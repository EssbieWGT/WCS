Ltd. has announced a major initiative to deploy a network of advanced EV charging hubs across the state’s challenging mountainous terrain.

As per the firm's statement, EzUrja’s highway charging hubs will initially feature 60 EV chargers catering to all vehicle types. Each hub will offer not only fast charging but also restrooms, food outlets, and digital engagement areas, creating a pit stop experience for travellers.

The company’s 'E-Way Hubs' are designed specifically for the hill state's roads, bringing highway charging, mobile EV solutions, and locally manufactured, weatherproof chargers to tourist routes and green corridors. The move aligns with Himachal’s ambitious roadmap of achieving 15 percent EV sales by 2025 and 100 percent by 2030, which has already seen the registration of over 5,000 EVs and approval for 402 charging stations across key routes and government facilities.

""Electric mobility in mountainous terrain requires more than just charging as it needs innovation, uninterrupted charging services, comfort halting and a deep understanding of local and climatic challenges. That’s exactly what we bring,"" said Rohit Agarwal, Spokesperson at EzUrja. ""Our solutions are made in Himachal, for Himachal, weather- proof, terrain-ready, to be powered by green energy from the State. By manufacturing locally and innovating for local needs, we are aligning with Himachal Pradesh’s environmental and economic goals,"" he noted.

The company is also leveraging its EV hub experience in Kolkata to introduce mobile charging units and microgrid-integrated hubs for remote and underserved areas in Himachal. These solutions are expected to help ease range anxiety, especially along tourism circuits and national highways like the Shimla-Chamba route, recently declared a green corridor by the state.

“With locally built technology, we are creating jobs and green industrial growth within the state,” said Ashhok Kapoor, Managing Director, EzUrja Group. “Himachal’s leadership in clean energy is commendable, and we’re proud to contribute to making sustainable mobility scalable, even in the remotest valleys,"" he noted.

As per the firm, hilly regions like Himachal Pradesh pose unique challenges for EV adoption, ranging from steeper power consumption during uphill driving to a lack of reliable highway charging access. EzUrja is addressing these hurdles through targeted initiatives that align seamlessly with the government’s green mobility vision, starting with the green corridor highway connecting Shimla to Chamba.

With the state set to procure 300 electric buses and transition 3,000 government vehicles to EVs this year, EzUrja’s infrastructure is poised to become a critical support pillar in Himachal’s green mobility revolution.",https://www.energetica-india.net/images/noticias/VORVMKI42Q6AOUOG3SVmqdiEtHC7Y9QmOmzZusPmQN8fMDWfZ0K3g.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 11:18:39.931632

Mr. Wright said the wind and solar projects have produced “more expensive electricity,” incentivized by lucrative government subsidies.
This intermittent use raises the cost of energy, Mr. Wright said.
In Connecticut, a significant portion of rising consumer electric bills is dedicated to funding green energy projects.
“They are going to be saved the outrageous costs from the additional offshore wind,” Mr. Wright said.","Energy Secretary Chris Wright has heard a lot of doomsday predictions about the rollback of wind and solar subsidies in President Trump’s sweeping tax cut bill.

He has one simple answer: “They’re just wrong.”

Mr. Wright, a former fracking executive with roots in solar and geothermal, said intermittent renewables are a costly impediment on the nation’s electrical grid, and the sooner they are replaced by reliable sources such as natural gas, coal or nuclear, the faster costs will come down.

“If you look at the places that have spent the most subsidies and built the largest amount of wind and solar, the more cheap energy you put on our grid, the more expensive the grid becomes,” Mr. Wright said in an interview with The Washington Times.

The cost of cutting taxes in Mr. Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill is paid for in part by axing a slate of subsidies for green energy projects, including wind and solar, by 2026.

The elimination of the renewable subsidies, the Joint Committee on Taxation determined, will save nearly $500 billion over ten years.

But opponents warn it will kill jobs, hike energy bills and ultimately weaken the power grid by discouraging future wind and solar projects, which will slow the growth of grid capacity as demand rises. Or, they warn, solar and wind projects will move ahead but at a higher, unsubsidized cost that will be passed along to ratepayers.

Sen. Ron Wyden, who authored many of the tax subsidies, called the cuts “an outright massacre” for wind and solar.

“Not only will hundreds of thousands of Americans who work in clean energy lose their jobs right away, individual families and businesses of all sizes nationwide will get clobbered with higher utility bills,” the Oregon Democrat said.

The media coverage has been overwhelmingly dire, honing in on states like Minnesota, which have invested heavily in wind and solar projects, and turning to clean energy advocates for assessments on how these states will be impacted by the cuts.

San Francisco-based Energy Innovation, which advocates for ending fossil fuels, calculated that subsidy cuts would increase annual energy bills in Minnesota households by $6 billion between 2025 and 2034.

“This is due to higher dependence on fossil fuels and higher fossil fuel prices,” the organization wrote in an analysis of the legislation.

Mr. Wright said the wind and solar projects have produced “more expensive electricity,” incentivized by lucrative government subsidies.

Natural gas, he said, “is just by far and away, the cheapest source of electricity today.”

California, for example, ditched coal and natural gas for wind and solar, and imports its renewable power from Utah and Nevada, among other states. Florida went in the opposite direction, investing in the construction of natural gas pipelines.

“California’s electricity prices today are twice as high as Florida’s. California has by far the largest population of any state in the country. They produce less electricity than Florida does,” said the energy secretary.

On average, the cost of onshore wind and solar is cheaper than fossil fuels, but they only produce power some of the time and require nuclear, coal and natural gas to rev up at night, when it’s cloudy or when the wind is not blowing. This intermittent use raises the cost of energy, Mr. Wright said.

Wind turbines and solar arrays take up more land than non-renewable energy plants and require new transmission lines.

“You really have to maintain two grids,” Mr. Wright said. “When it’s the middle of the day, when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining, all the other plants have to turn down to accommodate the wind and sun. Then they’ve got to be turned back up. And that is not an efficient way to run huge machinery. You have to operate your existing grid less efficiently than before, and you have to pay for a second grid.”

Mr. Wright said the tax cut legislation will steer states away from adding renewables to the grid and drive them to build reliable sources that run all the time.

“You still have the ability to generate electricity in all these states. They’re just not going to keep adding to that secondary, parasitic, more expensive grid,” he said.

In Minnesota, subsidized costs of wind and solar climbed even after passage of the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which implemented many of the tax credits for new renewable projects now targeted for elimination in Mr. Trump’s bill.

More than a third of the state’s energy is produced by renewables. A state law requires utilities to produce 100% of their electricity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2040.

The Center of the American Experiment, a conservative think tank in Minnesota, found that rising wind and solar prices have made them the most expensive sources of electricity in the state “by a substantial margin.”

It calculated that electricity produced by new wind projects costs twice as much as electricity from existing coal plants.

The cost of electricity from new solar projects in the state was triple the cost generated by existing coal plants, the group found. It blamed rising prices for wind turbines and solar panels.

Many states have shifted to renewables to reduce emissions and convert to clean energy produced by solar and wind.

In Connecticut, a significant portion of rising consumer electric bills is dedicated to funding green energy projects. Gov. Ned Lamont signed a law in 2022 mandating that the state achieve a zero-carbon electrical grid by 2040.

The ambitious plan is blamed in part for the state’s skyrocketing energy bills, although green energy groups say the real blame lies with global warming, which they say has caused extreme weather events and ultra-hot summers.

Mr. Wright said Mr. Trump’s January executive order blocking most new offshore wind projects along the eastern seaboard will spare Connecticut ratepayers even higher utility bills in the future.

Offshore wind is one of the most expensive forms of energy on the planet, he said.

Connecticut energy bills are among the highest in the nation and were expected to increase when the offshore wind projects went online. Eversource, a main provider of power in New England, projected offshore wind would cost nearly $100 per megawatt hour, which is almost double the cost of energy provided by the state’s Millstone Nuclear Power Plant.

“They are going to be saved the outrageous costs from the additional offshore wind,” Mr. Wright said.

Mr. Wright said the high energy costs in the northeast will be reduced by the Trump administration’s revival of a natural gas pipeline project extending from the Marcellus Shale gas fields in northern Pennsylvania to New York and into markets in New England, where consumers pay the highest electricity rates in the nation.

“New England has expensive energy for choices, and the biggest choice they’ve made is just to not have enough connection to the natural gas pipeline network,” he said.

Critics warn that if states abandon solar and wind for natural gas, it would take several years for the permitting and construction of new natural gas plants and much longer to build nuclear power plants. This could leave electrical grids without enough energy and consumers on the hook for higher prices.

Mr. Wright said states will have to change regulations to allow for the expansion of natural gas, which could happen faster now that subsidies for wind and solar are headed for a quick phase-out under the new tax cut law and Mr. Trump’s executive orders.

“Ultimately, if they don’t build all the offshore wind and all that, you’ll probably see an expansion in natural gas-generated electricity,” he said.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/06/02/Alaska_Trump_Energy_Oil_Field_Tour_13733_c0-207-4964-3102_s1200x700.jpg?05818a1aae4a18625e6d2f3787522970c4e058bd,N,,2025-07-13 11:18:45.020922

If you have to build one then it's way longer. All this chaos is costing us jobs. Companies that don't feel safe to invest are canceling programs due to uncertainty. Then they're laying people off due to lack of work.

President cheetoh mussolini is setting us back by decades. The only thing saving the US auto industry rigjt now is the tarriffs on Chinese EVs. If it weren't for them the big 3 would be toast.

EVs are priced taking the tax credit into account, and with huge margins in comparison to ICE cars, so I wouldn't be surprised if out the door prices end up being more or less the same after the credit goes away. The cost of LFP batteries is projected to drop to $50 a kwh by the end of 2025, which means EVs will hit manufacturing cost parity with ICE cars.

EV sales are continuing to grow year over year in the US. People who have EV’s in general have said they will never go back to a gas car. As more people get experience with EV’s more people will realize the perceived issues with charging and range anxiety are unfounded.

When more affordable options become available the EV market will continue to rise at a quick rate.

they're still increasing every year.

Also tired of the myth that most EV user are hanging out waiting for their car to charged. It almost universally comes from a ICE driver who never tried an EV. I'll admit EVs still have a ways to go for apartment dwellers or people without access to overnight or work charging, but for many homeowners, we spend less time at charging stations than you spend at the gas station.

Here's a scenario. I used to fill up 1-2x per week in my ATS. I drove a lot, about 20k a year. I recently got an EV. I upped my driving even more and now i'm driving 24k a year. In one entire year, i spent 18 minutes total at supercharger stations. The rest was simply plugging my car in while it sit and while i sleep in my driveway. I think homeowners(or anyone with easy access to overnight charging) should think of it this way, ""If i left every morning with 3/4 tank, how often would I need to visit the gas station"". For me the answer to that was 2x the whole year. I imagine for most people that would be between 4-8x per year.

A lot of ICE owners try to think of things like you need to go out of your way to charge and you need to wait until you're empty to start charging, but you don't charge like that

EVs were taking off and the infrastructure was coming very soon at the previous rate.

Under President Donald Trump’s new tax-cut law, many people for the first time could also claim a tax deduction for interest on their vehicle loans.

The new tax break will be available even to people who don’t itemize deductions. But there are some caveats that could limit its reach. The vehicles must be new, not used. They must be assembled in the U.S. And the loans must be issued no sooner than this year, to list just a few qualifications.

Here are some things to know about the new auto loan interest tax deduction:

Candidate Trump promised an auto loan interest tax break

Trump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and “stimulate massive domestic auto production.”

The idea made it into the big tax-cut bill passed by Congress, which Trump signed into law July 4.

The law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of interest payments annually on loans for new American-made vehicles from 2025 through 2028. It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles. But it only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes.

The tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns. But the deduction phases out for individuals with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 or joint taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000. Those earning more cannot claim the tax break.

Millions of buyers could benefit, but millions of others will not

U.S. automobile dealers sold 15.9 million new light vehicles last year, a little over half of which were assembled in the U.S, according to Cox Automotive. It says around 60% of retail sales are financed with loans.

After excluding fleet and commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, an estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year, if purchasing patterns stay the same, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.

It’s the assembly plant, not the automaker’s headquarters that matters

The tax break applies to vehicles assembled in the U.S., no matter where the company making them is headquartered. All Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. are assembled in this country. But so are all Acura brands, the luxury model of Japanese automaker Honda.

Last year, 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled in this country, according to Cox Automotive. But customers wanting the tax break will need to pay attention to specific models. While the Ford Mustang is assembled in Michigan, the Mustang Mach-E is built in Mexico.

General Motors assembles all of its Cadillacs in the U.S. But just 44% of its Chevrolets sold last year were assembled in the U.S., and just 14% of Buicks, according to Cox Automotive. That’s a lower U.S-assembled rate than Honda (60%), Toyota (52%) and Nissan (48%), which all are headquartered in Japan.

Taxpayers could save hundreds of dollars a year

The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year, because interest payments on loans are frontloaded while principal payments grow on the back end.

At a 9.3% interest rate, an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said. The tax savings would be less on a loan at 6.5%, which is the rate figured into calculations by the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.

Some people also could see a reduction in state income taxes

Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction.

On a tax form, the auto loan deduction will come before the calculation of a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. That’s an important distinction, because many states use a taxpayer’s federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for figuring their state income taxes. If that income figure is lower, it could reduce the state taxes owed.

The verdict is out on whether the tax break will boost sales

At Bowen Scarff Ford in Kent, Washington, customers started asking about the auto loan tax deduction before Congress had even taken a final vote on the tax-cut bill, said General Manager Paul Ray. So he decided to promote it on the dealer’s website.

A website ribbon exclaims: “CAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE” while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump’s tax-cut law.

“I think it’s going to help incentivize vehicle purchases through this year,” Ray said.

Celia Winslow, president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, concurred: “For some people deciding — should I buy it, should I not — this could be something that tips the scale.”

Others remain skeptical. According to Smoke’s math, the average annual tax savings is smaller than a single month’s loan payment for a new vehicle.

“I don’t think it moves the needle on somebody on the fence of buying a new vehicle or not,” Smoke said. “But I think it could influence their decision to finance that vehicle instead of paying cash or instead of leasing a vehicle.”",https://www.cbs17.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2025/07/AP25191678216150-e1752413902118.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-13 11:20:32.298693

The Idaho company designs small nuclear reactors that produce intense heat and electricity. These compact units serve manufacturing plants and isolated locations that need constant power without sending carbon into the atmosphere.

Nuclear power is derived from splitting atoms, which produces massive amounts of energy without a carbon output. Each NuCube system is built in a workshop and can be transported on a typical truck, unlike conventional nuclear plants, which often take years to construct.

""With Shell GameChanger's support, we're accelerating our path to market and expanding the impact of our technology.""

The system stands out because it could replace natural gas in industries that need extremely high temperatures. Many manufacturing facilities still burn gas because solar and wind energy cannot generate enough heat for industrial processes. NuCube provides an alternative with around-the-clock clean power.

Switching from gas to nuclear means less pollution that causes breathing problems and contributes to rising global temperatures. It also adds another option to our clean energy mix alongside solar and wind, helping maintain power even during cloudy or windless periods.

OEUK’s Wind Energy Manager, Thibaut Cheret, said: 'AR7 must be the turning point in making UK wind ambitions a reality.","Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) has proposed key reforms to accelerate offshore wind generation following the government’s publication of its Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (REMA).

OEUK says the decision to take a national approach to pricing will encourage more wind energy investment to help the government hit its Clean Power 2030 targets and boost growth in the critical offshore energy supply chain.

The National Energy System Operator has given 5,000 energy projects in the queue for grid connections until 29th July to submit evidence for preferential treatment.

The move is intended to prioritise 'shovel-ready' projects and scrap the first-come, first-served approach, which has allowed speculative schemes to delay viable clean energy developments.

This proposal must be matched by reforms to the Contacts for Difference (CfD) scheme and planning system to ensure the next allocation round – AR7 – delivers the scale and pace needed.

OEUK’s analysis shows that to meet the CP30 goal of 95% clean power by 2030, the UK must deliver half of this target from offshore wind. This means at least 43 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity must be installed by 2030, but current projections fall short at just 35GW. The next three CfD rounds must therefore secure an additional 20GW- equivalent to powering around 15 million homes.

Only two offshore wind generation projects – GreenVolt in Scotland and East Anglia Two – have been supported by the government’s CfD scheme since 2022.

A clear regulatory framework that secures investment and maintains the UK’s position as a global leader in offshore wind is now imperative.

Offshore wind is one of the UK’s greatest energy success stories – generating low carbon electricity at scale, creating jobs, and revitalising coastal communities.

Fixed-bottom turbines, with so-called monopiles attached to the seabed in shallower waters, have driven the UK’s rapid growth of wind energy generation to date but floating wind turbines using newer technologies, can be anchored in deeper waters with stronger wind resources, opening new areas for development.

They also have fewer environmental constraints than fixed-bottom projects and can progress more smoothly through the consenting process.

Speed and clarity to reform grid access and a more transparent approach with equal treatment for fixed and floating wind farms would give developers and the supply chain greater confidence to invest.

OEUK’s key recommendations for AR7 and beyond:

• Support for offshore wind: Provide assurance that sufficient funding is available for both fixed and commercial floating wind projects over the next three years, including projects to decarbonise offshore oil and gas operations, strengthen the UK supply chain, and create export opportunities.

• Grid and consent reform: Improved risk sharing between developers and grid network operators plus increased administrative capacity and streamlined planning to reduce delays to grid connection. Compensation should be offered for unexpected hold ups.

• Eligibility and investment: Reform eligibility criteria to allow both fixed and floating wind projects that have not received full consent to bid in the auction, extend CfD contracts from 15 to 20 years and introduce a well-balance cap and floor to transmission charges to improve investor confidence, lower subsidies and reduce costs to consumers. Introduce a well-balanced cap and floor to transmission charges.

OEUK’s Wind Energy Manager, Thibaut Cheret, said:

'AR7 must be the turning point in making UK wind ambitions a reality. That means enabling floating wind to compete on equal footing, unlocking grid access, and giving developers the confidence to invest at scale.

'We’re calling for clear eligibility rules that allow well-progressed but unconsented projects to bid, longer CfD terms to reduce costs to consumers, and a firm commitment to grid and consenting reform – including compensation for delays. These are the changes our members need to deliver the next 20GW.

'At the same time, we are working with our members to reduce project risk and borrowing costs as well as improving contractual relationships and promoting standardisation of modular wind turbine components to make them cheaper and faster to install.

'There is only one energy supply chain for offshore wind and oil and gas – and it cannot be allowed to decline. With the right reforms and a pragmatic energy strategy which supports homegrown oil and gas alongside the acceleration of UK renewables, the North Sea can remain a global energy powerhouse, supporting economic growth, jobs, and our climate goals.'

ScotWind: OEUK supports the ambition of the ScotWind leasing round and is calling for clarity on delivery timelines, grid access, and supply chain investment to ensure projects can rapidly move forward.

INTOG: OEUK backs INTOG schemes using wind energy to decarbonise offshore oil and gas production. We are urging government and regulators to ensure these projects are prioritised for grid access and CfD eligibility, and that planning processes reflect their dual role in emissions reduction and clean power generation.

Celtic Sea Round 5 of Celtic Sea wind auctions held last month (June) aims to unlock the potential for floating offshore wind off the coasts of South Wales and Southwest England. The Crown Estate has selected Equinor and Gwynt Glas to develop two 1.5GW floating wind farms. The leases come with grid connections already approved, but only two out of three leases on offer have been taken up.

TNUoS: Transmission Network Use of System Charges. Transmission has a cost which is paid by the generator and the user which appears in electricity bills. This cost is expected to increase dramatically in future years as more energy is brought from Scotland to England. The connection cost for the generator rises for remote areas but in heavily populated areas generators are paid to connect. The price difference must be adjusted with a proposed cap and floor system that would introduce an upper maximum cost to Scottish projects.

Review of electricity market arrangements (REMA): The government is still to announce the full outcome of its REMA consultation beyond the already published decision on zonal pricing. OEUK is calling for introduction of ‘deemed contracts for difference’ (based on potential, not actual output). This would mean wind energy producers being paid according to their potential capacity in a system that would give producers the opportunity to benefit from high global wind energy prices when they are available and keep a proportion of the additional profits

The Japanese automakerNissan Raises $4.5 Billion to Ease Debt Pressure as EV Plans Slow Down has secured $4.5 billion through a fresh bond sale in U.S. dollars and euros, aiming to buy itself time and space to manage a growing pile of debt.

The funds will help Nissan refinance around ¥700 billion (roughly $4.76 billion) in debt due this fiscal year. It’s a necessary move for a company that’s facing rising costs, a tougher EV market, and a recent downgrade to “junk” status by all three major credit agencies.

Borrowing Now, Breathing Room Later

According to a term sheet seen by Reuters, Nissan issued three dollar-denominated bond tranches worth $3 billion, alongside two euro tranches totaling €1.3 billion ($1.52 billion). The bonds stretch over four to ten years, with interest rates between 7.5% and 8.125% — higher than usual, but expected for a company under pressure.

For Nissan, this isn’t just about numbers, it’s about regaining financial footing after a few difficult years.

EV Plans Postponed as Caution Sets In

Nissan’s ambitions in the electric vehicle space are being quietly scaled back, especially in North America. Two new electric SUVs, one for Nissan, the other for its luxury brand Infiniti — were supposed to roll out of its Mississippi plant by 2028. That timeline has now slipped to late 2028 or even 2029.

It’s a reflection of the bigger picture: EV demand isn’t as hot as it once seemed. Policy shifts in the U.S., especially the rollback of key tax credits and the introduction of a 25% tariff on vehicle exports to Canada, are making things even more complicated. In response, Nissan has pulled two EVs from its U.S. lineup and halted Canadian shipments altogether.

Holding Tight to Cash

To conserve money, Nissan has reportedly asked some of its suppliers to delay payments — a tough ask that hints at internal cash flow concerns. At the same time, its battery partner AESC has paused work on a new factory in South Carolina. That site was meant to support Nissan’s EV production, but with plans now in flux, the construction has been put on hold.

These choices aren’t easy, but they show a company trying to stay afloat while recalibrating its path forward.

Investors Still Hopeful, For Now

Interestingly, retail investors are staying optimistic. Social platform Stocktwits reported a spike in discussions about Nissan, with sentiment labeled “bullish” and message volume marked “extremely high.” Whether this is grounded in confidence or just speculation remains to be seen.

A Company at the Crossroads

Nissan’s story right now is about survival but also resilience. It’s juggling short-term financial fixes while rewriting long-term plans in a shifting industry. The $4.5 billion it just raised doesn’t solve everything, but it gives the automaker breathing room to regroup.

For a company once seen as an EV pioneer, the road ahead is uncertain, but not closed.",https://techstory.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NISSAN-RESTRUCTURING-0_1747051237324_1747051249381.jpeg,N,,2025-07-13 11:20:40.120845
