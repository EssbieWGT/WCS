Policy Uncertainty and Its Impact on EV Adoption

California's 27% share of U.S. EV sales makes it a bellwether for the industryCalifornia Won’t Replace Expiring $7,500 Federal EV Tax Credit[ 1 ]. The absence of a $7,500 tax credit—a key affordability driver for lower-income buyers—risks stalling progress toward the state's 2035 gasoline vehicle sales ban. According to a report by Bloomberg, the loss of incentives disproportionately affects households earning less than $75,000 annually, who rely on subsidies to offset the higher upfront costs of EVsCalifornia Won’t Replace Expiring $7,500 Federal EV Tax Credit[ 1 ]. Without state-level rebates, analysts project a 12–15% decline in EV sales in California by mid-2026, which could ripple across the national market given the state's outsized influence on automaker strategiesElectric vehicle tax credits end, impacts California …[ 2 ].

Valuation Pressures on EV Manufacturers

The policy vacuum has already begun to erode investor confidence. Tesla's stock, for instance, has fallen nearly 50% from its December 2024 peak, reflecting broader market pessimism about near-term demandEV Stocks Are Falling Today: What's Going On?[ 5 ].

and , both of which have historically relied on California's regulatory tailwinds, have seen similar declines. Data from Forbes indicates that the removal of tax credits, combined with proposed 25% tariffs on imported EV components, has exacerbated production cost pressures, forcing automakers to reassess capital allocation2 Top Undervalued EV Stocks to Watch Now[ 3 ].

Yet, not all automakers are equally vulnerable. Rivian, for example, remains the most resilient among North American EV startups, with production ramping up and a clearer path to profitability compared to peers like Lucid or Mullen AutomotiveCalifornia EV Tax Credit Replacement Faces Funding Uncertainty[ 4 ]. This divergence highlights the importance of operational efficiency and diversified revenue streams in navigating policy-driven headwinds.

Supply Chain Dynamics and Resilient Segments

The EV supply chain is facing its own perfect storm. Tariffs on Chinese battery components and geopolitical tensions have driven up costs, but domestic and FTA-aligned battery material producers are emerging as bright spots. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has spurred over $49 billion in U.S. battery manufacturing investments, creating a buffer against global supply shortagesCalifornia Won’t Replace Expiring $7,500 Federal EV Tax Credit[ 1 ].

These firms, which supply sensors and microchips essential for autonomous driving and energy management, are less exposed to direct policy shifts than automakers themselves.

Strategic Entry Points and Risks

While the near-term outlook is clouded, long-term fundamentals for EV adoption remain intact.

The expanded capacity comes online as U.S. energy demand climbs for the first time in decades and the state pursues its goal of 10 gigawatts of distributed solar generation by 2030.

The four projects are part of an eight-project collaboration between Catalyze, a Texas-based renewables company, and CS Energy, a New Jersey-based solar and energy storage company.

Four additional projects from the Catalyze and CS Energy partnership, expected to add 25 megawatts to the New York grid, are scheduled for completion in the next year.

Trump administration trying to curtail wind, solar projects

Wind and solar power are two of the fastest-growing energy sectors in the United States and produced as much as 17% of the country’s electricity last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the statistical agency of the Department of Energy.

Since taking office, the Trump administration has paused permits on all new wind and solar projects on public land, onshore and offshore, writes Elizabeth Weise for USA TODAY.

The vast majority of renewable energy projects – 95% – are on private land, according to a report by the Brookings Institution. But many of those require some type of federal approval and are also being stalled by the new rules. It's this push to end large-scale energy projects on private property as well that some in the energy industry consider especially troubling.

“It’s expected that every time you have a major change in administrations, policies on public land might change,"" said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association. “But the willingness of this administration to create political and bureaucratic barriers to private economic activity on private land is something nobody anticipated.”

(P&GJ) — The U.S. Justice Department has entered the legal battle over Enbridge Energy’s Line 5 pipeline, filing a statement of interest in federal court that challenges Michigan’s attempt to shut down the cross-border oil and gas line.

The filing, submitted in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan, argues that Michigan overstepped its authority when it sought to terminate Enbridge’s easement for the 645-mile pipeline, which runs beneath the Straits of Mackinac between Lakes Michigan and Huron.

“The federal government already comprehensively regulates pipeline safety, but Michigan is trying to usurp the Department of Transportation’s statutory authority,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD). “President Trump has made clear that the United States will not tolerate state overreach that interferes with American energy dominance.”

The Justice Department pointed to the Pipeline Safety Act, which gives the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) sole responsibility for interstate pipeline safety standards. By attempting to enforce its own safety rules, the state infringed on PHMSA’s exclusive federal jurisdiction, the filing said.

The statement also emphasized the international dimension of Line 5, citing the U.S.–Canada treaty governing cross-border pipelines. Federal attorneys argued that Michigan’s actions interfere with U.S. foreign policy and treaty obligations.

Matt FoxBBC News NI

Kilroot power station may need to be given an exemption from environmental rules to help guarantee electricity supplies in Northern Ireland this winter.

It has two gas-fired turbines which are currently restricted to running for 1,500 hours per year.

Outages at Ballylumford and Coolkeeragh power stations mean these turbines have already been heavily used this year and are now approaching their annual running time limit, as set by the Northern Ireland Environment Agency.

The company which operates the grid said it is working with the regulator and the Department for the Economy (DfE) to ""unlock restrictions to ensure there is sufficient generation"".

Meanwhile, the department told the BBC it is ""prepared to use all levers available to government"" to address the situation.

""The department has been working with several key stakeholders, including the Environment Agency, to ensure mitigations are put in place to maintain security of supply,"" a DfE spokesperson said.

""Security of supply is a key priority,"" the department added, insisting it will continually work closely with the energy industry to ""ensure the resilience of the system"".

'A challenging year'

On Monday, the System Operator NI (SONI) issued a four day-long system alert, warning of a ""heightened risk"" for supply.

The alert was suspended on Friday afternoon, although the operator has said projections highlight the possibility of further alerts this winter.

In a statement, SONI explained that when it issues an alert ""there is no immediate impact for users of electricity"".

Instead, the alert ""warns of a heightened risk for potential temporary electricity supply issues in the near future"", allowing those working in the electricity sector to take ""pre-planned actions to protect the integrity of the grid"".

The operator said it has been a ""challenging year operationally"" with the prolonged outage at Ballylumford due to damage caused by Storm Darragh, alongside a ""significantly extended maintenance outage"" at Coolkeeragh.

These outages have meant that SONI has had to ""rely more heavily"" on Kilroot, however these plants ""are now approaching the current limit of hours these generators can run"", it said.

The operator added it is ""continuing to work closely with power station operators, the Utility Regulator and the Department for Economy to unlock restrictions to ensure there is sufficient generation to meet system needs and consumer demands as we head into the winter peak"".

'Delicately balanced'

Analysis by Louise Cullen, BBC News NI's BBC News NI agriculture and environment correspondent

While gas may be greener than oil, it is still a fossil fuel and the limits on how many hours Kilroot can use gas for generating power are there for a good reason.

They've been calculated in line with our greenhouse gas emissions targets, as set within the Climate Change Act and the carbon budgets, so reducing emissions means reducing power output.

The limits may be lifted when the plant converts to a combined cycle gas turbine to capture and utilise the residual heat from burning gas. The plan is for that to happen next year.

But this notification shows how delicately balanced our energy system can be when put under pressure.

It adds to the argument for more locally-sourced, sustainable energy – and storage to have it available for the system.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10c4/live/4101a4c0-95a3-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 04:58:30.869261

As Skor recounted, Growth Energy is the largest biofuel trade association in the country, with a network of 130 companies, including John Deere and BASF, and nearly 100 biorefineries, such as ADM, Cargill, and POET. These operations span 33 states, with a particular presence in the Midwest. “We are really the engine of the rural economy,” Skor said. “It goes back to the fact that we help keep small communities going and thriving.”

The conversation emphasized the enduring popularity and legislative success of biofuels in the U.S., with the industry offering value to both political parties. On the one hand, they provide low-carbon energy and decarbonized modes of transportation. On the other, they produce affordable and accessible fuel, contributing to both energy independence and dominance. This bipartisan support was most evident in the budget reconciliation bill that was signed into law earlier this year. Although it cut $545 billion in tax credits that originated in the prior administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, Congress extended and even enhanced the technology-neutral clean fuel production credit, Section 45Z.

Biofuels have emerged as a point of alignment between the Trump administration and the clean energy industry. For example, during President Trump’s first term, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) increased access to higher blends of ethanol. In this term, the president issued an executive order on day one directing the EPA to consider higher-ethanol blend E15. “So there’s a very strong connection to some of the real big priorities that are really important to this administration,” Skor explained.

Skor stated that this support stems from both the President’s loyalty to the U.S. farmer and his emphasis on ‘America First.’ “The administration is making these announcements through the framework of US agriculture and maintaining strong biofuel demand,” she summarized.

Meanwhile, the industry is seeing significant opportunities arise in both the short and long term. On the near horizon, argued Skor, the continued use of ethanol in cars and trucks in the U.S. and abroad is a particular highlight. Domestically, this has recently been spurred by the highest-volume requirements ever proposed by the EPA under the Renewable Fuel Standard. Even California, until now the last state to cap the amount of ethanol that can be blended with gasoline at 10 percent, saw its Senate vote unanimously to allow the sale of E15. Internationally, Canada, Brazil, India, Japan, and Vietnam are also increasing their goals and standards regarding ethanol, providing a market opportunity.

In the longer term, meanwhile, Skor pointed out that a significant amount of innovation is emerging in this space. For example, sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to transform the aviation industry. At the same time, ethanol can replace bunker fuel in the maritime sector and replace diesel in long-haul trucking. In these nascent markets, Skor commented, “We still have to be able to do, for some of them, proof of concept. We’ve got to get regulations in place. We’ve got to be able to produce a commercial scale and get the economics in line. But that’s the blue sky potential.” As these technologies further decarbonize through carbon capture, the application of climate-smart agricultural techniques, and the installation of more clean energy sources, the carbon intensity of these fuels will also continue to decrease.",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/549877374_1227743092726280_3947920055023475192_n-1-e1758291202320.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 03:58:12.493984

CALIFORNIA POLICY IS ALWAYS CHANGING: Know your next move.","With help from Alex Nieves and Camille von Kaenel

GREEN UNION ENERGY: Close your eyes and think of the power players you’d expect to be pushing state leaders on California climate policy. Are you imagining the autoworkers union? No. But you should be.

The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America sponsored SB 787, a bill on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk that would require a slew of state agencies to collaborate on building out the supply chain for clean energy industries including zero emission vehicles and their batteries, offshore wind energy and heat pumps.

Conventional thinking says UAW is a surprising sponsor for a renewable energy bill, but Mike Miller, the union’s region six director, doesn’t agree. Miller, who represents over 120,000 members across California and eight other western states, sees himself as part of a long lineage of environmentalist labor leaders. He described climate change as “the signature challenge of our time” in an August UAW report.

UAW is a very different union than the coalition that emerged from the Detroit auto plants in the 1930s. Today, the organization represents workers in local governments, hospitals, nonprofits, and universities. Miller himself came to UAW through academia, cutting his teeth organizing fellow teaching assistants at UCLA in the 1990s.

We spoke with Miller to learn why the labor leader decided to throw the heft of his union behind environmental reforms, and how he thinks the effort will benefit his members in the end.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Where did the idea come from for SB 787?

Well, the majority of our membership believes climate change is a crisis, and we need to move far more aggressively to tackle that crisis. You know, manufacturing is also in the DNA of the UAW. We need to find a way to thread these two goals together.

Industrial policy also is a historic core of who the UAW is, whether it was meeting manufacturing needs during World War Two or bolstering the post war boom. We’ve always believed it’s necessary for working people to engage in industrial policy.

So we decided about two years ago that we needed to take this seriously. We worked with some outstanding academics and working people to develop a vision for growing the clean industrial economy in California through policy.

Manufacturing has been on a long term decline since the late 80s. In California, we’ve lost close to a million manufacturing jobs in a variety of industrial sectors. It’s important that we grow these jobs back.

We really believe in and support California’s decarbonization goals. Climate change is a huge crisis, and one that we need to address quickly.

We think that one of the best ways to have the collective political will to make that happen is to have a strategic industrial policy that creates good middle class manufacturing jobs in the sectors of the economy that need to decarbonize, like batteries, building decarbonization, heat pumps, industries like that, offshore wind.

Can you share more about how you came to this moment of having climate change issues be such a major focus for you?

Hurricane Katrina, I mean you could go on and on.

I talked a little bit about the UAW’s DNA. UAW helped found Earth Day. And [former UAW president] Walter Reuther and after him Doug Fraser, I’ve seen quotes of them, and I’ll get these wrong, but I can paraphrase them, testifying before Congress: ‘What good does it do to to make more money, make enough money to go on vacation, if the lake you’re going to go on vacation to is polluted? What good does it do to have more time off if the air where you live is too polluted to breathe?’

So we’ve always understood the connection between the environment we live in and the environment we work in. And so it’s been an issue for us for a long time. I think that the stark climate crises that you see, and things like the wildfires in LA this year, really helped drive that home and make it a more pressing, salient issue.

Would you describe yourself as an environmentalist?

Yes.

I’m struck that if the policy works out the way you’re hoping for, it would benefit workers, but presumably it would also benefit people who are running companies, people in the management and investor class. Why is it that UAW sees it as part of its responsibility to help shepherd along policies that also help this investor class and management class?

You have to have a thriving business, a profitable business, to have a workforce. Auto companies where the auto workers work have to make profits to give pay increases to the workers.

The fight isn’t about the success of the company. The workers are often very invested in the success of the company, very proud of the cars and buses and trucks that they build. The fight is over what the workers rights in the workplace are.

That takes a number of forms: The right not to be harassed, the right not be bullied, the right to leave work in the same way that you came in, to work in a safe environment, to have control over your schedule, to have time off to spend with your family, to have paid parental leave, paid sick leave, and to share the profits of the company. The conflict in the collective bargaining process is negotiating over who controls production and in whose interest and who profits from the work that is done at the company. And we’re squarely on the side of the workers playing a very decisive role in all of those processes. — NB

ENERGY CARE PACKAGE: Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the sweeping package of bills Friday to boost oil drilling, rescue wildfire-threatened utilities and extend the state’s cap-and-trade program.

The package, which came together in a last-minute agreement after weeks of negotiations with lawmakers, represents a compromise between increasing fossil fuel extraction in an effort to stave off in-state refinery closures and continuing to ratchet down greenhouse gas emissions.

“We’ve got to manifest our ideals and our goals, and so this lays it out, but it lays it out without laying tracks over folks,” Newsom said, against a backdrop of towering redwood trees projected on the screen of a planetarium in a San Francisco science museum. “We set the tone and pace for the rest of the nation.”

The legislature’s focus on energy emerged in January as leaders promised to tackle affordability, which gained even more political urgency as wildfires and refinery closures raised the threat of higher electricity and gasoline costs. Two of the bills, which allow California utilities to join a West-wide energy market and increase oil drilling in Kern County, garnered Republican votes.

The renewal of the state’s carbon market, which Newsom committed to after President Donald Trump threatened to dismantle state climate laws in April, gives the governor a climate win at a time when the state is losing other core pieces of its climate strategy, like its mandated phase-out of new gas-powered cars by 2035. And the package includes a spending plan for roughly $4 billion in annual cap-and-trade revenues, including $1 billion in guaranteed yearly funding for the state’s controversial high-speed rail project.

Utilities will also benefit from an $18 billion boost to the state’s wildfire fund, a pot funded by utility company shareholders and ratepayers to help pay wildfire-related claims. And the final piece of the package will strengthen air quality monitoring in communities disproportionately impacted by pollution. — CvK, NB, AN

WHERE’S THE REBATE?: Newsom is retreating on his commitment to restart a state rebate program for EV buyers to backfill the expiring $7,500 federal tax credit.

Just minutes after signing the energy package, Newsom acknowledged at a press conference that the state “can’t make up” for the Biden-era incentive that the Trump administration will end on Sept. 30.

The announcement comes after Newsom said last November that he would propose creating a new version of a state rebate program if Republicans went after federal incentives. California ended its broad rebate program in 2023 and replaced it with a system focused on low-income drivers in certain disadvantaged communities.

“We can’t make up for federal vandalism of those tax credits, but we can continue to make the unprecedented investments in infrastructure, which we’re doing,” he said.

Prior to Newsom’s announcement Friday, five car manufacturers — Audi, Honda, Hyundai, Rivian and Volkswagen — had called on the governor and legislative leaders to create a $5,000 rebate program that would last until July 1, 2028. Under the terms proposed by the companies, cars priced up to $55,000 and trucks and SUVs up to $80,000 would be eligible for the rebate.

And state agencies released a joint list of recommendations for supporting the EV market last month, including “point-of-sale rebates, vouchers, or other credits” to backfill the expiring federal tax incentives. — AN

The speakers stepped to the podium in the dimly-lit room with a towering projection of redwood trees above them. Meanwhile, the TV news cameramen grumbled in the back about the terrible lighting. It seems that the governor agreed.

“This is a horrible setup, I can’t see a damn one of you,” Newsom said. The last time he spoke in the auditorium, he gave a marathon San Francisco state of the city speech stretching seven and a half hours, and earning sneers from the local press. “This brings back some memories that my staff, particularly my old mayoral staff, does not want to be brought back up.” — NB

(Lane is chair of the West Virginia Public Service Commission)","The Public Service Commission of West Virginia has been at the forefront of discussions on the importance of having a reliable energy source for this nation.

While never downplaying the importance of all fuels, we consistently advocate for having energy that doesn’t falter when there’s no wind or no sun shining.

We’ve found that coal and natural gas, both abundant in the Mountain State, are reliable sources for powering electric generation plants.

In support of this idea, the administration in Washington declared a national energy emergency soon after it came into office.

As part of that initiative, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced it would fast-track approval for projects involving coal, gas, oil, and minerals on public lands. (May 30, 2025)

As a result, environmental reviews of permits that previously took a year to complete could be done in as few as two weeks.

More complicated environmental impact statements that usually take two years to complete could be done in four weeks.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum says the federal government intends to cut through unnecessary delays so it can fast-track the development of American energy and critical minerals.

And the administration has taken steps under the emergency declaration to promote fossil fuels in particular.

Just recently, the U.S. Supreme Court narrowed the scope of environmental review on some major energy projects under the National Environmental Policy Act. (May 31, 2025)

This law requires an agency to produce an environmental impact statement that must address significant effects expected to be caused by a project, and to suggest alternative ways of making a lesser impact.

In its unanimous ruling, the nation’s highest court reversed an appeals court decision.

The appeals court said the agency should have broadened its study to include environmental effects upstream and downstream of the project. The Supreme Court reversed that finding.

The court also said citizens could not use the courts to challenge the environmental effects beyond the immediate project at hand.

This decision is in line with the administration’s concern for energy independence and our use of fossil fuels to power this nation.

It remains important to all of us, as the demand for electric power continues to grow in this country, that we continue to have a reliable source for that energy.

These two matters should help us on the way to energy independence.

The EPA administrator has welcomed the new approach to the energy sector in the United States","The EPA, or Environmental Protection Agency, has withdrawn the proposed coal-ash changes for the sector and reopened the sector to potential rulemaking changes that the EPA is hoping to wrap up as quickly as possible. In 2015, the EPA published its findings from an extensive study into CCRs(coal combustion residuals), commonly known as coal ash, from coal-fired power plants. Those findings enabled the EPA to establish new rules for the disposal of coal ash from coal-powered plants across the United States. However, the EPA is following a new directive championed by the Trump administration’s new approach to the energy sector in America.

The Environmental Protection Agency has made several changes to the rules around CCRs

When the EPA published its new direct final rules, the proposal was met with the warm embrace of the companies and individuals operating in the coal sector in the United States. It states that the rule is a direct result of the extensive study done into the effects of coal ash on the environment and public health. The direct final rule establishes technical requirements for CCR landfills and surface impoundments under subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA.

That RCRA is the primary rule set for operators in the coal sector in the United States. However, following a new ruling by the EPA, that direct rule is now going to feature some significant changes, thanks in no small part to the efforts of the Trump administration. The new policies and executive orders implemented by Donald Trump aim at increasing the standing of the energy sector in the United States by easing regulations and providing more flexibility for owners and operators in the energy sector.

The EPA proposes a significant change to the two-part Facility Evaluation Report

The two-part Facility Evaluation Report is essential to establish certain requirements for coal mine operators in the United States. Under the Biden administration, the Facility Evaluation Report, or FER, was split into two phases. Which took up valuable time and resources that cost the operators and eventually the public vast amounts of taxpayer dollars.

The proposed change comes in the two-phase FER process that companies and operators are forced to endure. Under the new EPA guidelines, championed by the Trump administration, the FER process can be completed simultaneously, instead of the traditional two-part process it currently uses. FER part 1 requires the operator to conduct a ” review of readily and reasonably available records regarding where CCR was either routinely and systematically placed on land, or where facility activities otherwise resulted in measurable accumulations of CCR on land.

FER part 2 requires on-the-ground testing. And under the old rules, those two reports were to be submitted separately. The proposed rule change would allow companies to merge FER Part 1 and FER Part 2 into a single submission, due on February 8, 2027. It is not the first action taken by the EPA to align with the new administration’s approach to the energy sector.

MADISON — Gov. Tony Evers today delivered his weekly radio address, celebrating National Clean Energy Week in Wisconsin. Gov. Evers proclaimed September 15-19, 2025, as “National Clean Energy Week” across the state, highlighting the importance of building a robust 21st-century clean energy economy in Wisconsin that supports green jobs, bolsters the health of our state, and ensures the clean, sustainable future Wisconsinites deserve. A copy of the governor’s proclamation is available here.

This week, Gov. Evers also announced the release of the 2025 Clean Energy Plan Progress Report, underscoring achievements made over the last year to advance goals established by the state’s first-ever Clean Energy Plan. The progress report released today details Wisconsin’s advances in reducing greenhouse gas emissions through clean energy sources while also creating thousands of new jobs and lowering energy costs for families across Wisconsin, as well as investing in job training and apprenticeship programs in innovative industries and technologies. During 2025 the Year of the Kid, the progress report also highlights stories of youth-driven initiatives, helping to create a more sustainable future for Wisconsin.

Since Day One, the Evers Administration has been committed to promoting climate resilience and building a clean energy economy in the state. In 2019, in one of his first acts as governor, Gov. Evers joined the U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of 24 governors representing nearly 60 percent of the U.S. economy and 55 percent of the U.S. population. Earlier this year, Gov. Evers was appointed a co-chair of the Alliance after being the first governor from the Midwest to join the executive committee, which oversees the strategic direction of the bipartisan coalition of governors.

In addition to joining the Alliance in 2019 Gov. Evers signed Executive Order #38 to create the Office of Sustainability and Clean Energy (OSCE), charging the office with developing the Wisconsin Clean Energy Plan to promote the development and use of clean and renewable energy across the state, advance innovative sustainability solutions that improve the state’s economy and environment, and diversify the resources used to meet the state’s energy needs. The order also established the state’s goal to reach 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2050 and charged the OSCE with ensuring the state is fulfilling the carbon reduction goals of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.

Hey there, folks. Governor Tony Evers here.

This week, we’re celebrating National Clean Energy Week across the state to highlight our efforts to build the clean energy future Wisconsin deserves.

Folks, we don’t have to choose between mitigating climate change and protecting our environment and good-paying jobs and economic development—we can and should do both.And a clean energy economy is as much about protecting the health of our communities as it is about protecting the health of our environment.

So, as governor, I’ve made protecting our environment and investing in a clean energy economy to support our 21st-century needs a top priority of my administration since Day One.

We’ve joined the U.S. Climate Alliance, created a Office of Sustainability and Clean Energy, and developed our state’s first-ever Clean Energy Plan.

We also created the Green Ribbon Commission on Clean Energy and Environmental Innovation and our Green Innovation Fund, and so much more!And I was thrilled to sign legislation to advance the state’s nuclear energy innovation to continue our work towards ensuring Wisconsin has 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2050.

Through these efforts, we’re working to lower energy bills for families, reduce reliance on out-of-state energy sources, and invest in jobs and apprenticeship training all while building a brighter, healthier, and more prosperous future.

And while leaders in Washington continue to slash and claw back millions of dollars of federal funding for clean energy initiatives across our state, sending us backwards, this work is more important than ever.

Now is the time to roll up our sleeves and get to work, and here in Wisconsin, that’s exactly what we are going to continue to do.

So, happy National Clean Energy Week, Wisconsin, and take care.",https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/WIGOV/2020/03/3252723/wisconsin-twitter_original.png,N,,2025-09-20 00:58:37.729418

While battery storage and solar manufacturing have captured headlines and capital, other critical components of the clean tech infrastructure landscape remain undervalued—presenting strategic opportunities for forward-thinking investors. This analysis examines the current state of underfunded clean energy projects, the transformative potential of battery storage, and the overlooked promise of wind manufacturing, all while navigating the complex interplay of policy, technology, and market dynamics.

The Resilience of Battery Storage: A Cornerstone of the Energy Transition

Battery storage has emerged as a linchpin of the energy transition, with global investment tripling since 2021Cleantech Market Update: Q1 2025 in Review[ 2 ]. In Q1 2025 alone, the U.S. added over 30 GW of battery storage capacity, a 65% year-over-year increase, while the development pipeline expanded by 57%Clean Investment Monitor: Q1 2025 Update[ 5 ]. Projects like Ontario's Hagersville Battery Energy Park—secured with CAD$538 million in financing and offering 300 MW of capacity—demonstrate the sector's scalability and its critical role in stabilizing grids during peak demandInfrastructure Quarterly: Q1 2025 | CBRE Investment[ 1 ].

The economic case for battery storage is strengthening. According to a report by Forbes, battery prices are projected to fall below $100/kWh in 2025, making electric vehicles (EVs) increasingly competitive with internal combustion engines2025 Energy Predictions: Battery Costs Fall, Energy Storage Booms[ 3 ]. This trend is accelerating demand for grid-scale systems, particularly in sun-belt states like Texas and California, where rapid deployment is already underway2025 Energy Predictions: Battery Costs Fall, Energy Storage Booms[ 3 ]. Meanwhile, lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries are gaining dominance due to their affordability and safety, with domestic manufacturing set to expand under Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives2025 Energy Predictions: Battery Costs Fall, Energy Storage Booms[ 3 ].

Policy Uncertainties and the Shadow of the Trump Era

Despite these gains, the sector faces headwinds. The U.S. policy landscape remains volatile, with the Trump administration's suspension of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program and its broader challenges to the IRA creating uncertainty for long-term planningCleantech Market Update: Q1 2025 in Review[ 2 ]. However, private sector confidence persists. The global infrastructure and energy investment reached $1.1 trillion in late 2024, driven by digital and transport infrastructureCleantech Market Update: Q1 2025 in Review[ 2 ], while $335 billion in dry powder remains available to sustain activityInfrastructure Quarterly: Q1 2025 | CBRE Investment[ 1 ].

The Overlooked Potential of Wind Manufacturing

While battery and solar manufacturing have surged, wind manufacturing has lagged. A 2025 report by the Clean Investment Monitor notes that the U.S. wind sector has seen declining investment, few new project announcements, and limited capacity expansion despite IRA incentives like the Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax CreditThe State of US Clean Energy Supply Chains in 2025[ 4 ]. This underperformance suggests a significant undervaluation.

The IRA's tax credits are designed to incentivize domestic production of wind turbines and components, yet the sector has not yet capitalized on these opportunities. This gap could be a strategic entry point for investors, particularly as global demand for wind energy grows. With supply chain bottlenecks easing and permitting reforms streamlining project timelines2025 Energy Predictions: Battery Costs Fall, Energy Storage Booms[ 3 ], the sector is poised for a rebound—if capital flows align with policy intent.

Navigating the Risks and Rewards of Underfunded Sectors

Not all clean tech infrastructure is created equal. While battery storage and solar remain robust, other areas like industrial decarbonization and utility-scale solar have shown volatility. In Q1 2025, U.S. industrial decarbonization investment plummeted to $79 million from $16 billion in Q1 2024Clean Investment Monitor: Q1 2025 Update[ 5 ], while utility-scale solar and storage investment declined by 15.4% year-over-yearClean Investment Monitor: Q1 2025 Update[ 5 ]. These fluctuations highlight the importance of sector-specific due diligence.

However, the development pipeline remains strong, with $328 billion in clean energy projects in the worksClean Investment Monitor: Q1 2025 Update[ 5 ]. Investors who focus on undervalued niches—such as wind manufacturing or regional battery storage projects—can capitalize on mispriced assets while contributing to a diversified energy transition.

Conclusion: Strategic Allocation in a Fragmented Market

The energy transition is not a monolith. While some sectors are overhyped, others are undervalued, offering asymmetric risk-reward profiles. Battery storage's resilience, wind manufacturing's untapped potential, and the IRA's long-term tailwinds suggest that investors who adopt a nuanced, sector-specific approach will outperform in the coming years.

From this action, the district court reasonably inferred that the government’s reference to lack of oversight was a pretext.
But of course the district court gave no evidentiary value to that video: it is patently irrelevant to the GGRF.
Although EPA claimed it conducted an “individualized assessment” of the grants, the district court found that EPA had not provided any rationale for the terminations.
The district court, as the finder of fact, concluded that EPA’s “public statements contradict its representations here regarding the future of the program.” Id.","U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Ranking Member Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), U.S. Representative Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), and 36 of their Congressional colleagues have submitted an amicus brief to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in the case of Climate United Fund, et al. v. Citibank, N.A. et al, urging the reinstatement of Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) grants.

The lawmakers pressed the Court to grant a rehearing en banc, or hearing of the full active bench, and to overturn the erroneous ruling issued earlier this month by a three-judge panel of the Court. That poorly reasoned ruling allows the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to proceed with its efforts to illegally claw back GGRF awards that were appropriated by Congress and fully disbursed into private bank accounts. The GGRF is a $27 billion national climate financing network that facilitates investments in affordable clean energy deployment to spur economic development, lower energy costs, and reduce pollution. It was passed into law in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and is based on the National Climate Bank Act, legislation authored by Senators Van Hollen and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Congresswoman Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.).

In the brief, the lawmakers argue that the D.C. Circuit panel’s two-judge majority – both Trump appointees – misapplied precedent and ignored the district court’s well-supported factual findings in a results-oriented bid to greenlight EPA’s unlawful efforts to claw back GGRF funds. Given that Congress mandated that the GGRF funds be spent as appropriated, and the funds were already distributed to private bank accounts, EPA’s cancellation of the program is clear executive overreach. The lawmakers stress that letting this decision stand jeopardizes Constitutional protections of the separation of powers, and would amount to a transfer of Congress’ power of the purse to the executive branch.

The lawmakers outlined the thorough, transparent process by which the EPA under the Biden Administration awarded GGRF funds, writing, “Congress passed the IRA in 2022, which authorized and appropriated nearly $20 billion for the GGRF programs at issue here: the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF) and the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA). Congress directed that these funds must be granted to specialized nonprofit financial organizations for projects that ‘reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air pollution.’ Congress required that the EPA obligate GGRF funds by September 30, 2024. EPA met the deadline and entered into Financial Agent Agreements to ‘[convey] to the grantees legal title to the award funds’ while ‘affording EPA greater oversight of the grantees’ use of the funds than it would have had under the default disbursement system.’”

“After President Trump took office, the new EPA Administrator and other officials began to make outrageous attacks on grantees – including attempts to fabricate criminal fraud allegations. EPA’s subsequent blanket termination of the NCIF and the CCIA programs willfully ignores Congressional spending power and puts $20 billion of community and clean energy investments at risk. This is not a prosaic contract dispute; this is a constitutional power grab,” they argued.

The lawmakers pointed out that the panel Dalton v. Specter, which disallows judicial review in cases where a statute commits decision-making to the discretion of the President. They argued that Dalton does not apply in this case, writing, “but no statute gave the President, let alone EPA, discretion to terminate all previously obligated and disbursed funds allocated by Congress for two GGRF programs. Plaintiffs’ claims here do not depend on termination of a single contract, withholding of a disputed grant amount, or even administrative interpretation of a statutory provision. Finally, in sharp contrast with the discretion afforded to the President [by the] … statute at issue in Dalton, Congress could not have been clearer that the GGRF was enacted to ‘enable low-income and disadvantaged communities to deploy or benefit from zero-emission technologies,’ and that EPA had to obligate all grant funding by September 30, 2024. […] Dalton cannot sanction EPA nullifying clear statutory directives by terminating these programs.”

They also criticize the panel for dismissing without basis key factual findings by the district court, writing, “The district court did not, as the panel writes, ‘simply declare’ that EPA was shutting down the GGRF program. […] Rather, the district court made well-supported findings of fact that EPA’s out-of-court words and actions contradicted the Agency’s representations in the litigation that the GGRF program would continue following termination of Plaintiffs’ grants.”

“If the panel decision stands, it would set precedent that any agency can simply unwind any Congressionally-mandated program, unilaterally ending contracts without process, seizing money in private bank accounts, and clawing back already-disbursed funds.

INTEREST OF AMICI CURIAE AND RULE 29(a)(4)(E) STATEMENT

Amici curiae include the original champions of Green Bank legislation and its passage as the GGRF; the Ranking Members of the Senate and House committees with jurisdiction over the GGRF (U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce); the Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Committee subcommittee with jurisdiction over GGRF funding; and other Members of Congress with a particularized interest in preserving the separation of powers and ensuring that Congress’s plenary power over appropriations and spending is protected.

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

Congress passed the IRA in 2022, which authorized and appropriated nearly $20 billion for the GGRF programs at issue here: the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF) and the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA). Congress directed that these funds must be granted to specialized nonprofit financial organizations for projects that “reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air pollution.” Congress required that the EPA obligate GGRF funds by September 30, 2024. EPA met the deadline and entered into Financial Agent Agreements to “[convey] to the grantees legal title to the award funds” while “affording EPA greater oversight of the grantees’ use of the funds than it would have had under the default disbursement system.” Climate United Fund v. Citibank, 2025 WL 2502881 at *16 (D.C. Cir. Sept 2, 2025) (Pillard, J. dissenting) (citing Bafford Decl. ¶ 33 (J.A. 372)).

After President Trump took office, the new EPA Administrator and other officials began to make outrageous attacks on grantees – including attempts to fabricate criminal fraud allegations. EPA’s subsequent blanket termination of the NCIF and the CCIA programs willfully ignores Congressional spending power and puts $20 billion of community and clean energy investments at risk. This is not a prosaic contract dispute; this is a constitutional power grab.

The panel errs in finding that Plaintiffs’ appropriations claims are prohibited by Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462 (1994). An agency’s failure to spend congressionally appropriated funds is illegal under In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d 255 (D.C. Cir. 2013). Yet the panel wrongly allows EPA to seize GGRF funds that were appropriated by Congress and fully disbursed into private bank accounts. Unlike in Dalton, which was not an appropriations case, here Congress mandated how, by when, and to whom appropriated funds should be granted. It is black letter law that Congress enjoys plenary appropriations power. As held by the Supreme Court in Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 464 (1998), the executive branch does not have the power to repeal a statute by withholding its funding. To hold otherwise would give the executive branch free rein to ignore Congressional appropriations decisions. This Court should grant rehearing, to consider the constitutional issues raised by EPA’s misdeeds.

ARGUMENT

EPA’s Actions

Violate Congress’s Appropriations Power.

The panel decision acknowledges that EPA terminated the full amount of all grants made under two GGRF grant programs, but discards the district court record and precedential case law to conclude that the grantees’ challenge “is not a constitutional claim at all” and is only a challenge to the IRA. Climate United, 2025 WL 2502881 at *10. This is exactly backwards: the existence of a potential statutory violation does not displace a constitutional claim, and the dispositive question is whether the Administration has exceeded its constitutional powers. Here, it has: Congress required EPA to spend the GGRF funds before September 30, 2024, and EPA would have been prohibited from refusing to do so. EPA’s efforts to terminate funding after disbursement are equally impermissible. Nor was there any basis to overturn the district court’s thorough analysis concluding that EPA terminated the grant programs wholesale.

A. The Panel Erred in Rejecting the Constitutional Claim.

The Court should grant en banc review and not allow an overly expansive interpretation of Dalton to nullify Congressional spending power. By stretching Dalton to reject Plaintiffs’ separation of powers claims, and shoehorning Plaintiffs’ remaining claims into contractual disputes under the ill-fitting Tucker Act, the panel swept constitutional questions under the rug.

This case concerns EPA’s unilateral termination of all grants under two GGRF programs (in addition to at least eight other programs beyond this case, see infra note 4), after all the funds had been dispersed to private bank accounts. These brazen actions usurped power assigned to Congress by the Constitution. Under our Constitution, the power of the purse belongs to Congress, not the President or his agents. U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7 (Appropriations Clause); U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1 (Spending Clause). Congress may employ that power “to further broad policy objectives” and as the dissent points out, “neither the President nor his subordinate executive agencies may decline to follow a statutory mandate or prohibit spending because of policy objections.” Climate United, 2025 WL 2502881 at *14 (Pillard, J., dissenting).

Dalton simply does not apply here. That case stands for the limited proposition that “[w]here a statute . . . commits decision-making to the discretion of the President, judicial review of the President’s decision is not available.” 511 U.S. at 477. But no statute gave the President, let alone EPA, discretion to terminate all previously obligated and disbursed funds allocated by Congress for two GGRF programs. Plaintiffs’ claims here do not depend on termination of a single contract, withholding of a disputed grant amount, or even administrative interpretation of a statutory provision. Finally, in sharp contrast with the discretion afforded to the President under the military base closure statute at issue in Dalton, Congress could not have been clearer that the GGRF was enacted to “enable low-income and disadvantaged communities to deploy or benefit from zero-emission technologies,” and that EPA had to obligate all grant funding by September 30, 2024. 42 U.S.C. § 7434. Dalton cannot sanction EPA nullifying clear statutory directives by terminating these programs.

Nor can the panel’s expansion of Dalton be reconciled with Supreme Court precedent that prohibits the executive from unilaterally refusing to spend appropriated funds – let alone claw back actually disbursed funds. In Clinton, the Supreme Court struck down the line item veto as unconstitutional, because Article I, § 7 of the Constitution makes clear that the President cannot cancel a law without Congress’s express authorization. Clinton, 524 U.S. at 446. Decided after Dalton, the Court’s opinion in Clinton specifically rejected the argument that cancellations of Congressionally appropriated programs were “merely exercises of discretionary authority granted to the President.” Id. at 442. Instead, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the bedrock principle that the Constitution does not permit “the President to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.” Id. at 438. The panel’s broad recharacterization of Dalton into the appropriations context effectively gives an unconstitutional line item veto to this Administration.

It is similarly not possible to square the panel’s reading of Dalton with the Supreme Court’s ruling in Train v. New York, 420 U.S. 35, 42-47 (1975). There, the Supreme Court held that language in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act that the EPA “shall” allot funds by a date certain meant what it said. Train, 420 U.S. at 42-47. At the direction of President Nixon, the EPA Administrator allotted less than what the Act specified. Id. at 40. The Supreme Court ruled that the Administrator could not do so. Inclusion of the phrase “not to exceed” did not provide discretion to the EPA to refuse to spend the funds; it only preserved the possibility that approved applications for funds already allotted “would not total the maximum amount authorized to be appropriated.” Id. at 44. Here, the statutory directive is even clearer: Congress appropriated specific sums to carry out the GGRF programs, to be spent by a specific date, and to be provided to specified eligible entities.

Meanwhile, on the correct factual record, Aiken County is indistinguishable. See Climate United, 2025 WL 2502881 at *29 (“[A]bsent congressional authorization, the Administration may not redistribute or withhold properly appropriated funds in order to effectuate its own policy goals.”) (Pillard, J., dissenting, quotation and citation omitted). Under Aiken County, an agency may not refuse to spend appropriated funds in violation of a statutory obligation. Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 257-69. As then-Judge Kavanaugh wrote: “where previously appropriated money is available for an agency to perform a statutorily mandated activity, we see no basis for a court to excuse the agency from that statutory mandate.” Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 260. The panel tries to avoid this precedent by discarding the district court’s well-supported findings and lending undue credibility to EPA’s inconsistent justifications for terminating the grants. Climate United, 2025 WL 2502881 at *11. As set out below, the district court’s factual conclusion that EPA had no intention of re-awarding the GGRF money was amply supported; thus, Aiken County should control. The district court correctly found that the Plaintiffs demonstrated a likelihood of success on this claim.

B. The Panel Wrongly Substituted Its Own Inferences and Factfinding for That of District Court

The panel avoids the clear dictates of Clinton and Aiken County only by rewriting the factual record in the case and overturning the district court’s factual findings. Climate United, 2025 WL 2502881 at *11. But this turns logic upside down, dispensing with the district court’s detailed factfinding while affording the government a presumption of regularity that strains credulity. Where “the district court’s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.” Anderson v. City of Bessemer, 470 U.S. 564, 573-74 (1985).

The district court did not, as the panel writes, “simply declare” that EPA was shutting down the GGRF program. Climate United, 2025 WL 2502881 at *11. Rather, the district court made well-supported findings of fact that EPA’s out-of-court words and actions contradicted the Agency’s representations in the litigation that the GGRF program would continue following termination of Plaintiffs’ grants. Specifically:

The district court found that EPA initially claimed fraud and conflicts of interest in grant awards and enlisted the FBI to pressure Citibank to freeze funds, but then admitted the terminations were “based on reasons of policy” when it could produce no evidence of fraud. Climate United, 778 F.Supp.3d at 114-115.

The district court found that EPA served Plaintiffs with identical information requests on the GGRF program’s oversight controls then terminated all the grants prior to receiving responses. Id. at 114. From this action, the district court reasonably inferred that the government’s reference to lack of oversight was a pretext.

The district court found that EPA refused to provide any rationale for why it terminated the grants, why cancellation was necessary when EPA had begun to examine the grant programs to add oversight mechanisms, or “why it needed to cancel every single grant to review some aspects of the GGRF program . . . .” Id.

The district court found that “[t]hroughout February and March 2025, Administrator Zeldin began to publicly express his desire to take control of the funds disbursed under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and to terminate the GGRF grants . . . and that EPA is ‘not going to rest’ until it recovered the grant funds.” Id. at 102. The district court was not “clearly erroneous” in concluding that these public statements by the EPA Administrator, alongside an executive order directing agencies to halt all IRA disbursements to “terminate the Green New Deal,” betrayed the actual, unlawful reason for the grant terminations and the intent to end the program.

The panel erred further by faulting the district court for “ignor[ing]” the “gold bars” video. Climate United, 2025 WL 2502881 at *11 n.12. But of course the district court gave no evidentiary value to that video: it is patently irrelevant to the GGRF. The video concerns efforts to award different grant money after the November 2024 election. All the GGRF grants were awarded by September – months before.

The panel also erred in holding that the district court should have afforded EPA’s unsupported and inconsistent representations a presumption of regularity. Climate United, 2025 WL 2502881 at *11. The “presumption of regularity” is a limited, rebuttable presumption that applies to authenticity of government documents and official acts. Latif v. Obama, 677 F.3d 1175, 1178 (D.C. Cir. 2011). The district court did not refuse to consider EPA’s evidence or account of its actions but rather determined – after significant factual analysis – that EPA’s representations were unsupported by the broader factual record. The district court found that EPA first sought to terminate grant funding through a criminal investigation, and when that failed, shifted its position to claim that the terminations were based on changed agency priorities. Climate United, 778 F.Supp.3d at 115. Although EPA claimed it conducted an “individualized assessment” of the grants, the district court found that EPA had not provided any rationale for the terminations. Id. at 115-116. The district court, as the finder of fact, concluded that EPA’s “public statements contradict its representations here regarding the future of the program.” Id. at 116. These factual conclusions were firmly grounded in the record and should not have been disturbed by the panel.

CONCLUSION

The stakes presented by this power grab are high. In the NCIF and CCIA programs under the GGRF, Congress directed EPA to grant nearly $20 billion to nonprofit financial organizations for the purpose of reducing pollution and energy costs for low-income and disadvantaged communities. There is considerable reliance on those grants, which were disbursed to private accounts nearly a year ago.

If the panel decision stands, it would set precedent that any agency can simply unwind any Congressionally-mandated program, unilaterally ending contracts without process, seizing money in private bank accounts, and clawing back already-disbursed funds. Congress’s exclusive power of the purse would be in name only. This Court should grant rehearing en banc.",https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/assets/images/sharelogo.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 20:59:15.323245

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Problem Solvers Caucus announced its endorsement of a bipartisan permitting reform framework. As momentum builds for Congress to act on permitting reform, the recommendations in this framework offer a commonsense, two-party roadmap to streamline the permitting process, boost energy production of all kinds, and give investors the clarity and confidence they need to invest in America.

This framework was developed by the Problem Solvers Caucus Permitting, Energy & Environment Working Group, led by Reps. Scott Peters (CA-50) and Gabe Evans (CO-08), along with Co-Chairs Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01) and Tom Suozzi (NY-03).

The framework reflects months of bipartisan collaboration with energy producers, industry experts, Members across committees of jurisdiction, and stakeholders across the political spectrum. It lays out a path forward to update the permitting system so the United States can compete globally and remain a responsible steward of the environment.

With the country poised to see one of the largest increases in energy demand in decades, Congress needs to act now. Communities and businesses across the country are facing rising costs and growing demand for affordable, reliable energy. Yet, too many projects remain stalled for years — some more than a decade — due to outdated regulations, duplicative reviews, and endless litigation, stifling innovation and driving up costs for families.

Key elements of the framework include:

• Cutting red tape for linear infrastructure projects

• Meeting growing energy demand across sectors

• Reforming outdated and duplicative NEPA requirements

• Establishing clear, enforceable permitting deadlines

• Strengthening domestic supply chains

“America faces a choice between cheap, abundant energy from all of the above sources or higher energy prices, falling behind China, and an increased risk of blackouts,” said Congressman Scott Peters (CA-50). “It’s obvious where we need to go. To get there, we know we need to update our environmental laws to meet the challenges of today and invest in a grid for this century. This platform represents a bipartisan commitment to set aside ideology and solve this problem for the American people. I look forward to working with my colleagues to keep the momentum going and turn this into legislation that can pass both chambers of Congress.”

“Reforming our permitting system is crucial, and this framework meets the moment for much-needed change. The demand for affordable and reliable energy of all kinds becomes increasingly urgent,” said Congressman Gabe Evans (CO-08). “By cutting through red tape, we can meet energy demand, lower costs, strengthen national security, and create high-quality jobs in America, while being responsible stewards of the environment and maintaining our position of global leadership and not cede ground to China. The urgency is real, and I am proud of this bipartisan push for change.”

“The number one issue Americans are concerned about is the cost of living,” said Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Tom Suozzi (NY-03). “Sky-high energy costs play an enormous role—electricity prices rose more than 6.5% in just the last year, and demand is skyrocketing. Right now it takes years, even decades, for new green energy and other projects to get connected to the grid and start generating energy to meet demand. We need commonsense, bipartisan solutions to cut red tape, bring projects online faster, and make energy more affordable for American families. That’s exactly what this framework does.”

“America wins the future by building faster, smarter, and cleaner than our competitors — lowering costs, creating jobs, and strengthening security here at home. But our permitting system has been holding us back. The Problem Solvers Caucus is changing that,” said Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01). “Our bipartisan framework sets clear rules, enforces real deadlines, unleashes investment in every form of American energy, and strengthens our security and supply chains while protecting our environment. This is the model for governing in the 21st century: two parties coming together to clear the path for innovation, jobs, and affordable energy — proving that when both parties lead together, America leads the world.”

“Too much government red tape drives up costs for Nevada families and industries alike. As one of the top two geothermal states in the country, red tape is currently preventing us from unleashing our full clean power potential and getting reliable and affordable energy on the grid,” said Congresswoman Susie Lee (NV-03). “I’m thrilled to have a bipartisan framework that includes my proposed geothermal permitting reforms.“

“As Co-Chair of the Climate Solutions Caucus, I believe we need to move energy and infrastructure projects forward in a way that strengthens our economy, lowers costs, and protects our environment,” said Congressman Andrew Garbarino (NY-02). “This permitting reform framework is a step toward cutting through red tape so we can build cleaner, more reliable energy, create good-paying jobs, bolster our supply chains, and secure American energy dominance for the future.”",https://scottpeters.house.gov/vendor/_accounts/scottpeters/_skins/peters/images/twitter_card.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 01:59:14.110120

The partnership combines Denham’s experience in developing, building, and operating large-scale power plants across six different continents, and B&W’s experience in coal power generation and the conversion of coal-fired power plants to use natural gas.

“Data centers have created an unprecedented and immediate demand for power generation, the likes of which we have not seen in nearly two decades,” said Justin DeAngelis, Global Head of Sustainable Infrastructure at Denham Capital. “Time-to-power is a key focal point for data center developers and hyperscalers, and this partnership is one differentiated tool we are looking to utilize to meet market needs.”

“We are delighted to partner with B&W to offer reliable, fast, low-cost and sustainable power solutions to the data center market, leveraging B&W’s nearly 160 years of expertise in power boilers, and bringing Denham’s 10 GW of experience in developing, constructing or operating power generation,” DeAngelis said. “Given the scale of this opportunity, Denham will shortly announce a dedicated portfolio company focused on delivering these solutions. It is vital we leverage existing power fleets, decarbonize, and increase the quality and security of our power generation systems.”

According to Industrial Info Resources (IIR), as of early March, there were over 1,900 data center projects in development in the U.S., with a total investment exceeding $800 billion. A lot of this announced spend is tied up in multi-building campuses with additions that are planned out to 2035.

While nuclear is a favorite of data center developers, natural gas may get most of the business – at least for the time being.

What are the relevant PFAS?

PFAS are synthetic chemicals used in many products and materials by a broad range of industries—from cosmetics to textiles—because they resist heat, water, and oil. Given their widespread use, these chemicals are relatively ubiquitous at low levels and have been detected in soil, sediments, groundwater, and surface water at many sites. The EPA rule at issue focuses on two PFAS specifically, PFOA and PFOS, given their widespread use and prevalence in the environment.

What does the rule do?

The EPA’s April 2024 rule designates PFOA and PFOS as “hazardous substances” under CERCLA. The rule establishes substantial reporting requirements for PFOA and PFOS releases, allows the EPA to initiate response actions without showing imminent and substantial endangerment, and perhaps most importantly, allows parties to pursue reimbursement or contribution claims for cleanups of these two substances. CERCLA’s strict, joint and several, and retroactive liability regime is particularly concerning in the context of chemicals like PFOA and PFOS that are ubiquitous in the environment and resistant to degradation.

More details on the rule’s specific requirements can be found in analysis from the Alston & Bird team here and here.

What’s the rule’s current status?

After the rule went into effect in July 2024, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and industry groups petitioned for review by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing in part that the agency had wrongly applied CERCLA and did not adequately assess the costs and benefits extending Superfund liability to PFAS contamination. With the Trump Administration’s arrival, the EPA moved for a stay in February 2025, and the case has been paused since then while the agency decided whether to continue defending the rule.

In its September 17 motion this week, the EPA asked the court to lift the stay. Attached to the motion was a declaration from a senior adviser to the EPA’s Office of Land and Emergency Management stating that the agency will continue to “engage with Congress and industry to establish a clear liability framework that ensures the polluter pays and passive receivers are protected.” This goal of protecting so-called “passive receivers” raises significant questions, including the criteria for determining which entities qualify, the scope of protections provided, and the potential of unintended consequences on enforcement actions and cost allocations at sites where these entities are involved. The EPA has indicated that Congress will have to adopt new statutory language to address concerns with passive receiver liability.

The decision to retain the PFAS Superfund rule contrasts with other Trump Administration actions to relax PFAS regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act and push back compliance deadlines under similar legislation.

Next Steps

As litigation against the rule proceeds, companies and stakeholders should follow developments both at the congressional and EPA levels, where prominent leaders in both branches have supported measures to keep the rule but excuse so-called “passive receivers” from liability. For now, companies should be aware of potential releases of PFAS—especially PFOA and PFOS—in their waste streams, be mindful of potential PFAS contamination during environmental due diligence for transactions, and stay informed on potential liability that may arise from real property investments.

The federal tax credit for electric vehicles is set to expire Sept. 30, which means consumer must act quickly to take advantage of the savings.

New qualifying EVs, known as ""clean vehicles,"" will see a tax credit up to $7,500. It's $4,000 for used models.

""If you're going to think about trying to get tax credit for your electric vehicle, act now. Don't wait till the last minute,"" said John Warren is an enrolled agent at Medford Tax Experts.

Here's what you need to know:

Consumers must buy the EV - before the deadline.

""The car can still be on order, or you can still be waiting for delivery, and you can still get this tax credit,"" Warren said.

Before signing the contract, make sure to read the fine print.

Eligibility for the tax credit, especially for used cars, could hinge on the type of car and how much money you make.

""In some cases, you can apply the credit if you're going to enter into a lease agreement with the car dealer and you can use the credit to lower the purchase price by $7,500,"" said Warren. ""The credit will go to the car dealer directly.""

A complete list of qualifying vehicles is available on fueleconomy.gov.

To claim the EV tax credit...

…taxpayers must fill out the IRS form 8936 with their federal income tax return.

""The purchaser of the vehicle has to receive a document from the car dealership. The car dealership will take their name, their social security number, their address, and report that with the VIN of the car they're buying to the IRS,"" said Warren. ""There is some information, documents that have to match for someone to be able to receive this credit""

Those who don't make the deadline may still find savings through financing deals from manufacturers or dealerships.

The Calcasieu-Sabine Basin will get $122 million from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement for drainage improvements geared to help marsh plants grow and halt erosion.

The basin, on trend with the entire Louisiana coastline, has experienced dramatic wetland loss, with more than 128,000 acres lost since 1932 and a projected 110,000 at risk of loss in a future without intervention, based on data from the United States Geological Survey.

The first phase of the project, planned along the southeastern edge of Calcasieu Lake, will build seven drainage structures with elements of a levee that allow water to flow back and forth from either side. The design is meant to balance water and salinity levels between the lake and the rest of the watershed, using natural events such as low tides and cold fronts to keep the marsh from being inundated with water.

“This funding allows us to move from planning to construction on one of our most critical restoration efforts,” Gov. Jeff Landry said Thursday in a Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority news release.

Future phases of construction include up to 18 miles of channels to improve water flow into the marsh and deposits of dredged material to promote the growth of marsh vegetation. Existing water control structures around Calcasieu Lake will also get maintenance upgrades as needed.

Estimates of the project’s total cost come to about $260 million, according to the CPRA. A previous $28.6 million grant was put toward planning costs with any remainder to be rolled over for construction and maintenance.

“The Calcasieu-Sabine project reflects the kind of large-scale, science-based restoration prioritized in Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan,” CPRA executive director Michael Hare said.. “We’re now moving from planning to action in one of the most vulnerable areas of our coast, where this investment will make a measurable difference.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-85/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_9101-1024x6831758312506.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=ntbz57FF,N,,2025-09-20 04:59:02.870790

Bob Latta and Heather Reams: Permitting reform is the key to American competitiveness,The Washington,,,,,https://washingtonreporter.news/p/op-ed-rep-bob-latta-and-heather-reams,"Too often, we have seen energy production or transmission projects languishing in litigation and redundant bureaucracy for years.

Too often, we have seen energy production or transmission projects languishing in litigation and redundant bureaucracy for years. As a result, Americans have been unable to fully benefit from our nation’s vast energy resources.

As a member of Congress and as the leader of an energy non-profit, we know that durable policy change as impactful as reforming our broken permitting process requires public buy-in. This is where federal policy and education from institutions like CRES go hand-in-hand — legislative action will help ensure long-term growth and informing Americans about how this will improve day-to-day life is key to garnering support. We know that passing comprehensive permitting reform will not only create jobs, but spur innovation, and the key is communicating that economic impact.

Improving federal permitting will create jobs and give business the certainty they need to invest in long term projects. Permitting reform will benefit all sources of energy production, meaning it could also help to lower consumption costs. However, supporting homegrown energy sources isn't just about supporting an American energy dominance agenda — it’s about boosting our local economies and American businesses. Take nuclear, an industry long burdened by red tape that supports roughly a quarter of a million jobs. Or wind, which boasts more than 300,000 jobs across all 50 states. Imagine if we made it easier to bring these job creating energy sources online?

Increased energy production is more important than ever with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). AI data centers need an immense amount of power — and one way to ensure we have that energy is an efficient and streamlined permitting process. To put it simply: data centers aren't just a trend; they're part of the next generation of the industrial economy, and we have to be ready to capitalize on their potential. This can be seen in Ohio, which is ranked fourth in the country for volume of data centers. We all use AI in our daily lives, and we need to take federal action to ensure the technology has the energy it needs to power its continued integration into our lives.

We need significantly more power, at lower costs, and the key is to use every tool and resource available to us. This is more important than ever, and should be a central focus of Washington, especially during this National Clean Energy Week.

There is so much to be gained from unleashing American energy: strengthening the economy, job creation, and innovation — but we have to get the policies right. Energy production, and the ability to move it, will be the defining need of our generation. As we continue to push pragmatic energy policy in the beltway and beyond, we look forward to working with the Trump administration to put American energy first.

Petrochemical companies and other industries in the coastal area need a lot of water and were already using the lion’s share of the municipal water supply.

The city of Corpus Christi is in a water crisis. It’s in stage three water restriction right now.

Desalination was being floated as the best solution. But it's expensive.

The project had ballooned from earlier estimates of $750 million to about $1.2 billion with residential users expected to pay for it with a 20 percent water rate increase.

Recently at a very long, emotionally charged city council meeting, many residents and environmental advocates spoke against the project. Major concerns included the high cost, fiscal risk, environmental damage—especially discharge of super-salty brine into the bay—and the unequal benefits.

But it was the cost concerns that eventually killed the project.

There was pressure from state officials pushing for desalination seeing this technology as a long-term partial solution to growing water needs for the state. For example, Governor Greg Abbott’s office had supported the project and provided some funding. But council members who opposed it said that despite the political pressure, the financial and broader benefit risks were too large.

Scrapping the Inner Harbor project is being seen as a major victory for the Corpus Christi community organizers who maintained pressure throughout the decade-long planning process.

They succeeded by mobilizing public testimony, framing the environmental stakes, and focusing on transparency and fiscal accountability.

Their strategy included showing how costs had escalated, how jobs or other claimed benefits were unclear, and insisting on alternatives.

The large public engagement shifted the political balance, making it politically costly for officials to support a plan seen as risky and burdensome.

Beatriz Alvarado and Jake Hernandez are lead organizers for the Texas Campaign for the Environment—Water for People Not Polluters operation.

Measles vaccine

On Thursday the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s advisory panel on vaccines voted to weaken recommendations for a measles vaccine that includes protection against the varicella virus, or the chickenpox.

They are saying the vaccine, called MMRV, shouldn’t be recommended for children under age 4 because of a small risk for seizures in that age group.

The seizures can be prompted by fevers associated with viruses. Doctors say that while they are scary for parents to witness, they are generally harmless.

It’s unknown if this recommendation will result in a policy change at the CDC but supporters of vaccines are alarmed.

Terri Burke says that would have had tragic consequences for Texans, given the fact the state just endured the worst outbreak of measles in 30 years.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6fb9fe4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/916x481+0+62/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8a%2F35%2F496e1feb4085a733d2cf8dcd6b9c%2Fdesal.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 20:01:44.394780

Hello and welcome to Eco Report. In today’s feature report, WFHB Assistant News Director Noelle Herhusky-Schneider reports on National Moth Week, a citizen science project to study and record populations of moths.

And here’s your environmental reports:

There is a Kissing bugs warning from CDC. Native insects aren’t always adorable bumblebees or beautiful butterflies. The triatomine insect, or “kissing bug,” is native to Indiana but it’s been making recent news as a danger. The CDC has issued a warning about the recent cases of Chagas disease—a parasitic infection that, while not immediately dangerous, can be deadly if untreated.

Environmental leaders from across the Great Lakes region gathered in Toledo this week for a groundbreaking summit focused on restoring the most polluted areas in the Great Lakes system. The “Areas of Concern Cross-Agency Partnership Summit” brought together federal, state, and local officials to coordinate restoration efforts. These “areas of concern” are locations that have experienced significant environmental degradation. The summit took place in the Maumee area, Ohio’s largest area of concern which has seen significant investment aimed at transformation.

The timing of this summit highlights major restoration progress happening across the region. Following a successful cleanup, the EPA removed New York’s Rochester Embayment from the list of most polluted Great Lakes areas, Since the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative began in 2010, the restoration program has already delisted 7 “areas of concern” and enhanced, protected, and restored nearly 530,000 acres of habitat, 13% of which are coastal wetlands.

Feeling the Heat? These fossil fuel giants are to blame, new study says. Climate change increased the probability and intensity of more than 200 heat waves across the globe over the last two decades, according to a newly published study.

Human-Caused Warming Tripled the Death Toll of European Heat Waves This Summer, New Report Shows

Public health researchers struggle to track the accelerating pace of global warming impact.

The folks from Campbell’s soup company are in hot water after officials admit that they’ve been dumping water in the Maumee River for over 6 years, violating the Clean Water Act thousands of times. This isn’t just about soup production gone wrong—it’s about contaminated water that affects everyone downstream. The factory dumps its waste into the Maumee River, which flows directly into Lake Erie. Phosphorus from the wastewater feeds toxic algae blooms that can harm swimmers and contaminate drinking water with dangerous cyanobacteria—something residents of Monroe County and visitors to Lake Monroe are all too familiar with.

The actor and influential environmentalist, Robert Redford, has passed away. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, Redford spent over fifty years advocating for public lands and protected waters in the West, protecting wildlife, pursuing environmental justice for Indigenous communities, and climate action. Redford was one of the early voices speaking out about climate change and the choices developers, communities, and governments can make in safeguarding the planet for future generations. Redford, a longtime resident of Utah, was 89.

In May, Trump released his budget request, which would cut NSF funding by 56 percent, from $9 billion to $3.9 billion.
In May, the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy revised an implementation plan for the Arctic.
He is the former assistant director for polar sciences and the executive director for the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee in the White House from 2020 to 2024.
“I just can’t emphasize enough what an impact that ARCUS has had to the Arctic research community over the years, and actually to communities in the Arctic.”","After nearly 40 years, the Arctic Research Consortium of the United States will close Sept. 30, a casualty of President Donald Trump’s proposed budget cuts and his administration’s focus on using the Arctic as an outpost for national security and energy dominance—and its push away from science.

As part of the overarching defunding of science after Trump took office, ARCUS’ major funder, the National Science Foundation, chose not to re-open a bid for a community hub project that would have continued to fund the nonprofit.

ARCUS had been trying to diversify its funding sources, but still received 93 percent of its funding—$1.7 million— from the NSF in fiscal year 2023, according to the nonprofit’s most recently available tax records.

While NSF is an independent federal agency, it relies on government funding to award grants to other organizations. It is also the lead agency responsible for implementing Arctic research policy. It is accepting input on the next five-year plan until Nov. 15.

In May, Trump released his budget request, which would cut NSF funding by 56 percent, from $9 billion to $3.9 billion. The request “reflects a strategic alignment of resources in a constrained fiscal environment in which NSF prioritizes investments that can have the greatest national impact,” an NSF spokesperson told Inside Climate News in an email.

The NSF spokesperson did not answer questions about the rationale for the cuts, how the money would be redirected and any connection between the reduction and the Trump administration’s national security plans for the Arctic region.

The U.S. House of Representatives is proposing a 23 percent decrease in NSF spending levels, while the Senate’s reductions are comparatively minimal, just 0.7 percent.

The ARCUS board recommended that the organization shut down, a move supported by the membership. “This decision to sunset ARCUS was not rash in any way,” said Audrey Taylor, its executive director, on a farewell call to supporters, scientists and media on Friday. “It was responsive to a number of things happening throughout the funding streams and throughout the federal government and the Arctic research community landscape writ large that have been going on for a number of years, but certainly came to a head in this last six months.”

Founded in 1988, ARCUS advanced Arctic research by connecting scientists, government agencies, Indigenous communities and nonprofits all over the world. Its dozens of projects included an Indigenous scholars program, the launch of the Sea Ice Prediction Network and an initiative to develop the prediction network’s sea ice forecast reports.

That research not only shed light on the effects of global climate change on sea ice, but provided crucial information for local subsistence hunters and businesses that relied on Alaskan shipping channels.

ARCUS, based in Fairbanks, Alaska, is closing at a critical time. Over the past several decades, federal data show Arctic air, ocean and land temperatures have increased at a rate more than twice the global average.

In May, the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy revised an implementation plan for the Arctic. Under the Biden administration, it had prioritized community resilience and health, hazard mitigation and sustainable economies and livelihoods, as well as the global climate impacts of a warming Arctic.

The Trump administration amended the list to prioritize community, economic, energy and military security. The changes mirror an executive order that Trump issued on his first day in office, “Unleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Potential,” that rescinded Biden-era energy regulations and replaced them with measures to fast-track fossil fuel drilling and exploration.

The melting of Arctic sea ice also allows other countries, particularly Russia and China, to more easily access the region. That could turn Alaska into a chessboard for international military maneuvers, whose value is measured by its geopolitical usefulness—similar to Hawaii and Guam.

“In the early days, anything we did in Arctic research had to be justified from the importance of why the Arctic was important to the Lower 48,” Larry Hinzman said on the farewell call. He is the former assistant director for polar sciences and the executive director for the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee in the White House from 2020 to 2024.

“ARCUS has really helped us change that perception and made the Arctic a presence in its own right,” Hinzman said. “I just can’t emphasize enough what an impact that ARCUS has had to the Arctic research community over the years, and actually to communities in the Arctic.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2215603850-1024x768.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 19:01:28.577719

Many spots again observed a more than 30° jump from the observed low temperatures to the observed high temperatures. Most once again ended up with highs in the upper 80s with several 90° readings.

Our blocking pattern this week ends soon! Notice the counterclockwise spin of an upper low. It drifts east tonight and brings more clouds here first. There are showers in Illinois but those will have a tough time holding as they enter a very dry environment. I won’t rule out a stray shower tonight but most, if not all, stay dry.

This weekend is when the changes arrive. If you have outdoor plans, Saturday is the day when rain shouldn’t bring impacts. Expect mostly to partly cloudy skies with the warm temperatures continuing in the upper 80s. As that upper-level low gets closer, the slightly higher rain chances come with it starting Sunday.

With the changes, this low will be cut off from the jet stream and nearly stationary from Sunday into the work week. This means (1) daily chances exist, (2) dry hours are promised and (3) cooler temperatures but higher dew points will be around. In the near term, the highest rain chances look to be late Sunday into Monday morning then again toward the middle of the week.

Total rainfall will help in putting a dent in our drought situation. However, it won’t help when it comes to the longer 60-90 day lack of rainfall across central Indiana. Most of the region is now under a Moderate Drought.

The rain will need something to feed off each day. That will come with increased humidity levels/dew points each day.

The 120-acre site at 1500 S. Tibbs Ave. has a long history of contamination.

It operated as a specialty chemicals production facility since the 1950s. Until 1972, a coal-tar refining and wood treatment facility that used creosote operated at the site. Creosote is a substance considered a likely contributor to cancer. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, site operators used a trench, a landfill and several pits to dispose of waste. Those waste handling practices contaminated the groundwater and soil.

The EPA placed it on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in 1984.

The site has opened and closed over the years and changed owners. It most recently closed in 2024.

“What I remember is the smell, the stench,” said Linda, a neighbor of 50 years. “It was putrid. There was always a layering of dirt or dust all over everything. Always a layering. You could wash your car and go out a couple of hours later, and it’s like a dust storm came through. It was that bad.”

In the 80s, Linda attended every meeting with the EPA for over a year.

“I learned that tons of chemicals were underground,” she said. “I did not know that. I don’t think anybody knew that.”

She remembers a few neighbors who still used wells and weren’t hooked up to city water. They had to get rid of their wells because the water wasn’t safe to drink.

Groundwater monitors detected benzene, a cancer-causing chemical.

“It’s like, what is this going to do to our health?” Linda said. “A lot of our neighbors are gone now, but they all felt the same thing that we did.”

“It’s nothing today like it was in the 80s,” she said. “But it’s still scary, because we lived here that whole time and you don’t know what the future holds.”

The existing groundwater extraction system has been operating at the site since 1994.

This month, crews will begin installing a new air sparging system. It’s intended to capture contaminants including benzene, ammonia and pyridine. The EPA says air sparging is the process of injecting air into the ground below the water table. It flushes the contaminants up through the groundwater as air bubbles and gets captured with a vapor extraction system.

1500 South Tibbs LCC is responsible for installing 73 air sparging wells along the east side under EPA’s oversight.

Crews will also install additional wells to monitor the cleanup process.

The EPA estimates the construction will be done in February. The existing system will remain online until the new air sparging system is fully operational.

“These are the pods once they’re mostly dry. But you can see we’ve got some of different colors,” Geiger said. “This is a blue-ish gray pod.”

He’s working with the Utopian Seed Project, an Asheville-based nonprofit, to test crops that will be climate resilient.

“Having seeds and crops that are resilient to our weather extremes is the best way to adapt to a changing climate,” Geiger said.

Several years ago, Geiger owned a food truck, then started a farm in Denton in 2020.

“[I] just got real interested in sourcing local ingredients and then kind of went down a rabbit hole of growing them myself,” Geiger said.

He says now he’s fairly hooked on farming.

With this project, he’s contributing to growing ingredients that can withstand the volatile nature of weather.

“Having more resilient plant varieties is definitely very important as we see more weather extreme events,” Geiger said.

The Utopian Seed Project uses crossbreeding to take different varieties to create hybrid versions of crops. Then Geiger can select and refine the seed collection. This year he grew three to four varieties of southern peas.

“These are the black-eyed peas that we’ve already shelled and harvested,” Geiger said.

With the southern peas that performed best, he’ll take those seeds and grow them again next year for a higher yield.

“It’s great. I’m very excited to be able to share our progress with the other growers. We have little groups that we’re able to share our successes, failures, what’s doing the best. Being able to collaborate and be in these groups with other plant breeders and seed savers,” Geiger said. “It makes me feel like there’s good progress to be had.”

“Probably the biggest thing would be it’s relatively quiet.” Muller said they're seeing demand for electric tractors from Europe, where farming policies are sometimes more progressive.
Some entrepreneurs see electric tractors as a step on the path to automation — fewer workers, more efficiency and less cost.","East Lansing — In the soft dirt of an indoor horseback riding ring last month, a group of farmers got ready to test drive a new piece of equipment: an electric tractor.

As they took turns climbing in — some surprised by its quick acceleration — they gave real-time feedback to the Michigan State University researchers who have been developing it for over two years.

The farmers remarked on the motor's quiet whir. Most were intrigued, or at least open to the idea. Some were concerned that the battery on the underside of the carriage would mean a lower clearance over the field, while others worried that it would simply be too expensive.

“What we hope to do when we retire is we want to get everything electric on the farm. The tractor is the last electric implement to get,” said Don Dunklee, one of the farmers to provide feedback. He runs a small organic vegetable farm that's relied on wind and solar for decades.

The market is fairly new, but some researchers and entrepreneurs think electric tractors will be ideal for small farmers who care about sustainability and want to market their products that way. The small cherry-red, open-cab machine is well-suited for tasks like weeding fields of specialty crops like carrots or asparagus, or squeezing between the tight rows of orchard trees. Farmers with solar panels can avoid the cost of diesel.

Agriculture is among the largest sources of climate-warming emissions worldwide. Though tractors are a small culprit, experts believe an environmentally friendly machine would still attract buyers interested in sustainability.

“There’s reduced emissions, but before you get there, you have to be solving for other problems,” including noise, ease of use and cost, said Derek Muller, business manager for battery electric systems at John Deere.

There are downsides — electric tractors are aimed at filling a niche, not overturning the status quo. And while battery technology has come a long way, they can’t last all day or match the massive horsepower of a diesel engine that sets giant tractors cruising through the sprawling grain and soybean operations of the Midwest.

Few companies offer electric tractor options

In addition to battery limitations, there are other structural obstacles. Most farmers do not have fast electric chargers, nor do they have solar panels to supply those chargers with free electricity — diesel would need to be much more expensive for the economics to turn sharply in favor of electric. But companies are starting to see an opportunity.

“For John Deere, it is not the only solution,” Muller said. “It’s not going to be where we lead our efforts. It’s going to be one of many options.”

The company has built a small utility electric tractor prototype. It joins a limited set of offerings from other companies like Monarch Tractor, which started in 2019 with the aim to help farmers, who have traditionally struggled with razor-thin profits to save money, work sustainably and more efficiently.

Ajit Srivastava, an agricultural engineer and Michigan State professor who hosted the farmer feedback session, wants to help smallholder farmers across the world. Such farmers grow about a third of the world’s food, but many do it with only hand tools. He started trying to emulate a pair of oxen made of off-the-shelf parts, so anyone could build it themselves.

“If we were to mechanize all the smallholder farmers in the world, there isn’t enough diesel out there to power them. So we have to find some other source,” Srivastava said.

It's still a work in progress. Rain had postponed the feedback session, originally planned for the spring, because the tractor hadn't been waterproofed yet. It also doesn't have enough power for some jobs like tilling. But farmers generally like what Srivastava had developed. He hopes it could eventually be sold for roughly $30,000, substantially cheaper than some of the competition.

“The steering is really responsive. It just seems to run really smooth,” said Dunklee, adding, however, that it might not do everything he needs on a farm yet. “Probably the biggest thing would be it’s relatively quiet.”

Muller said they're seeing demand for electric tractors from Europe, where farming policies are sometimes more progressive. And there's also a market at universities in other countries where researchers are studying agriculture, said Brendan Dowdle, chief business officer of Bonsai Robotics, which sells modular, automated electric farm robots that can work together to mimic some tasks ordinarily done by a tractor.

One possible customer is the so-called “gentleman farmer” who has a small operation of specialty crops or vegetables and farms for fun, not necessarily to make a living.

“They want to be self-sustaining,” said Patrick Woolcock, an associate engineering professor and agriculture expert at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls.

Plus, without harmful diesel emissions, they can work in greenhouses and, with fewer parts, there's hope repairs won't be as complicated, at least once a readily available supply is established.

Could electric tractors be more compatible with automation?

Some entrepreneurs see electric tractors as a step on the path to automation — fewer workers, more efficiency and less cost. Engineers are now designing machines that will drive themselves and power precise weeders and planters.

For example, Monarch Tractor CEO Praveen Penmetsa noted that if a self-guided tractor gets stuck and has to notify the farmer, electric power has clear benefits. A diesel tractor would sit there idling, but an electric one doesn’t waste fuel while waiting.

Srivastava also said he's just trying to make people's lives easier — looking backward all day to make sure a plow is operating properly is grueling. So, a self-driving tractor would let farmers pay more attention to ensuring harvesting is happening properly, or the weeder isn't accidentally digging up crops.

""Not that we want to take the operator off the tractor, the operator would be there, but they can focus on how well the operation is going rather than making sure the tractor is in the rows,"" he said.

Still, some aren’t so sure electric has such a big advantage when it comes to automation. Tim Bucher, CEO of Agtonomy, a company focused on bringing autonomy software to farm vehicles, was all-in on electric a few years ago. But the technology has gotten so good that now his customers can pick and choose the energy source for their tractor and see similar results, he said. And with government electric vehicle subsidies disappearing, there's less incentive for most farmers to go that route.

On his own farm, though, he opts for electric, and he says he's seen economic returns.

And from an environmental perspective, “it also just makes me feel better,” he said.

The launch follows DOE's report, ""Evaluating the Reliability and Security of the United States Electric Grid,"" developed under President Donald Trump's executive order (EO) on ""Strengthening the Reliability and Security of the United States Electric Grid"" (EO 14262). That analysis underscores an urgent reality: Planned retirements and interconnection delays – combined with AI/data center and industrial load growth – are stressing the U.S. electric grid. DOE is now asking industry, states, regulators, utilities and grid operators to help identify what can be advanced quickly and how federal tools should be applied to do so.

How Speed to Power Fits the Administration's Policy Framework

Speed to Power aligns with several administration priorities:

Unleashing American Energy (EO 14154). Emphasizes abundant, reliable and affordable energy across the nation as an economic and national security imperative.

Removing Barriers to American Leadership in AI (EO 14179). Prioritizes building U.S. AI dominance to promote economic competitiveness and national security.

Strengthening Grid Reliability and Security (EO 14262). Directs DOE to use a uniform reliability methodology to guide federal interventions to meet growing demand.

Reinvigorating America's Nuclear Industrial Base (EO 14302). Encourages rapid deployment of nuclear generation as firm, dispatchable capacity.

Together, these actions point to a federal posture that is both pro-build and time-sensitive – with Speed to Power as the mechanism to identify and accelerate critical projects that can realistically increase power availability and reliability over the near-term to accommodate and enable load growth.

What DOE Is Looking For

DOE seeks information on large-scale projects that could enable at least 3 GW (and up to 20 GW) of incremental load, including:

New interregional lines (≥1,000 megavolt-amperes (MVA)) and reconductoring of existing lines (≥500 MVA) to increase load-serving capability.

Bringing retired thermal generation facilities back into service or otherwise using the existing interconnection capacity to provide reliable power generation.

DOE is also inviting respondents to flag high-priority geographic areas – such as data center corridors, semiconductor clusters, industrial parks and port complexes – where targeted federal support could unlock major private investment but where grid constraints (i.e., capacity, congestion and interconnection) stand in the way.

Programs and Authorities on the Table

While the RFI is not a funding opportunity, DOE explicitly asks how its programs and authorities should be deployed to accelerate delivery. Relevant tools include:

Transmission Facilitation Program (TFP). DOE acts as an ""anchor customer"" and administers borrowing authority to support and de-risk large interregional projects.

Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP). Competitive funding for grid hardening, optimization and advanced technologies.

Loan Programs Office (LPO). Debt financing for eligible transmission, generation and integrated systems under Title 17 authorities.

Technical Assistance. Modeling, planning support and national lab expertise to help design bankable, buildable solutions.

For sponsors weighing capital stacks, the RFI also invites input on where gaps exist and how DOE could best de-risk early stages to crowd in private capital.

Connection to Recent INL RFA

Speed to Power complements DOE's recent Request for Applications (RFA) for long-term lease agreements to use federal land at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for AI data center and integrated energy infrastructure – a site-specific opportunity that encouraged engagement with GDO and LPO on financing pathways independent of leasing decisions. (See Holland & Knight's previous blog post, ""DOE Opportunity to Lease INL Land for AI Data Centers and Integrated Energy Infrastructure,"" Sept. 12, 2025.)

Who Should Consider Responding

Utilities and public power entities with major load additions or grid constraints in their service territories

Regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and independent system operators (ISOs) coordinating interregional solutions or facing queue backlogs

Large load customers (e.g., AI/data center operators, semiconductor fabrication plants and industrial facilities) with location-specific, near-term needs

Generation and transmission developers with advanced projects that can materially increase power availability and reliability

State energy offices (SEOs) and public utility commissions (PUCs) with development investment zones or corridor designations with projected demand growth from data centers, advanced manufacturing facilities, semiconductor plants and other large energy users

Technology and software providers with solutions that can realistically be deployed quickly to increase power availability or address grid constraints

How Holland & Knight Can Help

Holland & Knight advises investors, utilities and large-load customers on federal energy programs, including through GDO (TFP/GRIP) and LPO financing pathways. We can help scope a targeted RFI response, align projects with the appropriate federal tools, and position near-term projects for accelerated delivery.

,Congress,2025-09-19 21:11:19+00:00,www.wbur.org,"As federal tax credits for EVs end, experts worry about Mass. climate goals | WBUR News",Vivian La,,,,,https://www.wbur.org/news/2025/09/19/electric-vehicles-federal-tax-credit-mass,"This quarter, the U.S. could hit an all-time record for EV sales, the report stated.
A Massachusetts-funded EV rebate program will still be available after the federal tax credit ends.
The federal tax credit has income eligibility limits and requirements for vehicles to qualify.
Consumers can also take advantage of lower monthly payments on leased EVs through the expiring tax credit.
The other driver of EV sales, charging stations, seem to be back on track.","Car buyers have less than two weeks to take advantage of federal discounts that provide up to $7,500 toward the purchase of electric vehicles.

With the expiration of the federal tax credit at the end of this month, environmental policy experts said, there's one less incentive to buy the climate-friendly vehicles, and they're concerned about how Massachusetts will meet its goals for slashing planet-warming emissions.

“ It's going to be a lot harder to find a way to increase adoption to the levels that we need,” said Anna Vanderspek, electric vehicle program director at the nonprofit Green Energy Consumers Alliance.

Still, she said, consumers can still make the switch to EVs.

""This is not all going to grind to a halt,"" she said. ""It is a challenging time, but that does not mean that this transition is not moving forward.""

The federal discount was designed to encourage drivers to go electric. In ending the credit, Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration argued the government shouldn't place its thumb on automobile markets in favor of one type of vehicle over another.

In Massachusetts, staff at some local dealerships said they've seen an increase in interest and sales of EVs in recent weeks, as consumers try to take advantage of the credit before the looming Sept. 30 deadline. Some dealerships' websites feature online countdown clocks until the credit expires.

Nationally, EV sales are also up. Last month, more than 145,000 EVs were sold across the country and made up nearly 10% of all new vehicle sales, according to Kelley Blue Book estimates. This quarter, the U.S. could hit an all-time record for EV sales, the report stated.

Despite the “mad rush” to use the tax credit, EV sales will likely slow after it sunsets, said Christopher Knittel, professor of energy economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and director of the university's Climate Policy Center.

In 2023, research out of MIT and Harvard University projected that federal tax credits, combined with efforts to install charging stations on highways nationwide, would increase EV adoption by 18% through the end of the decade. Knittel suspects customers could turn away from the EV without the financial incentive program.

“ Those are customers that are buying it because the tax credit exists, and if you pull it away, they're gonna go back to the internal combustion engine vehicle,” Knittel said.

Taking away the tax credits could reduce the number of EV sales through the end of the decade by around 6%, according to updated models from the Harvard and MIT team.

Massachusetts needs residents to register 900,000 EVs by the end of this decade in order to meet its climate change target. Last year, officials reported 140,000 EVs were on the state's roads. That pace of EV adoption has to increase for the state to meet its goal, Vanderspek said.

A Massachusetts-funded EV rebate program will still be available after the federal tax credit ends. The state incentive provides up to $3,500 for eligible vehicles. And Uber, Lyft and taxi drivers are eligible for a $6,500 credit. Some low-income households can also qualify for an additional $1,500.

Lauren Diggin, spokesperson for the state Department of Energy Resources, said staff works to ensure the rebate program ""operates as cost-effectively as possible to support broad adoption of EVs, and to better support increased adoption among disadvantaged communities, which are disproportionately impacted by harmful transportation emissions.""

The state will continue to help residents looking to purchase an EV ""as the Trump administration dismantles federal programs that support affordable clean vehicles,"" she said.

The federal tax credit has income eligibility limits and requirements for vehicles to qualify. The IRS also clarified last month that as long as a buyers sign a sales contract and make a payment before Sept. 30, they can qualify for the credit even if their car is delivered after the deadline.

Consumers can also take advantage of lower monthly payments on leased EVs through the expiring tax credit. They count as commercial vehicles, so there's a wider range of qualifying cars and the person leasing doesn't need to meet the income requirements that buyers do. Dealerships claim a commercial tax credit and often pass savings onto consumers.

Whether buyers get the tax credit when they buy a car or when they file their taxes, Vanderspek said to make sure and get a “time of sale” report from the dealership within three days of purchase. That will allow buyers to prove their purchase happened before the deadline.

The other driver of EV sales, charging stations, seem to be back on track. The Trump administration resumed a federal charging infrastructure program in August after freezing its funding for months, but research suggests that won't make up for the loss of individual discounts.

Knittel sees potential for the state continue its work on charging infrastructure, which could encourage more EV adoption without the cost of tax incentives. The Northeast has some of the highest density of public EV charging ports in the country, with Massachusetts topping the list, according to data from the nonprofit Climate Central.

Last month, state officials announced $46 million to add more charging infrastructure.

""Access to EV charging is essential if we’re serious about reducing emissions and developing a transportation system that’s resilient, fair, and prepared for the challenges of climate change,"" said state Transportation Secretary Monica Tibbits-Nutt in the announcement.

Still, shifts in federal climate policy — like a proposal to end the legal underpinning for tailpipe emissions standards — and uncertainty about tariffs could spell further uncertainty for the EV industry, as well as for consumers, Knittel said.

"" The most concerning thing to me is the yo-yo nature of climate policy at a federal level,” Knittel said. ""We've really gone into a world where we just have uncertain policy and that's gonna have much longer term impacts than what we're talking about today.""",https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/nepm-ev-1000x750.jpeg,N,,2025-09-19 18:03:58.349179

I also said the temporary deployment of the National Guard, which doesn’t have law enforcement training, was unlikely to make our community safer but will affect tourism, restaurant, construction and other industries. See a release with my exchange with Director Patel here(link is external).

Introducing Safe Streets for All Act

On Thursday, I introduced the Safe Streets for All (SS4A) Reauthorization and Improvement Act with Congressmen Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Robert Garcia of California. The legislation aims to reduce traffic accidents by supporting projects protecting pedestrians, cyclists, scooter-riders, motorists and transit riders. This is an important and successful program from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and I am working to ensure it continues. See details about the measure here(link is external).

Meeting with Memphis Constituent Groups

This week, I met with several constituent groups including members of the Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce, University of Memphis President Bill Hardgrave and officials with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers – Memphis District, Head Start, the Port of Memphis and the Auto Care Association, including AutoZone, in my Washington office to discuss their legislative priorities. These meetings are helpful in shaping my approach to voting, and I always welcome the opportunity to talk with constituents from Tennessee’s 9th Congressional District to my Washington office.

Calling for Independent Congressional Redistricting

On Wednesday, I introduced the John Tanner and Jim Cooper Fairness and Independence in Redistricting (FAIR) Act to require states to remove politics from their congressional apportionment practices and establish independent redistricting commissions. The measure is named for two former Tennessee congressmen who championed an end to partisan gerrymandering. Read about the measure here(link is external).

Meeting with Russian Dissident Journalist Vladimir Kara-Murza

Kara-Murza, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 2024 while in prison, was released in a prisoner exchange last year. He is a true hero. As the Special Representative on Political Prisoners for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s Parliamentary Assembly, I discouraged Vladimir’s return to Russia in 2022 and worked diligently to keep his illegal detention in the headlines until he was released.

Denouncing Apparent Censoring of Trump Critics

ABC yanked late night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air on Wednesday citing some innocuous comments he made about the MAGA movement and its reaction to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. This follows CBS’s decision to cancel late night host Stephen Colbert in a transparent attempt to muzzle any criticism of Trump and his administration. These decisions, made while each broadcaster’s ownership companies are awaiting government approvals for multi-billion-dollar mergers, smack of government censorship in an age of fear and must be loudly and passionately condemned. As a democracy, we have a long tradition of criticizing public and elected officials, and the First Amendment guarantees that free speech. I spoke about this issue on the floor Thursday night which you can see here(link is external), and I cosponsored a resolution to condemn these attacks on free speech.

VPPs connect small energy systems and smart devices into a single network managed by an energy company or utility. That can include residential solar panels, battery storage, EVs, and smart thermostats. When the grid needs help during peak demand or emergencies, they can be tapped – and you get paid for participating.

Wood Mackenzie’s “2025 North America Virtual Power Plant Market” report shows that the market is expanding more broadly than deeply. The number of company deployments, unique buyers (offtakers), and market and utility programs each grew by more than 33% in the past year. But total capacity grew at a slower pace – just under 14%. “Utility program caps, capacity accreditation reforms, and market barriers have prevented capacity from growing as fast as market activity,” said Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid edge at Wood Mackenzie.

Residential VPP customers are gaining ground

Residential customers are making a bigger dent in wholesale market capacity, increasing their share to 10.2% from 8.8% in 2024. But small customers still face roadblocks, mainly due to limits on data access for enrollment and market settlement.

Battery storage and EVs are also playing a bigger role. Deployments that include batteries or EVs now account for 61% as many as those that include smart thermostats, which have long dominated VPP programs.

Leading states and markets

California, Texas, New York, and Massachusetts are leading the pack, making up 37% of all VPP deployments. In wholesale markets, PJM (which manages the electric grid for 13 states and DC) and ERCOT (the Texas grid), both home to massive data center commitments, also have the highest disclosed VPP offtake capacity. “While data centers are the source of new load, there’s an enormous opportunity to tap VPPs as the new source of grid flexibility,” Hertz-Shargel said.

Offtake growth and new business models

The top 25 VPP offtakers each procured more than 100 megawatts this year. Over half of all offtakers expanded their deployments by at least 30% compared to last year. That’s fueling the rise of a new “independent distributed power producer” model, where companies aim to use grid service revenue and energy arbitrage to finance third-party-owned storage for electricity retailers.

Policy pushback

Not everyone is on board with how utilities are approaching distributed energy resources (DERs). Many VPP aggregators and software providers oppose utilities putting DERs into their rate base under the Distributed Capacity Procurement model.* “This model is seen as limiting access of private capital and aggregators from the DER market, rather than leveraging customer and third-party-owned resources,” Hertz-Shargel explained. He added that most wholesale market experts believe FERC Order 2222 was a missed opportunity and won’t significantly improve market access.

*I really like this model, personally. I leased two Tesla Powerwalls under Green Mountain Power’s Lease Energy Storage program in Vermont for $55 a month, and it’s an excellent VPP program that’s grown much more rapidly than other models, such as bring-your-own batteries.

Final Word The construction start date is more than just a project milestone, it’s the gatekeeper to one of the most valuable tax deductions available today.
With the One Big Beautiful Bill sunsetting §179D on June 30, 2026, acting now ensures your project is on the right side of the deadline.","On July 4, 2025, Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill, a landmark piece of legislation that expanded the §179D Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction into one of the most powerful tax incentives available to building owners and designers. But this opportunity won’t last forever. The program sunsets on June 30, 2026. That means only buildings that start construction prior to this date will be eligible to claim the deduction.

After the deadline, the door to significant tax savings through §179D closes for projects that have not yet started.

Why Construction Start Date Matters

The construction start date is purely about eligibility. It does not determine which energy-efficiency standard applies. Instead, it’s the deciding factor for whether your project can claim the deduction at all.

Start before June 31, 2026 → Eligible to pursue up to $5.81 per square foot in deductions.

Start after June 31, 2026 → Not eligible, no matter how efficient the building becomes.

How the IRS Defines “Start of Construction”

The IRS recognizes construction through the use of 2 methodologies:

Method 1: Physical Work Test

Significant physical work on site is performed such as foundation work, plumbing, vertical construction, etc.…

This does not include site clearing, planning, design, permitting, etc..

Method 2: Safe Harbor

Incur 5% of the total cost of the facility. Additionally, work must be continuous.

In both cases, proper documentation of these activities is essential to demonstrate compliance with the eligibility cutoff.

What This Means for Owners and Designers

Building Owners: Beginning construction before June 30, 2026 locks in eligibility and ensures the opportunity to capture six- and seven-figure tax savings. Waiting too long could mean missing out entirely.

Eligible Designers: For architects, engineers, and contractors working on government or tax-exempt projects, starting construction before the deadline is the only way to receive an allocation of the deduction.

Steps to Take Now

Plan with the deadline in mind: Review project timelines to confirm construction begins before June 30, 2026.

Document thoroughly: Keep dated photos, contracts, and invoices to prove when significant work started.

Engage your advisors: Tax consultants and energy modelers can provide guidance and prepare the necessary reports and allocation letters.

Final Word

The construction start date is more than just a project milestone, it’s the gatekeeper to one of the most valuable tax deductions available today.

With the One Big Beautiful Bill sunsetting §179D on June 30, 2026, acting now ensures your project is on the right side of the deadline.

This follows building speculation in recent months that these designations would be revoked. The decision was confirmed in briefs filed on September 17, 2025, by the Department of Justice in the D.C. Circuit Court on behalf of EPA.

Presumably in response to pending legal challenges that the designation process for PFOA and PFOS under CERCLA section 102(a) was scientifically and legally flawed, EPA further announced it will pursue future rulemaking to establish a ""uniform framework"" governing the designation of any future hazardous substances under CERCLA.

,EPA,2025-09-19 20:17:18+00:00,Inside Climate News,Children Plead With U.S. Lawmakers to Protect EPA's Endangerment Finding,"Carl David Goette-Luciak, Wyatt Myskow",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/19092025/children-lawmakers-protest-epa-endangerment-finding-move/,"Repeal of the endangerment finding stands to fundamentally reshape the lives of young people, who will bear the brunt of climate change.
“Kids want the EPA to preserve the endangerment finding to protect our health and future,” said 12-year-old Valencia, who lives in Maryland.
The EPA determined at that time that the evidence was clear, and formalized the endangerment finding in 2009.
“The EPA couldn’t disapprove and deny the connection between greenhouse gases and climate change then, and they can’t now,” Markey told the audience.
“If the endangerment finding is overturned, all the environmental groups will come together in bringing a case against the EPA,” Rogers, a former judicial clerk, told ICN.","School-age children carrying signs reading “less pollution, more solution” and “people over polluters” gathered on Wednesday inside the U.S. Capitol to oppose the Trump administration’s plan to roll back greenhouse gas regulations.

Congressional leaders and climate advocates joined the youth at the press conference, where they denounced the Environmental Protection Agency’s move to reconsider the landmark 2009 endangerment finding, the backbone of emissions regulation.

The backdrop of young faces underscored a point lawmakers and experts repeated throughout the event: that the debate is not just over statutory interpretation, science or judicial precedent. Repeal of the endangerment finding stands to fundamentally reshape the lives of young people, who will bear the brunt of climate change.

“Kids want the EPA to preserve the endangerment finding to protect our health and future,” said 12-year-old Valencia, who lives in Maryland. “Our generation is expected to live through three times as many climate disasters as our grandparents, and we’re already living through them.”

Holding aloft hand-drawn posters with messages like “climate change makes camp unsafe,” the kids described how environmental issues were already constraining the fun of their childhood. “My swim practices have gotten canceled because of wildfire smoke and recess gets moved inside when it’s too hot outside,” Margot, a 10-year-old from Virginia, told the crowd. “It’s really scary.”

Several lawmakers present reflected on their own childhoods, before pollution was reined in by the environmental policies now in the administration’s crosshairs. Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) recalled “feeling that burning sensation in your eyes or in your throat because air quality was so bad.” He recounted how, growing up in Los Angeles in the 1970s, children had to stay home from school and avoid playing outdoors because of air pollution levels. “If you truly don’t believe in the power of cleaner vehicle standards, then think about these kids,” Padilla said.

Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) grounded the fight in history. His state argued, in Massachusetts v. EPA nearly two decades ago, that greenhouse gases were air pollutants and therefore must be regulated under the Clean Air Act. The Supreme Court agreed in its 2007 ruling, which compelled the EPA to determine, based on scientific evidence, whether emissions posed a serious threat to public health. The EPA determined at that time that the evidence was clear, and formalized the endangerment finding in 2009. It vested the agency with the authority—and the legal obligation—to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

“The EPA couldn’t disapprove and deny the connection between greenhouse gases and climate change then, and they can’t now,” Markey told the audience. “We have the facts on our side—Trump’s EPA is pushing its own fictions.”

Markey’s comments were backed up the same day by a publication from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine that will be submitted to the EPA. Authors of the new report from the nation’s premier group of scientific advisers reviewed the wealth of studies amassed by the scientific community since the endangerment finding was released, concluding that the evidence that emissions endanger human health is “beyond scientific dispute” and “has only grown stronger.”

“Much of the understanding of climate change that was uncertain or tentative in 2009 is now resolved and new threats have been identified,” the report said, drawing on some 600 studies published in the past 16 years. Those newly identified threats include climate change’s impact on metabolic disease, antimicrobial resistance, immune health, nutrition, mental health, pregnancy and birth outcomes, the scientists wrote. “The United States faces a future in which climate-induced harm continues to worsen and today’s extremes become tomorrow’s norms,” their report said.

The National Academies report is one of the more important documents to emerge in the brief public comment period that the EPA provided. That’s because Congress spelled out, in the Clean Air Act, that the agency should draw on the findings, recommendations and comments of the private, nonprofit institution, which operates under a 1863 congressional charter, signed by President Abraham Lincoln. Typically, the Academies write reports in response to requests from Congress or administrations, but in this case, no such request was made. The organization decided to self-fund a rapid response review of the science, completing it in just over 40 days.

Markey likened Lee Zeldin, Trump’s EPA head, to the mayor in the 1975 film “Jaws,” who keeps the town’s lucrative beaches open for swimming despite evidence of shark attacks and warnings from experts. “He’s trying to tell the American people, it’s all clear to get back in the water. Nothing to see here, folks. No danger from climate change. No laws that require him to fight pollution. No court precedent that demands the agency he leads must keep us safe.”

“We know that people are not safe; there’s blood in the water and more fossil fuel sharks than ever,” Markey added. “This attack on the endangerment finding is a clear and present danger to the public.”

In the 16 years since the endangerment finding, it was challenged numerous times by industry groups and their allies, but courts consistently upheld the EPA’s finding as “unambiguously correct.” Now, the Trump administration is moving to overturn years of precedent in just a few months.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said the EPA’s decision was the result of infiltration by the fossil fuel industry. Whitehouse described how the parasitoid wasp injects other bugs with its larva, which then controls the victim insect from the inside. “The Trump EPA is the bug and the fossil fuel larvae are in there, driving all of its decisions,” Whitehouse said.

Whitehouse announced an investigation Tuesday into whether the EPA’s decision had been shaped by industry groups. “I am concerned about the role that fossil fuel companies, certain manufacturers, trade associations, polluter-backed groups and others with much to benefit from the repeal of the endangerment finding … played in drafting, preparing, promoting, and lobbying on the proposal,” Whitehouse wrote in a formal request for documents from 24 companies and organizations.

Zeldin announced the plan to rescind the Endangerment Finding on July 29, promising to “end $1 trillion or more in hidden taxes on American businesses and families.” If successful, the move could repeal all emissions standards for vehicles and end the reporting programs that track emissions data.

The announcement provoked immediate and significant public backlash.

During the first day of public hearings on the EPA’s proposal, Inside Climate News counted only 10 people who testified in support out of roughly 200 speakers. The overwhelming majority expressed deep concern over the decision’s potential consequences to human health, environment and industry.

The EPA extended the deadline for public input until Sept. 22, and the agency’s docket has now drawn more than 100,000 comments. Federal law requires that the EPA respond to significant comments before issuing any rule and incorporate the substance of those comments into the final regulation.

If the public fails to shift the EPA’s course, litigation will become inevitable, according to Kathleen Rogers, president of environmental advocacy group EarthDay.org. “If the endangerment finding is overturned, all the environmental groups will come together in bringing a case against the EPA,” Rogers, a former judicial clerk, told ICN. “It’ll go to the Supreme Court either way.” The National Academies report undoubtedly will be used as evidence in the legal challenges.

Rogers said the EPA would ultimately be asking the Supreme Court to overturn its own precedent. However, Rogers said it was “concerning” that three of the justices who, in 2007, wrote dissenting opinions in Massachusetts v. EPA—Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito—are still on the court today. “The Supreme Court ruling against itself isn’t that unprecedented anymore,” Rogers said. “Presidential power has become everything.”

“If the endangerment finding is overturned, all the environmental groups will come together in bringing a case against the EPA.” Rogers, a former judicial clerk,

The Trump administration based its justification for dismantling the endangerment finding on a U.S. Department of Energy report that downplayed the danger of climate change and argued that mitigating its effects could be more harmful than helpful. The report, which was widely discredited and dismissed by the scientific community—was penned by the administration’s since-disbanded Climate Working Group, composed of five prominent skeptics of the scientific consensus on climate change.

The Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists filed a lawsuit accusing the Climate Working Group of violating the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which mandates transparency and balanced consideration from such bodies. President Trump insisted the group was exempt from those rules, but on Wednesday, a federal court rejected that argument.

“This Court rules that the Climate Working Group was not assembled to ‘exchange facts or information’ in a manner that would bring it into the claimed exception,” the order read, opening the path for the legal challenge to advance.

Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) highlighted Wednesday how long environmental regulation had enjoyed bipartisan support. “I’m here to praise Richard Nixon for creating the EPA and the Clean Air Act. I’m here to praise Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, whose leadership recognized that global pollution demands global solutions,” Casten said, adding that Zeldin had a duty to administer the policies established by the courts and Congress.

“If he doesn’t do that, he’s breaking the law. He’s breaking his oath, and he is putting every one of us in jeopardy,” Casten added.

Reese Wilkerson, a 15-year-old from Maryland, was among the last to speak before the group of children and advocates left to visit the EPA, where they delivered hundreds of letters, from people across the country, opposing the agency’s regulatory rollback. “To every adult listening today, who cares about children now and who cares about our lives in the future, we are asking you to please protect the endangerment finding—and our future.”

Even if they won’t help bridge the expected EV sales gap, cheaper models from Slate and Ford could help spur adoption after federal incentives disappear.","A decade ago, someone in the market for a new car with less than $25,000 to spend, had 43 different models to choose from. Today, there are five, according to Cox Automotive. Not one is electric.

But stalwarts like Ford Motor Co. and startups like Slate Auto are looking to change that, and they’re focusing on Americans’ favorite vehicle: the pickup.

With President Trump’s tax bill killing EV incentives at the end of the month, the push for a sub-$30,000 vehicle that runs on electrons may help buttress the projected dip in sales.

The average price of a new car in the U.S. hovers at $49,100, nearly a third higher than it was in summer 2019. The average EV price is higher still, $8,000 above that of the industry at-large, according to Cox Automotive.

Much of the recent auto inflation can be tied to options and add-ons. During the peak of the pandemic-related supply chain crunch, auto executives had trouble getting enough parts, so they put what little they could find into more expensive, lavish vehicles. In many ways, they never looked back.

Last year, the average car sold for one-third more than the average starting price. Most buyers either didn’t want bare-bones base models or couldn’t find them.

But some EV makers see a change ahead. At Slate’s launch event, Chief Executive Officer Chris Barman delivered what has since become a bit of a stump speech for cheap EVs.

“The definition of what’s affordable is broken,” she said.

A blank Slate

Every year, AutoPacific, an industry consultancy, asks car shoppers what features they need. For those looking to spend under $35,000, the list is short. Generally, budget-conscious drivers are willing to splurge for safety features and apathetic when it comes to leather seats, head-up displays and advanced driver-assistance systems.

None of this is lost on Slate. The company’s truck, which it plans to deliver late next year, is to a Ford F-150 what an Ikea futon is to a Pottery Barn sectional. The base version — the company calls it “the blank Slate” — is best described by what it isn’t. It lacks a touchscreen, ambient lighting, cooled seats, air conditioning, all-wheel drive, a stereo and virtually any kind of driver-assistance.

“You could say we took out everything that wasn’t a car,” Barman said at the launch event.

What Slate promises in return is a sticker price in the mid-$20,000s, before any incentives. By Slate’s reckoning, the market is sizable. In America, we love our trucks, but only about one-third of U.S. truck owners tow regularly. We love our road trips, but on average only drive about 30 miles a day.

While roughly 163,000 Americans buy small pickups in a typical year, the potential market for Slate’s EV expands when considering the 4.3 million people who buy a small SUV or the 1.2 million or so who drive off in a compact or subcompact car.

Would-be buyers can also purchase add-ons including speakers, a spare tire, or a kit that converts the truck to an SUV. Buyers can also add accessories in the years after their initial purchase, creating what the company hopes will be a long-tail revenue source.

Detroit reacts

Still, AutoPacific Chief Analyst Ed Kim sees Slate challenged on two fronts. Those considering the startup’s entry-level configuration may instead spring for a used truck that will offer far more features and niceties for the same price. And those considering a higher-end Slate may instead spend their money on a new machine from an established carmaker — say, the Ford Maverick, a pickup that starts around $27,000.

Ford, which dominates the market for full-size pickups, announced plans in August to make a mid-size electric truck that will sell for about $30,000, as well as a battery-powered SUV that will start below $40,000.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said the company was making a “tremendous pivot” to more affordable EVs. “This is a Model T moment for the company,” he told analysts, invoking a car whose price point put Ford on the map and made automobiles ubiquitous in America.

Toyota Motor Corp., whose Tacoma has long outsold every mid-size pickup on the market, is eyeing the tiny-truck market as well. The current Tacoma starts just shy of $32,000; if the company rolls out a smaller rig for less money, it will add yet another option for budget-conscious buyers.

Most Americans say they’re EV inclined. While battery-powered cars account for only about 1 in 10 new cars sales, almost 60% of shoppers say they are “very” or “somewhat” likely to buy an electric vehicle, according to JD Power.

Price is one of the obstacles, a speed bump the Trump administration made bigger when the president signed a tax law that will eliminate federal incentives for battery-powered cars and trucks. Without up to $7,500 purchase tax credits, EVs are expected to be just 27% of the market in 2030, down from nearly half had the incentives stayed in place, according to BloombergNEF’s projections.

Still, BNEF expects electric cars to be as cheap or cheaper than gas versions by around 2028. Even if they won’t help bridge the expected EV sales gap, cheaper models from Slate and Ford could help spur adoption after federal incentives disappear.

Derek Dufon, a 48-year-old architect in Iowa, put down a $50 deposit on a Slate hours after its reveal. Dufon doesn’t need much in the way of luxuries, just space to haul drawings and building materials to job sites and programmable air conditioning for Henry, his boxer-hound mutt.

“It would be great for work,” Dufon says of the truck. “And I’ve got an old house, so there’s always a project going on with that.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c7d890b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb4%2F96%2Fb5ba57a064e4344954e2034f6a48%2F1x-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 17:02:04.808511

Wireless Power Transmission Systems

In recent years, wireless power transmission technologies for devices such as smartphones, wearable devices, drones, and electric vehicles, which can supply electricity without using cables, have garnered increasing attention. There are two types of wireless power transmission systems: one uses microwaves and the other uses laser beams. Microwave wireless power transmission is already in practical use and its use is expanding. On the other hand, optical wireless power transmission using laser beams has not been put into practical use, but it is expected to realize compact long-distance wireless power transmission on the order of kilometers by taking advantage of the high directivity of laser beam technology.

Future prospects envision the development of next-generation infrastructure capable of supplying power and expanding communication coverage in situations and regions where electricity or communication networks are unavailable, such as during disasters, on remote islands, mountainous areas, or at sea. This includes delivering power precisely to specific areas or moving platforms such as drones. Achieving such highly accurate and long-distance power delivery requires laser-based wireless power transmission that takes advantage of its strong directionality.

Existing Technology Challenges and Achievements of This Experiment

The efficiency of optical wireless power transmission technology is generally low, and improvement of efficiency is an issue for practical use. One of the reasons for this is that when a long-distance laser beam propagates, especially in the atmosphere, the intensity distribution becomes uneven, and the efficiency of converting the laser beam into electric power in the photoelectric conversion element becomes low.

In this experiment, researchers combined NTT’s beam-shaping technology with MHI’s light-receiving technology to improve the efficiency of laser wireless power transmission. The team conducted a long-distance optical wireless power transmission experiment in an outdoor environment using long-distance flat beam shaping technology that shaped the beam at the transmission side to achieve uniform beam intensity after one kilometer propagation, and output current leveling technology that suppresses the influence of atmospheric fluctuations with a homogenizer and leveling circuits on the receiving side.

From January to February 2025, MHI conducted an optical wireless power transmission experiment on a runway at the Nanki-Shirahama Airport in Shirahama Town, Nishimuro District, Wakayama Prefecture (Figure 2). A transmission booth equipped with an optical system for emitting the laser beam was installed at one end of the runway, and a reception booth containing a light-receiving panel was placed one kilometer away.

During transmission, the optical axis of the laser was set at a low height of approximately one meter above the ground and aligned horizontally. As a result, the beam was strongly affected by ground heating and wind, and the experiment was conducted under conditions with strong atmospheric turbulence.

Inside the transmission booth, a laser beam with an optical power of 1,035 W was generated. Using a diffractive optical element (DOE), the beam was shaped to create a uniform intensity distribution at a distance of one kilometer. In addition, a beam steering mirror was used to precisely direct the shaped beam toward the receiving panel. The beam exited through the aperture of the transmission booth and propagated across one kilometer of open space, ultimately reaching the reception booth.

During propagation, atmospheric turbulence caused fluctuations in the beam’s intensity, creating hot spots. These were diffused by a homogenizer in the reception booth, resulting in a uniform beam being irradiated onto the receiving panel. The laser beam was then efficiently converted into electrical power (Figure 3). A silicon-based photoelectric conversion element was adopted for the receiving panel, taking into account both cost and availability.

In this experiment, the average electrical power extracted from the receiving panel was 152 W (Figure 4), corresponding to a wireless power transmission efficiency of 15%, defined as the ratio of received electrical power to transmitted optical power. This result marks the world’s highest optical wireless power transmission efficiency ever demonstrated using a silicon-based photoelectric conversion element under conditions of strong atmospheric turbulence. Furthermore, continuous power delivery was successfully maintained for 30 minutes, confirming the feasibility of long-duration power transmission using this technology.

From a safety perspective, the optical transmission system and the receiving panel were each installed inside booths to prevent accidental exposure to high-power laser beams and the scattering of reflected light.

Technical Highlights

Long-Distance Flat Beam Shaping Technology. To improve photoelectric conversion efficiency, it is necessary to make the intensity distribution of the beam incident on the photoelectric conversion element uniform. In this study, MHI proposed a beam shaping method that enables intensity uniformity after long-distance propagation. In this approach, the outer part of the beam is transformed into a ring-shaped pattern using the effect of an axicon lens. The central part of the beam is phase-modulated to expand through the effect of a concave lens. As the beam propagates, the ring-shaped beam and the expanded central beam gradually overlap, resulting in a uniform intensity distribution at the target location, as shown in Figure 5.

For the experiment, MHI optimized the beam design to achieve the desired intensity profile at a distance of one kilometer. The beam shaping was implemented using a diffractive optical element, which improved the uniformity of the beam intensity at the target position located one kilometer away.

Output Current Leveling Technology. As the laser beam propagates through the atmosphere, it is affected by atmospheric turbulence, which disturbs the intensity distribution. Although the flat-beam shaping technique described above can make the intensity distribution more uniform, strong turbulence can still cause the formation of high-intensity spots, as shown in Figure 6.

To address this issue, MHI placed a beam homogenizer in front of the light-receiving panel. The homogenizer diffused high-intensity spots so that the beam was uniformly irradiated onto the panel. In addition, leveling circuits were connected to each photoelectric conversion element on the receiving panel. These circuits helped suppress fluctuations in output current caused by atmospheric turbulence and contributed to a more stabilize overall power output.

These two technologies make it possible to achieve beam uniformity in kilometer-order transmission, which was difficult with conventional beam shaping methods, and to stabilize output in outdoor environments. As a result, stable power supply to remote locations such as isolated islands and disaster-affected areas is expected to become feasible.

Company Roles and the Path Forward

NTT focused on the design and implementation of transmission optics such as beam-shaping techniques. Meanwhile, MHI managed the design and implementation of photodetector optics such as photodetector panels, homogenizers, and leveling circuits.

This technology enables the efficient and stable transmission of energy over long distances even under atmospheric turbulence. In this experiment, silicon was used as the photovoltaic conversion element. However, by employing photovoltaic devices specifically designed to match the wavelength of the laser light, even higher power transfer efficiency can be expected. In addition, the use of laser light sources with higher output power would make it possible to supply larger amounts of electricity.

As a result, flexible and rapid power delivery can be achieved in remote areas such as disaster-stricken regions and remote islands, where the installation of power cables has traditionally been difficult. Beyond terrestrial applications, a wide range of new use cases can also be envisioned based on this technology (Figure 7). Notably, the high directivity and low divergence of laser beams allow for the design of compact and lightweight receiving devices. This is a major advantage for mobile platforms that face strict limitations in weight and payload capacity.

For example, by combining this technology with beam steering techniques, it becomes possible to deliver power wirelessly to drones in flight. This avoids operational constraints such as landing for battery replacement or the use of tethered power supply cables, enabling long-duration and long-distance continuous operation. Such capabilities can enhance disaster-area monitoring as well as wide-area communication relay in mountainous or maritime regions, applications that were previously difficult to realize.

In addition, potential applications in space are anticipated, including power delivery to mobile platforms such as HAPS (High-Altitude Platform Station), which falls within the scope of NTT’s space brand, NTT C89. Looking further ahead, the technology could be applied to power space data centers and lunar rovers, as well as to space solar power systems in which electricity is transmitted from geostationary satellites to the ground via laser. These applications represent areas with strong potential for market expansion.

Through the collaboration between NTT and MHI, the companies have realized the world’s most efficient laser wireless power transfer technology under conditions strongly affected by atmospheric fluctuations. This achievement represents a significant step toward building an innovative technological foundation that can meet a wide range of societal needs, from disaster response to space development.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fig7-use-cases-laser-power-transmission.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 18:04:34.213037

Tony Evers and Milwaukee County Executive and governor candidate David Crowley about the benefits.

But many of the usually benefits of a business entering the state – property taxes, sales tax and employment – have already been conceded by the state while questions remain about the impact of energy and water use at the facilities.

It’s why groups like Good Jobs First examine the deals surrounding data centers and provide the public with information about the deals and tax breaks, showing how these deals differ from what other businesses in Wisconsin receive.

“There are probably not a lot of benefits,” Good Jobs First Senior Research Analyst Kasia Tarczynska said. “On the tax side, if there’s any benefit it’s really difficult to know because there is so little transparency on the subsidies for these projects.”

There are six large-scale data center projects in progress in the state after Microsoft’s announcement and the state began the tax incentives for the projects in its last budget, exempting any sales tax on electricity or construction materials at any qualified data center including the water cooling systems and computing equipment. That means that much of the $4 billion Microsoft will spend on the facility will go untaxed along with the major costs of operating the data center once it is fully operational.

Tarczynska points to the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. website, where there isn’t information on the value of those tax incentives available. Many states estimated up front the value of waving taxes on electricity but have found that the actual amount of electricity used has far surpassed any expectations as more projects have appeared and the energy required by the data centers has multiplied.

Minnesota, for instance, reinstated its sales tax on electricity at data centers in June while sales tax on equipment at the data centers was extended for up to 35 years.

“A lot of tax revenue is not materializing because things are thrown back to the company,” Tarczynska said. “And, on top of that, the problem is that data centers don’t create a lot of jobs. They create very few jobs and a lot of those jobs go to residents who live outside of a community.”

Construction jobs are needed when the facility is being built but, afterward, there are a few high-level analyst and electrician jobs but also lower pay security, maintenance and technician jobs.

The two Wisconsin data centers that have disclosed their electrical needs, Microsoft’s first data center in Mount Pleasant and the Vantage data center in Port Washington, will require a combined 3.9 gigawatts of power, enough to power 4.3 million Wisconsin homes, according to data from Clean Wisconsin. Wisconsin has only 2.8 million housing units.

“Because only two of the data center projects have disclosed their power needs, we know this is really just a fraction of what the energy use would be if all those data centers are ultimately built,” Clean Wisconsin Science Program Director Paul Mathewson wrote in the analysis.

That untaxed electricity usage is a concern with energy availability and consumer electricity prices an increased concern in coming years.

Data centers are expected to lead to the average American’s energy bill increasing from 25% to 70% in the next 10 years without intervention from policymakers, according to Washington, D.C.-based think tank the Jack Kemp Foundation.

https://www.thecentersquare.com/virginia/article_368b645e-a86e-11ef-8825-772ecfdea4b2.html

The first Microsoft data center on the former Foxconn site in Mount Pleasant is in a tax increment district, meaning the additional property taxes that would have been collected by local government from the project will instead be kept in the district for Microsoft’s use.

Wisconsin state lawmakers have approved exceptions for two large data centers in Port Washington and Beaver Dam to the state’s 12% rule related to tax increment financing districts capping the amount of property in a municipality that can be in a tax increment district.

Having a data center in a TID means that the company isn’t paying new property tax into the local community to fund things like roads, police, fire and schools.

Historic reforms will save Californians billions and cut dangerous pollution

Here’s how the package will impact Californians:

💵 Saving Californians billions of dollars and making energy more affordable.

Together, these policies will save Californians billions of dollars on energy costs and bring down customer electric bills.

The legislation provides the biggest boost to the California Climate Credit ever – which already saves millions of California families more than $100 every year on their utility bills.

Accelerates critical clean energy projects by making them easier and cheaper to build while also further integrating the use of clean energy throughout the broader West – creating more energy supply, improving grid reliability and driving down costs.

By stabilizing the state’s gasoline market, Californians will continue avoiding billions of dollars in price spikes at the pump.

⛽️ Stabilizing California’s gasoline supply to prevent price spikes.

Provides a path for a targeted, locally-led, environmentally responsible and safe increase in oil production in Kern County to boost overall fuel supplies in the state.

Protects the state’s ongoing transition away from fossil fuels by maintaining a more affordable, reliable and safe supply of fuels that is often subject to increasing volatility.

Continues the state’s commitment of ensuring the safety of existing oil pipelines and related facilities both onshore and offshore.

Encourages the state’s oil refiners to continue safe operations and further stabilize the market.

🌎 Cutting pollution and creating jobs.

Extending Cap-and-Invest, formerly known as Cap-and-Trade, to 2045 continues California’s world-leading efforts to cut climate pollution and transition to the clean economy of the future.

Doubles down on investing billions of dollars in projects that are cleaning the air in communities most impacted by toxic pollution, delivering clean water and investing in clean transportation options for Californians.

Makes high-speed rail a reality by providing its first-ever stable source of funding, which resolves all funding gaps for the early operating segment in the Central Valley.

🔥 Protecting Californians from catastrophic wildfire.

Creates the next generation of the California Wildfire Fund to support wildfire survivors and protect ratepayers from excessive utility liability costs

Holds private electric utilities accountable by requiring billions in investments to modernize and harden the grid at the expense of shareholders, only.

Earlier this week, the Governor approved the first allocation of $3.3 billion from Proposition 4, which was overwhelmingly passed by voters last year. The funding is going to firefighting and wildfire prevention, clean water and agriculture projects.

California’s climate leadership

Pollution is down and the economy is up. Greenhouse gas emissions in California are down 20% since 2000 – even as the state’s GDP increased 78% in that same time period.

The state also continues to set clean energy records. California was powered by two-thirds clean energy in 2023, the latest year for which data is available – the largest economy in the world to achieve this level of clean energy. The state has run on 100% clean electricity for some part of the day almost every day this year.

Since the beginning of the Newsom Administration, battery storage is up to over 15,000 megawatts – a 1,900%+ increase, and over 25,000 megawatts of new resources have been added to the electric grid.

Recently, it also proposed to rescind a 2009 declaration that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health.
This would make it harder for citizens to keep track of how much local refineries are releasing greenhouse gases, which are the biggest drivers of climate change.
That’s absolutely critical when it comes to health,” said Lorene Allio, a member of the environmental justice group Fresh Air Vallejo.
The California Air Resources Board has a pollution mapping tool that residents can use to continue to track pollution.","VALLEJO – Last Friday, the Trump Administration announced that the Environmental Protection Agency was looking to permanently end a nationwide program that required refineries to report greenhouse gases emissions.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the program as harmful and expensive, and claimed that cutting it would save businesses billions in regulatory compliance. This is the latest in a series of environmental rollbacks from the administration. Recently, it also proposed to rescind a 2009 declaration that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health.

“It's a big step backward,” said Bill Magavern, the policy director of the Coalition for Clean Air, a nonprofit focused on air quality and climate change in California. “Reporting should be the bare minimum of what we're doing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and that was agreed on a generation ago.”

The program was first established in 2009 and has long had bipartisan support. If the plan is finalized, more than 8,000 facilities across the country will no longer have any federal requirements to report how much they’re polluting. This would make it harder for citizens to keep track of how much local refineries are releasing greenhouse gases, which are the biggest drivers of climate change.

“If you don't have the data to say it's happening, how are you going to prove that it's happening? That’s absolutely critical when it comes to health,” said Lorene Allio, a member of the environmental justice group Fresh Air Vallejo. “Communities around the country won't necessarily be able to show how they're harmed, even if they are showing up at the hospital.”

Greenhouse gases are a major contributor to higher rates of asthma. Solano County has the highest rate of asthma emergency room visits in the Bay Area and the third highest in the state, according to the California Department of Public Health.

Currently, the EPA’s emission data is still on its website. The data shows that in 2023 in California, the Los Angeles Refinery was the biggest polluter in the state, emitting over 6 million metric tons of greenhouse gases. But in second place was the Chevron refinery in Richmond, emitting 4.3 million metric tons. In fourth and fifth places were Benicia’s Valero refinery and the Martinez refinery, emitting 2.9 and 2.3 metric tons, respectively.

There are a total of 21 sites — including refineries, power plants, and landfills — in Solano County and Contra Costa that reported their greenhouse gas emissions to the EPA in 2023.

A 2023 study found that having a reporting program in place prompted facilities across the country to reduce their emissions by over 7%.

But even though this program may be ending at the federal level, Magavern said that California is better positioned to weather this change compared to other states. The California Air Resources Board has a pollution mapping tool that residents can use to continue to track pollution. And it has “a full fledged climate program,” said Magavern. “It does require the large emitters of greenhouse gases to report, and more importantly, to reduce their emissions.”

This program is called cap-and-invest (formerly known as cap-and-trade) and Gov. Gavin Newsom extended it until 2045 on Friday.

In the Vallejo area, there are also local organizations like the Benicia Air Monitoring Group, which has set up their own monitors to keep track of the emissions around the Benicia Valero refinery.

“It’s a continuous monitoring system. The monitors run 24/7, and it's on the website immediately,” said Kathy Kerridge, a board member with the Benicia Air Monitoring Group. “It's publicly available information.”

Meanwhile in Vallejo, Allio said that announcements like these have only motivated their organization to take more action and push for more environmental justice policies at a state and local level.

“Data is part of democracy,” said Allio. “When you take away people's right to have information, to talk about information, to share information, it's a big problem.”",https://www.vallejosun.com/content/images/size/w1200/2025/09/Valero-benicia-refinery-stack-fire-05-05-2025.jpeg,N,,2025-09-19 17:01:55.463669

Gavin Newsom now admits that “We are all the beneficiaries of oil and gas,” under severe pressure to avert a full-blown energy crisis.
At the tail end of the legislative session on Sept. 10, legislators and the governor reached an agreement to increase in-state crude oil production.
That’s more pollution, less transparency, less leverage for the U.S. — and yes, higher prices at the pump.","Time matters, and California is running out of it. Lawmakers in Sacramento must act to address the state’s fuel and affordability crises.

Since 2001, California gas prices have increased 162%. Today, we pay about 43% more than the national average, and that figure would likely be far higher if not for record-high domestic oil production.

That tailwind unfortunately won’t last. While crude oil prices have fallen 19% since January, California costs and taxes have increased, now accounting for approximately 26% of the retail price of gasoline. And with the highest state excise tax per gallon in the nation, California makes several times more than a typical retailer for the same gallon of gas sold.

Platitudes and rhetoric aside, the truth is California is staring at a near-term gasoline shortfall, driven largely by the pending closure of two refineries, the highest operating costs in the nation and decades of falling in-state production. What these fuel supply challenges have not resulted in is a gigantic drop in demand. This has and will continue to lead to a greater dependence on foreign fuel, greater emissions, increased exposure to global volatility, and ultimately an increase in the price Californians pay for the fuel that powers the world’s fourth-largest economy.

We face a choice: On one side, the status quo assumes California’s economy can run without petroleum any time soon. On the other is a growing recognition that affordable energy is essential to economic stability and national security.

After spending years demonizing the oil and gas industry and accusing California’s refiners of ripping off consumers, Gov. Gavin Newsom now admits that “We are all the beneficiaries of oil and gas,” under severe pressure to avert a full-blown energy crisis. At the tail end of the legislative session on Sept. 10, legislators and the governor reached an agreement to increase in-state crude oil production.

If we care about our climate goals, we must also care about where our gasoline comes from. In 1982, California imported around 6% of its oil needs from foreign sources; today, the Golden State imports around 64% from various petrostates. Shipping finished fuel thousands of miles can mean crude sourced from regimes with higher emissions and weaker oversight than California.

That’s more pollution, less transparency, less leverage for the U.S. — and yes, higher prices at the pump.

None of this is necessary, and most of this is self-created. California has one of the most underused oil reserves in the nation and some of the most advanced technologies, best-trained workforces and safest producers in the world. The Newsom administration’s recent moves to ease the bureaucratic red tape and permitting challenges that have forced us to import two-thirds of all our crude quietly admits as much.

We should use the resources we have today while we continue to build the clean energy system of tomorrow.

We also need to dial back the regulatory cost stack. On July 1, the state raised the gas excise tax and updated the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, the state’s greenhouse gas reduction program. Layer on infrastructure costs, amortization, new storage mandates, refinery retrofits for changing crude blends and the lagging effects of the LCFS credit. If we care about affordability, let’s price it honestly and show the math.

Finally, equity must be both fiscally and morally sound. California’s gas tax — roughly 61 cents per gallon — pays for the roads we all use. Meanwhile, electric vehicle drivers don’t pay the tax but still use the same infrastructure. As EV adoption grows, the revenue gap widens. In a state that prides itself on equity, a fair solution is to stop subsidizing EV owners on the shoulders of other drivers and adopt a more equitable mileage-based road fee for EVs that accounts for miles driven and vehicle weight, which better reflects road wear.

Newsom’s long-overdue acknowledgement of a pending gasoline and price crisis — together with the Legislature’s last-minute actions — are a start but also a piecemeal approach to addressing a critical problem.

As a next step, the Legislature should consider the repeal of regulations limiting production and pipeline use in more counties, assess the powers of agency bureaucrats who force higher prices on the backs of Californians, and a new regulatory strategy that will provide a more hospitable business environment for refiners and producers.

That ultimately means greater fuel and price security for California consumers.

The bills collectively “double down on the Trump administration's commitment to raising American electricity prices by discriminating against clean, cheap energy,” said Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), ranking member on the House energy and commerce committee.","Through mostly partisan votes, lawmakers in the House of Representatives advanced legislation Sept. 18 that proponents say will accelerate some energy-related projects, but some Democrats warn will raise energy prices.

The Promoting Cross-border Energy Infrastructure Act has a goal to make the process to authorize construction of international border-crossing facilities for import and export of oil and natural gas, and the transmission of electricity, “more uniform, transparent and modern.”

It would require anyone planning to build such a facility to obtain a certificate of crossing from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the U.S. Dept. of Energy for electric transmission facilities. The agencies would have 120 days to issue a certificate or deny an application if not in the public interest, or just 30 days for natural gas facilities on the Mexican or Canadian borders.

The bill includes an exemption for any projects with a presidential permit.

Rep. Julie Fedorchak (R-N.D.), who sponsored the bill, said in a statement that it would address regulatory uncertainty that has grown under the current process, which involves a mix of permits, different agencies’ procedures and executive discretion. She pointed to then-President Joe Biden’s decision to revoke the Keystone XL pipeline permit on the first day of his term in 2021.

“By passing my legislation, the House has taken a critical step to end years of regulatory uncertainty and partisan games that have delayed energy infrastructure projects, crushed good-paying jobs and undermined America’s energy security,” Fedorchak said.

Power sector groups have supported the legislation. Marco Giamberardino, senior vice president of public and government affairs at the National Electrical Contractors Association, said in a statement that the bill “enables more timely project delivery and ensures stable workloads for NECA contractors nationwide.”

Another bill, the Guaranteeing Reliability through the Interconnection of Dispatchable Power Act, or GRID Power Act, would assist power plant developers to fast-track project reviews. It directs the commission to initiate rulemaking “to address inefficiencies and ineffectiveness of existing procedures” in processing interconnection requests. Transmission providers could submit proposals for the commission to adjust its interconnection queue to prioritize dispatchable power plants.

Providers would need to demonstrate the need for a given project’s prioritization and describe how it would improve grid reliability and resilience. FERC would have 60 days to review and approve or deny a proposal.

Wait times for power projects on the interconnection queue have increased to as long as five years, according to Rep. Troy Balderson (R-Ohio), who sponsored the bill. He blamed projects supported by green energy tax credits for the longer wait times and highlighted the growing demand for facilities to power AI data centers.

“With American power demand far outpacing our ability to generate more electricity, our grid is heading toward a reliability crisis,” Balderson said in a statement. “The interconnection queue is overwhelmed and bogged down, leaving shovel-ready power projects waiting for years while demand continues to climb.”

A third bill advanced Sept. 18 reestablishes the National Coal Council, which shut down in the Energy Dept. when its charter expired in 2021. Per the charter, the council’s 120-150 members meet twice a year to advise the Energy secretary on coal policy matters, and are appointed by the secretary for terms of up to two years.

The bills collectively “double down on the Trump administration's commitment to raising American electricity prices by discriminating against clean, cheap energy,” said Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), ranking member on the House energy and commerce committee. “They prove that Republicans have never been for an all-of-the-above energy strategy, and they don’t care about fixing the insanely high cost of living that is crushing families across this country right now.”

The state has only to reach its remaining 20,480 eligible homes and businesses, the state said, because of successful investments under American Rescue Plan Act money contributing to a relatively rapid reduction in unserved and underserved locations.

Of the $551 million originally available under BEAD grants, South Carolina is aiming to spend just $41.3 million, or 7.49 percent.

New York also released its tentative grant winners under the $42.45 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment program this week, bringing the total to 43 states.

Meanwhile, a non-profit group called the Community Broadband Action Network confirmed the Commerce Department was moving ahead with plans to further drive down state spending before approving those draft proposals and allowing funds out the door.

South Carolina locations split between fiber and satellite

South Carolina locations would be roughly split between satellite and fiber, with 48.7 percent to be served by low-earth orbit satellite and 47.85 percent slated for fiber. The small number of remaining homes and businesses would get cable.

Amazon’s nascent Kuiper Systems would cover most of the satellite locations, about 8,900 to SpaceX’s 1,000. ZiTEL and TruVista would take the majority of the wireline locations, with AT&T, Charter, and Comcast serving several hundred each in addition to small projects from other local companies.

“Today’s release of the SC BEAD Final Proposal provides our plan for the anchor leg of the broadband investment relay race here in South Carolina,” Jim Stritzinger, director of the South Carolina Broadband Office, said in a statement.

“With an extraordinary team, in just over three years, we completed four ARPA investment rounds representing $400 million, and $41.3 million in BEAD, to 22 ISPs. From SCBBO inception (July 2021), combined federal, state, and private investments resulted in service to over 200,000 locations. Additionally, nearly 99 percent of these recently constructed locations now have access to fiber – or will soon!”

New York big on terrestrial fixed wireless

In New York, terrestrial fixed wireless would serve the largest portion of the state’s 53,918 BEAD locations, something not seen in any other state to have reported results so far, at about 44 percent. Fiber would take 30.72 percent and satellite, provided by SpaceX, would take 25.25 percent.

“Every community in New York State deserves to have access to the internet and it is time we uplift our underserved communities, providing them with more opportunities and resources,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) said in a statement.

The states will take public comments on their plans for one week before submitting them to Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration for approval.

A hidden NTIA cap on BEAD?

The awards are tentative and might be altered by NTIA before being finally approved. Last week, after apparent NTIA cost thresholds and an apparent internal memo leaked to broadband marketing executive Doug Adams, people involved in the process told Broadband Breakfast NTIA was seeking to have states negotiate down or potentially award to another provider grant awards that came above those cost caps.

CBAN’s executive director Curtis Dean said that a member company in Iowa had received notice from the broadband office there that some of its project costs had been deemed excessive and would have to be corrected within 72 hours, or within 3 days.

“Applicants can reduce costs by cutting expenses or increasing matching funds” or “provide extraordinary circumstances justifications,” Dean said. “The email explains that failure to respond by the deadline will result in locations being awarded to other applicants.”

Two people familiar with the matter said a similar process was underway in multiple other states. One said NTIA was also looking for states to further trim their lists of community anchor institutions, which are in line for fiber once a state’s eligible homes and businesses are taken care of.

ISPs bid on geographic units called project areas, the structure of which differ in each state, and many tentative BEAD projects encompassing several project areas.

The cost thresholds Dean outlined line up with the spreadsheet posted by Adams.

Question about non-deployment funds

It’s not clear what will happen to states’ BEAD money that isn’t used on broadband deployment projects. The 43 states to have reported results would have more than $16 billion in such “non-deployment” funding.

States were planning to use that left over money on things like broadband adoption and workforce development efforts, but the Trump administration isn’t eager to see much non-deployment spending.

,Clean Energy ,2025-09-19 18:45:58+00:00,The Breakthrough Institute,Quiet Climate Policy Is Dead. Long Live All-of-the-Above Energy… - The Breakthrough Institute,"Ted Nordhaus, Alex Trembath",,,,,https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/quiet-climate-policy-is-dead-long-live-all-of-the-above-energy-policy,"Even as pitched partisan battles over climate science, carbon regulation, and the Paris Agreement intensified, quiet climate policy largely prevailed when it came to energy innovation and investment.
The decade-long effort to center climate in US energy policy is over.
Pitched political battles over electricity generation, moreover, don’t address the source of much of the increase in retail electricity prices.
For Democrats, environmentalists, and clean energy advocates, this represents a “who moved my cheese” moment, where not just talking points and arguments will need to change but the entire basis of clean energy advocacy.
Quiet climate policy is dead.","Last January, in the Wall Street Journal, we argued that efforts to preserve the whole of the Inflation Reduction Act were both bad policy and politically doomed. Republicans had run against the IRA and needed to cut trillions of dollars to finance the extension of tax cuts established during the first Trump administration. One way or another, they were going to take a pound of flesh and it behooved climate and clean energy advocates to get clear about what in the IRA was worth saving.

We also argued that there was plenty of fat to cut. The vast majority of IRA spending was flowing towards mature technologies—wind, solar, and electric vehicles—that were well established in electricity and automotive markets. Preserving IRA money for these technologies wouldn’t appreciably change their trajectory, or the trajectory of US carbon emissions, which have been falling at a consistent rate for decades.

Rather, the main obstacles to continuing growth of those technologies are not primarily their direct costs, which continue to fall, but a range of well understood challenges associated with integrating these very different technologies into the legacy electricity and transportation sectors—permitting, transmission, and intermittency in the former case, range and charging infrastructure in the latter.

This message was not well received by many climate and clean energy advocates. They believed that the Biden administration’s clever Green Vortex strategy, which overwhelmingly directed clean tech spending toward Republican districts, might insulate wind, solar, and EV tax credits politically and accused us of “negotiating with ourselves.” Forever subsidies for wind, solar, and electric vehicles, moreover, were necessary because the future of the climate hung in the balance.

In reality, we weren’t negotiating with ourselves. We’ve long argued that public subsidies should support early stage commercialization of clean energy technologies and should phase out as those technologies achieve traction in energy and transportation markets. The point of clean tech industrial policy should be to make clean energy cheap in real, unsubsidized terms, not to prop up uncompetitive technologies in perpetuity.

Nor did the fate of the climate, or even US emissions, hang in the balance. Groups like Energy Innovation and Princeton’s Net Zero America that had promoted the legislation produced modeling purporting to show dire consequences if Trump were elected and repealed the IRA. But well before Trump and Republican majorities gutted it, the IRA was underperforming its promised emissions benefits while costing far more than initially estimated. In reality, emissions over the short and medium term were always likely to converge toward the long-term historic US decarbonization rate with or without the IRA. What will matter over the longer term are nascent technologies necessary for further progress: long duration energy storage, advanced nuclear energy, geothermal, and industrial decarbonization.

As it happened, the final package broadly comported with our political analysis. A handful of EV, battery, and solar assembly factories in Republican districts were not going to sidetrack tax, fiscal, and energy policy priorities that were far more important to the Republican coalition. The key fights that were there to be won were to preserve policy support for nuclear, carbon capture, geothermal and other nascent technologies in the face of the opposition from the Freedom Caucus’ fiscal hawks, along with beating back a last minute effort to tax wind and solar energy production.

If it had stopped there, we’d be taking a victory lap today. High-priority programs to promote nuclear, geothermal, energy storage and similar were not only preserved but extended through 2035. The sunsetting of wind and solar subsidies gave Democrats strong incentives to work with Republicans on permitting reform. And there was substantial demand in Congress to develop domestic critical mineral supply chains, and provide sufficient support for the commercialization of next generation nuclear energy technologies.

In place of the Biden administration’s whole of government climate obsession, you could almost convince yourself that federal energy policy was swinging back toward the successful all of the above energy policies that held sway across both the Obama administration and the first Trump administration—to the benefit of both America’s economic performance and its impressive decarbonization over the last two decades.

But, of course, it hasn’t ended there. The Trump administration has now borrowed a page from the Biden playbook, answering Democrats’ punitive approach towards fossil fuel and mining projects by turning the formidable administrative powers of the executive branch against wind and solar energy development. That effort has not only endangered clean energy production that America needs to meet rising demand in the short term, but has also substantially reduced the likelihood that Congress will get very far in efforts to reform permitting and other outdated environmental laws that now stand in the way of energy development of all kinds.

Polarization Trumps Green Pork

The green vortex strategy was, in one sense, an effort to build a durable bipartisan political base for the clean energy economy. By directing enormous public funding for clean energy manufacturing and production toward Republican and right-leaning congressional districts, the idea was that the representatives of these districts would have strong political incentives to support clean energy policies and subsidies whether they were Democrats or Republicans and whichever party controlled Congress and the executive branch. And perhaps, had Kamala Harris squeaked out a victory last November, four more years of public investment in these programs would have proven that strategy out.

But it is also the case that most of these policies already had bipartisan support. A broad swath of Republican politicians had supported tax credits, loan guarantees, ARPA-E, and other policies to support clean energy, electric vehicles, and other clean tech going back to the last years of the George W. Bush administration, including through the first Trump administration. Even as pitched partisan battles over climate science, carbon regulation, and the Paris Agreement intensified, quiet climate policy largely prevailed when it came to energy innovation and investment. But the era of quiet climate policy, it seems, ended with the passage of the IRA, or more precisely, with the fateful determination to enact those policies through a maximalist and entirely partisan budget reconciliation process in the name of historic climate action.

The bet by the Biden administration was that it could use budget reconciliation in the same way that the Obama administration had used the parliamentary procedure to pass the Affordable Care Act. Give the public a valuable benefit and policy-makers would be loath to take it away. Meanwhile, through its implementation, the Administration would use the IRA to make sure that Republican congressional districts benefited from the spending in much the same way that the Pentagon distributed defense production (or pork) widely around the country to assure bipartisan support for defense spending.

But in contrast to the ACA, most households saw little benefit from the IRA. Electricity prices in most places continued to rise and most people remained unconvinced that electric vehicles were a viable option despite the generous subsidies. And while defense spending was broadly supported by both parties in the Cold War era, when the Pentagon built a durable political economy around the military industrial complex, passage of a massive spending package for clean energy on a straight party-line vote in the name of averting a climate apocalypse put a huge partisan target on the IRA and the clean tech economy.

In the age of Donald Trump and an era defined by negative polarization, the results were predictable. Climate polarization swallowed the formerly bipartisan commitments to energy innovation whole, ushering in the fate that we have long warned of: that catastrophism and polarization were a positive feedback loop, imperiling not just conventionally toxic climate policies like carbon taxes and regulations but pragmatic quiet climate policies as well, such as transmission investment, conventional pollution regulations, and energy innovation.

Live By the Electricity Price Sword, Die By the Electricity Price Sword?

In the face of the Trump administration’s full frontal assault on wind and solar, much of the clean energy and climate advocacy community has pivoted, warning today not of looming climate catastrophe but an electricity price apocalypse. For the first time in decades, electricity demand is growing rapidly. Electricity rates are rising around the country. Natural gas production has flatlined. And now, alongside the phase out of subsidies, the Trump administration aims to block the siting of wind and solar projects on public lands and federal waters.

There is a belief among many advocates that Trump and the Republican Party will die by the same electricity price sword that they used so effectively against Biden and the Democratic Party in the last election. The public will blame Trump’s vendetta against wind and solar for the price hike, swinging the mid-term elections to Democrats or, at least, forcing Trump to backtrack in the same way that Biden was forced to reverse course on his administration’s moratorium on oil and gas development on public lands.

This may come to pass. But there are also reasons for skepticism. First, Trump, to a much greater degree than Biden, inherited rising electricity prices. As with the broader issue of inflation, Biden had the bad fortune of taking office just as energy prices were rebounding after the Covid pandemic, a problem that was then made worse by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Biden’s various energy policies were not the main event in the run up of energy prices. But in the context of a lot of other things that were out of his control, policies that seemingly contributed to the problem were bound to get an outsized share of the blame.

Second, it is not yet clear that Trump’s moves against renewable energy will be as politically salient as Biden’s moves against oil and gas. Gasoline prices typically set the template for public perception of energy prices more broadly and Trump has been extremely proactive about encouraging Saudi Arabia and other global producers to increase production, even though this has disadvantaged US oil and gas production.

As a result, while electricity prices are rising, gasoline prices are not. So it is not at all clear either that higher electricity prices will stoke public concern about Trump’s energy policies absent an increase in gasoline prices or that the voters or the public will so easily be convinced to accept a connection between Trump' s assault on wind and solar and electricity prices as they were to accept that Biden’s early moves against fossil fuels were responsible for high gas prices specifically and rising energy prices more generally. Indeed, recent polling suggests that voters are more likely to blame corporations and state governments than the Trump Administration for rising electricity prices.

Finally, the narrative that Democrats and clean energy advocates have begun to tell, about the cancellation of wind and solar projects causing rising electricity prices, is complicated by the widespread perception that wind and solar are responsible for high electricity prices in California and other blue states. This claim is highly contested. Clean energy advocates point to trends in wholesale electricity prices, for instance, which don’t show a strong correlation with renewable energy penetration.

But whether high retail electricity prices are the result of the costs of transmission, distribution, and other measures necessary to integrate variable renewable generation into electrical grids, wildfires, or just the “blue state model” more broadly, the fact remains that many of the highest profile Democrat-run states, including New York, California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Massachusetts feature very high electricity prices. This problem is further exacerbated by what has, to date, been Exhibit A in the effort to blame Trump for high electricity prices, which is the repeal of IRA subsidies for wind and solar, which undermines the claim that these electricity sources are cheap, not expensive.

In short, while the Trump administration’s energy agenda may not prove a recipe for either energy abundance or energy dominance, it is not clear that Trump or Republicans will pay a particularly high political price for it, particularly given how polarized the politics of energy, not just climate, has become.

Electricity Prices Are Too Damn High

Beyond the dueling claims about who is responsible for high electricity prices, what is clear is that energy price, reliability, and security are now the coin of the realm. The decade-long effort to center climate in US energy policy is over.

Yet neither fossil energy-focused Republicans nor renewable energy-focused Democrats are likely to make much headway on electricity prices in the short term. US natural gas production was already at record levels in the last years of the Biden administration. Gas production is expected to tick up a bit more this year but won’t grow remotely fast enough to keep up with demand growth.

Wind and solar, meanwhile, were not coming to the rescue of electricity ratepayers even if Kamala Harris were president and the IRA had not been repealed. Solar generation was growing rapidly even before the passage of the IRA and most current projections foresee strong continuing growth despite the phaseout of subsidies. Wind energy deployment, by contrast, was already flagging, due to rising commodity prices and exorbitant costs for off-shore projects even before the Trump administration’s recent moves against off-shore wind and the repeal of the IRA’s subsidies. Had Harris won the 2024 election instead of Trump, electricity prices would be rising just as rapidly and Republicans would be blaming the IRA for today’s electricity prices, just as they were before the election.

Pitched political battles over electricity generation, moreover, don’t address the source of much of the increase in retail electricity prices. Rather, a substantial portion is associated with the cost of transmission and distribution, which in many places has been rising faster than the cost of wholesale electricity generation.

The costs of maintaining and expanding transmission and distribution owes to many factors, including grid hardening in the face of extreme weather and rising commodity prices, as well as the costs of integrating geographically diffuse intermittent electricity generators like wind and solar. But it is also in significant part an unintended consequence of the effort to restructure and liberalize electricity markets.

Electricity market liberalization has allowed for competitive electricity generation markets and has been good for both the natural gas and wind and solar industries. But it also, by design, pushed utilities out of the electricity generation business. As a result, most utilities around the country now make their money through transmission and distribution, where they still maintain their regulated monopoly status and are still granted a guaranteed profit on top of the cost of building and maintaining transmission and distribution infrastructure.

Unsurprisingly, this has incentivized utilities to build and upgrade a lot more transmission and distribution infrastructure, and those are the costs that in most of the country are rising fastest. Worse, the institutional capacity to plan and coordinate investment for affordability, reliability, and decarbonization has been deeply compromised by a utility landscape that was already highly decentralized, by the many Rube Golbergesque variations of electricity market liberalization, and by the transformation of federal and state energy policy into culture war objects.

Wicked Electricity

Last spring, Alex declared the era of the climate hawk over, noting that none of the conditions that had allowed climate advocates to believe that climate change could be established as a durable priority for US policymakers over the decade or so before the COVID pandemic any longer obtained. Post-Covid budget deficits, supply chain challenges, and inflation had brought an end to the low interest rates and expansionary fiscal policy that had underwritten public clean energy investments over the previous decade. The post-COVID recovery and huge new demand from data centers reversed a generation of slow energy demand growth, putting upward pressure on electricity prices and making policy tradeoffs between energy costs and clean energy and climate objectives even more toxic politically than they already were. Perhaps most importantly, the election of Donald Trump had put to rest the notion that inexorable demographic trends would allow for sustained Democratic majorities which would prioritize climate policy at the federal level.

This shift appears unlikely to be temporary. Democrats might take back the House or even the Senate in the midterm elections and perhaps they will retake the presidency in 2028. But high interest rates and budget deficits are likely to be with us for a long time. So are high electricity prices. Despite America’s remarkable innovation capacities and energy resource endowments, we do not have the right mix of technologies nor the institutional arrangements nor the political leadership to solve the electricity problem anytime soon.

This will create possibilities for some clean energy technologies. Higher prices and supply constraints are good news for anyone who can get so-called “clean firm” generation technologies commercialized, sited, and built at a competitive price, whether that is advanced nuclear, enhanced geothermal, natural gas with carbon removal, or solar with long-duration battery storage. But the balkanized utility landscape, liberalized electricity markets, and diversity of rent-seeking interests competing for a share of the electricity generation and distribution pie make neither more centralized and rationalized planning of the electricity system nor truly competitive and efficient market based solutions particularly feasible.

We have long written about the wicked nature of climate change, which suffers not merely from polarization but rampant solution-based problem definition, policy-based evidence making, and arbitrary boundary setting. “The expert is also the player in a political game, seeking to promote his private vision of goodness over others,” as Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber, the UC Berkeley urban planning professors who first applied the idea of wickedness to policy debates, wrote over 50 years ago. “What comprises problem-solution for one is problem-generation for another.”

America’s electricity landscape is now wicked. The sheer number of conflicting economic and ideological interests make electricity cost and reliability a problem to be managed, not solved. Electricity costs are increasingly salient at a moment when cost of living concerns remain high and yet are not salient enough to discipline political actors and policy making in a nation in which a highly polarized public and even more polarized opinion elites are mostly rich enough to ignore cost of living concerns when they conflict with their ideological priors.

While there is no solving the problem, there are problems to solve. The electricity price crisis is the result of multiple causes, including generation and supply shortfalls; permitting, transmission and interconnection bottlenecks; wildfire mitigation, particularly in the west; and kludgy regulatory and market restructuring that simultaneously socializes the costs of goldplated infrastructure, subsidizes high-volume customers, and simulates competitive generation markets.

Solutions to these problems will look different in liberalized versus traditionally regulated utility markets. They will also look different in different parts of the country. Solutions that work in Texas, with abundant wind, solar, and natural gas resources competing in the most liberalized electricity market in the nation will not look the same as North Carolina or Florida, where vertically integrated monopoly utilities still lean heavily on nuclear and coal, or the Tennessee Valley, where TVA operates a publicly owned system powered predominantly with nuclear and natural gas.

For these reasons, as a matter of both policy and political communication, all-of-the-above energy policy remains both the most robust approach to the wicked and highly differentiated nature of America’s electricity system and, demonstrably, the best political approach. Neither Bill McKibben’s solar liberation nor Trump’s fossil-heavy energy dominance agenda are plausible alternatives.

Back to an All-of-the-Above Future

Democrats and clean energy advocates still have a lot of unlearning to do. We were both struck during our week in DC for Abundance 2025 how hard it was for even moderate, Abundance-pilled Democratic politicians, despite the determination to pivot to electricity cost, to talk about energy and electricity without talking about climate change. They would start off on their talking points, about AI and data centers, the need for more renewable energy and President Trump’s anti-abundance assault on wind and solar, and then they’d veer back to talking about climate change and decarbonization.

This was, perhaps, by design—based on the perception that they still need to signal to environmentalists that they care deeply about climate change. But if so, it is a poor design. When Democrats and clean energy advocates extoll the benefits of renewable energy to keep electricity costs under control, their supporters already know that they care about climate change. By contrast, when they muddle their energy affordability message with talk about climate change and emissions, they end up signalling to everyone else that what they really care about is climate change, not electricity costs.

Climate advocates, for their part, do their partners in the Democratic Party no favors by rebranding conventional green policies as an “energy affordability” strategy. A policy agenda that supports residential rooftop solar while opposing fossil fuel drilling and pipelines will strike voters as an agenda to keep energy prices high, because that’s what it is, notwithstanding talking points about shielding ratepayers from fuel price volatility and promises of solar energy too cheap to meter.

Trump and Republicans may face similar problems by the time the 2026 or 2028 elections come along. But removing subsidies, as they did in the Big Beautiful bill, likely won’t have the same political valence as the Biden Administration’s sweeping gestures towards fossil fuel abolition. That said, blocking wind, solar, and transmission development on public lands may undermine public support for the Trump Administration's energy dominance agenda.

Ultimately, whoever controls the affordability debate is likely to have the upper hand. For Democrats, environmentalists, and clean energy advocates, this represents a “who moved my cheese” moment, where not just talking points and arguments will need to change but the entire basis of clean energy advocacy. Policies to “keep it in the ground” are dead and aren’t coming back. The conflation of policies to make clean energy cheap with perpetual subsidies for renewable energy has polarized opinion toward what were once popular technologies and undermined claims that these technologies are cheap and hold the key to lower electricity prices. Hardest of all, clean energy advocates, not just Democrats, will need to learn to talk about the benefits that fossil fuels bring to America’s energy and electricity systems, even as they advocate for diversifying away from them.

This will seem new to many. But it is not so new for an older generation of Democrats and environmentalists. It is the language and agenda of the Clinton and Obama administrations, from before the time that the climate hawks seized control of the Democratic Party. It is still the most popular and durable approach to energy affordability and decarbonization, and holds the key to restoring credibility on the energy issue for both Democrats and clean energy advocates.

“LENOWISCO Planning District Commission believes that the Brownfields Program creates great potential for Southwest Virginia communities.

“This EPA Brownfield Assessment Coalition grant for $1.2 million helps LENOWISCO Planning District Commission continue its goals to redevelop hazardous or polluted sites in deep Southwest Virginia.”

BACKGROUND

In May, Congressman Griffith announced that LENOWISCO Planning District Commission received a different $1.2 million Brownfield Assessment grant from the EPA. That funding supported a community-wide assessment of local brownfields.

According to the EPA, Assessment Coalition grants are designed for one “lead” eligible entity to partner with two to four eligible entities that do not have the capacity to apply for and manage their own EPA cooperative agreement and otherwise would not have access to Brownfields grant resources.

Before his July appointment as Health Subcommittee Chairman, Congressman Griffith chaired the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment.

In March of 2025, Congressman Griffith chaired a hearing on the EPA’s Brownfields Program. Scott County Native and LENOWISCO Planning District Commission Executive Director Duane Miller testified to the panel and discussed the Program’s importance to Southwest Virginia communities.

LENOWISCO Planning District Commission serves the Counties of Lee, Wise and Scott and the City of Norton.

The Brownfields Program empowers states, communities and other stakeholders to work together to prevent, assess, safely clean up and sustainably reuse brownfields.

A brownfield site is real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant.

Brownfield Assessment grants provide funding for brownfield inventories, planning, environmental assessments and community outreach.

Industry estimates show a 250-megawatt data center can use about a billion gallons of water each year, or 2.7 million gallons a day.

Ed Buchan, assistant director of Raleigh Water, said that level of demand would be significant for the region.

“It’s a meaningful chunk of water that would otherwise be reserved for residential or commercial growth,” said Ed Buchan, assistant director of Raleigh Water. “That’s about what the demand is for some of our merger communities like Knightdale and Wendell.”

Buchan said that most water utilities return nearly all of what they treat back to the river basin, but cooling systems at data centers often evaporate it. “If it’s evaporated, it’s basically out of the equation,” he said. That could pose risks during drought, when downstream flow is critical.

Shaolei Ren, a University of California Riverside professor who has studied AI’s water footprint, said usage can spike during the hottest months. That means competition with residents who already need more water in summer. “Understanding the peak usage is also important in addition to the annual total,” Ren said.

While the overall national water use of data centers remains small compared with agriculture or industry, Ren noted that local impacts can be far greater. “We need to look at the specific context and understand if it is creating some pressure on the water infrastructures,” he said.

Michael Pencina, Duke University’s vice dean for data science, said sustainability must be part of AI’s future. At Duke, researchers are exploring ways to recycle the heat generated by computing power. “We’ve looked at using the heat from GPU farms to warm up water that’s used across campus,” he said. “It’s about being creative in reducing the footprint while still advancing discovery.”

AI companies have pledged to become “water positive” by 2030, yet transparency remains a challenge. Ren said roughly half of data centers are not publicly disclosing their water use. “Without knowing the numbers, how can we manage these resources responsibly,” he asked.

A Washington Post analysis found a ChatGPT text query uses only about five drops of water, but those small amounts add up when multiplied by billions of requests and the massive cooling demands of data centers.

Buchan said Raleigh has enough supply to handle one or two large facilities, but multiple sites could speed the need for new reservoirs or other costly projects. “If you had a significant number of them come into your service area, and then they were the type that evaporated a lot of water, then that might move up your need for a new water resource pretty quickly,” he said.

Communities weighing data center proposals are often drawn to their high property tax value.

“Data centers clearly have benefits,” Ren said. “On the other hand, they also use resources like power and water. The real question is whether those tradeoffs add up to a net benefit for the community.”",https://images.wral.com/ba85002e-96cb-4e4d-aab9-d9863654e3ea?w=1200&h=630,N,,2025-09-19 15:02:44.634076

This week, the campaign continues with additional events and rallies in today California, Arizona and Nevada. These events will engage constituents by delivering petitions, holding more events to come in additional states across the country and holding members of Congress accountable by urging them to stop increasing costs.

These events build on the more than 115 events LCV and state partners have already hosted across the country since the Big Ugly Bill passed. Since the start of the public education campaign last month, the League of Conservation Voters has also mobilized nearly 8,000 constituents through on-the-ground organizing in nine states. As a result, community members are taking action and sharing stories showcasing how Republicans in Congress who voted for the Big Ugly Bill are increasing costs for families across the country. The Big Ugly Bill raises costs across the board including healthcare, groceries, and utility bills, jeopardizes clean energy jobs, and guts critical programs that protect the health and safety of people.

“Families are struggling to make ends meet and cannot afford the rising costs that Congressional Republicans are making so much worse” said LCV Senior Vice President of Campaigns Sara Schreiber. “Republicans in Congress who voted for the Big Ugly Bill have broken their promise to their constituents to lower costs. They are siding with Big Polluters and other powerful billionaires and hurting working families by cutting widely supported investments and programs that mean energy, health care and grocery bills are going up. At a time of rising energy demand and extreme climate disasters, it makes no sense to block affordable clean energy solutions and roll back protections for our health and our environment. Our elected leaders should instead be investing in affordable energy solutions that work for us all and safeguard our communities, our planet, and future generations.”

“Our Latine and communities of color were already hurting before they passed this catastrophic legislation that will continue to raise our energy bills, make our air dirtier, impact our health,” said Chispa Arizona Executive Director Vianey Olivarría. “Our leaders who voted for these policies are responsible for the harm they are placing on all our families and neighborhoods.”

These events are part of LCV’s $4 million campaign in partnership with state affiliates to host rallies, town halls, phone banks, digital ads, partnering with local officials and content creators, canvassing and tabling, and on the ground field operations in more than fifteen states — including high-traffic canvassing and visibility events that elevate how the Big Ugly Bill increases costs for families and communities, jeopardizes hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs, and puts peoples’ health and safety at risk.

The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) prohibits constructing an “emission unit” without the requisite air permit. Yet many large capital projects involve both emitting and non-emitting components, and for decades, project developers have faced uncertainty about where the line is drawn. A 1986 “Reich memo” suggested that even “accommodating installations”—like foundations, pads, and roofs—might require permits. This expansive view often forced companies to delay construction of non-emitting components, even when those components were the rate-limiting step for development. The result: slower timelines and higher costs.

On September 2, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) provided long-awaited clarity. In a letter opinion, the agency confirmed that the prohibition applies only to construction “on an emissions unit” itself—not related non-emitting infrastructure. At the same time, EPA announced it would undertake a rulemaking to codify this narrower boundary, limiting future administrations’ ability to revert to the broader 1986 guidance without a full rulemaking.

EPA’s clarification may allow project developers in certain industries to get a head start on construction. But project sponsors, investors, and lenders alike should note that any construction remains at the permittee’s own risk: time and money spent before the permit is issued will not influence whether the permit is granted or the conditions it will impose.

The 2025 EPA Interpretation

In July 2025, semiconductor manufacturer TSMC Arizona Corporation (“TSMC”) sought clarification from the Maricopa County Air Quality Department (“MCAQD”) on whether it could begin construction of the foundation, steel superstructure, and exterior walls of a manufacturing plant prior to MCAQD’s issuance of the plant’s air permit. MCAQD agreed that TSMC was not prohibited from constructing the “core and shell” of the plant because these structures are not a source of emissions under the CAA. Nevertheless, MCAQD sought EPA’s concurrence.

EPA’s September 2 response letter (the “TSMC Letter”) explains that permit applicants can commence permanent on-site construction activities prior to receipt of a New Source Review (“NSR”) preconstruction permit, provided that no construction is performed “on an emissions unit.” EPA agreed that, based on the facts provided, erecting TSMC’s proposed plant’s superstructure would not constitute construction “on an emissions unit” and so is not prohibited by the CAA. But EPA cautioned that any construction performed would be at TSMC’s own risk, meaning that the time and resources TSMC expended on the superstructure cannot be used to influence or justify any permitting decisions, and that TSMC would assume the risk that the permit could contain conditions requiring TSMC to modify or rebuild what was already in progress.

EPA concurrently shared its intent to finalize by the end of 2026 revisions to its regulatory definition of “begin actual construction,” to more clearly articulate the construction activities prohibited by the CAA. EPA has since updated its webpage, “Construction Activities Allowed Before Obtaining a Preconstruction Air Permit,” with this information and a reference to the TSMC Letter. In the interim, EPA will continue to provide case-by-case guidance on pre-permit construction.

The Regulatory Background

The CAA generally prohibits the construction of stationary sources of air pollutants without an NSR preconstruction permit. EPA implements the CAA’s preconstruction permitting mandate through regulations, which states must incorporate into their respective state implementation plans.

EPA’s regulations provide that major stationary sources cannot “begin actual construction” without a permit. “Begin actual construction” is defined as “in general, initiation of physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a permanent nature,” including the emission unit’s supports and foundation, underground pipework, and storage facilities.1 Emissions units are “any part of a stationary source that emits or would have the potential to emit” regulated pollutants.2

The TSMC Letter arguably preserves the status quo: based on the plain text of EPA’s regulations, project developers like TSMC have never been constrained from beginning construction on non-emitting structures. Only construction “on an emissions unit” is prohibited. More fundamentally, it is reasonable to conclude that structures with no emissions are beyond the ambit of the CAA, as MCAQD and the TSMC Letter posit.

However, earlier EPA guidance like the 1986 “Reich memo” suggested that EPA would view construction of “any accommodating installation” related to an emissions unit as prohibited by the CAA. This historically drove developers to take overly conservative approaches to pre-permit construction, to the detriment of project development timelines—a problem the TSMC Letter appears to alleviate.3

Takeaways

The impacts will vary considerably by industry and potentially also by state, given state permitting agencies are not obligated to follow EPA guidance. For manufacturing and data center development, which often have significant non-emitting infrastructure, the TSMC Letter may promote accelerated construction timelines. Indeed, EPA’s decision to revise the “begin actual construction” regulatory definition is explicitly linked to the current administration’s desire to ramp up the deployment of domestic manufacturing and data center infrastructure. However, with respect to projects where virtually all equipment has potential to emit or is a direct accessory to such emitting equipment, the potential benefits are less clear.

Bottom line: The TSMC Letter gives project developers new room to maneuver, but not without risk. Expect federal courts to weigh in—via citizen suits or rulemaking challenges—on whether the CAA bars construction of non-emitting yet essential project structures before a permit is in hand. And after Loper Bright, it is the judiciary, not EPA, that will have the last word.

What work does Type One Energy hope to do at Bull Run?

Type One is planning to build the world’s first commercial nuclear fusion plant on the former TVA site. The Knoxville-based firm aims to use a machine called a stellarator to contain superheated plasma at the pilot plant being developed with TVA.

Its design plan is a break from traditional nuclear power plants, which use fission - the process of splitting uranium isotopes apart - to create heat. Fusion reactions instead smash hydrogen isotopes together for heat.

Company scientists have built stellarators, but not under the Type One name. Once the plant is fully online - possibly in the 2030s - it could create as many as 330 jobs, according to Type One’s leaders. They previously said they hoped to start constructing Infinity One, a prototype stellarator, in 2026.

Type One Energy has had an Oak Ridge office since August 2023 and works with both TVA and Oak Ridge National Laboratory on expanding its fusion projects. It was the first company to receive a grant − $4.5 million − from Tennessee’s Nuclear Energy Fund.

Microsoft on Thursday announced it will build a $4 billion advanced artificial intelligence data center in Mount Pleasant over the next three years, which will be similar in size and scale to the initial $3.3 billion facility set to be operational in 2026. The company’s total Wisconsin investment has reached roughly $7.3 billion.

“We’re in the final phases of building Fairwater, the world’s most powerful AI data center in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin — part of a region forged by generations of hard work and ingenuity,” wrote Brad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft, in an announcement.

In May 2024, Microsoft announced its first data center complex in southeastern Wisconsin, which included a visit from former President Joe Biden. The company initially planned a 1.5 million-square-foot data center on land formerly set aside for Taiwan-based Foxconn Technology Group.

Foxconn’s plans didn’t come to fruition, but companies such as Boldt and Walsh Construction are building out the data center complex on land Microsoft bought.

The facility will hold “hundreds of thousands” of powerful NVIDIA general processing units, which will be used to train AI models. Smith said this will deliver “ten times the performance of today’s fastest supercomputers.” Microsoft officials said the Mount Pleasant facility will be the world’s most powerful AI data center.

“But what does that mean for the average Wisconsinite?” Smith wrote. “It means new jobs, new skills and new opportunities — right here at home. From union construction roles to long-term careers in operations and IT, this facility is creating pathways for Wisconsinites to be part of the future of technology. It means students at Gateway Technical College can train for high-demand roles through Wisconsin’s first Datacenter Academy. It means local companies — from manufacturers to startups — can partner with Microsoft engineers to turn AI ideas into real solutions.”

More than 90% of the facility will use a closed-loop liquid cooling system which will be filled during construction and continuously recirculated, officials said. The rest will use outside air for cooling and switch to water on the hottest days to minimize environmental impact, officials added.

Microsoft will pre-pay for energy and electrical infrastructure to offset costs for ratepayers and match kilowatt hours used by fossil fuel with renewables, officials said. A 250-megawatt solar project under construction in Portage County will help with matching, officials said.

The first data center used more than 3,000 construction workers at its peak, Microsoft officials said. When the first data center is open, it will hire around 500 full-time employees and will grow to 800 when the second is completed.

“Throughout our history, innovation has been the key to Wisconsin’s success, championing ideas of discoveries that have transformed people’s lives the world over, and this announcement is no different,” said Gov. Tony Evers in a statement. “Microsoft’s investment puts Wisconsin on the very cutting edge of AI power, not just in the U.S., but throughout the world, while creating good, family supporting jobs, growing our communities and bolstering our critical biohealth, personalized medicine and advanced manufacturing sectors here at home. We are grateful for Microsoft’s continued investment in our state and look forward to continuing to partner together to support Wisconsin’s workforce, economy and communities.”

First data center goes under environmental scrutiny

Microsoft’s data center will use 8.4 million gallons each year, data from the city of Racine showed.

In February, Milwaukee Riverkeeper requested information from the city under public records. Later, the Midwest Environmental Advocates filed a lawsuit against the city to turn over project water use information. Racine’s water utility will provide Lake Michigan water for the data center campus under an agreement with Racine and Mount Pleasant.

The facility will hit peak daily use of 234,000 gallons of water each day when its first phase is completed in 2026, city data showed.

After future phases, the data center will use 702,000 gallons of water each day or 8.44 million gallons each year. This project is for when Areas 3B, 3A and 2 are built out.

The first phase (Area 3B) will see wastewater discharge of up to 81,000 gallons per day and more than 2 million each year. After all phases, the facility will discharge 243,000 gallons each day and more than 6 million each year.

“Data centers will have major implications for Wisconsin’s environment,” said Cheryl Nenn, lead at Milwaukee Riverkeeper. “Our ability to understand the impacts and protect our water resources depends on open and transparent government.”

The request “required additional review while the city worked with Microsoft and associated parties to ensure that the release of information would not violate contractual agreements,” wrote city of Racine officials. Officials pointed to the review for the delay and said their ultimate goal was transparency.

“Open and transparent government is not optional; it is essential to public trust,” said Racine Mayor Cory Mason in a statement. “While we needed time to ensure that we handled this request responsibly and in compliance with legal agreements, we believe transparency is paramount. The information has been released, and we remain committed to making all relevant government records accessible so our community can see how decisions are made and resources are used.”

In 2018, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources approved the city of Racine to divert up to 7 million gallons each day towards the former Foxconn site in Mount Pleasant.

The diverted water would be returned to the Great Lakes Basin through the Racine Wastewater Treatment Plant, DNR officials said.

The approval was granted under the Great Lakes — St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact, which banned diversions of Great Lakes water with a few exceptions, officials said. One exception was to allow a “straddling community” to receive Lake Michigan water if certain criteria were met. Mount Pleasant is classified as such a community.

The Microsoft data center in Mount Pleasant and Vantage Data Centers facility in Port Washington would require a combined 3.9 gigawatts of electricity, a September analysis by Clean Wisconsin found. That’s enough to power 4.3 million Wisconsin homes. However, there are only 2.8 million housing units in the state, U.S. Census data showed.

Mount Pleasant and Port Washington data centers were two of five proposed data center projects which publicly shared their electricity needs. Proposals are underway for Beaver Dam, Vienna and Red Cedar.

“To put this in perspective, that is more than three times the power production capacity of Wisconsin’s Point Beach nuclear reactor,” said Paul Mathewson, science program director at Clean Wisconsin. “And because only two of the data center projects have disclosed their power needs, we know this is really just a fraction of what the energy use would be if all those data centers are ultimately built.”",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/09/Microsoft.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 18:03:35.304668

The City of Tallahassee is proud to announce it has received the Sunrise Award and Redevelopment Award from the Florida Brownfields Association (FBA), recognizing its commitment to environmental stewardship, community engagement and sustainable growth.

These prestigious awards spotlight the City's successful Brownfields program, which is recognized as one of the most successful in Florida and the southeastern United States. Through this program, the City has secured over $3 million in grant funding from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) since 1997 to turn underused, environmentally impacted sites into thriving community assets.

Brownfields are properties where the perception or presence of environmental contamination hinder growth and development. Cleaning up brownfield properties improves the environment, facilitates job growth, utilizes existing infrastructure, increases the local tax base and enables redevelopment opportunities.

The Sunrise Award recognizes the most impactful brownfields redevelopment projects in the state of Florida that successfully leverage multi-stakeholder partnerships to bring about positive change. The Redevelopment Award celebrates innovative, transformative projects that are models of resilience, environmental responsibility and strategic reuse.

The centerpiece of this dual achievement is the transformation of Cascades Park, a former polluted Superfund alternative site, into a nationally recognized park known as a vibrant cultural and recreational destination that also houses vital stormwater infrastructure.

""This achievement highlights the City's leadership in turning environmental challenges into opportunities for economic vitality and community pride,"" Deputy City Manager Karen Jumonville said. ""The dedication and expertise of staff in the transformation of Cascades Park exemplifies the power of brownfields redevelopment to restore contaminated land and revitalize communities.""

Through collaboration by the City of Tallahassee, Blueprint Intergovernmental Agency, EPA, FDEP and private stakeholders, this once-polluted site was remediated and repurposed into a thriving community asset that has spurred more than $300 million in private investment.

These declarations are not merely procedural — they carry significant operational, regulatory, and environmental implications for Louisiana industry.

LDEQ may issue an emergency declaration in anticipation of, or immediately following, a major weather event such as a hurricane. This action is typically coordinated with the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Preparedness and other state and federal agencies. The declaration is based on expected or actual disruptions that could affect facility operations, public safety, environmental protection, and access to resources.

The declaration allows LDEQ to temporarily modify or suspend certain regulatory requirements. These modifications are intended to ensure continuity of critical operations, facilitate rapid response and recovery efforts, and prevent more significant environmental or public health consequences. Common elements addressed in a declaration include fuel storage and transfer, wastewater management, air emissions, debris management, and reporting deadlines.

Once a declaration is issued, facilities may apply for emergency authorizations or waivers. These requests must be submitted to LDEQ and should clearly demonstrate a hurricane-related need — for example, a power outage preventing normal emissions controls or the need to bypass wastewater treatment during flooding. While LDEQ provides flexibility, it still expects facilities to minimize environmental harm and to document any deviations from permit conditions.

In many cases, LDEQ may issue a general administrative order or preauthorized contingency relief to certain sectors, such as refineries, chemical manufacturers, and utilities. These orders typically outline what actions are permitted during the emergency and under what conditions. It is crucial that facility personnel review and understand these documents, as noncompliance — even during a declared emergency — can still result in enforcement action if the terms of the relief are not followed.

While LDEQ’s emergency declarations offer much-needed flexibility, they do not exempt facilities from all responsibility. Facilities remain accountable for actions that result in preventable releases, environmental damage, or public harm. Post-event reporting is typically required, and LDEQ may conduct inspections or request documentation after the emergency has passed.

It is important for Louisiana industry to proactively review emergency response plans, ensure environmental compliance procedures are adaptable to emergency conditions, and maintain open lines of communication with LDEQ. Early engagement with LDEQ can improve a facility’s ability to respond effectively and legally during a hurricane.

LDEQ’s emergency declarations are vital tools for managing environmental risks during hurricanes.

The executive order directs State Land to develop a report within 30 days outlining proposals to streamline and expedite processes for energy infrastructure development on state land. State Land will also be directed to identify and accelerate energy-related projects already underway.

“Arizona is on the frontlines of the American power resurgence, creating the affordable energy future,” said Gov. Hobbs. “We have incredible potential to deliver affordable energy to every business and family who needs it. We just need to unleash it. We’re going to cut away the bureaucracy and red tape that too often holds our economy back and increase costs. With this executive order, we will put common sense before outdated policies and procedures and build the energy infrastructure Arizona needs.”

The executive order also establishes the Arizona Energy Promise Taskforce, which will develop plans to facilitate large-scale growth, while preventing significant increases in Arizonans’ energy costs, expand Arizona’s clean energy economy and identify opportunities to streamline processes to site and develop energy infrastructure projects.

In addition to establishing the Taskforce, Gov. Hobbs’ executive order leverages state resources and directs state agencies to:

Develop an energy affordability study to identify opportunities to reduce consumers’ energy costs and expand energy affordability programs.

Analyze transportation fuel affordability and opportunities to plan for EV adoption.

Provide support for energy-related businesses impacted by changes to federal policy.

Support Tribes in advancing energy sovereignty.

Identify ways to reduce energy costs and lower energy use.

This executive order comes at a critical moment. Recent federal actions, including the repeal of clean energy tax credits and new obstacles delaying the deployment of solar and wind projects, have put jobs and energy developments at risk. Moreover, Arizona utilities estimate significant energy needs over the next 15 years, with some utilities projecting a 40% increase in peak demand.

“This executive order focuses on giving Arizona families the affordable and innovative energy future they want and deserve. It also helps Arizona continue on its trajectory to becoming an energy and manufacturing leader. The solutions that will stem from this EO come at a pivotal time, as energy costs and the uncertainty about future energy demand increase,” said Maren Mahoney, director of the Governor’s Office of Resiliency. “It’s an honor to help lead the Arizona Energy Promise Taskforce and ensure Arizona thrives for many generations to come.”

More than 40 organizations urge Governor Newsom to pass SB 787 and Support Clean Heat Pump, Battery, and Off-shore Wind Supply Chains in California

Los Angeles, Calif. — Today, Public Citizen joined the United Auto Workers and over 40 organizations urging Governor Newsom to sign SB 787 into law. The California State Assembly on Friday voted in favor of SB 787, which would create an Industrial Policy Council in the California Energy Commission. The council would coordinate agencies and stakeholders to support clean energy supply chains for three key sectors across the state: heat pumps, batteries, and off-shore wind.

“While Trump takes the country back to the time of coal barons, awful labor conditions, and extreme pollution, California—the world’s fourth largest economy—has an opportunity to support creating critical clean technology supply chains in the state,” said David Arkush, director of Public Citizen’s Climate Program. “We urge Governor Newsom to ensure California remains a global leader in clean industry development by signing SB 787 into law.”

“UAW is committed to an equitable vision for decarbonizing California’s economy. Part of that vision is growing good union manufacturing jobs in the industries of the future, while accelerating clean energy deployment and bringing down the price of energy for working class Californians,” said Mike Miller, Director of UAW Region 6, which represents 100,000 members across various industries in California. “With SB 787, we’ve sponsored a bill championed by Senator McNerney that will go a long way towards reaching these critical goals in an affordable manner. We’re proud to be joined by a broad coalition of unions, environmentalists, businesses, community groups, counties, utilities, and other organizations who have linked arms in supporting this common sense measure.”

California has established ambitious goals for building a green economy that accelerates the deployment of affordable clean energy and provides quality jobs. However, the state lacks a comprehensive approach to building the clean energy supply chains and workforce needed to achieve its goals.

SB 787 formalizes partnerships between state agencies, labor, environmental organizations, and clean energy industries to coordinate supply chain development for batteries, including electric vehicle and grid-scale batteries, along with building decarbonization technologies and offshore wind.

Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Hourly Electric Grid Monitor When electricity demand in New England is relatively high, electricity imports from Canada have a key role in meeting that demand.
For example, in January 2025, the month winter demand peaked in ISO-NE, Canada provided an average of 14% of ISO-NE electricity demand.
Between 2016 and 2022, Canadian electricity imports provided 11% of NYISO electricity.
Through August 31, 2025, Canadian electricity imports remained about 2% of NYISO electricity demand.","Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Hourly Electric Grid Monitor

Over the past few years, net electricity inflows from Canada into New York (New York Independent System Operator, or NYISO) and New England (Independent System Operator of New England, or ISO-NE) have decreased. We identified this trend in an analysis in 2024, and the trend has continued through the first eight months of 2025. From January through August 2025, daily net electricity imports from Canada into ISO-NE averaged less than 40% of those occurring over the same months in 2022. During the same period, NYISO and Canada net trade fell to 25% what it was during the same months of 2022.

Two factors contributed to the falling imports from Canada. First, drought conditions have led to less hydropower electricity generation in Canada throughout most of the past three years. Despite parts of Canada receiving above average rainfall in July, drought conditions have persisted across much of the country, according to the Canadian government’s Drought Monitor. Second, electricity demand in both ISO-NE and NYISO has fallen. Between 2016 and 2024, electricity demand in ISO-NE fell 9%, and demand in NYISO fell 6%.

Although NYISO and ISO-NE typically import electricity from Canada, the shifting trends have led to multiple days of net electricity exports into Canada from the two ISOs. Net electricity exports from these two grid operators to Canada are more common in the shoulder seasons (spring and fall) when electricity demand in the U.S. Northeast is relatively low. In summer and winter, relatively high electricity demand in the U.S. Northeast limits the electricity available for export.

Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Hourly Electric Grid Monitor

When electricity demand in New England is relatively high, electricity imports from Canada have a key role in meeting that demand. For example, in January 2025, the month winter demand peaked in ISO-NE, Canada provided an average of 14% of ISO-NE electricity demand. But the average over the first eight months of 2025 was 5%. In previous years, Canada contributed a higher share of electricity, providing an average of 14% of ISO-NE’s electricity between 2016 and 2022. That share fell to 11% in 2023 and to 5% in 2024.

ISO-NE first exported more electricity than it imported from Canada, becoming a net exporter, on a daily basis in February 2023. Daily net exports have become increasingly common, occurring 49 times in 2024 and 20 times through August 31 in 2025, according to data collected in our Hourly Electric Grid Monitor.

Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Hourly Electric Grid Monitor

As in ISO-NE, Canadian electricity imports to NYISO are an important component in meeting electricity demand, but the amount of electricity imported from Canada has decreased in recent years. Between 2016 and 2022, Canadian electricity imports provided 11% of NYISO electricity. In 2023, that share fell to 5%, and in 2024 it fell to 3%. Through August 31, 2025, Canadian electricity imports remained about 2% of NYISO electricity demand. In August 2025, NYISO was a net exporter to Canada every day except for three during the month.

NYISO was a daily net exporter of electricity to Canada for the first time in July 2023. In 2024, NYISO was a net exporter to Canada for 87 days. In 2025, through the end of August, NYISO was a daily net exporter 86 times.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/TIE09192025.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 14:07:03.368379

Pennsylvania Settlement Summary In the Pennsylvania case, the plaintiffs alleged that Styropek released nurdles into a river without authority under Styropek’s NPDES permit.
As part of the proposed settlement, Styropek agreed to install equipment to prevent and monitor future releases.
The Pennsylvania settlement is the third settlement related to plastic pollution in waterways.
Key Considerations Manufacturers of plastics and those who use plastic components in any part of their processes should consider the following.","In both cases, environmental groups allege that the defendants have been releasing small plastic pellets, called nurdles, into waterways without a permit. In the Pennsylvania case, environmentalists accused Styropek USA, Inc., an expanded polystyrene manufacturer, of discharging nurdles into a tributary of the Ohio River. As part of a settlement with the plaintiffs and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, Styropek agreed to install monitoring and control equipment and to pay $2.5 million for watershed restoration.

Soon after, environmentalists in South Carolina issued a citizen suit letter to two companies allegedly discharging nurdles into the Congaree River. The increased attention to nurdle releases raises the possibility of additional citizen suit activity in the near future.

South Carolina Citizen Suit Summary

In February, an environmental group, Congaree Riverkeepers, first began collecting nurdles near Columbia, South Carolina. The Riverkeepers assert that a polyester factory operated by Alpek Polyester USA, LLC and Eastman Chemical Company has been releasing nurdles, 1,4-dioxane, and organic matter into the Congaree River.

The CWA forbids the discharge of any pollutant without a permit. 33 U.S.C. § 1311(a). The Act defines a “pollutant” to include solid waste discharged into water, which can include solid plastic. 33 U.S.C. § 1362(6). The Riverkeepers allege that Alpek and Eastman have been discharging nurdles and 1,4-dioxane without a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit.

The Riverkeepers also accuse Alpek and Eastman of violating the RCRA. The RCRA allows citizen suits against a defendant for the handling, storage, treatment, transportation, or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste that may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to health or the environment. 42 U.S.C. § 6972(a)(1)(B). It also forbids the disposal of solid or hazardous waste in an “open dump”—anywhere outside a proper landfill. 42 U.S.C. §§ 6945(a), 6903(14). The RCRA defines “solid waste” to include discarded material from industrial operations. 42 U.S.C. § 6903(14). The Riverkeepers contend that Alpek and Eastman’s nurdles harm fish in the river and the people who eat them. They also say that the plant’s wastewater treatment system is located within a floodplain and therefore results in open dumping.

Unless regulators act within 60 days, we expect litigation. The Riverkeepers’ case may be yet another model for environmental plaintiffs seeking to limit plastic pollution.

Pennsylvania Settlement Summary

In the Pennsylvania case, the plaintiffs alleged that Styropek released nurdles into a river without authority under Styropek’s NPDES permit. As part of the proposed settlement, Styropek agreed to install equipment to prevent and monitor future releases. Styropek also agreed to pay a $100,000 penalty, $2 million for plastic remediation, $500,000 for watershed restoration, and $375,000 in attorney’s fees. The environmental plaintiffs who brought the suit suggested the settlement could set a framework that could be copied across the country.

The Pennsylvania settlement is the third settlement related to plastic pollution in waterways. In 2019, Formosa Plastics Corp. agreed to retrofit its facility and pay $50 million after it allegedly discharged nurdles into Lavaca Bay in excess of its permit conditions. In 2021, Frontier Logistics agreed to pay $1.2 million to settle a lawsuit after nurdles washed into Charleston Harbor.

Key Considerations

Manufacturers of plastics and those who use plastic components in any part of their processes should consider the following.

Whether any wastewater discharges may contain plastics.

Request appropriate modifications to existing NPDES permits.

Supply chain decarbonisation Mars aims to integrate sustainable practices not only in its confectionery and pet food production, but also across its wider supply chain.
By collaborating with Enel, Mars enhances its efforts to decarbonise, particularly through the Renewable Acceleration programme.
""For Mars, Renewable Acceleration is a performance accelerator, cutting emissions at a scale and speed we could never achieve through traditional value chain engagement approaches.
These contracts exemplify a transformative approach to the supply chain, potentially inspiring similar actions among other manufacturers, furthering the cause of global sustainability in procurement and supply management.","Mars is taking steps to enhance its Renewable Acceleration programme by teaming up with energy partner Enel.

The multinational manufacturer is dedicated to implementing sustainable practices, considering everything from building partnerships with NGOs to the responsible sourcing of raw materials.

Since introducing its Generation Plan in 2017, Mars has been actively working to ensure it is a positive force for the world.

Supply chain decarbonisation

Mars aims to integrate sustainable practices not only in its confectionery and pet food production, but also across its wider supply chain.

By collaborating with Enel, Mars enhances its efforts to decarbonise, particularly through the Renewable Acceleration programme.

“Many large companies are well on their way to sourcing renewable electricity for their own operations, but that’s just a part of the picture,” says Kevin Rabinovitch, Global VP Sustainability at Mars.

""For Mars, Renewable Acceleration is a performance accelerator, cutting emissions at a scale and speed we could never achieve through traditional value chain engagement approaches. It lets us bring demand for all the electricity used in our value chain to the clean energy market in a highly efficient manner.""

Suppliers will shift to renewable energy and trucks transporting ingredients and finished products will transition to EVs, exemplifying Mars' commitment to sustainable procurement.

Alastair Child, Chief Sustainability Officer at Mars, adds: ""[The partnership with Enel] means sourcing renewable electricity to cover everything from the farms that grow our ingredients, to the trucks that deliver products, and even the energy used by consumers at home to enjoy their favourite Mars products, like Ben’s Original and SNICKERS Ice Cream or at their BANFIELD veterinarian’s office.

""By implementing this strategy, we could cut around three million tons of carbon emissions from the Mars full value chain, amounting to an estimated 10% of our current total footprint. This is a huge unlock for decarbonisation and we’re just getting started.""

The adoption of renewable electricity is an accessible and cost-effective strategy for decarbonisation, and is well received publicly and by businesses alike. Direct operations under the Mars name use about 2 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity annually.

However, the full value chain, including suppliers, customers and consumers, requires 8-9TWh, indicating the vast scope of the Renewable Acceleration programme to reduce emissions.

Developing sustainable value chains

The inaugural contract in this programme, spanning Mars and Enel North America, stands as a testament to Mars' dedication to sustainable energy, setting its largest precedent in global power purchase agreements (PPA) with a commercial and industrial client.

“Renewable Acceleration is a bold initiative to support the buildout of more clean energy capacity, which we know is among the fastest and most economical ways to decarbonise,” asserts Michele Di Murro, CEO of Enel North America.

“Mars is raising the bar for corporate sustainability strategies, taking a comprehensive and direct approach to addressing emissions across its entire value chain. Enel is proud to partner with Mars in launching this new programme.”

Mars continues to fortify its procurement and supply strategies through diversified renewable energy contracts with global companies, facilitating its suppliers' transition towards decarbonisation.

Strategic energy resilience

Mars’ approach manifests its commitment to fostering robust and effective supply chains through strategic partnerships that bolster both energy resilience and supplier relationships.

By not relying on a single provider, Mars enhances its capability to meet decarbonisation goals more expediently.

The initial trilogy of contracts with Enel is projected to generate a cumulative 1.8TWh annually, reducing approximately 700ktCO₂e each year. With continued collaboration and contracting, Mars anticipates achieving a 10% reduction in its total carbon footprint by 2030.

These contracts exemplify a transformative approach to the supply chain, potentially inspiring similar actions among other manufacturers, furthering the cause of global sustainability in procurement and supply management.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/62a82981ab16dd951068ad0990034462:bb2455a98e9e7bd321a36d36f148c8ad/aurora-solar-farm-dual-use-solar-min.jpeg.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 17:01:33.931649

For the U.S., it would reinforce leadership in an industry critical to economic growth, energy security, and climate goals.","Over the past three years, global energy markets have been rocked by successive crises.

When Russia invaded Ukraine, European nations — and the UK in particular — were forced to go “cold turkey” off Russian natural gas, severing a supply chain that had underpinned electricity and heating for decades. That scramble collided with an unprecedented heatwave in the UK’s early summer, straining grids, sending prices soaring, and exposing the fragility of over-reliance on imported fossil fuels.

These shocks underscored a hard truth: energy security is national security. Countries that cannot depend on their own supply — or on trusted allies — risk economic disruption, political instability, and a diminished ability to protect their citizens when geopolitics shift. We wrote about these geopolitical events previously.

Against this backdrop, the United Kingdom and the United States have launched an ambitious new phase of cooperation to accelerate nuclear power development on both sides of the Atlantic. The new Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy, expected to be signed during President Trump’s state visit to London, marks a major step toward unlocking the next generation of clean, secure energy.

By streamlining licensing and encouraging private investment, the partnership aims to shorten the time it takes to build new reactors—from three or four years for regulatory approvals to as little as two. That would mean more jobs, faster deployment, and greater energy security for both nations.

A transatlantic energy alliance

By combining the two countries’ innovation, investment and industrial sites, as well as more aligned regulatory oversight, the Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy aims to offer:

Lower costs and shorter schedules through mutual recognition of safety reviews.

Robust supply chains, including advanced fuels and reactor components, that bypass hostile actors and improve resilience.

Shared R&D on fission and fusion, harnessing AI tools and joint test facilities to accelerate breakthroughs.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the partnership “a golden age of nuclear,” while U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright highlighted how cooperation will “enhance global energy security” and “fuel the AI revolution.”

Key announcements driving the partnership

Several commercial agreements were unveiled alongside the government-to-government framework. Together, they signal a wave of investment in advanced reactors, fuels, and clean power applications.

X-Energy and Centrica – Plans to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors at Hartlepool, creating as many as 2,500 skilled jobs. The full UK programme could deliver 6 GW of capacity, power 1.5 million homes, and generate £40 billion in economic value—£12 billion of which would flow to the North East.

Holtec, EDF and Tritax – A proposal to develop data centres powered by small modular reactors on the site of the former Cottam coal station in Nottinghamshire. The £11 billion project could employ thousands during construction and create long-term operations roles.

Last Energy and DP World – One of the world’s first micro-modular nuclear plants to supply clean power to DP World’s London Gateway port and logistics park, backed by £80 million in private investment.

Urenco and Radiant – A £4 million deal to supply advanced HALEU fuel to the U.S. market. Urenco’s new Advanced Fuels Facility in the UK, co-funded by government, may become a model for similar plants in the United States.

TerraPower and KBR – A collaboration to study and evaluate UK sites for deploying the Natrium advanced reactor, each unit supporting about 1,600 construction jobs and 250 permanent jobs while pairing reliable nuclear power with grid-scale energy storage.

Why this matters

For the current U.S. Administration, the Atlantic Partnership is more than a gesture of friendship—it’s a way to meet strategic and economic goals at home. The same goes for the UK, with the partnership expected to create tens of thousands of high-quality jobs in regions which have historically been overlooked.

Among other things, the more U.S. and UK technology is deployed, the more first-of-a-kind costs are driven down, and the stronger the commercial offering—both domestically and abroad--become:

Grid reliability & clean energy: Nuclear power offers firm, carbon-free electricity to complement renewables and meet surging demand from AI, data centers, and electrified transport.

Industrial competitiveness: Building and exporting advanced reactors creates thousands of highly skilled jobs in engineering, construction, operations, and supply-chain manufacturing.

Energy security: Closer coordination with the UK diversifies global supply chains, reduces reliance on Russian fuel, and strengthens Western resilience against hostile suppliers.

Innovation leadership: Bilateral projects—like Natrium, advanced SMRs, and HALEU fuel supply—position companies from both countries at the forefront of next-generation nuclear technology.

Climate and decarbonization goals: Meeting emissions targets will require reliable zero-carbon power alongside renewables; nuclear is the only large-scale option already proven.

Conclusion

The UK–U.S. deal could transform the pace of nuclear deployment in the UK, the U.S., and abroad. For Britain, it could provide a route to affordable, clean, homegrown energy and thousands of well-paid jobs. For the U.S., it would reinforce leadership in an industry critical to economic growth, energy security, and climate goals.

While there are inevitably questions around how it will be delivered (in particular the reduction in regulatory timetables without compromising on safety), this collaboration would mark the most significant transatlantic effort in civilian nuclear power since the dawn of the atomic age—ushering in a truly shared golden age of nuclear energy.

While executive orders carry the force of federal law for those who must follow them, they do not go through the constitutional legislative process and are subject to limits.

How an executive order is different from a law

Feature Executive Order Law (Statute)

Origin Issued unilaterally by the President to manage the federal government.

Passed by a majority vote in both the House and Senate, then signed by the President. Constitutional basis

Must be based on authority granted to the President by the Constitution (Article II) or an existing federal statute.

Directly enabled by the legislative powers given to Congress in the Constitution (Article I).

Scope of authority Used to direct federal agencies on how to implement or enforce existing laws and manage the executive branch. Cannot be used to create new laws or appropriate money. Can cover a broad range of topics, including creating new programs, making new crimes, and authorizing spending. Overturning

Can be rescinded by the issuing President or a future one. Can only be overturned by passing new legislation or by a court finding it unconstitutional.

Judicial review Federal courts can strike down an executive order if it is found to exceed the President's authority or be unconstitutional. Federal courts can strike down a law if it is found to be unconstitutional, a process called judicial review. Public vs. federal workers

Primarily binds and directs employees within the executive branch. However, it can affect the public by changing how federal agencies operate. Binds the entire nation and applies to all people.

Limits on executive orders While a powerful tool, a President's use of executive orders is not unlimited and is subject to the system of checks and balances:

Judicial review: The federal courts can invalidate an executive order that they find unconstitutional or beyond the President's legal authority. A famous example is the Supreme Court striking down President Truman's executive order to seize steel mills in 1952, determining it was an overreach of his power.

Congressional action: Though challenging, Congress can pass legislation that overrides or defunds an executive order. This legislation would require a two-thirds majority in both houses to overcome a presidential veto. Congress can also refuse to fund initiatives directed by an executive order, effectively killing it.

Future presidents: A new President can easily revoke the executive orders of a predecessor. This means their effects can be temporary, changing with each new administration.",,N,,2025-09-19 14:05:24.072229

Renewable energy jobs grew more than three times faster than the rest of the U.S. economy in 2024. However, future growth could be in jeopardy, according to the 10th annual Clean Jobs America report released by E2.

The report showed that the renewable energy sector added almost 100,000 new jobs, bringing the total number of renewable energy workers in the United States to 3.56 million. However, policy uncertainty and an overall slowing of job and economic growth in 2024 led to the growth in renewable energy jobs dropping to its slowest pace since 2020, adding about 50,000 fewer jobs than in 2023.

Still, jobs in solar, wind, batteries, energy efficiency, storage and grid and other clean energy subsectors continued to grow faster than the broader economy, and make up an increasingly larger share of the overall U.S. workforce. More than 7% of all new jobs added in the United States and 82% of all new energy jobs added last year were in renewable energy occupations.

E2’s 10th annual Clean Jobs America report comes as the clean energy industry is reeling from recent federal policy decisions to kill projects, revoke tax credits, cancel permits and add new regulatory red tape and legal hurdles aimed at hobbling solar, wind, electric vehicles and other industries. These federal policy assaults come even as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says the fastest-growing occupations in America are wind turbine service technicians and solar photovoltaic installers.

Though not reflected in the 2024 data, recent policy actions by congress and the Trump administration have already resulted in major job losses in the industry, with more expected to come. According to separate E2 research, since January 2025 companies canceled more than $22 billion planned clean energy related factories and other projects that were expected to create 16,500 new jobs. Analysis by other organizations estimate more than 830,000 jobs could be lost just because of the energy policy rollbacks in President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law on July 4.

“What these numbers show is that this was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024,” said Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director. “Now, clean energy job growth is at serious risk – and with it, our overall economy,”

According to E2’s report, clean energy jobs now account for 42% of all energy jobs in America and 2.3% of the overall national workforce. More people now work in clean energy related occupations than work as nurses, cashiers, waiters and waitresses, or preschool, elementary, and middle school teachers.

More than 520,000 jobs have now been added by the clean energy and clean vehicle sectors over the last five years, an increase of 17% — far exceeding employment gains in fossil fuels, gas and diesel motor vehicles, and the overall U.S. economy.

While the sector added the fewest jobs since the pandemic-fueled unemployment crisis, clean energy still grew more than three times faster than the rest of the U.S. workforce (2.8% vs. 0.8%) amid an economy-wide slowdown in hiring and rising policy uncertainty. Over the last five years, clean energy companies have added jobs 60% faster than the rest of the economy.

“Every year, clean energy jobs become more intertwined and critical to our overall economy,” said Michael Timberlake, director of research and publications for E2. “These jobs are now a vital anchor of America’s energy workforce. The strength of the U.S. job market and the future of our energy economy are now inseparable from the growth of clean energy.”

Energy efficiency remains the top sector for U.S. clean energy jobs, employing nearly 2.4 million workers nationwide after adding 91,000 jobs in 2024. That’s followed by renewable generation (569,000 overall, +9,000 in 2024) and clean vehicles (398,000 overall, -12,000 in 2024). Despite an industry-wide decline across all motor vehicle sectors in 2024, clean vehicle jobs have grown 52% since 2020, adding 137,000 jobs.

Over the past five years, no region added more clean energy jobs and at a faster rate than the South — now home to more than 1 million clean energy workers. From Texas to Virginia, Southern states added 41,000 clean energy jobs in 2024. Western and Northeastern states added more than 20,000 jobs respectively. The Midwest added more than 13,000 jobs. See a detailed regional breakdown in the full report.

At the state level, clean energy continues to drive economic prosperity. Twenty-three states are home to at least 50,000 clean energy jobs and just eight states have more workers employed by fossil fuels than clean energy.

Seventeen states have seen their clean energy workforces jump at least 20% in the last five years. See table below for more detail.

Methodology

This analysis of U.S. clean energy employment is based on employment data collected and analyzed by the BW Research Partnership for the 2025 U.S. Energy and Employment Report (USEER). The USEER analyzes data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) to track employment across many energy production, transmission and distribution subsectors. In addition, the 2025 USEER relies on a unique supplemental survey of 42,800 business representatives across the United States. Created and conducted by BW Research, the methodology has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). This survey is used to identify energy-related employment within key subsectors of the broader industries as classified by the BLS and to assign them into their component energy and energy efficiency sectors.

A full methodology on the sectors and types of jobs this analysis includes and does not include is available in the report here.

According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, VPPs are networks of small energy generation sites — think hundreds of homes with rooftop solar — that are combined with storage technologies like home batteries and electric vehicles. VPPs can help grid operators manage peak demand, improve affordability, and bolster grid resilience by taking some of the strain off of centralized power plants, especially during times of peak demand.

The use of solar+storage helped many communities during Hurricane Helene in Fall 2024. As we approach the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Helene, we want to take time to showcase a solutions-based program for the Carolinas: Duke Energy in North Carolina’s VPP pilot program, PowerPair, which provides an incentive for solar+storage systems for residential customers.

PowerPair Basics

The intent of the PowerPair pilot program is to reduce Duke Energy’s peak demand by making solar+storage systems more affordable, incentivizing more customers to add solar+storage to their homes. The pilot program also increases resilience since solar+storage systems can continue to run even in a system outage. This is a 3-year pilot. Customers have until the end of 2027 to apply. Participants are required to participate for 10 years. Incentive levels vary depending on rate structure and utility battery control, with the maximum rebate being $9,000 per residence. Remaining program capacity is updated periodically on the PowerPair website.

The pilot consists of two cohorts.

Cohort A is for residents who would like to control their battery themselves. These participants are on a time-of-use rate schedule that encourages them to reduce their utility-fed electricity usage during times of peak demand when it is most expensive for the utility to meet customers’ needs.

Cohort B allows Duke Energy to control the customer’s battery and provides the customer with an additional monthly incentive.

A Missed Opportunity to Incentivize Resilience for Medical Device Households

As an additional resilience measure, a Cohort C Medical Device Pilot was also discussed throughout 2024/2025. The intent of the medical device pilot would have provided incentives specifically for solar+storage for individuals with a medical device. This would make these particularly vulnerable dwellings more resilient and allow these customers to shelter in place when there is a power outage. A great example of this working is a Savannah, GA homeowner who uses a sleep apnea machine and was able to shelter in place during Hurricane Helene. Unfortunately, despite efforts by SACE and others, in July 2025, Duke Energy notified the NC Utility Commission that, even though the costs of such a program would be fairly modest, Duke could not find a way to pay for the Cohort C Medical Device pilot program. Households with medical devices can, of course, still participate in the Cohort A or B pilot program, but without additional incentives.

How can I participate?

To participate in PowerPair, Duke Energy North Carolina customers select a Trade Ally, which is a contractor that has met the requirements to partner with Duke Energy. The Trade Ally helps the customer complete an Interconnection Request and program application, which is reviewed and approved within 10 business days. Once the installation is completed by the Trade Ally, required documentation is submitted, eligibility requirements are verified, and billing has started, the customer will receive the one-time PowerPair incentive payment. More information is available on the PowerPair website.

VPPs Can Support Resilient Communities Throughout the Southeast

VPPs throughout the Southeast are a great way to provide resilience, as shown in NC and FL during Hurricane Helene. In addition to providing resilience for customers, these programs reduce usage during periods when it is most expensive for the utility to provide service, thereby lowering utility bills for all customers. Duke Energy is leading by example with the PowerPair pilot, and the Georgia Public Service Commission recently approved a similar Georgia Power Company pilot as part of their 2025 Integrated Resource Plan. We encourage other Southeast utilities to follow in Duke Energy and Georgia Power’s footsteps and provide the opportunity for resilience and peak demand assistance for their customers.

I didn’t gamble a single cent or pay for a sip of a drink, but the trip out to Las Vegas for RE+ completely wiped me out.

The long flights and days spent shuffling around the Venetian and Caesar’s Forum were well worth it, though, and as I shamble back into the saddle and transcribe quotes from the event, I’m picking up on some prominent themes. The prevalent one is optimistic: the tailwind of increasing electricity demand is strong enough to ensure the U.S. renewable energy industry survives and thrives, despite headwinds from the federal government.

Kevin Smith, CEO of independent power producer (IPP) Arevon, put it succinctly.

“Solar and battery storage are best positioned, with or without tax credits,” he told me. “And the industry feels that because projects are still continuing to move forward, there’s still demand from utilities.”

Smith anticipates a more acute supply vs. demand situation to emerge in late 2026 and into 2027; keep your eyes on Factor This for more on that in a future article.

In the meantime, here’s a 2,000-word testament, in black and white, to Smith’s sentiments. If you want to see a particular project or financing appear in this column, send it my way. In the meantime, be good to one another, and when the weekend finds you, may you bask in its warmth like a comforter fresh out of the dryer.

Catalyze Brings Community Solar Online in New York

This week, fully-integrated distributed renewable energy asset developer and IPP Catalyze announced the completion of four community solar projects in central and western New York. The projects are located in Pavilion, Phelps, Fonda, and Fabius (sounds like a cool name for a law firm!) and were developed in partnership with CS Energy. Combined, they account for 27 megawatts (MW) of capacity.

According to Catalyze, the projects leveraged standardized design, a consistent racking system, and trusted subcontractor relationships, allowing teams to accelerate schedules and bring power online as fast as possible. Construction access and laydown areas were carefully managed so that farmland could return to its pre-existing condition, allowing landowners to continue farming outside the solar arrays. The installations, built with prevailing wage labor, were supported by New York State programs including the Inclusive Community Solar Adder and the Community Adder, which help ensure reliable energy access to low-to-moderate income (LMI) subscribers and disadvantaged communities.

“Our work with CS Energy shows what’s possible when states, developers, and communities align,” said Andrew D’Amico, Chief Operating Officer at Catalyze. “This milestone is about more than megawatts; it’s about taking action. We are seeing businesses move fast to lock in the long-term benefits and cost advantages of solar power while federal tax credits are still in place, with states offering incentives designed to expand access.”

The timing of these projects, as D’Amico points out, highlights the importance of acting quickly to secure federal tax incentives while they’re still around. Current solar investment tax credits cover 30% of project costs, with potential bonuses of 10% for domestic content and an additional 10% for projects in designated energy communities.

This marks the halfway point of an eight-project collaboration between Catalyze and CS Energy. The remaining projects, totaling more than 25 MW, are scheduled for completion over the next year. Last October, New York reached its goal of installing 6 gigawatts (GW) of distributed solar ahead of schedule.

Enel Signs Largest-Ever Power Purchase Agreement

Enel North America is going to Mars! Or rather, Mars is coming to Enel… for power.

Late last week, Enel signed three power purchase agreements (PPAs) for the full output of a trio of Texas solar farms with Mars Incorporated (yes, the candy bar company). The deals represent Enel’s largest corporate PPA transaction worldwide. Combined, the agreements represent 851 MWac and are expected to yield 1.8 terawatt-hours of electricity each year.

Vegetation at all three sites will be managed through sheep grazing, a sustainable dual-use solar practice that Enel expanded through the largest solar grazing agreement signed in the United States. Learn more about that deal and check out cute sheep pics here:

“This deal reinforces our commitment to decarbonization and shows how renewables are among the fastest and most affordable solutions to meet the nation’s energy needs. Through these agreements, we’re adding clean capacity to the Texas grid while supporting a leading manufacturer’s sustainability goals,” said Michele Di Murro, CEO of Enel North America.

“Many large companies are well on their way to sourcing renewable electricity for their own operations, but that’s just a part of the picture,” added Kevin Rabinovitch, Global VP Sustainability at Mars. “For Mars, Renewable Acceleration is a performance accelerator, cutting emissions at a scale and speed we could never achieve through traditional value chain engagement approaches. It lets us bring demand for all the electricity used in our value chain to the clean energy market in a highly efficient manner. The more demand we create together, the faster we can build the future we all want. And clean energy means cleaner air for our communities, our people, our partners.”

Fourth Power Secures $20M for Utility-Scale Storage Solution

Startup flexible-duration energy storage provider Fourth Power has secured $20 million in Series A Plus funding led by Munich Re Ventures, with follow-on investments from DCVC and Breakthrough Energy Ventures.

The funding will accelerate the commercial deployment of Fourth Power’s modular, utility-scale thermal energy storage system, supporting the commissioning of an integrated 1 MWh-e demonstration using full-scale commercial components, the company’s final step before customer deployments. Fourth Power also intends to use the influx of capital to deepen partnerships with suppliers and customers further and grow its customer pipeline.

“We’re in a race between the growing need for reliable electricity and the grid’s ability to provide it quickly and affordably. Existing solutions are too slow to deploy, too expensive for customers, and oftentimes both,” argued Arvin Ganesan, CEO of Fourth Power. “Fourth Power offers a new path forward: scalable, flexible-duration energy storage built from abundant domestic materials. It’s how we deliver reliability at a price point that works—for energy providers, their customers, and the future of the grid.”

Since its $19 million Series A in 2023, Fourth Power has doubled its team size and claims it has achieved breakthrough engineering milestones that validate its commercial readiness. The company constructed three large-scale, accelerated life test rigs to validate the durability, safety, and lifetime performance of its subsystems at temperatures up to 2400°C. Further advances include demonstrating a self-lubricating graphite pump for moving molten tin, high-pressure-rated graphite fittings for liquid metal containment, and a scalable inert gas enclosure system.

“Fourth Power is solving a grid problem that’s very real and very near-term, and they’re doing it with a system that’s safer, cheaper, and dramatically more scalable than anything we’ve seen in this category,” stated Peter Ortez, principal at Munich Re Ventures. “We focus on companies tackling the biggest risks facing society. And we believe Fourth Power’s approach represents exactly the kind of resilient infrastructure investment the energy transition demands.”

The Northeast faces distinct challenges, including transportation electrification, aging infrastructure, renewable integration, grid modernization, and increasingly severe weather. DTECH® Northeast will assemble leading stakeholders to tackle these issues head-on, offering insights into cutting-edge technologies and strategies that ensure reliability, sustainability, and customer satisfaction. Join us in Boston, Massachusetts, from November 17-19, 2025!

Fourth Power’s thermal energy storage system works by converting electricity into heat using 2400°C liquid metal as a heat transfer fluid. It stores that energy in carbon blocks and converts it back to electricity using proprietary thermophotovoltaics (TPVs). The company’s use of very high-temperature liquid metal for heat transfer achieves high power density, reducing overall system costs. Fourth Power’s modular design separates power and energy, allowing utilities to add storage duration over time as needs change at just a fraction of the initial installation cost. This flexibility, which the company says is enabled by storage costs of less than $25/kWh-e, allows customers to “grow with the grid,” a key differentiator from lithium-ion batteries, where adding duration means duplicating the entire system.

“This technology doesn’t just incrementally improve on existing solutions, but completely reimagines how we approach the problem,” said Carmichael Roberts of Breakthrough Energy Ventures. “With energy demand rising rapidly, we need storage technologies that can scale cost-effectively alongside that growth. Fourth Power’s flexible-duration approach is that kind of infrastructure-grade solution.”

Fourth Power expects to announce its first commercial partnerships by 2027.

Jupiter Power Brings Michigan’s First Utility-Scale Battery Online

On Wednesday, Texas-based Jupiter Power and Michigan utility Consumers Energy hosted a ribbon-cutting ceremony celebrating the successful commercial operations of the Tibbits Energy Storage Facility, the first-of-its-size operational battery energy storage system (BESS) in the mitten state. The 100 MW, four-hour duration BESS is located in Coldwater Township.

In June 2024, Consumers Energy announced a long-term agreement to purchase 100 MW of capacity from the Tibbits facility to be built and operated by Jupiter Power. The project went online earlier this summer and is the first of several large-scale battery projects that Consumers Energy has in the works this decade.

“Jupiter is proud to have completed Michigan’s first utility-scale energy storage project, which will increase Consumers Energy’s supply of reliable, flexible energy solutions to meet customer needs and also bring many benefits to the Coldwater community,” said Jack Godshall, Chief Commercial Officer of Jupiter Power. “Tibbits puts Jupiter’s total battery storage projects now in operation or under construction at nearly 3GWh, and with more than 12GW of new projects in development, we have much more to do – including in Michigan.”

Jupiter Power is also advancing the proposed 100 MW Voyager Battery Storage project in Saline Township, supported by a long-term power purchase agreement with Consumers Energy.

Nexamp Attracts $350M for First Utility-Scale Projects

Nexamp, the largest community solar and commercial-scale distributed generation owner in the United States, has secured $350 million in financing from Macquarie Asset Management to support the construction of its first utility-scale solar and battery storage projects. In a separate transaction, the company also raised additional development capital from Nomura to advance earlier-stage projects and sustain a national pipeline of utility-scale opportunities.

The Macquarie deal is more about Nexamp’s near-term construction plans. It will enable Nexamp to advance a significant portion of its 6 GW pipeline, which has been under development since the company’s expansion into the utility-scale segment in 2021. According to Nexamp, the Nomura investment complements this structure by supplying flexible capital to support the development activities of its next tranche of utility-scale projects.

“Access to capital across both development and construction is essential for building the scale of projects that today’s energy market demands,” said Zaid Ashai, Chairman and CEO of Nexamp. “These financings, secured from two world-class partners, ensure that Nexamp can both deliver on the near-term buildout of utility-scale solar and storage and invest in the development pipeline that will power the next phase of growth. This is about building a durable platform that meets the country’s rising demand for easy-to-deploy, more affordable energy.”

Macquarie’s financing will facilitate the construction of more than 1 GW (AC) of solar and storage projects across the high-demand MISO, ERCOT, and NYISO markets, while Nomura’s capital will advance development activities in MISO, NYISO, and PJM, three of the nation’s fastest-growing regions for utility-scale renewables. PEI Global Partners served as financial advisor to Nexamp on both transactions.

Sol Systems Scores $80M for Project Pipeline

Growing IPP Sol Systems has announced an initial commitment from Great Bay Renewables (GBR) of approximately $80 million in interconnection letters of credit (LCs) supporting Sol’s MISO portfolio. The revolving facility will be used to post refundable milestone deposits to MISO and, subsequently, to support readiness deposits in PJM.

“Interconnection is a bottleneck for U.S. clean energy deployment,” noted Richard Romero, Chief Financial Officer of Sol Systems. “This facility lets us scale more efficiently by posting deposits with letters of credit rather than cash, so we can advance a broader, de-risked portfolio for our customers and capital partners. Great Bay Renewables understands today’s queue realities and structured a solution that meets the moment.”

Non-cash-collateralized LC capacity has historically been reserved for large, credit-rated platforms. By partnering with GBR, Sol gains balance-sheet efficiency comparable to the industry’s most prominent players while continuing to invest in rigorous upfront engineering and site selectivity. This non-cash-collateralized LC capacity enables Sol to advance a greater number of high-quality interconnection positions without tying up cash, supporting a larger, more diversified pipeline, and accelerating deployment as projects mature.

“The capital required for grid interconnection security is one of the largest impediments to energy project development,” added Frank Getman, CEO of Great Bay Renewables. “At Great Bay, we specialize in creating innovative financial solutions to solve these complex problems. Our interconnection financing frees up our partners’ balance sheets, enabling companies like Sol Systems to deploy their resources efficiently to build the projects that accelerate the growth of American industry.”",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/FT-Template-19.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 14:05:09.123114

Conclusion The decommissioning and recycling requirements introduced via HB 3809 and HB 3228 marks a significant shift in the regulatory landscape for BESFs, wind, and solar power facilities in Texas.","As the energy landscape continues to evolve, so too does the regulatory framework governing it. Texas House Bills 3809 and 3228 introduce significant changes to the decommissioning and recycling requirements for Battery Energy Storage Facilities (“BESFs”), Solar Power Facilities, and Wind Power Facilities in Texas. This legislation, effective for agreements entered into on or after September 1, 2025, mandates specific obligations for the removal and recycling of facility components. Here’s what you need to know to ensure compliance in your lease agreements.

Key Provisions of HB 3809: Battery Energy Storage Facilities

HB 3809, codified into law as Chapter 303 of the Texas Utilities Code, requires project lessees to undertake comprehensive decommissioning and recycling activities. The following requirements, which cannot be waived, include:

Equipment Removal:

Project lessees must remove all BESF equipment, transformers, substations, and cables to a depth of at least 3 feet below surface and fill any resulting holes with similar soil.

Project lessees must also remove overhead lines.

Upon landlord owners’ request, project lessees must remove roads, restore land to a tillable state, and reseed as appropriate.

Recycling and Disposal: Project lessees must reuse, recycle, or ship for recycling all recyclable facility components.

Project lessees must dispose of all components of the facility that are not practicably capable of being reused or recycled.

This includes the proper handling of both hazardous and non-hazardous materials to minimize environmental impact.

Not only must these recycling and disposal requirements be incorporated into a BESF lease, but they also should be included in any wind or solar lease that includes a BESF component.

Financial Assurance: The project lessees must also provide landlord owners with financial assurance covering the full cost of recycling or disposal of all facility components, less project salvage value (salvage value to exclude the amount pledged for debt) along with an estimate of these costs.

Costs and salvage value must be determined by an independent Texas-licensed engineer, with the initial estimate provided to the landlord owner on or before the 10th anniversary of the battery operations date and updated estimates provided every 5 years.

Financial assurance must be delivered by the earlier of (i) agreement termination or (ii) year 15 of the battery operations date and must remain sufficient and in place until the lessee’s decommissioning activities are completed.

Key Provisions of HB 3228: Wind or Solar Power Facilities

Chapters 301 and 302 of the Texas Utilities Code currently require both wind and solar projects to undertake comprehensive decommissioning activities. Under HB 3228, wind and solar project lessees are now required to undertake additional recycling activities for wind and solar power facilities, which include:

Recycling and Disposal: Project lessees must now collect, reuse, recycle, or ship for recycling all recyclable facility components.

Project lessees must dispose of all components of the facility that are not practicably capable of being reused or recycled.

This includes the proper handling of both hazardous and non-hazardous materials to minimize environmental impact.

Financial Assurance: HB 3228 amends the existing financial assurance requirements in Texas Utilities Code Section 301.0004 (for wind projects) and Section 302.0005 (for solar projects) to add the estimated amount of the costs of recycling and disposing of all components to the formula for calculating the amount of financial assurance. As revised, the financial assurance provided by project lessees shall be at least equal to the estimated amount by which the cost of removing the solar or wind facility from the property, recycling or disposing of all components, and restoring the property as required exceeds the salvage value of the solar or wind facility, less any portion of the value of the solar or wind facility pledged to secure outstanding debt.

Impact on Lease Agreements

The enactment of HB 3809 and HB 3228 necessitates a thorough review of existing and future lease agreements for BESFs, wind facilities, and solar facilities. Here are some key considerations:

Clarification of Responsibilities: Lease agreements must clearly delineate the responsibilities of each party concerning removal and recycling obligations. This clarity is essential to avoid disputes and ensure compliance with the new law.

Financial Planning: The requirement for financial assurance means that project lessees must engage in careful financial planning to meet these obligations. This may involve setting aside funds or securing bonds to cover potential costs.

Compliance with Environmental Standards: The recycling requirements underscore the need for compliance with environmental standards. Lease agreements should reflect these standards to ensure that all parties are aligned with the legislative intent.

Reviewing and Revising Lease Agreements

It is important to note that the changes to Chapter 301 and 302 and the new Chapter 303 of the Texas Utilities Code apply only to agreements entered into on or after the effective date of the Act, September 1, 2025. Agreements entered into before this date are governed by the law in effect at the time of the agreement. However, if amending, or amending and restating, a lease entered into prior to September 1, 2025, consider whether the new law applies.

Conclusion

The decommissioning and recycling requirements introduced via HB 3809 and HB 3228 marks a significant shift in the regulatory landscape for BESFs, wind, and solar power facilities in Texas. These new requirements emphasize the importance of comprehensive decommissioning and recycling practices and ensure that environmental standards are met and financial assurances are in place. As these changes have already taken effect, it is crucial for project lessees to review and update their lease agreements now to ensure compliance.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15872_4946.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 14:06:25.083612

Hyundai CEO José Muñoz has said the immigration raid will delay opening the battery plant by at least two to three months.
“Our investments in America are part of a long-term strategic plan.” The $2.7 billion investment confirmed Thursday will go to expanding capacity at the plant and group affiliates, Stewart said.
That includes another 250,000 vehicles out of Pune, India; and 200,000 more at Hyundai’s electric vehicle plant in Ulsan, South Korea.
The automaker said it would also deliver parts for assembly into an additional 250,000 vehicles at plants in Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and North Africa.","ATLANTA (AP) — Hyundai Motor Group on Thursday confirmed it is going forward with previously announced plans to expand its Georgia plant, just weeks after an immigration raid delayed the startup of an electric vehicle battery plant at the site.

As part of a broader investment strategy, Hyundai said it would spend $2.7 billion to increase production capacity at the Ellabell site by 200,000 over the next three years, to a total of 500,000 vehicles a year.

The company first announced the expansion in March at the grand opening of the plant west of Savannah, and had said in August that it would invest an additional $5 billion in United States overall. But the raid, which included arrests of more than 300 South Korean citizens, led to questions about the wisdom of the Asian nation investing in the U.S..

The company said it now plans to produce 10 models of electric and hybrid gas-electric vehicles in Georgia, up from the current two the plant has been assembling as it ramps up production. Hyundai says it’s still on track to expand production worldwide to 5.6 million vehicles a year by 2030. The automaker pledged that 60% of those vehicles will be electric or hybrid powered, targeting sales in South Korea, North America and Europe.

Hyundai said that it plans to make more than 80% of vehicles sold in the United States domestically by 2030, with total domestic content increasing from 60% to 80%. For the first time, the vehicles would include a mid-sized pickup truck, a key vehicle class in the U.S. market. The company already makes the Santa Cruz model, a four-door compact pickup, that it started selling in 2021.

Hyundai CEO José Muñoz has said the immigration raid will delay opening the battery plant by at least two to three months. Spokesperson Michael Stewart said Thursday that the facility will open in the first half of 2026.

Both Hyundai executives and Georgia officials have been trying to calm the situation since the raid, which mushroomed into a diplomatic dispute between South Korea and the United States.

Republican Gov. Brian Kemp told reporters Tuesday at a ceremony marking the groundbreaking of a Rivian Automotive electric vehicle plant that he remains confident Georgia’s business advantages would “win out” in terms of foreign investment. The raid may even wind up smoothing the way for South Korean employees to more easily obtain legal permission to help build and operate facilities in the United States, he said.

“I’ve had good conversations with companies that are here doing business in Georgia, companies that are looking to do business here,” Kemp said. “And I’ve had good conversations with people in the White House about the visa issue.”

Brent Stubbs, the chief administrative officer of the Ellabell site, wrote in an opinion piece published Wednesday in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the company is still committed to Georgia.

“This situation doesn’t change our plans to continue expanding and localizing in the United States,” Stubbs wrote. “Our investments in America are part of a long-term strategic plan.”

The $2.7 billion investment confirmed Thursday will go to expanding capacity at the plant and group affiliates, Stewart said. That would bring total investment in the auto plant to $10.3 billion, not counting the $4.3 billion that Hyundai and its joint-venture partner, LG Energy Solution, are putting into the battery plant.

Hyundai and its onsite affiliates currently have 3,129 employees in Ellabell, Stewart said. Hyundai pledges to hire at least 8,500 workers by the end of 2031. State and local governments have promised $2.1 billion in tax breaks and other incentives.

The boost at the Ellabell site is the biggest part Hyundai’s plan to raise production by 1.2 million vehicles a year worldwide. That includes another 250,000 vehicles out of Pune, India; and 200,000 more at Hyundai’s electric vehicle plant in Ulsan, South Korea. The automaker said it would also deliver parts for assembly into an additional 250,000 vehicles at plants in Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and North Africa.

Hyundai underlined a previous announcement to deepen its investment in robotics and said that by 2027 it would launch extended-range electric vehicles with gasoline motors to extend the range of its electric batteries to more than 600 miles (960 kilometers).",https://www.mypanhandle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/88/2025/09/68cc664e927642.35566143.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-19 13:02:52.057928

Evers proclaimed September 15-19, 2025, as “National Clean Energy Week” across the state, highlighting the importance of building a robust 21st-century clean energy economy in Wisconsin that supports green jobs, bolsters the health of our state, and ensures the clean, sustainable future Wisconsinites deserve. A copy of the governor’s proclamation is available here.

This week, Gov. Evers also announced the release of the 2025 Clean Energy Plan Progress Report, underscoring achievements made over the last year to advance goals established by the state’s first-ever Clean Energy Plan. The progress report released today details Wisconsin’s advances in reducing greenhouse gas emissions through clean energy sources while also creating thousands of new jobs and lowering energy costs for families across Wisconsin, as well as investing in job training and apprenticeship programs in innovative industries and technologies. During 2025 the Year of the Kid, the progress report also highlights stories of youth-driven initiatives, helping to create a more sustainable future for Wisconsin.

Since Day One, the Evers Administration has been committed to promoting climate resilience and building a clean energy economy in the state. In 2019, in one of his first acts as governor, Gov. Evers joined the U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of 24 governors representing nearly 60 percent of the U.S. economy and 55 percent of the U.S. population. Earlier this year, Gov. Evers was appointed a co-chair of the Alliance after being the first governor from the Midwest to join the executive committee, which oversees the strategic direction of the bipartisan coalition of governors.

In addition to joining the Alliance in 2019 Gov. Evers signed Executive Order #38 to create the Office of Sustainability and Clean Energy (OSCE), charging the office with developing the Wisconsin Clean Energy Plan to promote the development and use of clean and renewable energy across the state, advance innovative sustainability solutions that improve the state’s economy and environment, and diversify the resources used to meet the state’s energy needs. The order also established the state’s goal to reach 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2050 and charged the OSCE with ensuring the state is fulfilling the carbon reduction goals of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.

Audio File of Radio Address

Hey there, folks. Governor Tony Evers here.

This week, we’re celebrating National Clean Energy Week across the state to highlight our efforts to build the clean energy future Wisconsin deserves.

Folks, we don’t have to choose between mitigating climate change and protecting our environment and good-paying jobs and economic development—we can and should do both.

And a clean energy economy is as much about protecting the health of our communities as it is about protecting the health of our environment.

So, as governor, I’ve made protecting our environment and investing in a clean energy economy to support our 21st-century needs a top priority of my administration since Day One.

We’ve joined the U.S. Climate Alliance, created a Office of Sustainability and Clean Energy, and developed our state’s first-ever Clean Energy Plan.

We also created the Green Ribbon Commission on Clean Energy and Environmental Innovation and our Green Innovation Fund, and so much more!

And I was thrilled to sign legislation to advance the state’s nuclear energy innovation to continue our work towards ensuring Wisconsin has 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2050.

Through these efforts, we’re working to lower energy bills for families, reduce reliance on out-of-state energy sources, and invest in jobs and apprenticeship training all while building a brighter, healthier, and more prosperous future.

And while leaders in Washington continue to slash and claw back millions of dollars of federal funding for clean energy initiatives across our state, sending us backwards, this work is more important than ever.

Now is the time to roll up our sleeves and get to work, and here in Wisconsin, that’s exactly what we are going to continue to do.

So, happy National Clean Energy Week, Wisconsin, and take care.",https://drydenwire.com/site/assets/files/28127/governor-tony-evers.1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 14:05:35.613104

The federal government has ordered a 60-day review of the EV mandate.
The most recent data from Statistics Canada shows EV sales accounted for 7.7 per cent of all new vehicle sales in July.
The regulations also allow carmakers to invest in charging infrastructure to earn credits if they won’t meet their sales mandate — one credit for every $20,000 invested.
But the companies worked out these agreements years ahead of time in case sales still lagged as sales targets increased.","Kingston said it’s not clear how much money has been spent already on buying credits for the 2026 model year, which the government recently exempted from the EV sales mandate.

“I can’t tell you how much money would have already gone,” he said. “It’s committed to a multi-year contract that you could effectively option these credits as required over the coming years.”

The EV sales mandate requires that automakers ensure a certain percentage of new cars, SUVs and light-duty trucks sold are zero-emission vehicles, including plug-in hybrids.

The mandate was supposed to start at 20 per cent in 2026. Now it will begin in 2027 with an initial target of 27 per cent, rising steadily every year until 2035, when all new vehicle sales must be EVs.

The federal government has ordered a 60-day review of the EV mandate. Automakers have repeatedly called for its full repeal.

EV sales in Canada reached almost 15 per cent of total sales last year, when the government was offering consumer rebates of up to $5,000, and surpassed 18 per cent in the final three months of the year.

Sales plunged after funding for the rebate ran out in January and the government abruptly ended the program. The most recent data from Statistics Canada shows EV sales accounted for 7.7 per cent of all new vehicle sales in July.

The government paused the implementation of the mandate to help give Canada’s auto sector more liquidity in the face of U.S. tariffs.

An analysis by Anderson Economic Group suggests Canadian cars had been hit with $311 million in tariffs as of July, with another $72 million on parts made in Canada.

With 2026 models already being sold, Kingston said Tesla would be one of — if not the only — carmaker with a surplus of credits on hand to sell to other companies, since it doesn’t sell any gas-powered vehicles.

The regulations also allow carmakers to invest in charging infrastructure to earn credits if they won’t meet their sales mandate — one credit for every $20,000 invested. But the government capped that measure at 10 per cent of a company’s sales target — meaning automakers can’t buy their way out of a deficit by simply building charging stations.

Kingston said companies will almost certainly have to buy credits from other automakers like Tesla to meet their obligations.

If sales do ramp up, automakers aren’t necessarily on the hook for those credit-purchase agreements as they’re only option agreements. But the companies worked out these agreements years ahead of time in case sales still lagged as sales targets increased.

“There’s a concern that as the targets become more stringent, there’ll be fewer credits available in the marketplace,” David Adams, head of the Canadian organization representing automakers like Honda, Toyota and Hyundai, told The Canadian Press.

“So you want to make sure that you have those … credits in your back pocket in advance, so that you can utilize them when you have to.”

Like Kingston, Adams couldn’t say for sure how much money automakers have spent already on credits for the 2026 model year, noting many of the agreements are subject to nondisclosure agreements.

“You’re certainly talking millions, if not tens of millions,” Adams said.

EPA Proposes Ending Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Rules for Large, Industrial Polluters

Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lee Zeldin proposed a rule last week to end its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, Smart Cities Dive reports. This program requires over 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the country — mostly refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills — to report their greenhouse gas emissions every year without penalty.

The EPA is arguing that this annual reporting isn’t mandated by the Clean Air Act and that being forced to report their emissions hurts businesses and “[drives] up cost of living.” Despite the pushback, the reporting program has been an effective strategy to lower pollution levels: Since the EPA began collecting this data in 2008, these facilities have reported a 20% decrease in emissions. This move is one of many deregulation tactics by the current administration, erasing Biden- and Obama-era environmental protections.

US DOT Is Pulling Grants For Projects That Don’t Focus on Cars

Communities are seeing their federal transportation grants being taken away by the Trump administration, Streetsblog USA reports.

The grants being cut by the Department of Transportation were aimed at improving pedestrian and cycling infrastructure. This includes a bike trail alongside Route 66 in McLean County, Illinois; a biking and walking trail along the Naugatuck River in Connecticut; and a extending the rail trail in Albuquerque. Grantees have been instructed to instead focus on projects that promote travel by car.

These three projects were funded under the Biden administration, and local officials have been concerned for months that these grants would be revoked. In April, the department warned applicants to the Safe Streets and Roads for All grant program that infrastructure projects that reduced lane capacity for cars were less desirable.

Trump Plans To End Forest Protections for Logging and Mining

The Trump administration plans to end protections for about 45 million acres of national forest, Capital and Main reports. The government plans to allow the construction of roads, logging and mining on swaths of public land that do not have many roads.

Government officials have called the Roadless Rule, which has protected public lands from logging and road construction, too “restrictive.” Ending this protection will benefit the timber industry, but it will hurt conservation throughout the country.

Some officials have argued that this would support quicker responses to wildfires. But Capital and Main reports that a former fire chief in the Forest Service says otherwise. A study from the Wilderness Society found that forested areas that are 50 meters from roads experience almost four times more wildfire ignitions than forested areas without roads.

California Pushes to Build Denser Housing Near Transit Hubs

California’s legislature voted 21-8 last week to pass Senate Bill 79, the Abundant & Affordable Homes Near Transit Act, with Gov. Gavin Newsom to either sign or veto the bill by early October.

California will likely build denser, multifamily housing near its highest-capacity transit hubs throughout the state even if zoning laws restrict more housing, Smart Cities Dive reports. If signed, SB 79 will focus on counties in California that have at least 15 passenger rail stations. This includes San Mateo, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Santa Clara, Sacramento and Alameda.

“Building more homes in our most sustainable locations is the key to tackling the affordability crisis,” State Sen. Scott Wiener said in a press release. “Decades of overly restrictive policies have driven housing costs to astronomical levels, forcing millions of people away from jobs and transit and into long commutes.”

Public Schools Left Struggling Amid Trump Admin Funding Chaos

U.S. public school districts received emails in late June notifying that they would lose millions in federal funding, with the Trump administration freezing a $7 billion pot of promised funding, The Guardian reports. “I had teachers crying, staff members crying. They thought they were going to lose their jobs a week before school,” one Phoenix superintendent told The Guardian.

Schools struggled to keep running and to avoid staff layoffs until some of the funding was reinstated in late July after public outcry and a lawsuit that forced the administration to unfreeze funds. Still, school leaders say they can’t rely on government funding anymore: The current House budget proposal would cut federal funds for disabled students and schools serving low-income students, and Department of Education grants addressing teacher shortages and disability services have also been cut.

The Economic Engine of Capex The buildout of data centers and the power grid may offer the best opportunity to generate sustained growth.
Data Centers Require Power According to the Department of Energy, U.S. data center electricity consumption could double or triple by 2028.
The PwC study for the Data Center Coalition found that from 2017 to 2021, U.S. data centers added $2.1 trillion to GDP.
As noted by Goldman Sachs: “Generative artificial intelligence has the potential to automate many work tasks and eventually boost global economic growth.","Could data centers and the power grid be America’s next “renaissance?” With the U.S. national debt exceeding $37 trillion and interest payments surpassing defense spending, many articles have been written about the “debt doomsday” event coming. Such was a point we made in “The Debt and Deficit Problem.”

“In recent months, much debate has been about rising debt and increasing deficit levels in the U.S. For example, here is a recent headline from CNBC:”

“The article’s author suggests that U.S. federal deficits are ballooning, with spending surging due to the combined impact of tax cuts, expansive stimulus, and entitlement expenditures. Of course, with institutions like Yale, Wharton, and the CBO warning that this trend has pushed interest costs to new heights, now exceeding defense outlays, concerns about domestic solvency are rising. Even prominent figures in the media, from Larry Summers to Ray Dalio, argue that drastic action is urgently needed, otherwise another “financial crisis” is imminent.”

As we discussed in that article, the “purveyors of doom” have been saying the same thing for the last two decades, yet the American growth engine continues chugging along. Notably, Ray Dalio and Larry Summers focus on only one solution: “cutting spending,” which has horrible economic consequences.

“Furthermore, investors must understand a critical accounting concept: that the government’s debt is the household’s asset. In accounting, for every debit there is a credit that must always equal zero. In this case, when the Government issues debt (a debit), it is sent into the economy for infrastructure, defense, social welfare, etc. That money is “credited” to the bank accounts of households and corporations. Therefore, when the deficit increases, that money winds up in economic activity, and vice versa. In other words, those shouting for sharp deficit reductions are also rooting for a deep economic recession.” – The Deficit Narrative

The other challenges with cutting spending are that it is politically toxic, and tax hikes drag on growth.

However, one solution that all the mainstream “doomsayers” overlook is raising productivity and GDP through private-sector capital investment. In other words, as the U.S. did following World War II, it is possible to “grow your way out of your debt problem.”

That’s where the AI data center boom and massive electricity demand come in.

The Economic Engine of Capex

The buildout of data centers and the power grid may offer the best opportunity to generate sustained growth. The scale of investment is large enough to matter, the economic multipliers are high, and the timeline aligns with when fiscal pressure will peak.

Data centers are the backbone of the digital economy. AI models, cloud platforms, and automation rely on them, and each large AI model requires thousands of GPUs housed in purpose-built facilities. These are not minor server rooms. They are $1 billion-plus industrial complexes. But, for the build-out of “data factories” to impact economic growth, a massive investment will be required to affect a $30 trillion (nominal) U.S. economy.

How much are we talking about? As noted in our previous article on data center demand, McKinsey projects that data center investment will reach $7 trillion globally by 2030. Over 40 percent of that will happen in the U.S. Alone. Moreover, Nvidia’s latest quarterly report forecasted data center capital expenditures by Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet to reach $4 trillion by 2030, or roughly $1 trillion annually.

However, you can’t build a data center without power.

Data Centers Require Power

According to the Department of Energy, U.S. data center electricity consumption could double or triple by 2028. Deloitte expects a 30-fold increase in AI-related data center power usage by 2035, reaching 123 gigawatts. That’s more than the total residential demand in California. This means building new substations, transmission lines, and power plants. Therefore, as noted by Edison Electric Institute, investor-owned U.S. electric utilities will invest more than $1.1 trillion in the 2025-2029 period to meet that demand.

This infrastructure boom will not be optional. AI development needs low latency, which requires local capacity and reliable electricity. Since data centers are capital-intensive and mission-critical, the U.S. economy could see between $1.25 and $1.5 trillion in annual capex spending.

Why is that critical to our “debt to GDP” concerns? Large-scale capital spending is one of the few economic inputs reliably boosting long-term growth. Unlike stimulus checks or tax credits, infrastructure spending creates durable productivity improvements. We are already seeing this impact.

The PwC study for the Data Center Coalition found that from 2017 to 2021, U.S. data centers added $2.1 trillion to GDP. That’s before the AI acceleration began.

According to Reuters, in Q2 2025, AI-related capex accounted for over one-third of real GDP growth, which added roughly 0.4 percentage points to quarterly GDP.

The Multiplier Effect

But it isn’t just $1 trillion in CapEx. These projects create upstream demand for construction, power equipment, semiconductors, cooling systems, and skilled labor. They support engineering, real estate, logistics, and utility services. Most notably, they set the stage for sustained gains in productivity. Once operational, AI systems reduce costs, improve decision-making, and enable scale in industries from health care to manufacturing. In other words, there is a “multiplier effect” to these projects. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) estimates that every $1 billion in infrastructure investment creates 13,000 jobs and adds $3 billion to GDP over a decade.

Therefore, by 2030, if the $5 trillion in combined investment in AI data centers and power generation comes to fruition, the U.S. economy will see an additional $15 trillion in growth. The chart below shows the average 5-year growth rate in nominal GDP and projected growth.

The chart below assumes we will continue to issue debt at the average quarterly pace since 2021. However, instead of wasting money, we focus on productive investments while maintaining all current spending programs and obligations. Assuming some conservative growth estimates resulting from the investments, the “debt to GDP” ratio will begin declining in 2026 and revert to more sustainable levels by 2030.

However, this isn’t a guarantee, but it is certainly potentially more realistic than a “debt crisis” that sends the U.S. into an economic depression.

Risks and Constraints

The growth opportunity is significant, but not risk-free. While the bears constantly ring the alarm bell about the current level of debt and deficits, the more dire economic consequences they forecast may fail to come to fruition.

As noted by Goldman Sachs:

“Generative artificial intelligence has the potential to automate many work tasks and eventually boost global economic growth. AI will start having a measurable impact on US GDP in 2027 and begin affecting growth in other economies worldwide in the following years. The foundation of the forecast is the finding that AI could ultimately automate around 25% of labor tasks in advanced economies and 10-20% of work in emerging economies.”

They currently estimate a growth boost to GDP from AI of 0.4 percentage points in the US.

Increases in productivity, productive capital investment, and increased labor demand for the infrastructure buildout (which will also result in higher wages) should provide the economic boost needed.

Conclusion

Will it solve all of the current socio-economic ills facing the U.S.? No. However, it may provide the growth boost necessary to revitalize economic growth and prosperity in the U.S., which we have not seen since the 1970s. But there are risks to this outlook.

The scale of spending may lift electricity prices. A study from NC State found national prices could rise 8 percent by 2030, with some localities seeing 20–25 percent jumps. If not managed, this could erode industrial competitiveness.

Jobs per dollar of investment are low. Data centers are automated. Once built, they require few workers. A $1 billion facility may employ only 100 people full-time.

There is a local backlash. Projects require land, water, and energy. Communities are resisting tax incentives and environmental costs. Several counties have imposed moratoriums.

Permitting delays and regulatory hurdles remain high. The average interconnection wait for new power projects is over 3 years. Without reform, many AI investments will be delayed or redirected.

The government will need to be involved to unlock the full economic benefit.

Public policy must streamline permitting, including environmental review, grid interconnection, and land use.

Given that infrastructure and national security are at stake, a public/private partnership should be involved.

Tax policy should avoid distortion. Many subsidies go to projects that were already economically viable.

The focus should be on shared infrastructure, such as transmission lines, regional data hubs, and reliability upgrades.

Utilities need regulatory clarity. Traditional cost-of-service models may not align with the fast pace of AI demand, so performance-based rates or return-on-equity mechanisms may be required.

Energy policy must support generation diversity. Solar and wind are inefficient, and AI demands require firm natural gas, nuclear, and advanced storage capacity.

The goal should be energy abundance. High reliability, low prices, and scalable infrastructure will attract private AI investment and increase growth.

It may also just be enough to keep the demise of the U.S. from occurring any time soon.",https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Electric-Power-Grid-e1716919382866.png,N,,2025-09-19 14:05:53.650570

Bosch, the world’s biggest automotive supplier, has reserved a “significant” share of the plant’s annual magnet production, Neo said in a statement on Friday after signing a multi-year memorandum of understanding with the German firm.

The plant in Estonia is offering a chance to lock in supply chains at a time of global trade tensions, including over rare earths with China. Europe and the world’s vulnerabilities were exposed earlier this year when Beijing in April heavily restricted the export of some of its rare earths in retaliation against US President Donald Trump’s decision to hike tariffs on Chinese goods.

European Union companies incurred seven production stoppages in August because of shortages in rare earths, and an additional 46 are expected this month, the EU Chamber of Commerce in China said Thursday, without specifying the scale or nature of the affected facilities.

Neo’s Estonian plant manufactures neodymium magnets, one of the products restricted by China. The magnets convert the electricity stored in a battery into motion, helping rotate the wheels of EVs. They are also used widely from smartphones to wind turbines and fighter jets.

A shortage of rare earth magnet supplies earlier this year forced Ford Motor Co. to idle production of its Explorer sport utility vehicle in Chicago for a week.

Neo - which is also active in chemicals and metals and has 10 manufacturing plants globally, including in the United States and China - made the decision to build the new factory in Estonia in late 2022, months after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine disrupted Europe’s economy. Neo managed to complete its site on time and within budget, Suleman said.

“With the exception of Neo there is no EV traction motor magnet manufacturing capacity in the West,” Marvin Wolff, an analyst at Paradigm Capital, said in an Aug. 12 report.

The plant will initially produce 2,000 tons of magnets per year, about a tenth of the demand in Europe. The factory will source its own raw materials from Australia.

Neo has signed “multiple” five- to seven-year contracts in the range of $50-$100 million, Suleman said, adding that major deliveries are set to begin in 2026.

“This is the most important critical materials project happening in Europe today,” Suleman said in an interview ahead of the factory opening.

Neo plans to triple capacity there after an expansion that could begin in 2027. It would cater to soaring demand fueled by European carmakers, who are pivoting toward EVs ahead of a 2035 deadline to ban the sale of new vehicles with combustion engines.

While there are signs that the EU directive may be watered down - German Chancellor Friedrich Merz last week backed a bid by his country’s carmakers to soften the rules - the direction of travel toward more EVs isn’t in doubt.

BMW AG, Volkswagen AG and Mercedes-Benz Group AG all showed off new EV models at the Munich auto show last week that they said would put them in a position to take on intensifying competition from China.

The magnets trade is expected to be among the thorniest items for negotiation when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet at the end of October on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in South Korea.

While China has recently eased its rare-earths controls - exports rose to a highest monthly level in August since at least 2012, according to Bloomberg calculations based on Chinese customs data - Beijing’s earlier weaponization of its market dominance has spurred Western companies to look for alternative suppliers.

Last month, GM signed a deal with Texas-based Noveon Magnetics Inc. to secure rare-earth magnets for its full-size pickup trucks and SUVs. Along with contracts with Las Vegas-based MP Materials Corp. and E-Vac Magnetics, a South Carolina-based unit of Germany’s Vacuumschmelze GmbH, GM plans to get the majority of rare-earth magnets it sources directly from domestic suppliers.

MP Materials, the sole US rare earths miner, will have annual capacity exceeding Neo’s, with production slated to start later this year. The company will also serve customers including Apple Inc. and has plans to add a Pentagon-funded factory to expand production.

Neo though is first out of the gate - much to the delight of Canada and the EU.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen passed around a magnet from Neo’s plant in the Baltic country at a Group of Seven meeting in Kananaskis, western Canada in June. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney brandished a sample during a speech, hailing his nation as one with “immense potential” as a rare-earths supplier.

“Everyone else frankly in the industry is generally making promises about what they’ll be doing in the future,” Neo’s Suleman said. “We built it in under 500 days.”

“Energy prices continue to skyrocket as Trump blocks clean energy investment, and these bills will only ensure that rates continue to climb.”","The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill Thursday that could give dispatchable power plants priority in interconnection queues.

“The interconnection queue is overwhelmed and bogged down, leaving shovel-ready power projects waiting for years while demand continues to climb,” Rep. Troy Balderson, R-Ohio and the bill’s sponsor, said in a press release.

Under the GRID Power Act, FERC would have 60 days to review proposals from regional transmission organizations and independent system operators for specific projects that would be pushed to the head of interconnection queues.

The RTOs and ISOs would have to show the proposed projects would bolster grid reliability and resilience, according to the legislation. The bill defines dispatchable power as “an electric energy generation resource capable of providing known and forecastable electric supply in time intervals necessary to ensure grid reliability.”

The bill requires FERC to start a rulemaking process to implement the legislation within 90 days after the bill becomes law and to complete the rulemaking within 180 days.

Sens. John Hoeven, R-N.D., and Todd Young, R-Ind., have introduced a companion bill in the Senate.

The Electric Power Supply Association, a trade group for power producers, supports the bill.

“It has been surprising to hear that opponents of the GRID [Power] Act believe that this process will become chronic or habit-forming for grid operators or somehow represents a permanent barrier or level of discrimination against non-dispatchable projects,” EPSA President and CEO Todd Snitcher said in a “backgrounder” on the bill. “If the immediate reliability need doesn’t exist or can’t be explained, and FERC isn’t convinced both to the urgency and efficiency of the proposal, then queue prioritization doesn’t take place.”

The Sierra Club said the bill — along with two other energy bills that passed the House Thursday — would hamper efforts to build cleaner, more reliable energy sources, like wind and solar, that can be built more quickly than fossil-fueled power plants.

“House Republicans have continued the claim they want abundant, affordable, American-sourced energy while doing everything in their power to block clean energy progress and prop up dirty, expensive energy sources of the past,” Beyond Fossil Fuels Policy Director Mahyar Sorour said in a statement. “Energy prices continue to skyrocket as Trump blocks clean energy investment, and these bills will only ensure that rates continue to climb.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/pM37JHXejhCdo9pPo3j6rKtzv2-JpPZcX87dXtWoR4E/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9ESklfMDIwOC1jcm9wLWUxNTg5OTA3NTc2NTI4LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-19 12:05:47.743887

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman David Rosner laid out his priorities during his first open meeting on Thursday as head of the agency, including a desire to issue guidance soon on how data centers can be colocated with power plants in the PJM Interconnection.

“My priorities as chairman are the same as when I was a commissioner,” Rosner said. “I’m working hard with my colleagues to make decisions swiftly, fairly and independently. Grid reliability as job number one has not changed.”

Rosner, a Democrat, replaced Mark Christie, a Republican, as FERC chairman after Christie left the agency in early August. Rosner joined FERC in June 2024. With Republicans Laura Swett and David LaCerte advancing through the Senate confirmation process to fill the agency’s two empty seats, it’s unclear how long Rosner will remain chairman.

In discussing his priorities, Rosner said he is focused on enabling economic growth through “abundant and affordable energy.”

He said he is “really excited” about infrastructure.

“I think we need to build, build, build,” Rosner said. “America needs every electron and every molecule of every type we can get, and we need more infrastructure to move it … Reliable and affordable energy, it’s not only a prerequisite to ensuring the safety and security of the American people, but it’s also totally critical to winning the AI race, reshoring manufacturing and ensuring a prosperous economy.”

FERC is focused on developing “accurate, clear, stable market price signals to get new infrastructure built in places where it’s needed,” Rosner said. That means connecting new generation to the grid faster, and fair and fast decisions on issues related to pipelines, hydropower, liquefied natural gas and transmission lines, he said.

Tackling the PJM colocation review

Resolving the pending PJM colocation docket is a top priority, according to Rosner. Under colocation arrangements data centers receive electricity directly from a nearby power plant.

“It’s also a very complicated topic,” Rosner said. “My colleagues and I have been working hard on this. I’m really excited about colocation and everything in between, and getting the rules of the road in place so that we can unlock all these new technologies, get them on the grid and get data centers built.”

FERC Commissioner Lindsay See echoed Rosner’s comments on the colocation proceeding.

“My office has been deeply engaged on these matters, and I look forward to being able to bring it to a close,” See said.

In an interview, Christie lamented his inability to issue a colocation decision before he left the agency on Aug. 8.

“I pushed very hard for a set of guidelines — which is what all the regulated entities were asking — that would protect consumers from cost shifting and protect reliability, and I couldn’t get two other votes,” Christie said Thursday.

The outcome of the review could set a precedent for colocated load in the power markets FERC oversees.

Speedy decisions vs. regulatory certainty

During FERC’s open meeting, See said part of her goal at FERC is to get the “tension right” between making decisions quickly and regulatory certainty.

“I never want us to be the holdup when it comes to necessary development of infrastructure and permitting decisions,” See said. “We play a critical role in doing needed policy in a fair, predictable and legally durable way.”

See noted that while attending Gastech, an annual trade show, in Milan earlier this month, she spoke to leaders in the gas industry “who said that as much as they value speed in what we do — and trust me, they do — they also want strong confidence that the orders we issue are worth their weight, and they will stand up when they’re tested in court.”

See said she hopes in the near future FERC will launch a process to create a “blanket certificate” program for LNG export facilities modeled after one FERC has for gas pipelines and other facilities. A blanket certificate allows a gas company to undertake certain routine activities on their facilities without obtaining specific permission from FERC for each individual project.

The United States has become the largest LNG exporter in the world, with exports totaling 11.9 billion cubic feet per day last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The U.S. has eight LNG export terminals that can handle 14.5 Bcf/d and another eight are being built that could export about 21.8 Bcf/d, according to FERC.

Average residential electricity rates jumped 6.6% over last year as of June, with the largest increases in Maine, up 25.5%, the District of Columbia, up 23.3%, and New Jersey, up 21%, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

All sectors saw an increase in price, as measured in revenues per kWh, with a total average increase of 5.2% over last June to 13.88 cents/kWh. But the rise was not evenly distributed. Residential customers saw the highest increase, followed by transportation, up 6.1%; the industrial sector, up 5.1%; and the commercial sector, up 4.8%.

Also, natural gas prices at the Henry Hub soared 22.6% to $3.11 per million British thermal units in June from June 2024, the EIA said in its most recent Electricity Monthly Update. Gas prices help set wholesale power prices, which affect electricity bills over time.

Dive Insight:

Differences in how utilities report costs mean it’s hard to say exactly which pressures have made the greatest contributions to rising electric prices, said Shannon Baker-Branstetter, senior director of domestic climate policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy research and advocacy organization. CAP did its own analysis based on utility rate filings that found U.S. residential electricity rates rose 7% between June 2024 and June 2025.

But to date, rising natural gas prices paired with growing demand seem to account for the bulk of requested utility rate increases, Baker-Branstetter said. The EIA expects gas prices to rise to $4/MMBtu this year from $2.20/MMBtu last year.

Some of the growing demand is from artificial intelligence data centers that have stressed utilities’ budgets as operators push for more infrastructure projects on top of grid upgrades that were probably already overdue, Baker-Branstetter said. Extreme weather has also increased utilities’ costs. But the full impact of tariffs and the loss of clean energy tax credits has yet to show up in electrical rates, they said.

“We are definitely seeing, at a most basic level, an increase in demand and constraints in supply,” Baker-Branstetter said.

At least 102 gas and electric utilities have either raised or proposed higher rates that would go into effect in 2025 or 2026, according to CAP. These rate cases could raise Americans’ total electric bills by some $67 billion.

CAP’s conclusions echo those of a different report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. That also said natural gas and a loss of federal support for renewable energy would drive up prices.

Rising rates have already triggered a public backlash that is raising the pressure on elected representatives and regulators.

Indiana’s governor recently pressed for lower utility rates from investor-owned utilities, saying “We can’t take it anymore.”

The Arizona attorney general has also opposed a proposed rate hike in that state and said regulators should consider lowering rates instead.

Electricity prices have also popped up as a political issue in New Hampshire, New Jersey and throughout much of the PJM Interconnection.

Concerns about affordability could lead to greater scrutiny of utility requests in the future, Baker-Branstetter said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/dYEG87f2O5sRYVeNjuO-TAufKGCXA0K9ZtFo_1PTMAg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9DZWRhcl9DcmVla19HYXNfUGxhbnQuanBn.webp,N,,2025-09-19 12:08:16.791855

Siemens: Bridging digital and energy realities

Siemens plays a pivotal role in the energy transition by integrating digital solutions with energy systems.

Through its Electrification X, the company merges real and digital realms, advancing electrification and automation to help tackle challenges in the energy transition.

This software aids renewable energy providers such as data centres and transmission system operators, in managing energy networks, enhancing uptime, improving reliability and optimising energy efficiency.

Siemens also contributes financially, helping new markets and technologies within the clean energy sector to flourish.

Notably, Siemens has played a part in financing over 18 gigawatts of wind and solar power plants globally.

Carl Ennis, CEO of Siemens UK & Ireland, says: “We must support business and industry to decarbonise if we are to successfully deliver the energy transition we need.

“A clear industrial strategy is a key piece of the puzzle and would give businesses the confidence to invest meaningfully in cutting carbon, while boosting economic growth and productivity.

“Over the next few years, adopting clean energy technology and digitalisation software that can help accelerate the transition to net zero will become instrumental, and we need to give companies the right platform to do so.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/16b18bbd9f5b3f906690e0eb65aa35ae:44e9d5022b77e9749360bc3cecb00397/a9848a93-4fe0-4d32-a348-ac01aa73da64.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 15:02:13.181490

Working with businesses, nonprofits or local governments, each fellow contributed to projects that both supported local organizations and advanced their own professional goals.

Administered by IU’s Environmental Resilience Institute , McKinney Climate Fellows connects undergraduate and graduate students to full-time, paid summer positions to work on climate, energy and community resilience projects. IU students are encouraged to apply for the summer 2026 cohort now through Nov. 1.

Growing sustainability knowledge at Newfields

For Caroline Pennington, a Kelley School of Business student, becoming a McKinney Climate Fellow was a chance to align her interest in economic consulting with her commitment to sustainability. At Newfields — the 152-acre campus that includes the Indianapolis Museum of Art — Pennington spent her summer conducting a waste audit and working with staff to improve recycling and composting efforts.

“When applying for internships and professional development experiences, I knew that I wanted something more out of the ordinary for business students, but something that still meant a lot to me,” she said. “When one of my professors told me about McKinney Climate Fellows, I jumped at the chance to apply.”

In addition to the waste audit, Pennington worked with Newfields’ natural resources department to remove invasive plant species and plant more native species throughout the grounds. Each day, she relished walking the grounds, with forested paths, gardens and fountains.

“It’s just a beautiful place to be,” she said.

Supporting rural resilience through community engagement

IU Southeast junior Owen Harmon said the McKinney Climate Fellows opened his eyes to the role students can play in supporting rural communities.

As a member of the Environmental Resilience Institute’s Indiana Resilience Funding Hub, Harmon researched funding opportunities for rural community projects, collaborated with local leaders and visited rural libraries to discuss solar projects.

“I believe that the most important thing I learned from my internship is that change starts on such a small scale, and that just one person or a small group can do so much to bring about positive change,” he said.

Harmon, who is majoring in geoscience with a minor in sustainability, said the program gave him his first taste of working in a professional environment and the confidence to pursue future career paths.

“It taught me that it’s not so scary working with professionals in the field, and that at the end of the day we’re all the same, just people,” he said.

Cutting food waste, boosting energy efficiency

At Second Helpings, an Indianapolis nonprofit that turns surplus food into thousands of meals each year, IU Bloomington student Sophie DeWael showcased a mix of technical and operational skills.

DeWael, who is studying environmental and sustainability studies with a concentration in sustainable food systems, created an online dashboard to track the organization’s environmental impact, helped secure a $10,000 sustainability grant and jumped into daily operations — from food rescue to kitchen prep.

“She fit right in with the culture here and really got to work,” said Nora Spitznogle, Second Helpings’ chief program officer.

DeWael’s dashboard now helps the nonprofit measure emissions reductions, track waste diversion and set future sustainability goals. The experience reaffirmed her interest in sustainable food systems and showed her the power of local action.

North Carolina is among the leading states in electric vehicle batteries and manufacturing, as the industry booms in the Southeast. Companies have announced over $20 billion in EV and battery manufacturing projects in North Carolina, including over 16,000 new jobs.

“Investments in EVs and batteries, particularly in Georgia and North Carolina, were the largest economic development projects ever in the history of those states,” said Stan Cross, electric transportation director for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, which studied EV adoption.

The bulk of that investment in North Carolina comes from the $14 billion Toyota battery manufacturing plant in Liberty, N.C. The Charlotte region has seen similar investments, including those from direct current charger manufacturer Alpitronic and commercial vehicle manufacturer Daimler.

“Of the top four states that have investments in manufacturing EVs and batteries and such, three of them are in the Southeast: Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee,” said Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy.

Michigan was number one. EV and battery manufacturing and sales in the Southeast have grown rapidly despite less public funding. The Southeast has received slightly more than half the national average.

But storm clouds are gathering: Private investments are slowing down, and some companies have canceled projects altogether. California-based battery manufacturer Natron Energy abandoned plans to build a $1.4 billion battery manufacturing plant in Kingsboro, N.C., news outlets reported. The project promised to create 1,000 jobs in Edgecombe County. The state was prepared to reimburse costs up to 21.7 million dollars, but the company failed to raise sufficient capital to complete the project. The site would have been the country’s first sodium-ion battery gigafactory.

Nigro said it’s too soon to tell if these market contractions were caused by federal policy shifts.

“If I had to put my money on it, a lot of these cancellations that we’ve seen this year — whether we’re talking about electric vehicles or batteries — were just going to happen anyway,” Nigro said.

Although the Southeast lags the rest of the country, EV sales in N.C. have steadily grown since 2020. The same can be said for S.C., albeit at a much slower rate. It remains to be seen if Trump’s repeal of the clean energy tax credits will cause EV sales to plateau or decrease in market share.

The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocated nearly $5 billion to expand EV charging infrastructure through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, or NEVI.. The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocated nearly $5 billion to expand EV charging infrastructure. The North Carolina Department of Transportation anticipated receiving $109 million; however, the Trump administration paused the program in February and has not issued new guidance for states since.

“The entire globe is moving to electrification, and if the U.S. is going to have an auto industry in the future, we have to have a really robust electric vehicle manufacturing base,” Nigro said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5ee3891/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2034x1068+0+44/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1a%2Fe0%2Fbef3f84546a684a8e511b7e37602%2F072721-ev-home-charging.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 12:05:17.337286

In May, Reeves went further, noting during his Power Play Summit that “the future is going to be nuclear,” a sign of state-level support for nuclear power development in some capacity.
State officials have said Mississippi is open to expanding its current nuclear power generation, which currently sits at one facility, Entergy’s Grand Gulf Nuclear Station near Port Gibson.
The USEIA reports that the 1,400-megawatt Grand Gulf Nuclear Power Station is the largest single-reactor nuclear power plant by net summer generating capacity in the nation.
Mississippi’s willingness to further explore nuclear power and its proactive attitude are positive signs for the state, the CEO said.","“Economic development in the future is going to go to places where you have affordable and reliable power,” PSC Commissioner De’Keither Stamps said.

With billions of dollars in economic development projects coming to Mississippi, including multiple data centers, reliable and affordable energy is needed to power these new facilities as they require substantial amounts of electricity.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (USEIA), natural gas accounted for 76 percent of Mississippi’s electricity net generation in 2023 and was the primary fuel used at nine of the state’s ten largest power plants.

However, to meet the demands of the future, one energy source state officials are exploring is nuclear power.

Governor Tate Reeves (R) has shown an openness to support nuclear power during his announcements of these large-scale projects, saying he supports all energy sources if they are safe, reliable, and affordable.

In May, Reeves went further, noting during his Power Play Summit that “the future is going to be nuclear,” a sign of state-level support for nuclear power development in some capacity.

Last year, the Mississippi Public Service Commission also threw its support behind nuclear power. The three-member commission passed a resolution stating the PCS recognizes nuclear power as “a clean baseload energy necessary to achieve a reliable, secure, and diversified electric grid.”

Chris Brown (R), the Northern District PSC Commissioner and the group’s chairman, said three major benefits of nuclear power are resiliency, reliability, and affordability. The PSC oversees a wide range of public utility regulation, including power generation.

State officials have said Mississippi is open to expanding its current nuclear power generation, which currently sits at one facility, Entergy’s Grand Gulf Nuclear Station near Port Gibson.

The USEIA reports that the 1,400-megawatt Grand Gulf Nuclear Power Station is the largest single-reactor nuclear power plant by net summer generating capacity in the nation. The plant generated about 16 percent of the state’s electricity in 2023.

Commissioner Brown believes being open to more nuclear power generation shows the world “Mississippi is open for business.” In November, Brown went further, telling the Senate Energy Committee, “We think nuclear is our future.”

Last fall, at an PSC-sponsored Nuclear Summit, Central District Commissioner De’Keither Stamps (D) said nuclear energy is linked to Mississippi’s economic development.

“Economic development in the future is going to go to places where you have affordable and reliable power,” Stamps said. “And one of the most affordable and reliable power sources is nuclear.”

With Mississippi already having three data centers under construction, AWS, AVAIO and Compass, Brown said nuclear power will make the Magnolia State more attractive to similar industries.

“Securing the power connection is typically the biggest hurdle for a data center,” an AVAIO spokesperson said.

Data centers and the rise of AI-powered tools have created unprecedented demand for computing power, wrote Robert Rapier in Forbes earlier this year.

“These complex models require massive amounts of electricity not just during training, but continuously during deployment (or inference) as well,” Rapier wrote. “This isn’t just about a few extra servers. AI data centers are power-hungry operations, often requiring the energy equivalent of a small city. Some estimates suggest that U.S. data centers could consume more electricity by 2030 than entire countries such as Japan or Turkey.”

Rapier notes that electric utilities from Texas to Virginia are scrambling to adapt to this new energy strain on the grid.

“The challenges are both technical and political. Meeting these new demands often requires massive upgrades to transmission infrastructure—projects that can take five to ten years to permit and build. Meanwhile, delays frustrate developers and risk driving AI firms to seek power from independent suppliers or alternative locations,” Rapier wrote. “Utility companies are being forced to rethink everything: where and how they build generation, how they plan grid expansions, and how to regulate and forecast demand. The traditional demand modeling tools that rely on historical trends are no longer sufficient in this brave new world.”

There has been speculation about another nuclear facility in Mississippi to help with energy generation in this new tech environment, particularly in Tishomingo County’s Yellow Creek. For half a decade, Huntsville, Alabama-based Flibe Energy has spent more than $250 million on site improvements. Yet, it remains unclear when and if the site would receive approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Flibe’s Chief Executive Officer Kirk Sorensen was in attendance at the state’s Power Play Summit. Mississippi’s willingness to further explore nuclear power and its proactive attitude are positive signs for the state, the CEO said.

“This aligns perfectly with our vision for Mississippi’s energy landscape, where our Yellow Creek operations could play a critical role in regional energy security,” Sorenson said.

In 1978, the Tennessee Valley Authority started construction on the Yellow Creek nuclear power plant but abandoned its work in 1983. The TVA abandoned the project in 1984 due to cost and lower electrical demands, according to the New York Times.

Sorenson emphasized to Governor Reeves how rising uranium costs – a vital material in nuclear reactors – threaten conventional nuclear economics, while Flibe’s thorium-based Lithium Fluoride Thorium Reactor technology offers a promising alternative with significantly lower fuel and construction expenses.

“Flibe Energy remains committed to working alongside Mississippi stakeholders to advance thorium energy as a safe, affordable, and sustainable power solution for the region,” Sorenson said.

President Donald Trump (R) called for 10 nuclear power facilities to be built by 2030 in a recent executive order, with accelerated licensing timelines, construction of reactors for the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. Department of Defense use, and support for nuclear fuel cycle infrastructure.

Mississippi officials are not sure if the state will see a nuclear power plant approved by way of the executive orders, but they are hopeful.

“Mississippi can make it happen,” said Commissioner Brown, adding that a nuclear reactor has not been built in four decades.

If Mississippi does gain more nuclear facilities, the commissioner said he would like to see institutions of higher learning offer courses in nuclear facility management. Currently, many nuclear reactor employees are at or near retirement age, and the younger generation is not gravitating towards the industry.",https://magnoliatribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Grand_Gulf.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 12:05:56.079487

But without steel, the foundation of every solar project, ambition alone will not be enough.","The American steel market has rarely looked this tight. Domestic mills are booked through the end of 2025, and customers across industries are scrambling to secure material. For builders, automakers, and renewable energy developers, the supply pipeline is simply clogged.

What could have been dismissed as a normal cycle has been hardened into something far more serious. Trade policies have compounded the shortage. The 25 percent Section 232 tariff has been in place since 2018, but in June 2025, the U.S. doubled the duty to 50 percent, Council on Foreign Relations, April 2025. For India, which shipped nearly half a billion dollars of iron and steel to the U.S. last year, the move was crippling. These duties may have been meant to shield domestic producers from oversupply abroad, but the timing could not be worse for downstream industries that depend on steady inputs to keep projects moving.

India’s role

India is not America’s largest steel supplier; Canada, Brazil, and South Korea dominate in tonnage. Yet India fills a strategic niche, exporting specialized flat-rolled and structural products that are difficult to substitute. These grades flow directly into infrastructure and renewable energy projects.

In 2024, U.S. imports from India totaled roughly 487 million dollars. That number looks modest against the nation’s overall steel trade, but the concentration matters. Much of it ends up in solar farms, racking systems, and modular structures. Developers favored Indian material not only because it was cost-competitive, but also because it reliably met the standards of strength and galvanization. The new tariffs cut off that option overnight.

Solar in the crosshairs

Few industries feel the squeeze as sharply as solar. Steel is not just an input; it is the skeleton of every project. Mounting structures, racking, and single-axis trackers are all steel-intensive. Their performance—resistance to wind loads, corrosion protection, and structural integrity over 25 years—depends on reliable material.

These systems account for 10% to 15% of a project’s total cost.. Tariffs that push up prices by half have an immediate and painful effect on project economics. Developers who set budgets in 2024 are finding those numbers obsolete. Worse, the problem is not only about price, but also about availability. Mills are oversold, and even buyers who are prepared to pay more often cannot get the tonnage they need. That reality is already rippling into project schedules, said a report from Reuters. Developers are stretching timelines, postponing installations into 2026, and revising financial models to account for higher capital expenditure. Every delay slows the renewable energy buildout that federal and state policies are trying to accelerate.

A double squeeze

The tariff shock is only half the story. At the same time, U.S. solar manufacturers have asked the Department of Commerce to impose anti-dumping and countervailing duties on solar cells and modules imported from India, said Reuters. Their claim is that Indian producers are subsidized and are pricing below cost. If those duties are enacted, it will raise module prices just as mounting structures are already becoming more expensive.

That creates a double squeeze. On one side, the steel that holds solar projects together is harder to get and more costly. On the other hand, the panels that generate electricity may soon face their own barriers. Margins erode. Installations stall. The U.S. loses ground in global competitiveness as other countries press ahead with lower-cost renewable energy deployments.

What executives should do

For senior leaders, this is not a problem to watch passively. It demands action. Several strategic responses stand out.

Manage price risk proactively:

Steel prices are already climbing, and they will climb further. Companies must consider hedging, locking in long-term fixed contracts, or building pricing flexibility into customer agreements. Waiting to see where the market settles is a gamble few can afford.

Prepare for project delays.:

Supply constraints are real. Executives should not assume that paying more will solve the problem. Instead, project teams need to evaluate phased or staggered execution and communicate realistic timelines to regulators, investors, and customers. Transparency now will preserve trust later.

Reinforce investor confidence:

Trade volatility has made financing more complicated. Lenders want predictability, but right now, uncertainty dominates. Developers who can demonstrate diversified sourcing strategies, strong supplier relationships, or alternative procurement pathways will be better positioned to secure capital.

Consider vertical integration or partnerships:

Some firms are exploring joint ventures with domestic steelmakers to secure priority access. Others are weighing in-house fabrication for racking and trackers. Neither option is inexpensive, but both reduce exposure to tariff risk and improve supply reliability.

Policy questions

The shortage also exposes a policy dilemma. On the one hand, tariffs protect domestic producers and manufacturing jobs. On the other hand, they slow renewable deployment at a time when the Inflation Reduction Act and state mandates are pushing the U.S. to build clean power at unprecedented speed.

Targeted exemptions for renewable infrastructure may be the most pragmatic answer. Section 232 has been flexed this way before when supply shortages threatened national interest. A carve-out for solar would not eliminate the challenges, but would alleviate the most severe bottlenecks.

Another path is to encourage domestic capacity dedicated to renewable-grade steel. Incentives for galvanizing lines, structural production, or lightweight flat-rolled materials could build resilience over time. But new capacity takes years and billions of dollars. It will not help developers already facing delays.

The global dimension

This is not just an American problem. Steel markets are tight everywhere. Europe and Southeast Asia are also competing for supply to support their own infrastructure programs and energy transitions. Diverting imports from one region to another is not realistic.

India, for its part, has begun imposing safeguard duties on certain imports to shield its producers, Economic Times, August 2025. That signals a more protectionist posture globally. U.S. buyers should not assume they can simply pivot to other suppliers without encountering similar headwinds.

A pivotal moment

The U.S. now faces a crossroads. Trade protection has long been framed as a way to bolster industrial strength. However, the energy transition relies on affordable and timely steel, and these two goals are in conflict. Business leaders are caught in the middle.

This is the moment for clarity. Executives must diversify their supply, rethink procurement strategies, and, in some cases, invest directly in capacity. Policymakers must weigh the costs of protectionism against the urgency of climate goals. If both groups continue along parallel paths without coordination, the result will be predictable: slower renewable deployment, higher costs, and lost ground in the global race for clean energy.

The Japanese electronics company aims to boost battery capacity by 25%, potentially extending Tesla’s Model Y range by around 90 miles (145 km) with the existing battery size.

Panasonic’s new battery could also enable the company to create “lighter” and potentially more affordable batteries by maintaining the current driving range while reducing battery size, according to the news agency’s report.

Ahead of a presentation by Panasonic Energy’s technology leader Shoichiro Watanabe, a company executive revealed details about anode-free battery technology.

This method involves generating a lithium metal anode inside the battery after its first charge, allowing for the inclusion of more active cathode materials like cobalt, aluminium, and nickel, thereby increasing capacity without expanding the battery’s size.

Additionally, Panasonic plans to lower the nickel content in its batteries, as nickel is one of the priciest components.

However, the company has not disclosed how this technology might affect production costs or whether it could help reduce Tesla’s vehicle prices.

These two energy giants — with their respective California Independent System Operator (CAISO) and Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grids — are rapidly expanding their clean power portfolios, widening the gap over other states.

This dynamic reshapes the American energy landscape, highlighting the growing regional divergence in clean energy growth and future capacity. This comprehensive article explores the statistics, drivers, policy frameworks, and implications of this clean energy surge in California and Texas.

Overview of Clean Power Growth in 2025

By August 2025, combined clean electricity output from California’s CAISO and Texas’s ERCOT marked record levels, expanding 10% from the same period in 2024. This rate significantly outpaced the rest of the U.S., which saw only a 2.6% increase in clean energy generation. The combined output from both grids reached more than 10.2 million megawatt-hours (MWh), reflecting both continued capacity additions and heightened efficiency in renewable resource integration.

Role of California ISO (CAISO) and Texas ERCOT

CAISO: Manages approximately 80% of California’s electric load, coordinating generation, transmission, and consumption across a power grid increasingly reliant on renewables and battery storage.

ERCOT: Oversees about 90% of Texas’s electric demand, supporting a grid powered primarily by wind and solar farms alongside natural gas plants, enabling significant clean energy deployment.

Both operators maintain intricate systems balancing intermittent solar and wind generation with grid reliability.

Record-Breaking Clean Electricity Generation Statistics

Key Drivers of Growth in California

California’s clean energy surge is led by:

Aggressive solar PV installations, with rooftop and utility-scale projects

Expanding battery storage that enhances grid flexibility and stores midday solar for evening use

Regulatory targets requiring 100% clean electricity by 2045, including Senate Bill 100

Electrification of transportation and buildings increasing electricity demand compensated by renewables

Sustainable investments driven by Climate Investments and Cap-and-Trade revenues

Solar Power Capacity in California and Texas

California maintains its position as the nation’s solar leader but Texas is rapidly closing the gap due to vast land, favorable policies, and strong wind resources.

Wind and Battery Storage Growth in Both States

Wind remains dominant in Texas with multiple large-scale farms, while California leans on solar and fast-growing battery installations:

California has surpassed 13,000 MW of battery storage capacity distributed across residential, commercial, and utility scale.

Texas has installed over 9,000 MW of battery storage, focusing on grid support during peak demand or generation gaps.

Both states integrate renewable generation with storage to maintain grid reliability despite variable weather patterns.

Policy Frameworks Driving Expansion

Essential elements include:

California’s Senate Bill 100, mandating clean energy reach, and initiatives like the Strategic Reliability Reserve.

Texas’s competitive market incentives and Renewable Portfolio Goal policies encouraging private investment.

Federal Inflation Reduction Act grants stimulating new renewable and storage developments.

Both states have unique regulatory environments—California with more centralized management (CAISO) and Texas featuring a decentralized market (ERCOT)—but both succeed in rapid capacity expansion.

Comparison of Clean Energy Share: CAISO & ERCOT vs. Rest of U.S.

In 2025, clean energy sources comprised nearly 74% of CAISO’s power mix and 46.5% of ERCOT’s. These figures contrast with the 39% share recorded across the rest of the country, highlighting significant regional disparities.

Table: Clean Power Generation by Region, 2025 (Jan–Aug)

Federal Funding and Its Impact on Investments

Federal incentives and grants catalyzed much of the 2025 investment surge. However, expected declines in federal funding for renewables may challenge other states lacking robust infrastructure and policy frameworks, potentially widening the gap with California and Texas.

Challenges and Capacity Constraints

Despite growth, challenges remain:

Grid integration complexities, especially with variable renewable generation

Transmission constraints limiting delivery from resource-rich regions to demand centers

Occasional curtailments occur due to oversupply or grid operational limits, especially in Texas

Need for upgraded grid capabilities and cross-state coordination to fully harness renewables

Impacts on Electricity Markets and Prices

The boom in clean energy has steepened competition, leading to:

Reduced wholesale power prices during peak renewable generation

Greater price volatility when renewable output dips or demand spikes

Increased reliance on flexible demand response and storage solutions

Environmental and Economic Benefits

Reduction in carbon emissions—California’s 2025 emissions in the power sector dropped by over 20% compared to 2015 levels.

Job creation in construction, manufacturing, and maintenance of solar and storage facilities.

Enhanced public health from reduced air pollution.

Future Outlook: Continuous Growth and Grid Evolution

Industry forecasts predict continued expansion of battery storage, solar, and wind with emerging technologies such as green hydrogen and advanced grid management playing increasing roles.

Both CAISO and ERCOT plan to deploy cutting-edge forecasting and demand management tools to maintain grid stability amid rising electrification.

Technological Advancements Supporting Clean Power

Advanced battery chemistries extending storage duration

Virtual power plants aggregating distributed resources

AI and machine learning for predictive grid modeling

Enhanced power electronics accelerators for renewables integration

Conclusion

California and Texas are accelerating their leadership in clean electricity generation, propelled by strong policies, market innovation, and expanding renewable portfolios. Their widening lead over the rest of the U.S. highlights the importance of continued investment in clean energy infrastructure, regulatory commitment, and technological innovation.

Some entrepreneurs see electric tractors as a step on the path to automation — fewer workers, more efficiency and less cost.","EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — In the soft dirt of an indoor horseback riding ring last month, a group of farmers got ready to test drive a new piece of equipment: an electric tractor.

As they took turns climbing in — some surprised by its quick acceleration — they gave real-time feedback to the Michigan State University researchers who have been developing it for over two years.

The farmers remarked on the motor’s quiet whir. Most were intrigued, or at least open to the idea. Some were concerned that the battery on the underside of the carriage would mean a lower clearance over the field, while others worried that it would simply be too expensive.

“What we hope to do when we retire is we want to get everything electric on the farm. The tractor is the last electric implement to get,” said Don Dunklee, one of the farmers to provide feedback. He runs a small organic vegetable farm that’s relied on wind and solar for decades.

The market is fairly new, but some researchers and entrepreneurs think electric tractors will be ideal for small farmers who care about sustainability and want to market their products that way. The small cherry-red, open-cab machine is well-suited for tasks like weeding fields of specialty crops like carrots or asparagus, or squeezing between the tight rows of orchard trees. Farmers with solar panels can avoid the cost of diesel.

Agriculture is among the largest sources of climate-warming emissions worldwide. Though tractors are a small culprit, experts believe an environmentally friendly machine would still attract buyers interested in sustainability.

“There’s reduced emissions, but before you get there, you have to be solving for other problems,” including noise, ease of use and cost, said Derek Muller, business manager for battery electric systems at John Deere.

There are downsides — electric tractors are aimed at filling a niche, not overturning the status quo. And while battery technology has come a long way, they can’t last all day or match the massive horsepower of a diesel engine that sets giant tractors cruising through the sprawling grain and soybean operations of the Midwest.

Why few companies offer electric tractor options, and who wants them

In addition to battery limitations, there are other structural obstacles. Most farmers do not have fast electric chargers, nor do they have solar panels to supply those chargers with free electricity — diesel would need to be much more expensive for the economics to turn sharply in favor of electric. But companies are starting to see an opportunity.

“For John Deere, it is not the only solution,” Muller said. “It’s not going to be where we lead our efforts. It’s going to be one of many options.”

The company has built a small utility electric tractor prototype. It joins a limited set of offerings from other companies like Monarch Tractor, which started in 2019 with the aim to help farmers, who have traditionally struggled with razor-thin profits, save money, work sustainably and more efficiently.

Ajit Srivastava, an agricultural engineer and Michigan State professor who hosted the farmer feedback session, wants to help smallholder farmers across the world. Such farmers grow about a third of the world’s food but many do it with only hand tools. He started trying to emulate a pair of oxen made of off-the-shelf parts, so anyone could build it themselves.

“If we were to mechanize all the smallholder farmers in the world, there isn’t enough diesel out there to power them. So we have to find some other source,” Srivastava said.

It’s still a work in progress. Rain had postponed the feedback session, originally planned for the spring, because the tractor hadn’t been waterproofed yet. It also doesn’t have enough power for some jobs like tilling. But farmers generally like what Srivastava had developed. He hopes it could eventually be sold for roughly $30,000, substantially cheaper than some of the competition.

“The steering is really responsive. It just seems to run really smooth,” said Dunklee, adding, however, that it might not do everything he needs on a farm yet. “Probably the biggest thing would be it’s relatively quiet.”

Muller said they’re seeing demand for electric tractors from Europe, where farming policies are sometimes more progressive. And there’s also a market at universities in other countries where researchers are studying agriculture, said Brendan Dowdle, chief business officer of Bonsai Robotics, which sells modular, automated electric farm robots that can work together to mimic some tasks ordinarily done by a tractor.

One possible customer is the so-called “gentleman farmer” who has a small operation of specialty crops or vegetables and farms for fun, not necessarily to make a living.

“They want to be self-sustaining,” said Patrick Woolcock, an associate engineering professor and agriculture expert at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls.

Plus, without harmful diesel emissions, they can work in greenhouses and, with fewer parts, there’s hope repairs won’t be as complicated, at least once a readily available supply is established.

Could electric tractors be more compatible with automation?

Some entrepreneurs see electric tractors as a step on the path to automation — fewer workers, more efficiency and less cost. Engineers are now designing machines that will drive themselves and power precise weeders and planters.

For example, Monarch Tractor CEO Praveen Penmetsa noted that if a self-guided tractor gets stuck and has to notify the farmer, electric power has clear benefits. A diesel tractor would sit there idling, but an electric one doesn’t waste fuel while waiting.

Srivastava also said he’s just trying to make people’s lives easier — looking backward all day to make sure a plow is operating properly is grueling. So, a self-driving tractor would let farmers pay more attention to ensuring harvesting is happening properly, or the weeder isn’t accidentally digging up crops.

“Not that we want to take the operator off the tractor, the operator would be there, but they can focus on how well the operation is going rather than making sure the tractor is in the rows,” he said.

Still, some aren’t so sure electric has such a big advantage when it comes to automation. Tim Bucher, CEO of Agtonomy, a company focused on bringing autonomy software to farm vehicles, was all-in on electric a few years ago. But the technology has gotten so good that now his customers can pick and choose the energy source for their tractor and see similar results, he said. And with government electric vehicle subsidies disappearing, there’s less incentive for most farmers to go that route.

On his own farm, though, he opts for electric, and he says he’s seen economic returns.

And from an environmental perspective, “it also just makes me feel better,” he said.

The Subcommittee on Environment of the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee held a September 16th hearing titled:

From Gridlock to Growth: Permitting Reform Under the Clean Air Act (“Hearing”).

The stated purpose of the Hearing was to focus on:

…potential reforms to permitting and environmental reviews under the Clean Air Act.

The following bills will be addressed:

H.R. 161, New Source Review Permitting Improvement Act (Rep. Griffith)

Amends the definition of “modification” in multiple sections to clarify that certain activities that do not increase emissions do not trigger NSR permitting.

H.R. ___, Air Permitting Improvements to Protect National Security Act

Amends Section 173 to exempt advanced manufacturing facilities and critical mineral facilities from the requirement to offset emissions as part of the Nonattainment New Source Review (NNSR) permit process if the President issues a national security determination or if other conditions are met. This is based on a similar provision in Section 173 waiving emission offset requirements for rocket engines.

H.R. ___, Reducing and Eliminating Duplicative Environmental Regulations Act (RED Tape Act)

Amends Section 309 to eliminate the requirement for EPA review and provide written comment on federal construction projects or other actions by a federal agency that are already subject to environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act.

H.R. ___, Foreign Emissions and Nonattainment Clarification for Economic Stability (FENCES Act)

Amends Section 179B to exclude emissions from foreign sources from being used to determine whether an area is attaining a NAAQS and considered as part of NSR permitting.

H.R. ___, Fire Improvement and Reforming Exceptional Events Act (FIRE Act)

Amends Section 319(b) to limit how emissions from wildfires, prescribed burns and exceptional events from the air monitoring data can be used to determine whether an area is attaining a NAAQS and to require increased coordination between EPA and affected states regarding exceptional event determinations.

A September 12th Memorandum from the Committee Majority Staff has the following components:

Clean Air Act Pre-Construction Permitting (discussing the three kinds of Clean Air Act pre-construction review and permit programs [often referred to as New Source Review or NSR Permit Programs]).

Concerns about NSR Permit Process (stating that the permit process involves multiple steps, including public notice and comment, can take several years to complete).

Issues for Discussion:

How frequent changes in regulations and interpretive guidance create uncertainty for the regulated community and regulatory agencies and the role that Congress can play in providing regulatory clarity and simplifying the permitting process.

The impact that air pollution from foreign sources, forest fires, and exceptional events can have on air quality and the ability to obtain pre-construction permits under the NSR permit process.

Challenges that industries critical to national security face in navigating the NSR process and how NAAQS standards that approach background level concentrations impact economic development.

How the Clean Air Act can be modernized to meet the nation’s need for economic security while continuing to deliver clean air and a healthy environment.

Witnesses at the Hearing included:

Associated Press

Tax incentives that saved U.S. residents thousands of dollars on home efficiency upgrades, clean energy installations and electric vehicles are expiring this year. That means people who want to take advantage of them before they disappear have to act quickly.

“There is still time, but the clock is ticking,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we’ve got some tips on how to maximize savings.

Refresh my memory. What are these incentives?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren’t capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

When are they expiring?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it’s also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

The car doesn’t need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

If I’m focused on my home, what should I prioritize?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

“That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,” she said. “Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.”

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

“We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn’t mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,” Pierce said.

“Experts estimate that takes 16 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that’s quick,” said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. “You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it’s even possible.”

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?

OK, let’s say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren’t allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects — think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage — could be carried forward if you didn’t get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

Rewiring America said it’s not clear if that will continue given the accelerated expiration dates, and recommended consumers check with their tax adviser.

The allied leaders announced the Technology Prosperity Deal in a press conference at Chequers, the country manor of the British PM in Buckinghamshire northwest of London, claiming that the “win for both sides” could create up to 17,500 new jobs across both nations.

“This trip has galvanized $350 billion in deals across many sectors, and we’re committed to ensuring that the UK is a secure and reliable supply of the best AI, hardware and software on Earth, and we supply that and make sure we supply it in quantity to the UK,” said Trump.

The president later joked it was “a better deal for you than us,” praising Starmer as a tough negotiator, while the PM described the pact as a “good deal” for both countries.

“It’s a blueprint to win this new era together, shape it according to our shared values, and seize the incredible opportunities that are on offer,” Starmer told reporters.

“We have huge new investments from Nvidia, Nscale, Open AI, Google, Salesforce and many more backing cutting-edge British jobs for years to come.”

The investments are expected to result in around 15,000 jobs in the UK, along with the construction of 12 advanced nuclear reactors in the north of England. The US anticipated 2,500 jobs being created in its territory.

The deal would also provide power for up to 1.5 million homes — with both nations optimistic the civil nuclear project will serve energy needs on both sides of the Atlantic.

Trump touted collaboration on “quantum computing, fusion, 6G and civil nuclear energy,” saying the memorandum balanced deregulatory steps with a push toward innovation in those sectors.

James Burnham, who founded an AI policy council in Washington this past July, told The Post that the investments in AI and quantum computing will lower prices for consumers because they’ll allow many industries to operate “at a speed and scale that humanity is not capable of doing.”

“It just has the ability to make our lives better and easier,” said Burnham, who served previously as the top lawyer at the Department of Government Efficiency.

The innovations will largely benefit consumer-facing sectors of the economy, making travel bookings near-instantaneous and rendering the complexity of self-driving cars an easy and widespread phenomenon.

“You’ll have computers doing work that right now is being done by humans,” Burnham added. “AI is going to be really good for customer service and all the process, back-office functions.”

That will also spur growth in US and UK manufacturing,” he claimed.

“For everything from installing home batteries to building data centers to manufacturing battery cells, there’s a lot of hard, human work that has to happen to enable all of these technologies to exist and grow.”

The AI developments will include joint research programs as well as a space partnership between the US and UK.

There will also be an emphasis on chip and data center exports from both countries, as well as enhanced collaboration between the US Center for AI Standards and Innovation and the UK AI Security Institute, both of which regulate the industry.

New nuclear policies will mainly help power the tech boom but also enhance existing non-proliferation and security programs.

Perhaps most crucially, the UK will move toward “full independence from Russian nuclear fuel by the end of 2028,” according to the White House.

Burnham pointed out that most nuclear fuel is exported from China but produced in Russia, posing a major problem for the West.

“Getting the UK on board with not buying Russian enriched uranium is both good on its own, because we don’t want the Russians to be selling nuclear fuel to one of our close allies, but also good for American companies,” he said.

“It’s another great example of ‘America First,’ selling stuff that we make here,” Burnham underscored. “Step one, kick out the Russians; step two, bring in the Americans to make it simpler.”

Quantum technologies, aimed at speeding up computer processing capabilities, will be deployed to “transform defense, finance, and healthcare, protect [US and UK] citizens, and create high-skilled jobs.”

The agreement is due to be put in effect by mid-March of next year.

Formal discussions between the countries updating each other on implementation will take place each year beginning in 2026.

“Firming up international relationships will be critical to American AI success,” Matthew Mittelsteadt, a tech policy researcher at the libertarian Cato Institute, told The Post of the deal.

“To lead this space, the United States needs markets, capital, and data — ‘resources’ that mutually beneficial trade partnerships and openness can provide,” Mittelsteadt said.

“As the United States continues negotiations,” he added, “we should strongly reconsider our current protectionist stance so we can further deepen ties with the UK and others, and reap the benefits of the resources and openness that will follow.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/newspress-collage-alsa61d7g-1758221205529.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1758206891&w=1024,N,,2025-09-19 12:07:29.729192

“We are talking about so many jobs, so many construction jobs, so many union jobs,” Healey said in an interview this month.","Cesar Lima never gave much thought to the politics of offshore wind. Most days, the ironworker focused on his shift 15 miles out at sea, climbing turbines and watching dolphins gliding past his vessel off the coast of Rhode Island.

That changed when President Donald Trump’s administration ordered work to stop on the Revolution Wind project a month ago.

Lima’s job is now at risk as Trump threatens to shutter offshore wind farms, upending states’ investments to support the clean energy source. The administration’s actions have postponed, if not outright eliminated, years of potential construction work. Altogether, more than 15,000 prospective and current jobs tied to wind projects in New England are under threat from the potential shutdowns, according to a Bloomberg analysis of company and state announcements.

For now, Lima and other specialized union staff are still stationed with the Revolution Wind project, and he’s continuing to get paid. But Lima worries about what comes next for his family, including three children, who depend on his income. Ironworkers on the project earn about $76 an hour with pension and health benefits, typically working 84-hour weeks on four-week rotations, according to David Langlais of the Iron Workers union.

“I just came here to work for my family and I don’t really pay attention to all the political stuff,” Lima said, adding that he was confused why the White House would stop the Revolution project when it’s already 80% completed. “If the work stops and it keeps going like this, it’s going to hurt us.”

Trump has long opposed offshore wind, suing unsuccessfully before he became president to block a project within view of his golf course in Scotland. But the recent escalation of his administration’s battle against the industry risks clashing with simultaneous claims that the White House’s policies are fueling investment and job growth.

The bulk of potential job losses stem from government actions targeting several wind farms off the New England coast. The US Interior Department issued a stop-work order in August for the Revolution Wind farm, which is being built by Denmark’s Orsted A/S and Global Infrastructure Partners. The Revolution project supports more than 2,000 jobs, about half of which are union roles, according to Orsted.

The wind farm venture has sued to force the Trump administration to allow work to restart on the project. Revolution Wind has said it’s already spent $5 billion on the project and is now at risk of incurring an estimated $1 billion in breakaway costs.

“We have invested a significant amount of time and money” to support offshore wind, Rhode Island Democratic Governor Dan McKee said in an interview, referencing the state’s spending on training programs for workers, port upgrades in Quonset and a new offshore wind construction hub - all of which generated local jobs.

The Trump administration has also moved to reconsider or invalidate permits for other wind projects near Massachusetts that have yet to start construction but were expected to create more than 13,100 jobs on a combined basis. In addition, the US Transportation Department yanked $34 million in funding for a new port in Salem, Massachusetts, that was meant to support the offshore wind industry. That project was slated to create an additional 800 construction jobs.

Last week, the administration asked a court to cancel the approval of a $6 billion wind project planned off Maryland’s coast. A large offshore wind project in Virginia, which has a Republican Governor, Glenn Youngkin, is continuing.

The Massachusetts Clean Energy Center has projected employment in climate-friendly power production would need to grow to more than 140,000 jobs by the end of the decade in order for the state to meet its climate goals. The state organization has already spent more than $20 million in total on offshore wind job-training programs. Last year, Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey signed a bill authorizing $200 million of investments to support offshore wind, an attempt to establish the state as a global clean energy hub in the same way it’s evolved into a life sciences mecca.

“We are talking about so many jobs, so many construction jobs, so many union jobs,” Healey said in an interview this month. “There’s been a lot of investment in this workforce, actually, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. Don’t let that go to waste.”

Governors and labor leaders warn that the push to halt offshore wind development will also weigh on the manufacturing and commercial fishing industries, exacerbating the labor market impact.

“The offshore jobs are one thing, and they’re significant, but we were starting to develop the infrastructure for the industry itself,” said Frank Callahan, president of the Massachusetts Building Trades Unions.

About 80 fishermen in Rhode Island and Connecticut work for Sea Services North America, a co-op that was formed with support from Orsted to investigate potential risks to marine life from Revolution Wind’s construction. Another 100 work in similar roles across other states on the East Coast. In total, the co-op deploys 22 independent commercial fishing vessels with the work earning the participating fishermen an extra $24 million in income over four years.

“Most of our group are Trump supporters,” said Gordon Videll, CEO of Sea Services North America. “We’ve demonstrated that co-existence of commercial fisherman and offshore wind is possible. Nobody understands. It defies logic.”

Orsted also footed half the bill for a $1 million training facility in Rhode Island. The school has already trained nearly 200 students in skills such as first aid, fire awareness and special instruction for working at heights and living at sea for extended periods. The majority of course participants are union electricians and iron workers, according to Rosemary Costigan, president of the Community College of Rhode Island, which hosts the training facility on its campus.

“These are good-paying jobs, sustainable wages that the workers can have,” Costigan said. “We were on the precipice of actually expanding out and being able to recruit to a wider student audience.”

For Georgians interested in saving on the purchase of an electric vehicle, rooftop solar panels or a heat pump, the clock is ticking — fast.

This summer, Republicans in Congress locked in key parts of President Donald Trump’s agenda when they passed the “One big, beautiful bill.” The legislation extended corporate and individual tax cuts created in Trump’s first term, and increased border security and defense spending.

But the law also dented many of President Joe Biden’s signature accomplishments, including rolling back federal incentives meant to encourage Americans to switch to EVs or reduce home energy use. Electrifying homes and automobiles reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality and often saves money.

Next January will spell the end of most federal clean energy tax credits, but there are rebates for home energy upgrades that will still be available in Georgia for the next several years.

There are two programs: The Home Efficiency Rebates program, offering savings for energy-efficient home retrofits, and the Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates program, that can slash the cost of heat pumps, electric stoves and more.

Georgia received just under $220 million to distribute for the two programs — money allocated by President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that was not clawed back by Trump’s “One big, beautiful bill.”

Georgians can save as much as $16,000 on efficiency upgrades through the HER program and up to $14,000 off the cost of eligible appliances. But not everyone qualifies for the full rebates — savings depend on how each household’s income stacks up with the median in their area.

The rebates will be available through Sept. 30, 2031, or until the funding runs out.

TRENTON, NJ - New Jersey LCV, the leading political voice for the environment in New Jersey, announced its 2025 endorsements for the New Jersey Assembly and local races in the 2025 general election, as well as their continued enthusiastic support and endorsement of Mikie Sherrill for Governor. New Jersey LCV is a nonpartisan organization whose mission is to elect environmental champions, and is the only New Jersey environmental group with a Political Action Committee (PAC) and Super PAC.

New Jersey LCV announced these endorsements after receiving questionnaires from over 100 candidates. In a critical year for elections, the organization is making its largest ever investment in elections, spending $100,000 in legislative and down ballot elections.

“With Washington rolling back environmental protections, it’s more important than ever that we elect state and local champions who will fight for our right to clean air, safe drinking water, and healthy communities,” said Allison McLeod, Deputy Director, New Jersey LCV. “That’s why we’ve endorsed candidates up and down the ballot—from Governor and Assembly to county and local races—because every level of government plays a role. From tackling flooding and air pollution to protecting open space from warehouse sprawl, state and local leaders are on the front lines of this fight, and they need our support now more than ever. The stakes have never been higher.”

New Jersey LCV is also proud to continue their enthusiastic support and endorsement for Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill, an environmental champion, for Governor during the general election cycle. Congresswoman Sherrill’s leadership in Washington and on the ground in New Jersey has made a critical difference in securing multiple major legislative victories in recent years that boosted cost-saving clean energy, protected New Jersey communities from the impacts of climate change, safeguarded clean drinking water, and created union jobs.

“Based on Mikie Sherrill’s outstanding record of environmental leadership in Congress, New Jersey LCV concluded she is far and away the best candidate to deliver bold environmental policy leadership that will make a crucial difference in fighting the climate crisis, lowering electricity costs, and protecting our environment and every New Jersey family’s right to breathe clean air and drink pure water,” said Randy Jones, New Jersey LCV C4 Board Chair.

New Jersey LCV has also endorsed a diverse group of 46 candidates for Assembly, including 22 women and 14 BIPOC candidates, representative of the constituencies in which they serve.

We’re proud to have stood shoulder to shoulder with them in the Assembly and look forward to continuing to do so, pushing for bold action every step of the way.”

Local and county governments are on the front lines of tackling issues such air quality, flooding, and preserving open space from warehouse sprawl. Local elected officials are empowered to make critical land use, development, water quality, and preservation, and funding decisions that play an outsize role in environmental protection, which is why it is critical to have environmental champions at every level of government - particularly in a time when we see federal protections being rolled back.

Since its first local endorsement process in 2020 with 26 endorsements, New Jersey LCV has seen the number of candidates moving through the process grow exponentially, demonstrating the importance of environmental protection to residents across the state. From the endorsed local candidates this year, 32% are people of color, 51% women, and 3% identify as LGBTQ+.

“When it comes to protecting our environment, local races matter just as much as statewide and federal elections. The decisions made by local officials shape how our communities respond to flooding, invest in clean energy, preserve open space, and safeguard our air and water. By electing environmental champions at every level of government, we ensure New Jersey communities can thrive with cleaner air, healthier lands, and stronger protections against climate change,” said Jaclyn Rhoads, New Jersey LCV, Political Chair.

The shift has left clean energy companies struggling, communities losing good-paying jobs, and America’s leadership in renewable energy hanging in the balance.","The future of America’s renewable energy industry—and the millions of clean energy jobs it supports—is under threat from recent policy shifts by the Trump administration. A new report from national nonpartisan business group E2 warns that federal rollbacks on clean energy support are already driving widespread job losses in wind, solar, and other fast-growing energy transition sectors.

Over the past decade, clean energy jobs in the United States consistently outpaced employment growth in conventional energy sectors. In 2024 alone, nearly 100,000 new positions were created across renewable energy, energy efficiency, and clean transportation—bringing the nationwide total to 3.56 million jobs. More than 80% of all new energy jobs last year came from clean energy.

But this upward trend is now reversing. According to the E2 report, “recent policy actions by Congress and the Trump administration have already resulted in major job losses in the industry, with more expected to come.”

“Clean energy was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the nation at the end of 2024,” said Bob Keefe, E2’s Executive Director. “Now, thanks to regressive policies, America’s clean energy job growth is at serious risk—and with it, our overall economy.”

Since President Trump took office, nearly $19 billion worth of wind and solar power projects have been cancelled, according to U.S. consultancy Atlas Public Policy. The sharp reduction in federal support—through subsidy cuts and weakened regulatory backing—has triggered bankruptcies, collapsing stock prices, and project cancellations totalling $18.6 billion.

The shift has left clean energy companies struggling, communities losing good-paying jobs, and America’s leadership in renewable energy hanging in the balance. With local opposition to new projects adding to the uncertainty, industry leaders warn that without strong, consistent federal policy, the United States risks falling behind in the global clean energy race.",https://hydrogenindustryleaders.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Firefly_Clean-energy-vs-decline-—-half-the-image-shows-bright-wind-turbines-solar-panels-an-964153.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 13:01:51.917606

In Plaquemines Parish, generations worked in the oilfield, their livelihoods dependent on continued oil and gas industry investment.
But in the first of 42 cases to go to trial, a Plaquemines jury found Chevron responsible for about 25% of $2.7 billion in damages to the parish.
Those are the facts that recently led a jury to hold Chevron accountable for its role in the destruction of the Louisiana coastline.
The Chevron case is a textbook case of pollution and direct permitting violations, not vague nuisance claims.","Louisiana is unapologetically pro-energy. Our people proudly support and participate in exploration, production and refining oil and gas.

We won’t apologize for powering our nation. As Louisiana’s attorney general, I led the nation fighting the Biden administration’s flawed energy policies. Louisiana successfully blocked a moratorium on oil and gas leasing and led the attack on overzealous permitting requirements, a ban on LNG exports, flawed social cost of carbon metrics and more.

But fighting for responsible energy policy does not require us to ignore environmental impacts. In its continued efforts to avoid accountability, however, Chevron and its surrogates are taking a new tack: misdirection. Chevron’s strategy is flawed for two reasons: First, its conduct is indefensible; and second, it’s just plain wrong in its characterization of the coastal zone litigation.

The trial that took place in Plaquemines Parish is a good example of what’s necessary to impose liability. In Plaquemines Parish, generations worked in the oilfield, their livelihoods dependent on continued oil and gas industry investment.

But in the first of 42 cases to go to trial, a Plaquemines jury found Chevron responsible for about 25% of $2.7 billion in damages to the parish.

How did such an oil and gas industry friendly jury reach such a result? Easy: Because the evidence revealed Chevron’s predecessor Texaco unlawfully dumped four billion gallons of toxic wastewater into the Louisiana marsh for decades, while knowingly and intentionally ignoring permitting requirements.

At the same time, it profited from selling storage to other oil companies. Those are the facts that recently led a jury to hold Chevron accountable for its role in the destruction of the Louisiana coastline. Even then, the jury only held Chevron accountable for about 25% of the damage, recognizing that other factors contributed to some of the damage.

The coastal cases are distinctly different from frivolous climate change “nuisance” lawsuits, contrary to Chevron’s attempts to characterize them as the same. I have vigorously opposed those kinds of actions because even if such a cause of action could supply a vehicle to sue, proving that a particular defendant’s actions directly caused particular damage is virtually impossible.

Not so with the coastal suits: These lawsuits require proof that a particular defendant engaged in unlawful activity before 1980 that continued after 1980, and that caused actual identifiable harm.

The Chevron case is a textbook case of pollution and direct permitting violations, not vague nuisance claims. From the mid-1940s through the mid-1980s, Texaco discharged four billion gallons of toxic wastewater into the marsh in the Delacroix field. This was an illegal discharge under then-applicable rules and regulations.

It gets worse. Texaco flatly ignored the permitting rules established under Louisiana’s State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978. The linchpin for liability is proof of activity continuing after the act’s Sept. 20, 1980, effective date.

There were safer alternatives. Use of disposal wells was the industry standard, as Texaco’s internal documents and its operations elsewhere proved. And it was feasible — several sites could have been converted at minimal expense.

Texaco even owned a disposal well in a nearby field and charged other companies to dispose of their toxic wastewater, while dumping Texaco’s own waste into our marsh. This conduct continued until the late 1980s, while Texaco lied to regulatory authorities about its activities, including dates of discharge, volumes and lab data.

Dumping 4.2 billion gallons of toxic waste for four decades into our marsh was irresponsible and illegal. But why does Chevron have to pay? Because it assumed the liabilities of Texaco, and it has profited (and continues to profit) from that purchase.

The verdict did not hold Chevron accountable for damage it did not cause, such as erosion caused by hydrology changes or hurricanes. The Plaquemines jury award of $745 million reflects thoughtful deliberation, not “hometown” justice.

The facts disproved Chevron’s case — it lied about its conduct being lawful; it lied about the duration of its unlawful activity; and it lied about the breadth of its unlawful activity.

Quite simply, Chevron chose profits over people and the law — and it continues to do so every day it refuses accountability for its actions. This is not controversial.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/19/d1937e29-c2b1-47f0-928e-a3edef325f7a/5d14d7cc41ec9.image.jpg?crop=600%2C315%2C0%2C30,N,,2025-09-19 13:03:06.370015

We the undersigned unequivocally condemn the murder of Charlie Kirk and all forms of political violence. There is simply no place for such actions in the United States.

Political violence has targeted those of every political persuasion and of no political persuasion. It is un-American and wrong to use this act of violence as a pretext for weaponizing the government to threaten nonprofit and charitable organizations, other perceived adversaries, or any class of people. They did not commit this murder, and the vast powers of the government should not be abused to threaten their constitutionally-protected free speech and other rights.

Nonprofit and charitable organizations support critical services to our nation – working with faith communities, caring for vulnerable populations, upholding the Constitution, defending the rule of law and much more. Attacks on nonprofits and charities threaten that essential work happening everywhere across our country.

We implore the government to cease its escalation of political division, and stop the unjustified targeting of organizations and people in the wake of this terrible act of political violence.

This moment of tragedy does not call for exploiting a horrific act to further deepen our divides and make us less safe. It calls for unity–unity against violence and unity of purpose as Americans.

This updated plan will guide Liberia in cutting down emissions, preparing for climate impacts, and attracting support from partners.
He added that Climate change is already affecting farms, the health sector, and even the safety of the communities.
The meeting concluded with a validated draft of NDC 3.0, including clear targets for reducing emissions, adapting to climate change, and finding financing options.","Ganta, September 17, 2025-The Government of Liberia, through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), held a one-day climate consultation in Ganta, Nimba County, as part of efforts to finalize the country’s updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC 3.0) under the Paris Agreement.

The NDC is Liberia’s national plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen resilience against climate change. The Ganta consultation brought together government officials, civil society groups, women and youth organizations, academia, the private sector, and development partners to ensure the updated plan reflects the needs and voices of communities across the country.

EPA’s Director of Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs), Arthur R.M. Becker, explained the importance of the meeting. He said:

“The fight against climate change is for everyone and cannot be left with the government alone. That is why we came to Ganta to sit with our people, listen to their concerns, and include them in this plan”

According to him, the Paris Agreement requires countries to act, but Liberia’s NDC 3.0 must not only answer to the world, it must respond to the realities in our towns, villages, and cities. When people take ownership, when they see their voices in the plan, then the plan becomes stronger and workable.

He stessed that the process is about building trust and showing that climate action is a shared responsibility.

“NDC 3.0 is not starting from scratch. It builds on the efforts we made in 2015 and 2021. We have spent months talking to communities, doing technical studies, and engaging stakeholders. This updated plan will guide Liberia in cutting down emissions, preparing for climate impacts, and attracting support from partners. It is a blueprint for action, investment, and inclusive development. The goal is to create a plan that is realistic, practical, and achievable., Mr. Becker added.

Also speaking, Louis Kuukpen, UNDP Resident Representative encouraged participants to make their voices heard.

According to him, UNDP is proud to walk with Liberia on the journey.

He added that Climate change is already affecting farms, the health sector, and even the safety of the communities.

“These consultations are not just formal meetings; they are opportunities for women, youth, farmers, and other vulnerable groups to help guide the decisions that will shape Liberia’s future. When communities are part of the discussion, the solutions become more practical and fair. Together, with unity and shared commitment, we can build a Liberia that is stronger, greener, and safer for generations to come.”, he added.

Following the consultations, a technical validation meeting was held on September 12, 2025, in Tubmanburg, Bomi County, with over 25 representatives from government, local authorities, civil society, academia, and development partners. The meeting provided a chance to review and strengthen the draft NDC 3.0.

The meeting concluded with a validated draft of NDC 3.0, including clear targets for reducing emissions, adapting to climate change, and finding financing options.",https://epa.gov.lr/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/epa-logo-90x90.png,N,,2025-09-19 14:06:03.016769

Congress must act without delay to pass this measure and ensure the VA can continue delivering lifesaving services to veterans and their families.
Again, we urge U.S. House members to support the CR.” Unify.US: “Unify.US strongly supports H.R.
5371, a clean, short-term continuing resolution that will keep the government open while Congress continues to work on a full-year funding package.
Shutting the government down while this work continues is irresponsible and will be harmful to the American people.” Vietnam Veterans of America: “Congress must ensure no lapse in veterans’ care or benefits.","WASHINGTON – Today, Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) announced key stakeholder support for the Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026. This bill keeps the government open, allows House Republicans to continue advancing the America First agenda, and serves the American people while Congress continues working through the regular order appropriations process.

Here is what stakeholders are saying about the bill:

Aerospace Industries Association (AIA): “AIA urges Congress to pass this continuing resolution that will keep the government open, maintaining critical functions to protect national security, prevent delays in air travel, and allow innovation to continue. While we understand that Congress needs more time to hammer out details for a funding bill for fiscal year 2026, a full shutdown has serious implications that will reverberate throughout the aerospace and defense supply chain for months, causing major disruptions. We encourage both the House and the Senate to swiftly pass this bill.”

America First Policy Institute (AFPI), Greg Sindelar, Acting President and Chief Executive Officer: “The only way to keep our country on the path to delivering the America First Agenda and meaningful change is for Congress to consider and pass a clean CR before the September 30th deadline. Continuing America’s comeback success means funding our government. Failing to protect our economic and national security interests at home and abroad would diminish this momentum.”

American Telemedicine Association (ATA) Action, Kyle Zebley, Executive Director of ATA Action and Senior Vice President of Public Policy at the ATA: “We are mere days away from having telehealth services lapse, leaving literally millions of patients across the country with no access to necessary care and our healthcare providers helpless to deliver that care. ATA Action supports and endorses the short-term continuing resolution language put forward by U.S. House leadership that extends Medicare telehealth flexibilities and the Acute Hospital Care at Home program through November 21. This is the only viable legislative vehicle up for consideration that will ensure these essential programs do not lapse past the end of the month.”

Americans for Prosperity (AFP), Brent Gardner, Chief Government Affairs Officer: “This continuing resolution is a necessary step to avoid a harmful and unnecessary government shutdown. While we support this short-term measure, we do so because the alternative—shutting down the government—is worse and would harm all Americans.”

AMVETS, Joe Chenelly, National Executive Director: “AMVETS supports the passage of the Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026, which contains vital extensions for the Department of Veterans Affairs. These provisions safeguard critical programs, including the Staff Sergeant Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention Grant Program, the Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) Program, and the Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) Program. Congress must act without delay to pass this measure and ensure the VA can continue delivering lifesaving services to veterans and their families. Looking ahead, AMVETS encourages Congress to prioritize timely, full-year appropriations to provide the VA with the stability and predictability needed to best serve our nation's veterans.”

CTIA, Ajit Pai, President and Chief Executive Officer: “We support the extension of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 included in the House of Representative’s Continuing Resolution. CISA 2015 established a vital legal framework that enables trusted cyber threat information sharing between the public and private sectors, and this collaboration has strengthened cybersecurity efforts across critical infrastructure, including wireless networks. This will ensure Americans continue to be protected from evolving cyber threats while Congress pursues a long-term extension of the Act.”

Independent Women, Patrice Onwuka, Director of the Center for Economic Opportunity: “This clean continuing resolution is a necessary step to keeping the government running even as Congress does the good work to pass responsible appropriations bills through regular order. Americans did not vote for a dysfunctional government. They want a right-sized government, and so far, this Congress has taken that mandate seriously. Furthermore, in light of the horrendous slaying of Charlie Kirk, this CR provides members of Congress with additional protections so that they can serve their constituents. We urge all members to pass this clean CR to prevent disruptions to national security, public safety, veterans care, and social safety net programs while bringing back fiscal responsibility.”

Mission Roll Call: “Mission Roll Call calls on Congress to ensure uninterrupted funding for critical VA programs — including the Fox Suicide Prevention Grants, Supportive Services for Veteran Families, and Health Care for Homeless Veterans. These are lifelines for veterans and their families, and their continuation must be guaranteed without interruption.”

National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), Lake A. Coulson, Senior Vice President & Chief Lobbyist: “On behalf of the more than 140,000 members of the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), I am writing in support of H.R. 5371, the Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026 that would continue to fund operations of the federal government including the extension of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) until November 21…NAHB believes that it is critically important for the economy, and the housing industry specifically, that Congress extend this vital program to provide certainty, predictability, and peace of mind to policyholders who rely on the NFIP for the flood protection and mitigation strategies for which it was designed.”

National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA), Tanner Beymer, Executive Director of Government Affairs: “NCBA is encouraged by the progress congressional leaders have made in appropriations this year. A shutdown at this juncture would only stymie this momentum and further disrupt business in cattle country. This stopgap spending bill affords the House and Senate necessary time to bolster crucial agriculture programs and enact key policies through the budget process. We urge lawmakers to swiftly adopt the continuing resolution.”

Small Business & Entrepreneurship (SBE) Council, Karen Kerrigan, President and Chief Executive Officer: “SBE Council strongly supports the CR and urges every U.S. House member to vote in favor of this sensible step to keep the federal government open, allowing for discussions to continue on longer-term funding matters. Small business owners, their employees, and local communities are still transitioning through the effects of past policies that imposed multi-year inflationary pressures and higher borrowing costs, among other challenges. They need certainty and confidence that elected officials and government leaders are delivering on stability, not disruptive action that could potentially undermine growth and planning. Advancing the CR signals that Congress is serious about supporting a stable environment and getting back to regular order. Again, we urge U.S. House members to support the CR.”

Unify.US: “Unify.US strongly supports H.R. 5371, a clean, short-term continuing resolution that will keep the government open while Congress continues to work on a full-year funding package. Shutting the government down while this work continues is irresponsible and will be harmful to the American people.”

Vietnam Veterans of America: “Congress must ensure no lapse in veterans’ care or benefits. Extending critical authorities for nursing home care, rural access, and community-care capacity is essential to protect our most vulnerable veterans while longer-term solutions advance.”

They added: We have received no directions to wave planning applications through.
The agency’s role in judging planning applications is enshrined in law, but Reeves is working on a planning and infrastructure bill that could rip up many of the rules around permitted developments.
Choking the role of the Environment Agency and fettering their independence goes against all principles of good regulation.”","The Environment Agency has been told by ministers to wave through planning applications with minimal resistance as part of a regulatory shakeup designed to increase economic growth and plug the government’s financial hole.

Officials at the agency say they have been told to do as little as legally possible to prevent housing applications from being approved and the government has drafted in senior advisers from the housing department to speed up the process.

Some believe the existence of the agency is under threat given Rachel Reeves’s push to eliminate government quangos as part of her dash for growth. Government officials insist this is not the case.

There is a wider push from the chancellor to inject more urgency into housing and infrastructure development, which she is hoping will help her fill a multibillion-pound hole at the next budget.

But environmental campaigners warn that clipping the wings of the Environment Agency could harm wildlife and the natural world.

One agency source said the staff from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) were “pushing development at any cost”.

They added: “We are taking a step back from planning and the organisational steer is to do the minimum required to fulfil our legal duties but nothing more. They are seeking legal advice as to what the minimum they can get away with is.”

They added: “There are lots of examples of where nature and development happen together, but going forwards, the EA doesn’t seem to want to be part of it.”

An Environment Agency spokesperson said they did not recognise the claims, but acknowledged that MHCLG staff had been brought into the agency. They added: We have received no directions to wave planning applications through. The EA continues to provide robust technical advice to ensure that environmental protections are considered in planning decisions. The government’s ambitious target for building 1.5m new homes is vital. To support this, we have rapidly reformed our planning service, now provide advice consistently within the 21-day deadline and use our technical expertise to achieve the best outcomes for the environment and economic growth.”

Reeves has told ministers to make a fresh push to cull quangos that their departments oversee, with sources indicating that the environment department has been singled out.

The department, whose new secretary of state, Emma Reynolds, was previously a Treasury minister, controls 37 agencies, including Natural England, the Environment Agency and the Office for Environmental Protection.

Ministers in this government and the previous Conservative administration have expressed frustration at the ability of some of the environmental regulators to hold up development. The chancellor has blamed them for choking economic growth by demanding developers build expensive wildlife protections such as the infamous £100m “bat tunnel” over the HS2 high-speed rail line.

The Environment Agency polices nutrient neutrality rules which ban developments in dozens of regions across the country if they are predicted to add to nutrients to nearby rivers.

The rules are in place to prevent the buildup of algae and other plants, which can choke off aquatic life, but have been blamed for the lack of housebuilding in certain areas.

The agency’s role in judging planning applications is enshrined in law, but Reeves is working on a planning and infrastructure bill that could rip up many of the rules around permitted developments. New rules could also be included in the forthcoming water bill.

Environmental campaigners say removing the agency entirely from the planning process could damage British wildlife.

Ali Plummer, the director of policy and advocacy at Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “Deregulation won’t speed up nature recovery; it will just leave us with poorly designed developments, increased pollution and lower access to nature. Weaker regulation is not the foundation to build from for the next generation.”

Alexa Culver, a lawyer at the ecological consultancy RSK Wilding, said: “Properly funded and independent regulators are an essential part of any thriving economy. Choking the role of the Environment Agency and fettering their independence goes against all principles of good regulation.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0f6a7222b691f2e02a5679071ffeb55f0eeaf51/568_26_6769_5415/master/6769.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e15e42677806cc63cbdbcf2b79f6748e",N,,2025-09-19 12:06:14.762468

Missouri can lead the way,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/american-data-centers-are-key-beating-china-ai-race-missouri-can-lead-way,"Neil Armstrong’s “one small step” highlighted the critical connection between significant advances in science and technology and our national security.
A July executive order will cut federal red tape and streamline permitting to fast-track construction of U.S. data centers.
Why shouldn’t northeast, central or southeast Missouri play a major role in powering the national AI race?
But we need to do it strategically ensuring (1) American data centers are sited in appropriate locations and (2) local communities where the centers are located get answers to all legitimate questions about the projects.
Winning the AI race against China will not be easy.","As a kid growing up in southeast Missouri, I watched the moon landing in awe. America had done it! Our astronauts were the first to walk on the moon’s surface.

It wasn’t until I was elected to represent Missouri in Congress that I more fully appreciated the generational impact “winning the space race” had on America’s global influence and national security.

Neil Armstrong’s “one small step” highlighted the critical connection between significant advances in science and technology and our national security. Only by harnessing these innovations did we ensure that this new space frontier would be led by Americans instead of the Soviets. In the decades following the moon landing, America enjoyed an unprecedented period of peace and national security, which eventually culminated in our victory in the Cold War.

Headlines today echo those in the 1960’s. This time our national security and prosperity are threatened by another global foe — the People’s Republic of China — and they are attempting to harness technological advances to reshape the world in their image.

Instead of space, this new race is taking place in the digital world of artificial intelligence, or AI. Simply put, if we allow China to overtake America as the world’s leader in AI, it could create insecurity for our fellow citizens for decades to come.

What will fuel our nation’s AI dominance is our ability to efficiently and effectively ramp up construction of American data centers, including the massive amounts of energy it takes to run them.

For the past three years, China has invested billions to be an AI superpower in hopes of catching up to the U.S. Consequently, a lack of data center development here in America’s heartland would be a disaster and play right into their hands.

As part of the White House’s American AI Action Plan, President Donald Trump has chartered a course for America to cement our dominance in artificial intelligence. A July executive order will cut federal red tape and streamline permitting to fast-track construction of U.S. data centers.

According to the Trump administration, winning the AI race represents the “cornerstone of innovation, powering a new age of American leadership in science, technology, and global influence.”

Over the next year or two many of the decisions on where this new high-tech industry will invest, create jobs and grow are being made.

Why shouldn’t northeast, central or southeast Missouri play a major role in powering the national AI race?

In addition to a well-trained and eager workforce, the eastern side of the Show-Me State is home to some of the most affordable electricity in the country — including rates 29% lower than the national average.

A proactive effort to site and build data centers will complement the recent push to make the St. Louis region a defense tech hub. The National Geospatial Lab is set to open next year and the White House recently announced that the next-generation F-47 fighter jets will be built in St. Louis by Boeing.

I applaud policymakers in Jefferson City who are doing their part to implement this AI Action Plan here in Missouri.

Gov. Mike Kehoe signed legislation in April that will enable Missouri to generate more home-grown electricity, including next-generation nuclear power. The new state law directs energy producers to create user-friendly policies for large data center customers and ensures that utilities pay their fair share of service costs. This forward-thinking legislation is a strong signal that Missouri is open for business and our grid will continue to have the capacity to serve businesses and homes in our local communities, including data centers.

These efforts have quickly attracted new data center opportunities. In fact, the St. Louis region is on the cusp of being the possible home to several major data centers. These projects would be among the largest construction projects in Missouri’s history, creating jobs and growing our economy. In these scenarios, local communities win because of the significant tax revenues data centers will generate, including millions of dollars in property taxes.

Putting Missouri on the map as a national leader is exciting and important.

But we need to do it strategically ensuring (1) American data centers are sited in appropriate locations and (2) local communities where the centers are located get answers to all legitimate questions about the projects. The recent pause on a St. Charles-area data center was a good example that transparency and communication about these transformational developments cannot be shortchanged.

Winning the AI race against China will not be easy. Many states and locales will allow the forces of status quo and NIMBY to prevail and lose out on these cutting-edge opportunities. But other communities which embrace these high-tech investments are likely to reverse decades of lost manufacturing jobs and witness positive economic and population growth.

Imagine a scenario — in rural Missouri or downtown St. Louis — where the “jobs of the future” exist. Young professionals and jobseekers won’t need to leave Missouri in search of a career but can instead stay, raise families and help their own local communities grow and thrive.

What's happening?

Many federal energy tax credits are ending at the end of 2025, so this campaign is designed to help as many families qualify for those credits as possible. They apply to heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, rooftop solar, battery storage, and a range of other electrification and clean energy upgrades for your home.

""Congress's decision to repeal [IRA incentives] prematurely means households should act fast,"" Rewiring America CEO Ari Matusiak said, per Electrek. ""But the savings, comfort, and long-term value of these upgrades remain. For homeowners ready to act, we have the tools to help. And for those who need more time, we're working to expand your options and ensure that these upgrades make financial sense whenever the moment is right.""

Why is scheduling your upgrade now important?

Heating is most households' largest expense when it comes to energy use at home. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, space heating accounted for 42% of home energy bills in 2020. If you want to lower those bills — not to mention reduce your energy usage to protect the planet from pollution — one of the best moves you can make is to upgrade your HVAC system. If you do it quickly, while the IRA incentives are still available, it will be much more affordable.

For help doing that, try a trusted brand like Mitsubishi, which can help you find the right heat pump option for your home, such as one of its cost-effective mini-split systems. Heat pumps outperform traditional HVAC in terms of energy efficiency while delivering both heating and cooling.

That's on top of other financial benefits such as the tax credits available through the IRA. Mitsubishi can even help connect you with trained professionals who will help you install your new HVAC system.

What's being done about getting upgrades done quickly?

Rewiring America is helping as many people take advantage of the incentives as possible by providing a central hub where residents can get educated about the available incentives, offering weekly sessions where you can ask questions about your situation, providing a directory of contractors and installers, and helping you map out your project through a planner.

Her pushback echoed the broader clash with the Trump administration, which has targeted electric cars as costly for consumers and impractical.
She argued that the air board failed to study the economic impacts of its new standard.

Adrian Martinez, a lawyer with Earthjustice, said California’s air board faces “perilous times.” “Everyone breathing in California depends on it,” he said.","The California Air Resources Board is getting a new leader at a pivotal moment, as it battles the Trump administration in court and contends with growing scrutiny from Democrats and voters questioning the price of the state’s climate principles.

Liane Randolph has chaired the board of the state’s top air and climate regulator since 2020. She oversaw a range of policies including landmark clean-car and truck rules, a fuel standard with implications for gas prices and the state’s signature carbon trading program, cap-and-trade. This week, Gov. Gavin Newsom nominated his senior climate advisor, Lauren Sanchez, to replace her.

Randolph, in an interview, told CalMatters her departure was part of her “personal journey,” something she began considering earlier this year.

“I’ve worked really hard over the last almost five years, and I’m ready for a break,” she said. “I am confident that the transition will go incredibly smoothly.”

Observers say the handover highlights the air board’s key role at a time of political pushback and consumer resistance.

“Pretty much all of the major areas in climate that [the air board] touches are going to be in really significant periods of challenge,” said Danny Cullenward, a climate expert and vice chair of an independent committee that analyzes the cap-and-trade program. “This is not an easy time to take over an agency. It’s a time when sound strategy — and not just autopilot — is going to be required.”

California’s climate ambition meets Trump opposition

Newsom’s 2020 order to phase out gas-car sales by 2035 was a watershed moment for California climate policy. His executive order was a headline-grabbing strike at the oil industry, meant to accelerate not only the state’s adoption of electric cars, but the nation’s.

Newsom said Randolph would be the champion of that effort as his pick to lead the air board just a few months later, calling her “the kind of bold, innovative leader that will lead in our fight against climate change with equity and all California’s communities at heart.”

But Randolph faced a larger challenge than her predecessors: a Trump administration bent on thwarting California’s authority. The White House immediately criticized Newsom’s order as an example of how “extreme the left has become,” evidence that liberal policymakers wanted to “dictate every aspect of every American’s life.”

While Randolph’s air board made significant policy during the years of the Biden administration, Trump attacked those efforts once he returned to office.

“Liane didn’t have the time or the circumstances to pivot toward a new, adjusted strategy,” said Daniel Sperling, a former member of the board, now the director of the Institute for Transportation Studies at UC Davis. “She inherited the trajectory that California was on, and that the governor was articulating, and then she got undermined by the Trump administration.”

For the gasoline car ban, the air board held months of marathon hearings filled with car owners, environmentalists and industry lobbyists. In 2022, the board approved the measure that Newsom wanted. More rules soon followed, targeting diesel trucks, locomotives and other major polluters.

Ethan Elkind, a climate law expert at UC Berkeley, said Randolph steered the board through a difficult time.

In disputes involving environmental justice groups, he said, “she really listened to people,” building consensus and lowering tensions.

“She’s always very diplomatic,” Elkind said. “She was mild-mannered, she wasn’t polemical, she didn’t use it as a perch to pontificate. She seemed very measured and steady and took her role as the public face, and the need for outreach, very seriously.”

Policies moving the state toward zero emissions vehicles have struggled, as federal and state regulators have pulled industry in opposing directions.

The Biden administration signed off on California’s clean-car rules last year. But the state air board withdrew one of its most aggressive measures on diesel trucks, as well as rules on locomotives, harbor craft and other polluters, in anticipation of Trump’s return.

“There’s not a full understanding of how aggressive the administration’s attacks on all of California’s efforts to achieve climate action have been,” Randolph said at a CalMatters event in San Francisco. She pointed to the Trump administration’s withdrawl of a rule aimed at cleaning up nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.

“That has nothing to do with electric vehicles,” Randolph said. “It was all about just attacking California’s authority, and letting the big companies who supported the administration continue to pollute communities.”

Catherine Reheis-Boyd, a senior advisor to the Western States Petroleum Association, said that under Randolph’s tenure, California’s ambition got ahead of consumers and technology. Her pushback echoed the broader clash with the Trump administration, which has targeted electric cars as costly for consumers and impractical.

“We have no problem with electric vehicles,” Reheis-Boyd said, at the San Francisco CalMatters event. But “we think there should be a free market.”

Searing climate battles at home

Last November, the air board revamped its Low Carbon Fuel Standard, a program that uses financial incentives to encourage cleaner fuels as the state phases out gasoline and diesel.

The fight exposed twin challenges arising from within the state: rising costs and lingering environmental harms not addressed by the climate policy. Consumer advocates raised alarms about gas prices, while environmentalists warned that boosting alternatives like biofuels made from cow manure or soybeans offered limited climate benefits.

Phoebe Seaton, co-director of the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability, said her group “strongly disagrees” with the expansion of the fuel standard program but credited Randolph’s leadership for showing up and listening to all parties.

“We are especially grateful for the time Chair Randolph dedicated to meeting in Pixley and Fresno with people impacted by dairies,” Seaton said.

Central valley politicians criticized the program for making fuels less affordable. Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains, a Bakersfield Democrat looking to unseat a moderate Republican in Congress, called for Randolph’s resignation earlier this year. She argued that the air board failed to study the economic impacts of its new standard. Her office did not respond to a request from CalMatters for comment.

Cullenward said the air board hasn’t always clearly said what its programs cost consumers. While Newsom and the legislature will extend cap-and-trade, the board still must decide how to reshape the program after pausing work on it during the reauthorization fight.

“One of the toughest things about this process is that being really honest about what’s working — and what’s not working — and what the costs of the different options are, is going to be essential,” Cullenward said. “Historically, that’s not something staff have ever embraced.”

Newsom praised Randolph for stepping in during a time of uncertainty and leading with “vision and resolve.” She will leave at the end of the month, before the end of her term, which lasts through 2026.

Questions about costs, affordability and environmental concerns will continue to hang over the air board as it decides how to steer cap-and-trade and other programs in the years ahead.

Randolph, in her remarks Wednesday, said California regulators must get creative in the face of federal attacks, while also addressing public concerns and communicating why the state’s policies matter.

“All of the impacts of climate change make things fundamentally unaffordable,” she said.

Newsom’s point person steps in

Randolph’s replacement, Lauren Sanchez, has been the governor’s point person on climate from within the executive office. Translating Newsom’s vision into state policy at a key turning point while also leading a 16-member board and managing the agency’s vast, highly technical staff will present a new challenge.

Sanchez built her climate credentials on the international stage and inside the governor’s office, where she helped steer billions in budget funding for climate programs and advised Newsom on this summer’s high-stakes energy and climate package.

“He turned to the aide he trusts most on climate,” said Dean Florez, the state Senate appointee to the air board. “Lauren’s been at his side drafting the playbook and steering the billions. This isn’t a change in course, it’s keeping faith with his own circle.”

Before joining Newsom’s office in 2021, Sanchez served as a climate negotiator at the U.S. State Department and later advised John Kerry in the Biden administration. She also held senior roles at the California Environmental Protection Agency and the air board, coordinating climate policy across state agencies and shaping California’s international climate work.

“Lauren has been my most trusted climate advisor and the chief architect of California’s bold climate agenda,” Newsom said. “She is a force in her own right: her expertise, tenacity, and vision will serve California well as the Board works to protect our communities and defends our climate progress against relentless attacks from Washington.”

Sanchez played a central role in weaving climate priorities into the state budget in recent years, said Jamie Pew, climate policy advisor with NetxGen Policy. Cap-and-trade pays for a climate credit that consumers see on their utility bills; Pew said Sanchez advocated for expanding the credit during the recent legislative negotiations.

“Lauren has been a champion for getting cap and invest done this year, which will ensure that funding for critical climate programs will continue to grow at a time when federal rollbacks threaten the transition,” Pew said.

Next week, the state’s top air and climate regulators will vote on amendments narrowing a previously rescinded truck rule to public fleets. The board is also advancing an emergency regulation to keep its clean-car and truck standards enforceable as the board battles the federal government in court.

Many of the air board’s recent accomplishments have run into roadblocks this year. As expected, Trump quickly moved to block California’s mandates aided by Congress, signing three measures in June against clean cars and two others targeting diesel trucks.

Adrian Martinez, a lawyer with Earthjustice, said California’s air board faces “perilous times.”

Some entrepreneurs see electric tractors as a step on the path to automation — fewer workers, more efficiency and less cost.","EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — In the soft dirt of an indoor horseback riding ring last month, a group of farmers got ready to test drive a new piece of equipment: an electric tractor.

As they took turns climbing in — some surprised by its quick acceleration — they gave real-time feedback to the Michigan State University researchers who have been developing it for over two years.

The farmers remarked on the motor's quiet whir. Most were intrigued, or at least open to the idea. Some were concerned that the battery on the underside of the carriage would mean a lower clearance over the field, while others worried that it would simply be too expensive.

“What we hope to do when we retire is we want to get everything electric on the farm. The tractor is the last electric implement to get,” said Don Dunklee, one of the farmers to provide feedback. He runs a small organic vegetable farm that's relied on wind and solar for decades.

The market is fairly new, but some researchers and entrepreneurs think electric tractors will be ideal for small farmers who care about sustainability and want to market their products that way. The small cherry-red, open-cab machine is well-suited for tasks like weeding fields of specialty crops like carrots or asparagus, or squeezing between the tight rows of orchard trees. Farmers with solar panels can avoid the cost of diesel.

Agriculture is among the largest sources of climate-warming emissions worldwide. Though tractors are a small culprit, experts believe an environmentally friendly machine would still attract buyers interested in sustainability.

“There’s reduced emissions, but before you get there, you have to be solving for other problems,” including noise, ease of use and cost, said Derek Muller, business manager for battery electric systems at John Deere.

There are downsides — electric tractors are aimed at filling a niche, not overturning the status quo. And while battery technology has come a long way, they can’t last all day or match the massive horsepower of a diesel engine that sets giant tractors cruising through the sprawling grain and soybean operations of the Midwest.

Why few companies offer electric tractor options, and who wants them

In addition to battery limitations, there are other structural obstacles. Most farmers do not have fast electric chargers, nor do they have solar panels to supply those chargers with free electricity — diesel would need to be much more expensive for the economics to turn sharply in favor of electric. But companies are starting to see an opportunity.

“For John Deere, it is not the only solution,” Muller said. “It’s not going to be where we lead our efforts. It’s going to be one of many options.”

The company has built a small utility electric tractor prototype. It joins a limited set of offerings from other companies like Monarch Tractor, which started in 2019 with the aim to help farmers, who have traditionally struggled with razor-thin profits, save money, work sustainably and more efficiently.

Ajit Srivastava, an agricultural engineer and Michigan State professor who hosted the farmer feedback session, wants to help smallholder farmers across the world. Such farmers grow about a third of the world’s food but many do it with only hand tools. He started trying to emulate a pair of oxen made of off-the-shelf parts, so anyone could build it themselves.

“If we were to mechanize all the smallholder farmers in the world, there isn’t enough diesel out there to power them. So we have to find some other source,” Srivastava said.

It's still a work in progress. Rain had postponed the feedback session, originally planned for the spring, because the tractor hadn't been waterproofed yet. It also doesn't have enough power for some jobs like tilling. But farmers generally like what Srivastava had developed. He hopes it could eventually be sold for roughly $30,000, substantially cheaper than some of the competition.

“The steering is really responsive. It just seems to run really smooth,” said Dunklee, adding, however, that it might not do everything he needs on a farm yet. “Probably the biggest thing would be it’s relatively quiet.”

Muller said they're seeing demand for electric tractors from Europe, where farming policies are sometimes more progressive. And there's also a market at universities in other countries where researchers are studying agriculture, said Brendan Dowdle, chief business officer of Bonsai Robotics, which sells modular, automated electric farm robots that can work together to mimic some tasks ordinarily done by a tractor.

One possible customer is the so-called “gentleman farmer” who has a small operation of specialty crops or vegetables and farms for fun, not necessarily to make a living.

“They want to be self-sustaining,” said Patrick Woolcock, an associate engineering professor and agriculture expert at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls.

Plus, without harmful diesel emissions, they can work in greenhouses and, with fewer parts, there's hope repairs won't be as complicated, at least once a readily available supply is established.

Could electric tractors be more compatible with automation?

Some entrepreneurs see electric tractors as a step on the path to automation — fewer workers, more efficiency and less cost. Engineers are now designing machines that will drive themselves and power precise weeders and planters.

For example, Monarch Tractor CEO Praveen Penmetsa noted that if a self-guided tractor gets stuck and has to notify the farmer, electric power has clear benefits. A diesel tractor would sit there idling, but an electric one doesn’t waste fuel while waiting.

Srivastava also said he's just trying to make people's lives easier — looking backward all day to make sure a plow is operating properly is grueling. So, a self-driving tractor would let farmers pay more attention to ensuring harvesting is happening properly, or the weeder isn't accidentally digging up crops.

""Not that we want to take the operator off the tractor, the operator would be there, but they can focus on how well the operation is going rather than making sure the tractor is in the rows,"" he said.

Still, some aren’t so sure electric has such a big advantage when it comes to automation. Tim Bucher, CEO of Agtonomy, a company focused on bringing autonomy software to farm vehicles, was all-in on electric a few years ago. But the technology has gotten so good that now his customers can pick and choose the energy source for their tractor and see similar results, he said. And with government electric vehicle subsidies disappearing, there's less incentive for most farmers to go that route.

On his own farm, though, he opts for electric, and he says he's seen economic returns.

And from an environmental perspective, “it also just makes me feel better,” he said.

But even if siting a nuclear microreactor near a town is technically feasible, would the community accept it?","You might imagine nuclear power plants as behemoth facilities spanning hundreds of acres. Nuclear microreactors, by contrast, could sit on land the size of a football field and power a whole town.

However, after decades of fraught relationships between the nuclear industry and communities in many parts of the U.S., building these tiny reactors requires reckoning with the complex history of nuclear technology and rebuilding public trust.

Microreactor technology for use in towns or cities hasn’t been developed yet, but many researchers have been building the case for its use.

For example, this technology could benefit college campuses, remote communities in Alaska primarily powered by oil and diesel, tech companies looking for reliable electricity for AI data centers, companies in need of high-temperature heat for manufacturing and industrial processes, mining operations that need a clean energy source and even military bases in search of a secure source of energy.

I’m a nuclear engineer who has been exploring nuclear microreactors’ potential. My research and teaching focuses on some of the questions that would come with placing miniature nuclear reactors close to where people live.

Microreactors: A history

Nuclear microreactors as a technology are both new and old. In the 1940s and ’50s, the American military and government began developing small reactors and nuclear batteries to power submarines and spacecraft.

After developing these small-scale reactors and batteries for various missions, the nuclear industry’s focus shifted to power reactors. They began to rapidly scale up their designs from producing tens of megawatts to the gigawatt-scale systems common around the world today.

These historical reactors were small because scientists were still learning about the physics and engineering underlying these systems. Today, engineers are deliberately designing microreactors to be small.

Microreactors aren’t to be confused with small modular reactors – these are often scaled-down, modularized versions of large reactors. Small, modular reactors can be built as single units or in clusters to achieve the same capacity as a full-size reactor. Microreactors would be smaller than these, with a power capacity under 20 megawatts.

Manufacturing and cost

Because they’re small, microreactors wouldn’t require a massive, multiyear construction project like large nuclear power reactors. Several units could be assembled in a factory each year and shipped off to their final destinations in a truck or on a barge.

Large reactors are not inherently flawed – in many ways, they remain the more economic nuclear energy option. However, electric utility companies have recently hesitated to invest in large reactors because of the multibillion-dollar nature of these projects.

Microreactors require a different but equally significant kind of investment. Though individual units will have a significantly lower price tag, building a factory to produce these microreactors is a massive undertaking. Reactor companies are waiting for their order books to fill up before investing in factories.

It’s a catch-22. Without orders, technology developers are unlikely to build microreactor factories. And future users of these new reactors are unlikely to place orders until this new style of production has been tested and the initial units built.

Future users are also waiting to see what the microreactors will actually cost. Reactor developers have put forward many cost estimates, but in the past, estimates for nuclear reactors haven’t always been reliable. Developers likely won’t know the true numbers until the reactors are actually built.

Initial “first of a kind” units will undoubtedly cost significantly more than later units. As manufacturers learn the best production processes, they’ll be able to make more reactors for less.

In this paradoxical situation in which developers are waiting for orders and users are waiting to see the economics of initial reactors, government funding for building demonstration projects could help usher microreactor technology from early designs to the market.

First movers such as national laboratories, universities, data centers and military bases that are willing to buy these initial reactors also have a role to play in validating the economic feasibility of these new reactors.

Today’s microreactors

In a nuclear reactor, the combination of nuclear fuel and coolant – which is the substance used to both cool the fuel and transport the heat generated by it – used in its design determines what situations it will work best in. Many nonwater coolants can allow reactors to operate at lower pressures, which is a little more safe.

The microreactors being developed today are based on a wide range of reactor technologies and make use of many different combinations of nuclear fuels and coolants.

Some reactors, such as the submarine propulsion reactors, are small, pressurized water reactors – the same basic technology used in most large-scale nuclear power plants. Others use configurations that resemble the small reactors in spacecraft. Still others make use of nuclear fuel and coolant combinations previously attempted in much larger reactors, such as high-temperature gas reactors, sodium fast reactors and even molten salt reactors.

Though encompassing a range of technologies, microreactors are all significantly simpler than the large reactors in use today. In many cases, they have few to no moving parts.

Microreactors, by virtue of being significantly simpler, are going to be more knowable. Because they’re easier to study and understand, simpler reactor systems have fewer points of failure and safety concerns.

Complex systems, such as the large nuclear power reactors, can be fundamentally unknowable, with unexpected entanglements of “unknown unknowns” creating instabilities, safety concerns and potential for failure. Large reactors operate safely today because we have learned about these unknown unknowns over decades of operation. Microreactors, because of their simplicity, will fundamentally be safer and more predictable than the large reactors were when they were first built.

Siting microreactors

Although the Department of Energy oversees microreactor demonstration projects, commercial deployment of microreactors requires approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which could take several years and may ultimately determine how soon commercial reactors can be built. Several designs are now approaching or in the early stages of review.

To keep people safe, large reactors have designated emergency planning zones – usually 10 and 50 miles around – which require different degrees of planning and protection to enter. The 10-mile zone has specific shelters and evacuation plans in place, while people in the 50-mile zone may need to take precautions about what they eat and drink in the event of a catastrophic accident but will not need to evacuate.

Because microreactors are smaller and simpler, developers and regulators may significantly reduce their emergency planning zones. The zones could extend only to the facility’s site boundary, or perhaps a few hundred meters beyond it.

A reduced emergency planning zone could mean that microreactors could be built in towns and cities, or embedded in remote communities. They might one day become as ubiquitous as the solar panels and windmills you see when driving through the countryside. And like the submarine reactors that can power a small underwater community of 100, one microreactor could power a rural town.

But even if siting a nuclear microreactor near a town is technically feasible, would the community accept it?

Public engagement

My lab’s ongoing research suggests that the answer to this question is contingent on how technology developers engage with the communities that may host a microreactor. If they attempt to unilaterally decide, announce and defend their decision to build a microreactor without input, communities will likely push back.

However, if developers work with communities to understand their hopes, concerns and priorities, they will likely find that many people are receptive to hyperlocal nuclear energy facilities.

My team’s initial findings suggest that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach for designing these facilities. Each community will have its own set of preferences that developers will need to navigate alongside the engineering questions.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/688801/original/file-20250902-56-hmf7x0.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C322%2C1201%2C600&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-19 12:06:05.399969

Lima’s job is now at risk as Trump threatens to shutter offshore wind farms, upending states’ investments to support the clean energy source. The administration’s actions have postponed, if not outright eliminated, years of potential construction work. Altogether, more than 15,000 prospective and current jobs tied to wind projects in New England are under threat from the potential shutdowns, according to a Bloomberg analysis of company and state announcements.

For now, Lima and other specialized union staff are still stationed with the Revolution Wind project, and he’s continuing to get paid. But Lima worries about what comes next for his family, including three children, who depend on his income. Ironworkers on the project earn about $76 an hour with pension and health benefits, typically working 84-hour weeks on four-week rotations, according to David Langlais of the Iron Workers union.

“I just came here to work for my family and I don’t really pay attention to all the political stuff,” Lima said, adding that he was confused why the White House would stop the Revolution project when it’s already 80% completed. “If the work stops and it keeps going like this, it’s going to hurt us.”

Trump has long opposed offshore wind, suing unsuccessfully before he became president to block a project within view of his golf course in Scotland. But the recent escalation of his administration’s battle against the industry risks clashing with simultaneous claims that the White House’s policies are fueling investment and job growth.

It’s simply still in development.

That’s why today I dedicate my column to sorting through Indiana’s complicated relationship with solar power—the one energy form whose costs have long been falling, whose ability to scale is rising, and the one Elon Musk constantly insists we should bet on: “Solar power is very obviously the future if you can do elementary math.”

If there were ever a time to fix our relationship, now is the time.

On one hand, Indiana has many bright spots around this evolving energy tech. In 2024, we had one of the highest state installations of solar, including finishing Phase One of Mammoth Solar—one of the nation’s largest projects. We are home to one of the nation’s relatively few made-in-America solar manufacturers, Bila Solar. Purdue University’s formidable research capacity is helping increase yields with nanophotonics and reimagining farms and solar with agrivoltaics.

Anecdotally, too, one of the few American billionaires to come out of the solar business is a son of Gary, Indiana: Dean Solon, who is now leading a charge to reinvent U.S. solar manufacturing. Former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s first move post-tenure was to join the board of a major solar company. And if you drive out of the Indianapolis airport, you’ll pass one of the largest airport solar installations in the country.

Story Continues Below

On the other hand, solar has been a political lightning rod. Year in and year out, Hoosiers from across the state band together to oppose solar and wind, obstructing legislation at the state level and projects at the county and local levels. The laws on the books tilt the scales against homeowners who want to sell homegrown rooftop solar onto the grid. Solar has become so toxic, many politicians will not touch it.

The concerns around this tech deserve clarity and space—the effects of converting farmland, the financial viability of projects, the fairness of having solar in your community—but today, I’m asking people to step back, pause and consider three big, foundational reasons to rethink solar in our current moment.

First, immediate demand spikes. In the next few years, additional energy demand can really only be met by gas, solar, wind and storage. We’re not building coal, hydro or nuclear. It would be backward not to feature solar—smartly—in that portfolio, especially given widely reported supply-chain problems for gas-plant parts.

Second, innovation. The public often underestimates the power of innovation—especially American innovation in an energy crunch. Solar and battery technologies keep improving, from inverters to better storage.

Third, China. We can’t lose the AI arms race for lack of energy. Further, China is scaling solar at breathtaking speed—projecting annual capacity additions by the end of decade that will exceed the energy the United States generates in a single year. We can’t discard this next-gen energy tech while it’s on the rise globally.

As I would with any energy source, I’m arguing for a real, honest conversation, because the stakes and potential are so high. There’s a great evolution happening in the energy and tech space, so I urge our leaders to think like clear-eyed energy strategists. Speak openly with the public about the trade-offs—as well as the promise—of this technology, and get creative with how we bring about—and where we place—this growing tech.•

Power the Future

The Center Square

In late summer 2019, an elderly woman I knew from church asked me to stop by her house in our New Mexico neighborhood. It was late August, the kind of day when the desert sun turns homes into ovens, and her air conditioner simply wouldn’t keep up. I’m no HVAC expert, but I promised to look at her thermostat.

There was no problem with the thermostat inside. The problem was on the air conditioner outside, but not a mechanical function or broken part. Her utility company installed a regulator on her A/C unit – part of a so-called “power-saving” program. The catch? During the hottest part of the day, when she needed cooling the most, the utility cut her system back. In exchange for surrendering control of her own comfort, she received a rebate of just $25 a year.

And now, instead of just controlling the A/C, some want central control of your whole thermostat.

A new bill in Ohio would allow utilities to reach into homes and directly control customer thermostats. Supporters call it “demand management.” But the reality is clear: these programs are designed to normalize energy poverty by conditioning families to accept less comfort and less freedom in exchange for pennies on the dollar.

Ohio wouldn’t be the first. In Colorado, tens of thousands of families discovered they couldn’t change their Wi-Fi enabled thermostats during a sweltering day. They were locked out – literally – because the utility had triggered a “demand response event.” One home in the program reportedly reached 88 degrees inside. Additionally, in Colorado Springs, customers are offered $50 to enroll, but the company reserves the right to raise your thermostat up to four degrees during peak demand. Sure, you can opt out – but the normalization is the point.

In Indiana, a utility pilot remotely adjusted smart thermostats to cut demand by nearly a kilowatt per home in summer. While residents technically could override, the default was no longer their choice — it was the utility’s.

Different programs, same philosophy: normalize energy scarcity by quietly taking over the devices in your home.

Policymakers and utilities always sell these schemes as “partnerships” or “innovation.” But let’s be clear: it’s not innovation to make a grandmother sit in a sweltering house because her air conditioner has been throttled. It’s not progress when families discover their thermostats are frozen on a triple-digit day. These programs shift the burden of bad energy policy onto ordinary families. Instead of building reliable power plants that keep up with demand, utilities are trained to manage shortfalls by managing you. Your thermostat, your A/C, your comfort – they become their safety valve.

This is how energy poverty is normalized. Not through rolling blackouts, but through quiet intrusions that teach us to accept less as the new normal.

Think of it this way: we would never accept Comcast taking control of our television or your internet provider cutting out news sources and social media sites. Yet, when it comes to air conditioning – the very system that keeps us safe in dangerous heat – we are told it’s normal for strangers to decide how cool our homes are allowed to be.

That double standard is alarming. The things that make life bearable in the hottest summers and coldest winters are the very things we should be protecting from outside control. The price tag for this surrender isn’t just $25 a year. It’s our autonomy. It’s the principle that our homes are our own. Every locked thermostat, every cycling A/C switch, every “demand response event” is another step toward redefining reliability downward. Comfort becomes selfish. Scarcity becomes “noble.”

That’s not noble. It’s rationing with a smartphone app. And if a utility company – or a government bureaucrat – can dictate the temperature of your living room, then your home is no longer your castle. It’s just another outpost in the grid they control.

The states with the most to lose when the EV tax credit ends

On September 30, 2025, the government’s EV tax credit expires.

For years, it’s been the magic coupon that softened the blow of sticker-shock and nudged people into electric ownership.

Now, the math gets harsher.

In 2023 alone, nearly half a million new EV buyers filed claims worth $3.3 billion, while used EV shoppers chipped in another $95.6 million.

The average payout?

Around $6,700 for a new car, $3,400 for a secondhand one.

Take that away and the buying equation shifts dramatically.

No state has more at stake than California.

If the program disappears, its drivers lose out on roughly $1.1 billion in incentives.

Texas follows with just under $273 million, then Florida with about $201 million.

On the opposite end sits Mississippi, North Dakota, and Louisiana, where EV credits barely made a dent in the first place.

For automakers, that’s a patchwork market.

Hot zones are suddenly cooling, while slow states will stay slow.

And the trend was already wobbly.

Nationwide EV registrations grew to 1.7 percent of all light-duty vehicles in 2023, up from 1.2 percent the year before.

But sales of new EVs actually dipped 6.3 percent in Q2 this year compared with last.

Removing the credit risks pouring cold water on an already lukewarm market.

What this means for the electric car market

Nationwide, EVs are still only a sliver of the market.

Just 1.7 percent of light-duty vehicles on US roads in 2023 were electric, even after the tax credit helped thousands of buyers.

And in Q2 2025, new EV sales actually slipped 6.3 percent compared with the same period last year.

LendingTree’s analysis warns that removing the federal incentive could slow demand even further.

Especially in states without strong local programs or charging infrastructure to pick up the slack.

That means fewer people crossing the line into EV ownership, and a tougher job for automakers already facing softer sales.

For buyers, the next couple of weeks may be one of the last chances to claim the maximum credit.

But so far, some Republican committee chairs appear skeptical that the opportunity even exists. And even if a second reconciliation bill does come together eventually, key players in Congress are indicating that energy and environment provisions may be off the table.

“I feel like the things that we could do within the parameters of reconciliation we exhausted,” said House Budget Chair Jodey Arrington (R-Texas), speaking specifically about energy provisions.

He said Republicans “had so many wins” in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that it’s unclear “if there’s any meat left on the bone with respect to more pro-energy policies.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has announced plans to take a second stab at a party-line reconciliation bill this fall, and some of the planning has already begun.

A House GOP working group has kicked off discussions, and some members have laid down markers for provisions they want to pursue, including regulatory overhauls and fees on electric vehicles.

Still, those efforts have been slow to gain steam, and they face major headwinds with lawmakers suggesting there is little desire for chasing more energy and climate policies.

The relative dearth of activity thus far is in part a reflection of the comprehensive haul Republicans secured in the multitrillion-dollar party-line bill they passed in July. It checked most of the GOP’s boxes — repealing clean energy tax credits, rescinding billions of dollars for climate grants, rolling back emissions rules, and creating incentives for fossil fuel drilling and mining, among other provisions.

Republicans’ apparent hesitance to pursue even more energy provisions also signals a weariness among members to go through the kinds of intense intraparty negotiations they endured just a few months ago.

“It seems to me that the appetite for anything reconciliation right now, understandably, is, ‘God, please don’t,’” said Heather Reams, president of the right-leaning advocacy group Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions.

The White House and congressional leaders have yet to outline specific priorities for a second bill, and some lawmakers have thrown cold water on the idea of it coming together at all, with some warning it could actually be counterproductive.

“I think that’s going to be interesting if it develops,” said Senate Environment and Public Works Chair Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.). “It’s not developing now.”

The vision for the second bill, according to Johnson, Arrington and other GOP leaders, is a much smaller package that would contain budget policies that Republicans did not get to the first time or that they were forced to abandon because of parliamentary issues.

But conservative lawmakers, advocates and lobbyists say they are generally satisfied with what they got out of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And some of the language that dropped out of the original bill may not be revived — including related to permitting and regulations — because it still would not comply with the Senate’s strict reconciliation rules.

The allure of budget reconciliation process is that it allows fiscal legislation to pass by simple majority. The downside is the restrictions.

Democrats will have little power to stop the bill since they are in the minority. But like last time, they could request parliamentary inquiries to tank provisions that violate the Senate’s budget rules.

Democrats are also likely to continue to amplify their messaging that Republican-favored energy policies will increase Americans’ electricity bills.

“Instead of helping families, Republicans are ripping away the cheapest forms of power we have, driving up costs, killing jobs, and handing another gift to Big Oil & Gas,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement to POLITICO’s E&E News.

“Now they want a sequel?” Schumer said. “American families can’t afford an encore of Republicans’ Big Beautiful Blunder.”

Mixed signals

Republicans appear to be in vastly different places in the planning process, creating a split-screen dynamic between members who are forging ahead and others who say discussions have not yet begun.

On one side of the spectrum is the Republican Study Committee — the House’s conservative policy forum — which has set up a “Reconciliation 2.0 Working Group.” They plan to unveil a broad policy framework for the reconciliation package as soon as this week, said Rep. August Pfluger (R-Texas), chair of the RSC.

The group held multiple brainstorming and informational sessions with congressional staffers and advocacy groups over the summer. In early August, aides were invited to hear from staff on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, POLITICO reported.

“We’ve passed a very successful first bill. Now, what kinds of provisions can we look forward to?” Pfluger said, describing the RSC’s thinking without providing specifics. “How can we work with our Senate counterparts to move the ball a little bit more forward on some of the issues that have been hampering energy production?”

House Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) has been saying for months that he has been talking to members and staff to get the ball rolling.

“Those discussions are happening, and I think it could happen,” Westerman said recently. “I can tell you we’re working on it.”

But on the other end of the spectrum, some Republican committee chairs say they have not seen any movement or begun conversations of their own, despite Johnson’s publicly stated plans for a second bill.

House Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.) said, “I know that people are talking reconciliation, but I haven’t — we haven’t — sat down and started putting any plans together.”

Capito, the EPW chair, noted that a reconciliation bill is “not developing now” because “there’s just too many other things that are taking precedence.”

Congress has been busy with fights over nominees and fiscal 2026 appropriations bills. Controversies around the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, partisan rescissions packages and other issues have also taken up significant floor time.

Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, declined to comment.

Spokespeople for the White House and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Johnson referred E&E News to the speaker’s previous public statements.

Johnson told Bloomberg in July that his goal was to produce a smaller reconciliation bill in the “late fall.” He said it would probably involve just four or five committees, including the Energy and Commerce Committee and the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.

Keeping the door open

The lack of visible action on a second reconciliation bill does not necessarily spell doom for the effort. Some Republican lawmakers and lobbyists are waiting in the wings, eager to pitch in when the time is right.

“Undoubtedly, if there was another bill, we would certainly take the opportunity to try to do better on renewable energy and try another path,” said Reams, of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, which supports renewables as part of a balanced energy strategy.

“It may be futile to do that,” she said, “but if there’s an opportunity and the doors open, we would take that opportunity.”

Luke Bolar, chief external affairs officer at the conservative energy nonprofit ClearPath, said that while most of the group’s top priorities were taken care of in the first bill, the advanced manufacturing production tax credit known as 45X “might be one to relook at.”

“They did include some provisions that will be good for critical minerals, which is positive,” Bolar said, “but I think there are other American advanced manufacturing technologies that could benefit from the 45X credit,” including for grid components such as transformers and conductors.

Lee and Rep. Kat Cammack (R-Fla.) want to revive their sweeping regulatory overhaul bill — a version of the “Regulations from the Executive In Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act” — which the parliamentarian said ran afoul of Senate reconciliation rules. The provision would have expanded congressional veto power over certain agency rulemakings.

“I feel like, had we had more time, we could have worked out some of the bugs on [‘REINS’],” Lee said after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed without his preferred language. “Even that adverse parliamentarian ruling is one that I think we could work through. That’s a potential option.”

Guthrie, who said his committee has not started putting together ideas, hinted before the August recess that artificial intelligence policy could be a priority for the Republican majority this Congress. The energy demands of the rapidly advancing technology could be at the center of upcoming conversations, he said.

“Everybody you meet with [on] AI business says, ‘Energy energy, energy,’” Guthrie told reporters. “They’ve got the brain power, they’ve got the capital, and they need energy. So that’s what we have to focus on.”

Doubts remain

While lawmakers and advocates have sporadically floated various ideas for “reconciliation 2.0,” the effort still faces obstacles.

Mustering the political will for more party-line energy provisions could prove exceedingly difficult, especially since many members and lobbyists feel satisfied with the results of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

“We’re talking about a second bill,” said Westerman, “but, you know, we got a lot of stuff in the first bill.”

Kristin Whitman, senior vice president of federal relations at the American Petroleum Institute — the oil and gas industry’s loudest voice on Capitol Hill — praised the first reconciliation bill in a statement but indicated that the group is now focused on permitting reform, which is likely to be acted on outside of reconciliation.

Capito and House Transportation and Infrastructure Chair Sam Graves (R-Mo.) have said they would want to revive a proposal to impose registration fees on hybrid and electric vehicles in order to shore up the Highway Trust Fund, which relies heavily on gasoline taxes.

But that language, promoted by Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio), was dropped from the first bill because the fee structure was too difficult to enforce as written at the time.

Asked recently whether he would want to bring it back in the next budget bill, Moreno demurred.

“Not EVs,” he said. “I think that’s settled.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/6a/38/3ef8bf724ee08b2e333e28b349f9/u-s-congress-84881.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 11:01:47.806177

OK, let’s say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed.","Tax incentives that saved U.S. residents thousands of dollars on home efficiency upgrades, clean energy installations and electric vehicles are expiring this year. That means people who want to take advantage of them before they disappear have to act quickly.

“There is still time, but the clock is ticking,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we’ve got some tips on how to maximize savings.

What are the incentives?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren’t capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

When are they expiring?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it’s also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

The car doesn’t need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

If I’m focused on my home, what should I prioritize?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

“That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,” she said. “Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.”

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

“We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn’t mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,” Pierce said.

“Experts estimate that takes 16 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that’s quick,” said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. “You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it’s even possible.”

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?

OK, let’s say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren’t allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects — think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage — could be carried forward if you didn’t get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

When homeowners decide to go solar, many assume the process is as simple as choosing a provider and scheduling an installation. In reality, there is a common obstacle that can stop projects before they begin: the roof. If the roof is old, damaged, or nearing the end of its lifespan, most installers will not move forward until it is replaced.

More solar providers are now moving toward integrated roofing and solar services to reduce delays and cut costs. Purelight Power, which operates across the Pacific Northwest and is expanding into California, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, is one of several companies betting that this bundled approach could become the new standard in home energy.

The Problem with Separate Contractors

For decades, roofing and solar were handled by different trades. A homeowner might sign a contract for solar panels, only to discover later that their roof could not support the system.

""It is one of the biggest frustrations we hear from homeowners,"" says Josh Hoeg of Purelight Power. ""They are excited about solar, but they end up facing an unexpected roof replacement before they can move forward.""

Hiring a roofer separately often adds months to the project. It also creates warranty headaches: if a leak develops later, the roofer and solar installer may blame one another, leaving the homeowner stuck in the middle.

The Rise of Integrated Solar and Roofing

This gap in the market has led to a growing trend: companies offering integrated solar and roofing solutions. Homeowners can now replace their roof and install panels through a single provider, rather than juggling two contractors.

The benefits are clear:

One point of contact. No need to manage multiple companies.

Unified warranties. A single provider takes responsibility for both the roof and the panels.

Simplified financing. Roofing costs can often be bundled into solar loans, and in some cases may even qualify for tax incentives.

Purelight has already expanded its roofing services in Oregon, including Portland and Bend, where demand for combined projects is strong. ""By combining services, we are removing one of the biggest barriers to going solar,"" adds [Executive Name]. ""When homeowners can solve two problems with one investment, adoption goes up dramatically.""

Why It Matters for Homeowners

Bundling a roof replacement with a solar installation is not just about convenience; it can also deliver long-term savings. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the average residential solar system costs between $15,000 and $25,000, while a new roof ranges from $10,000 to $15,000. When handled separately, these projects often require different loans with different terms.

Doing them together allows some providers to fold both projects into a single financing plan. The Solar Energy Industries Association notes that portions of the roof replacement that directly support the solar system may qualify for federal tax credits, lowering costs by thousands of dollars.

There is also a practical advantage. A new roof can last 25 to 30 years, roughly the same lifespan as most solar panels. Aligning the two investments helps ensure the solar system produces consistently without major interruptions.

Industry Perspectives

Analysts are paying attention. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) has identified ""roof readiness"" as one of the most common barriers for homeowners considering solar. That has made integrated services an attractive option as adoption continues to rise.

Purelight Power is not the only company moving in this direction, but it has been among the early adopters in the Pacific Northwest. The company recently earned recognition as a Best of Bend award winner for solar, placing second in the category. The award highlights how local communities are responding to providers that simplify the process and reduce barriers for homeowners.

""Energy is changing faster than most homeowners realize,"" says Josh Hoeg. ""In the next decade, we believe solar will be as standard as air conditioning, and integrating roofing is part of making that future practical and affordable.""

Looking Ahead

As more states introduce incentives and homeowners look for ways to lower energy bills, pairing solar with roofing may soon become the default option. For homeowners, the shift promises fewer surprises, stronger warranties, and more predictable savings.

Going solar has always been about more than clean energy. It is also about making a smart, lasting investment in the home. With roofing and solar increasingly handled together, that investment is becoming much easier to manage.",https://d.techtimes.com/en/full/459331/pairing-solar-roofing.png,N,,2025-09-19 14:06:50.339013

However, Rep. Kevin Mullin (D-Calif.) said in a markup earlier this year that the bill would allow “fossil fuel projects to cut the line.”

“We shouldn’t be prioritizing ready-to-go projects just because they are clean energy,” he said.

The bill is unlikely to pass in the Senate, where it would need at least seven Democrats to support it.

The Trump administration wants to roll back the 2009 endangerment finding, which determined that carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases threaten human health and can be regulated under the Clean Air Act.

Because the endangerment finding forms the basis for so many other rules, some conservatives have seen rolling it back as a way to knock down multiple climate regulations at once. Announcing plans to revoke the finding in July, Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, called it “the largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States.”

One of the Trump administration’s arguments to repeal the endangerment finding amounts to an assertion that the science has changed since 2009, and the evidence no longer supports the conclusions that underpin rules limiting emissions from cars and power plants.

According to DoE analysis, the current pace of project development is insufficient to support the rapidly growing manufacturing base and ongoing reindustrialisation.

Through this initiative, the department will work with stakeholders to identify grid projects capable of power delivery, while addressing the grid’s complex challenges.

US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said: “In the coming years, Americans will require more energy to power their homes and businesses – and with President Trump’s leadership, the Department of Energy is ensuring we can meet this growing demand while fuelling AI and data centre development with affordable, reliable and secure sources.

“With the Speed to Power initiative, we are leveraging the expertise of the private sector to harness all forms of energy that are affordable, reliable and secure to ensure the United States is able to win the AI race.”

To begin with, the DoE is issuing a request for information to gather input on large-scale grid infrastructure projects, including both generation and transmission.

The initiative builds on President Trump’s Executive Order declaring a National Energy Emergency, signed on his first day in office, which emphasised the urgent need to expand US energy infrastructure for national and economic security.

In line with this order, the DoE released the report evaluating US grid reliability and security, which provides a uniform methodology to identify at-risk regions and guide federal interventions around reliability.

But whatever Congress decides on the EPA budget, state environment departments next year will still receive substantially less federal support for their work.","Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

Every dollar that the federal government directs to state environment departments enables the Great Lakes and every other region to steward natural resources, yielding many times the value of the federal contribution. State environment departments make the case daily that they merit more financial support, not less.

That is why Circle of Blue’s opinion desk has been worried for months about the dangerous consequences of President Trump’s proposal to rip $5 billion – 55 percent – out of the Environmental Protection Agency’s $9.1 billion budget.

Now that it’s September, we’re encouraged (just a tiny bit, mind you) by the actions MAGA Republicans in both houses of Congress have taken to break with the president to reduce the size of the proposed EPA budget reduction.

The Republican-led House proposes a less absurd but still dire 26 percent cut for the EPA. The Senate wants to shave a more reasonable 6 percent out of the environmental agency’s 2026 budget. Lawmakers from both chambers are meeting to reach a compromise in time to add the EPA provisions to a final federal budget bill by the end of the month to avoid a government shutdown.

Both proposals are a visible and aggressive rebuke of Trump at the federal level that attracted scant comment in the capital. That doesn’t mean, though, that we’re anywhere close to being relieved. Here’s why. Most of the work – 90 percent, in fact – of meeting the goals of federal statutes to safely manage air, water, wildlife habitat, and toxic substances is carried out by state environment and natural resources departments. And sizable portions of every state’s environment budget are funded by the EPA.

For instance, the Illinois EPA receives $1 billion of its $1.3 billion budget from U.S. EPA funds. Similarly, Michigan’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) receives 52 percent of its $1.2 billion annual budget from federal revenue.

The Environmental Management Division of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources gains a quarter of the funding for its air quality program from the U.S. EPA. Almost all of the $34.3 million Ohio EPA budget for protecting water quality is funded by the U.S. EPA.

State authorities insist they will manage with what they have. “EGLE continues to keep an eye on federal actions and potential actions,” said Dale George, the department’s communications director, in an email message. “We’re not letting uncertainty shift the focus from our statutory functions protecting Michigan’s environment and public health.”

State Departments Will Have Less Money

EGLE employs 1,500 full-time staff members, and judging from the generally first-class condition of Michigan’s waters, forests, shorelines, and streams, the agency is holding its own. But the loss of tens of millions of federal dollars in the environmental protection programs in Michigan and every other state seriously diminishes their capacity.

The reason: responsibilities of state environment agencies are extensive, expensive, and – with the exception of major mistakes – generally out of public sight. They encompass such tasks as deciding permit conditions for new commercial and industrial developments. They monitor the quality of streams and the safety of drinking water. They ensure that toxic cleanups, mining, and oil and gas production are done safely. And they prosecute violations.

State environment departments also are responsible for administering their portion of the more than $4 billion from the EPA that is available to local governments for modernizing drinking water infrastructure and preventing water pollution. President Trump proposed to cut most of the funding for this low-interest loan and grant program. The House is eyeing a 24 percent cut, while the Senate wants to maintain current funding levels.

To everyday Americans that may appear to be tussling around big dollars. In government terms, it’s not. Environment department budgets typically are a fraction – 1 to 3 percent – of total state budgets. The U.S. EPA budget is less than two-tenths of 1 percent of this year’s $6.8 trillion federal budget.

At that level the president’s assertion that cutting the EPA budget will reduce the federal deficit is absurd. The deficit has grown even as states have steadily lost federal support for their core environmental programs for over two decades.

EPA funding in 2025 for what the agency calls “categorical” grants for air and water quality, pollution prevention, toxic waste management, and 18 other core programs was $1 billion. In 2003, the budget for categorical grants was $1.14 billion, which in real dollar terms, accounting for inflation, is equal to $2 billion today.

In other words, states lost half of their federal funding in 22 years for the day-to-day work they do to protect the environment.

President Trump proposed earlier this year to eliminate 19 of the 22 categorical grants. Congress appears ready to reject those cuts, too.

That’s a relief. In 1964 the Wilderness Act was enacted to block development in the country’s wildest public lands. In the next 16 years the United States embarked on a profoundly important and successful era of national environmental policy to limit damage to air, water, habitat, and people that culminated in 1980 with the federal Superfund law to clean up toxic wastes. Almost every one of the environmental statutes relied on the concept of cooperation between the federal and state governments.

The federal government established the basic framework and goals. The EPA provided financial support to reach them. State and local agencies agreed to be directly responsible for implementation and enforcement.

Breaking Cooperation?

President Trump proposed in his 2026 budget plan to wreck that relationship. Even reactionaries in Congress rejected the most extreme version of Trump’s gambit.

But whatever Congress decides on the EPA budget, state environment departments next year will still receive substantially less federal support for their work. Every state will feel the consequences. Erosion in the quality of a state’s natural abundance, and its accessibility, weakens the quality of life and the condition of the economy.

Less money limits state oversight of polluters and law breakers. It will slow administrative functions, like reviewing and issuing new air, water quality, and operating permits. These delays aggravate business and factory owners. It could cause employers to lay off staff and abandon their projects.

Michigan, my home state, is rich now in clean water, clean air, unspoiled shorelines and Lake Michigan sand dunes, ample freshwater fisheries, and millions of acres of public forest accessible by hundreds of trails.

It’s a legacy of effective environmentalism that supports abundant wildlife, a robust economy, a reliably excellent experience for millions of faithfully returning visitors, and life-in-balance for the people of this beautiful state. I dread to think how serious reductions in federal support will spoil what the state environment agency has accomplished over the last half century.

Veloz, a national nonpartisan 501(c)(3) nonprofit, leads the charge in electric vehicle (EV) education through its “The Way Forward is Electric” initiative under the Electric For All program. This brand-neutral campaign educates consumers on EV benefits amid surging sales, reaching hundreds of millions nationwide in its first two months. Launched on July 1, the effort emphasizes cost savings, lower maintenance, charging ease, and ample range, adapting swiftly to policy shifts like the early end of federal EV tax credits.

Key Highlights

425.5 million paid media impressions generated since launch, driving widespread awareness.

Over 990,000 website visits to ElectricForAll.org, with 220,000+ accessing incentive resources.

Campaign pivots to inform on qualifying for tax credits via contracts and down payments by September 30, despite possession delays.

EV sales hit a record 146,332 units in August, with projections for the highest quarterly total in U.S. history.

Supported by $43.5 million from Electrify America and partners like automakers, utilities, and nonprofits.

The campaign’s agility shines in its response to congressional changes ending the federal EV tax credit ahead of schedule. Veloz updated messaging to guide consumers toward ElectricForAll.org, a multilingual hub in 15 languages, including English and Spanish. This resource simplifies finding federal, state, and local incentives by ZIP code, comparing new and used EVs, locating charging stations, and calculating gas and maintenance savings. It equips drivers with tools for long-term affordability, addressing concerns like charging access and post-incentive costs.

Josh D. Boone, Executive Director of Veloz, highlights the focus on financial perks. “Americans are deeply concerned about the cost of living right now,” Boone states. “So, we’re focusing on the financial benefits of EVs through both short-term incentives and long-term savings.” This research-driven approach counters misinformation, fostering confidence in EV ownership.

Engagement metrics underscore the campaign’s impact. Consumers from states like Texas, Florida, California, Georgia, Washington, and New York flock to the site for answers to key questions: Where to charge? How much to save? What follows federal incentives? Automaker data reflects this momentum—General Motors achieved its best-ever month with over 21,000 EVs sold in August, while Ford saw a nearly 19% sales jump from July as buyers hurried for the $7,500 credit.

Boone emphasizes sustained growth: “Just because the federal incentives are sunsetting doesn’t mean EV adoption will stall.” The initiative builds momentum beyond policies, uniting industry, advocacy, and policy experts. With broad collaboration, it positions Veloz as the architect of the nation’s largest EV public awareness effort.

Founded in 2017 on the California Plug-In Electric Vehicle Collaborative’s legacy, Veloz convenes diverse stakeholders for innovative programming and events. The Electric For All program, powered by Veloz, streamlines the switch to electric transport, making it accessible for all communities. By sparking interest and providing clear information, the campaign ensures EV adoption thrives, even as incentives evolve.

This collaborative model proves powerful. “Working with industry, policy, and advocacy experts, we’ve shown that when the EV industry comes together, we can build momentum that lasts beyond a single policy or incentive,” Boone concludes. As EV interest surges this quarter, Veloz’s efforts cut through noise, empowering informed choices and driving record engagement at a pivotal moment.",https://theevreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Electric-For-All.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 11:01:08.119566

I read about it in “My Weekly Reader,” (a popular educational newspaper for schoolchildren in those days) and discussed it with my teacher. She was the same teacher who advised us not to ride gas-operated mini-bikes as it was harmful to the environment.

It was an exciting time to come of age. Environmental awareness had creeped into the American consciousness. It was a time when a river in Ohio made international news by catching on fire and our cities were experiencing the choking haze of worsening air pollution. People just knew something had to be done about it.

That first Earth Day was universally celebrated by both political parties. It was that same year that then-President Richard Nixon (a Republican) signed the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), established the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

It is impossible to talk about that First Earth Day, and what the distinguished author Douglas Brinkley calls the “Silent Spring Revolution… and the Great Environmental Awakening” without first mentioning a fearless and courageous woman, Rachel Carson.

Rachel Carson’s watershed book “Silent Spring” was published in 1962 and is often credited as the linchpin to the modern environmental movement. In the book, Carson warns of the dangers of widespread use of DDT and other pesticides. Of course, she was viciously attacked by the chemical industry.

When Nixon created the EPA by executive order in 1970, it was in response to this rising environmentalism and was almost immediately effective in setting about to reduce pollution. State and municipal governments soon followed suit. These ideas were not radical. They were about protecting the commons, the air that we breathe and the water that we drink. Today, I feel as though the EPA is retreating from these important accomplishments. One step up and two steps back, it would appear.

Last month, the EPA published its repeal of the Endangerment Finding, which provides the legal underpinning for limiting greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from cars and other sources. The EPA administrator said, “Today marks the death of the Green New Scam.” I think we need to be careful about oversimplification and sloganeering. It was the EPA under the authority of the Clean Air Act which established standards for limiting the amount of lead in gasoline and other emissions, including carbon monoxide. I remember filling my motorcycle up with leaded gasoline when I was in high school. Leaded gasoline was extremely harmful, especially to children. Years later, during port calls in developing countries, I could personally witness the harmful effects to people in places that did not have these same protections and regulations. It took decades to phase out the use of leaded gasoline. How long will it take us to recover from misguided actions we might be undertaking today?

As of this writing, there is still a chance to provide public comment to the EPA regarding the Endangerment Finding on their website. I encourage individual citizens to do so. I am a sailor, not a scientist, but it just makes sense to protect humanity and all living things on this rapidly warming planet. Undoing the regulatory framework that Nixon put in place in 1970, over a half a century ago, is misguided. Touch gently the earth our children and grandchildren rest upon.

Stevenson, Carlos Anchondo, Jennifer Yachnin, Heather Richards, Scott Streater",,,,,https://www.eenews.net/articles/burgum-celebrated-wind-power-then-trump-tapped-him-to-kill-it/,"During his eight years in office, wind power flourished in his home state — so much so that Burgum honored wind power last year as part of a weeklong celebration for clean energy.
“Wind power provided about one-third of North Dakota’s net generation in 2022,” Burgum bragged in his September 2024 proclamation.
“He knew that wind power was one of those important features to reach that goal.” But now, Ista says he fears for workers in his district — which includes the city of Grand Forks — who work at a wind turbine manufacturing plant, LM Wind Power.

North Dakota is a natural source for wind because it has “substantial and nearly continuous wind energy resources,” according to the EIA.","Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has taken a wrecking ball to the U.S. wind industry since joining the Trump administration earlier this year.

But it hasn’t always been that way.

In just seven months at Interior, Burgum has blocked or stalled at least six major wind projects, including one off the coast of New England that’s 80 percent complete. At the same time, Burgum has cast doubt on the reliability of wind power, telling CNBC last week that “you don’t know when the wind’s gonna blow.”

Yet Burgum’s recent turn as wind power nemesis stands in contrast to how he viewed the energy source during his time as North Dakota governor. During his eight years in office, wind power flourished in his home state — so much so that Burgum honored wind power last year as part of a weeklong celebration for clean energy.

“Wind power provided about one-third of North Dakota’s net generation in 2022,” Burgum bragged in his September 2024 proclamation. That put North Dakota “among the top six states with the largest share of electricity generated by wind.”

That’s not all.

In 2021, he called on his state to reach carbon neutrality by 2030. It’s an aggressive timeline, but Burgum said North Dakota is uniquely positioned to hit that mark because it boasts enough underground storage space to store “4,400 years’ worth of the state’s carbon output,” according to the governor’s office.

“We can reach carbon neutrality in the state of North Dakota by 2030 without a single mandate, without any additional regulation,” Burgum said in 2021. “We can get there just through the innovation and the different geology that we have.”

An Interior Department spokesperson did not directly answer questions as to why Burgum’s position on wind had changed so significantly in the last year but issued a statement that attacked the “Radical Green New Scam” and promoted fossil fuel generation.

“Secretary Burgum is in agreement with President Donald Trump that protecting our energy security means ensuring the American people aren’t reliant on designed to fail energy sources, such as wind, which is why the Department of the Interior recently ended special treatment for these unreliable energy sources,” Aubrie Spady said in a statement.

White House spokesperson Anna Kelly added that Burgum has “long aligned with the President’s agenda to Make America Energy Dominant Again, largely through prioritizing fossil fuel-generated energy.”

To be sure, Burgum was a big booster for fossil fuels when he was governor — which makes sense given North Dakota’s wealth of oil, gas and coal reserves. But it was part of a broader “all-of-the-above” energy policy that one North Dakota Democrat says he no longer recognizes.

Burgum “went out ahead of his fellow Republican governors and it put us on a path towards carbon neutrality in an aggressive time frame,” said state Rep. Zachary Ista. “He knew that wind power was one of those important features to reach that goal.”

But now, Ista says he fears for workers in his district — which includes the city of Grand Forks — who work at a wind turbine manufacturing plant, LM Wind Power. “Their jobs are the ones that are getting played, they’re having politics played with them,” said Ista, who serves as minority leader in the North Dakota state house.

When he was first elected in 2016, Burgum was a moderate who avoided culture wars and did not seek to block renewable energy, said Scott Skokos, executive director of the Dakota Resource Council, a conservation group that advocates for clean energy.

In fact, Burgum as governor did not back a GOP-led effort in the state legislature to ban wind turbines, Skokos noted.

“A lot of people are very confused about what happened to Doug Burgum,” Skokos said. “People kind of think of Doug as something like two different people. There is Doug Burgum pre-presidential run, and then there’s Doug now.”

Burgum briefly sought the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.

As Interior secretary, Burgum has been aggressive in his attacks on wind generation. In Europe last week, he said there was “not a future for offshore wind” in the Trump administration.

Last month, as part of its ongoing efforts to throttle clean energy projects, the Interior Department issued an order that made clear it would now consider as a factor the amount of space a proposed project takes up compared to other energy sources. That’s a directive aimed at wind projects, which can require more acreage than oil and gas drilling.

Burgum again repeated his newfound worries about wind energy, claiming it was “unreliable.”

“Gargantuan, unreliable, intermittent energy projects hold America back from achieving U.S. Energy Dominance while weighing heavily on the American taxpayer and environment,” Burgum said in a statement.

Under Burgum, the Interior Department has proposed revoking the permits for at least three offshore wind projects in the Atlantic, canceled approvals for a massive onshore wind project in Idaho and issued a stop-work order on an offshore wind project that is 80 percent complete. Interior also issued a stop-work order on a New York wind project, but later lifted it.

Additionally, the Interior Department is working to slow additional wind projects by exploring their impact on migratory birds, eliminating policies “biased in favor of wind and solar energy” and weighing whether to remove areas onshore and offshore for wind energy development.

Burgum’s recent attacks on wind energy are notable too given how much the power source has helped his home state. During Burgum’s tenure as governor, from 2016 to 2024, wind power generation more than doubled in North Dakota, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

North Dakota is a natural source for wind because it has “substantial and nearly continuous wind energy resources,” according to the EIA. That natural advantage helps explain why North Dakota has more than 4,000 megawatts of installed wind power generating capacity and four of its top 10 power plants by generation are powered by wind.

That takes on extra significance because North Dakota is ranked third among states — behind only Texas and New Mexico — for crude oil reserves and production. And yet, the state’s electricity generation mix is about 40 percent clean energy, including wind at 35 percent and hydropower at 5 percent, according to EIA data from 2024.

The first elected office Burgum held was North Dakota governor, so he started running the state like a CEO of company who recognized the value in all forms of energy production, said Heather Reams, CEO of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a conservative clean energy advocacy group.

He had a “problem-solving mindset” and clearly saw the value in wind because North Dakota had so much energy potential, she said.

“He was looking at the balance sheet more than anything, I think that was his motivation, rather than anything political because he didn’t come from politics, doesn’t have that background,” Reams said. “You can see how he operated much more as a more like, a CEO, an innovative thinker, out of the box thinker.”

That has certainly changed now that Burgum is leading Trump’s anti-wind crusade, but Reams said it seems like Burgum is just following the president’s priorities rather than relying on his own experience as governor of a wind-intensive state.

Whatever Burgum may profess to believe now, investors don’t seem to buy in when it comes to clean energy in the state he once led, said Skokos, of the Dakota Resource Council.

“Clearly North Dakota doesn’t agree with Doug because we rely on so much wind power,” he said. “And clearly wind is reliable in North Dakota because people keep investing in it.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/0c/4b/175a2c694b718612dc26ffbc4185/election-2024-burgum-05788.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 07:58:46.292005

Aspects of this different approach to security are considered in the Dashboard with a number of SMR design incorporating ‘security by design’ into the SMR design.","The global appetite for energy, in particular electricity, is insatiable. Our demand for electrification is driven to a significant extent by our digital lives, underpinned by the rapid roll-out of data centres, new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), as well as the electrification of mobility (EVs) and increased demand for heat and cooling. In a February 2025 report, the International Energy Agency's (IEA) director, Keisuke Sadamori stated:

“The acceleration of global electricity demand highlights the significant changes taking place in energy systems around the world and the approach of a new Age of Electricity. But it also presents evolving challenges for governments in ensuring secure, affordable and sustainable electricity supply, … While emerging and developing economies are set to drive the large majority of the growth in global electricity demand in the coming years, consumption is also expected to increase in many advanced economies after a period of relative stagnation.”

As the world is looking beyond traditional fossil-fuel based energy sources, nuclear is emerging as the source of long term, low carbon and efficient electricity supply. When people think of nuclear power, they likely think of the huge nuclear power plants in Europe, Asia, and North America. These grid scale plants typically start at 1 GW and up, take many years to plan, permit and build and come at significant cost, generally in the billions. However, small modular reactors (SMRs) (typically reactors that produce 300MW or less though some designs are closer to 500MW) are emerging as a more efficient and cost-effective alternative.

Many countries are developing SMRs with over 120 different designs under active development. Such countries include the US, UK, France, Canada, Korea, Czech Republic, Poland, Finland, UAE, Switzerland, Netherlands, and South Africa. With such interest and investment, SMRs are expected to play an important role in future energy markets.

In July 2025, the Nuclear Energy Agency – a part of the OECD – published its third edition of the Small Modular Reactor Dashboard (the Dashboard)1 which sets out the current state of play of SMRs across the globe. It identifies a surge in designs, financing, and regulatory engagement relating to SMRs. This article will look at some of the findings of the Dashboard including the key benefits of SMRs and considerations around their licensing in addition to other key issues, including financing, security and the need for public engagement.

SMRs – a catch-all solution to the energy crisis?

The IEA predicts that global energy demand will grow 4% per year between now and 2027. Current energy grids and traditional fuel sources will struggle by themselves to meet this demand. Renewables alone cannot supply this level of demand without significant and costly investment in energy storage solutions and grid enhancement. Also, renewables typically take up significant land resources. As a result, many countries are looking to SMRs as a possible solution to provide base load, low carbon power within a geographically small area (essentially providing high density power compared to renewables' low density). The Dashboard shows that over 30 countries are now in various stages of developing their first commercial nuclear power project – many of these will be SMRs.

Small and modular design

SMR designs look to utilise factory manufacturing and a modular construction process, where quality assurance and testing can take place during the manufacturing stage, with construction timescales reduced and transportation to the customer site simplified.

The 120 (and counting) SMR designs being developed around the world, target varied outputs and different applications, such as electricity, hybrid energy systems, heating, water desalinisation and steam for industrial applications.

There is no single ""standard"" SMR design, but rather a category of nuclear reactors defined by their output and modular, factory-fabricated construction. While designs vary, prevalent technologies include pressurized water reactors (PWRs). These are essentially scaled down versions of the grid scale plants. Other types of SMR are also being developed including high-temperature gas reactors, pebble-bed, thorium and molten salt reactors.

Advanced SMR refers to SMRs that incorporate innovative technologies and designs to enhance safety, flexibility, and affordability compared to conventional nuclear power plants. These reactor designs are often smaller again than SMRs, factory-built for modular installation, and can leverage passive safety features and various technologies beyond traditional light-water designs, offering new applications for electricity, heat, and clean fuels. In addition to SMRs, there is a renewed interest in micro-reactors which have a capacity of 1 – 20MW, as opposed to the 200 – 500MW for SMRs. The Dashboard helpfully provides a collection of leading examples of SMRs under design, as well as some micro-reactors.

Use cases

SMRs offer a new universe of opportunity for nuclear, with multiple potential use cases. For example, BIG TECH are increasingly turning to nuclear sources of energy to supply the electricity used by the huge hyperscale data centres that drive AI (and intended to accommodate the planned growth in quantum-computing), resulting in Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Apple all having now made significant investments into the nuclear sector. This is because AI data centres need large amounts of electricity to both power them and keep equipment cool, and access to power has become a critical factor in driving new data centre builds. Importantly, nuclear power, which can provide firm baseload low carbon power 24 hours a day, has become increasingly attractive to the tech industry as it attempts to cut emissions even as they use more energy.

Another potential SMR use case is nuclear maritime, as around 90% of global trade transported by sea, shipping accounts for nearly 3% of worldwide emissions. The IMO is in the process of establishing a new greenhouse gas strategy aiming for zero emissions by 2050, which includes a target for sustainable fuels to represent 10% of energy usage in maritime transport by 2030. Nuclear energy (with naval nuclear propulsion successfully deployed for decades, with 160 ships being powered by small nuclear reactors – essentially pre-cursers to the modern civil SMRs being planned today) is increasingly gaining traction in the energy transition, as a potential solution for lowering emissions from international maritime shipping. Regulatory challenges remain with respect to maritime nuclear, with a lack of IMO or other regulation. Land base uses of SMR will take priority in the medium term.

Licensing

While the nuclear industry across jurisdictions is heavily regulated, this regulation has been focused on medium and large 'traditional' nuclear power plants. Applying the same regulatory approach to SMRs would unnecessarily constrain and delay their deployment. Given their modularity, technical design (including inherent safety features) and scalability, the regulation of SMRs will require a different approach to traditional nuclear power plants. Crucially, while traditional nuclear power plants are bespoke, often taking many decades to transition through the design phase, to the regulatory approval stage, to construction and completion, given the relative size of SMRs, they will be able to be constructed quickly by comparison once initial design approval is given to the particular SMR model and the industry is tooled accordingly.

While approving the first SMR in a given country will be the largest hurdle - that is other than China and Russia, which collectively already have three domestic designed SMRs in operation, once the first SMR is completed (the first-of-a-kind), obtaining approval for the following SMRs (the 'Nth-of-a-kind') should be much more straightforward. Given their small size and modularity, regulators can approve standard designs for each module, which will improve efficiency. In theory, a design for a module only needs to be approved once, following which compliant designs can be rolled out without the need for additional certification.

One option could be to foster international collaboration between national nuclear regulators, so that ‘badge of origins’ can be utilised with regulators having the ability to passport designs into their own regulatory framework based on this badge of origin from another regulator. There are now encouraging signs that international collaboration between nuclear regulators is indeed increasing, driven by new nuclear technologies (primarily SMRs and advanced micro-reactor SMRs) and the need for more aligned regulatory approaches to ensure global safety and facilitate deployment. In September 2025 the UK and the USA announced the Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy. The partnership will fast-track reactor design reviews, meaning that if a reactor design passed rigorous safety checks in one country, this work can be used by the other to supports its assessment, avoiding duplication of work. This is expected to speed up the licensing process.

In addition to the UK-USA partnership other initiatives include the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) Regulatory Cooperation Forum, formal Information Exchange Arrangements for bilateral agreements, and trilateral Memoranda of Cooperation on specific technologies like AI. This collaboration aims to share knowledge, align standards, and streamline regulatory processes, creating efficiency and ensuring consistently high safety levels across different countries.

When dealing with any nuclear substance, safety is paramount. Regulators need to be sure that what they are approving is safe to operate, particularly given SMRs are likely to be situated much closer to and within business districts and even residential areas. Given their compact size, there will be much less reliance on active safety systems (like pumps and valves) and instead more reliance on passive safety systems (such as natural circulation and the use of gravity to assist draining and water movement). However, the whole safety apparatus around SMRs will be on a much-reduced scale from traditional nuclear power plants.

Site approvals

While regulatory approval of design may be passported from one country to another, approval of the installation of a particular SMR design to a specific site will remain the concern of the national nuclear regulator. Regulators will need to take into consideration the unique factors of each site, which will vary greatly between, for example, those in rural areas vis-à-vis those located in a central business district. Much like the ownership of SMRs themselves, siting is going to involve a mix of public and private entities. The Dashboard highlights that while the majority of potential SMR sites are associated with utilities and government owned entities, a significant minority are linked to laboratories and private industrial players.

SMR site approvals are likely to be simpler than for large scale plants. Due to the smaller size and passive safety features, the area required for an SMR and its associated Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ) is likely to be significantly smaller. The EPZ for a grid scale plant can extend up to 60 miles (made up of the 10-mile Plume Exposure Pathway EPZ (PEPZ) and 50-mile Ingestion Exposure Pathway EPZ (IEPZ)). The Sizewell nuclear power plant in the UK has a 15km and 30km EPZ. The EPZs for SMRs are being developed with flexibility, as SMRs' design allows for smaller EPZs. Regulatory bodies like the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission are establishing performance-based programs that recognise SMR design advances and offer alternative emergency preparedness requirements to reduce the need for exemptions. Some SMR designs are being planned with site-boundary EPZs.

Of the SMRs covered by the Dashboard, three are licensed to operate, seven have been granted a licence to construct, seven have submitted a licence application, and 33 SMR designs are in pre-licensing activities. This is a sign of a healthy SMR pipeline. While three are operating, many dozens are currently undergoing the regulatory process.

Financing

Traditionally, the nuclear industry was financed by governments, with a small amount of private financing. However, private investment in nuclear is surging. In 2023, there were USD15.4bn of funding announcements for SMRs (outside of Russia and China), around one third of which was private funding. Notably, three SMR companies are publicly traded: NuScale, Oklo, and NANO Nuclear Energy. While public funding will remain critical, more investment through public-private partnerships is needed to assure that SMRs are a viable option into the future. The role of large power users (likely the hyperscaler data centre providers) in providing this private funding is becoming more prevalent. Amazon announced last year that it was going to invest more than half a billion dollars in companies developing nuclear power and SMRs. Google has also invested in nuclear and has ordered several SMRs from Kairos Power, with the first due to be completed by 2030. Similarly, Microsoft and Meta have recently announced plans to invest in SMRs.

Security

The relatively small size of SMRs is both a security strength and weakness. It is a strength as there is no need for a vast EPZ security perimeter around an SMR. Additionally, SMRs can be deployed underground, even below water, which offers protection from external threats. SMRs also offer a form of ‘energy security’ in that once installed, their upkeep is not dependent on consistent imports of fuel etc., with some SMR designs requiring refurling every three to seven years, and others aiming for up to 30 years. However, the smaller size and geographic footprint may also limit the usual layered protection made possible by the EPZs of grid scale plants. In addition, increased digitisation of control systems opens the possibility of cybersecurity threats. Remote maintenance and monitoring systems that are included in some SMR designs also increases this cyber risk potential. Current legal and regulatory frameworks need to be reviewed in the light of this different security threat environment. Aspects of this different approach to security are considered in the Dashboard with a number of SMR design incorporating ‘security by design’ into the SMR design. This process includes underground siting, robust containment structures and passive safety systems that reduce vulnerabilities and mitigate the consequences of sabotage.

Public engagement

While this issue is covered last, it is vital to the success of SMRs and the energy transition. SMR projects will not advance far unless a strong relationship is built between those developing SMRs and local communities. Particularly in countries like the UK, where planning laws mean public buy-in is often required for building projects, educating local communities about the benefits of SMRs is important. The Dashboard shows that SMR developers are contributing to a broader public understanding and acceptance of nuclear technologies including through town hall meetings. Educating the public on the benefits of SMRs not just to their local community (although such benefits are sizeable) but to the wider energy transition and global carbon reduction efforts is a crucial part of generating public acceptance of nuclear.

SMRs are coming

With 120 designs and counting and over 30 countries looking to deploy SMRs to meet rapidly increasing energy demand, we can expect to see two or three SMR designs move from first of a kind to nth of a kind over the next decade.

The September 2025 announcement of commercial deals of new SMR deployments in the UK (in addition to the Rolls Royce SMRs previously announced) as well as the first micro reactor demonstrate the speed of developments.

The benefits of the modular design as well as the potential for an element of passporting of designs through a badge of origin approach are expected to increase the number of SMRs being deployed and reduce costs of nuclear power. With a more streamlined design approval process, passive safety features and a smaller overall profile, it is possible that site approvals will also become simpler for SMRs when compared to grid scale plants.

Financing will remain an issue. However, the demand from hyperscalers does provide a new potential source of financing in some use cases. Moreover, public engagement (and education) will be critical to the deployment of SMRs and continued engagement from developers, governments and regulators is required.

The decision raised questions about how the city gave up on the contract that would have created seven child care facilities and served more than 500 of Santa Ana’s most vulnerable youth, and why it failed to inform the City Council before doing so.

Santa Ana was awarded $6.7 million by the state in 2023 for child care and development programming. The money would pay for new staff, licensing, training, program equipment, community engagement and state-required facility upgrades. That includes maintaining the overall operation of the program.

“If we ever have a grant of this size, any decisions that should be made should be made here at the dais, publicly,” City Councilmember Johnathan Ryan Hernandez said. “Especially when it comes to millions of dollars.”

What did the city say?

Assistant City Manager Kathryn Downs told the City Council on Tuesday that the contract was relinquished because the city could not handle the state’s complex requirements.

“These concerns included compliance with a series of federal regulations, as well as California Title 5 and Title 22 regulations addressing educational requirements and health and safety issues,” Downs said.

She said the city didn’t have an expert on navigating California’s stringent regulations. According to city records, parks and recreation staff were in the process of hiring a site director who would have had that expertise to regulate and license the city’s facilities.

“There was a plan to bring experts onto staff to help navigate the implementation of this program, and additional resources,” Downs said. “The reality of it is that that's placing a lot of trust in a new staff member to stand up something for the city that comes with complex compliance issues and significant liability if you fail to do so.”

She said the upfront price of the program would have cost the city millions of dollars.

City records and the state’s funding terms and conditions say the city would have been reimbursed for “costs that are reasonable and necessary to the performance of the contract,” which includes startup costs.

In November 2024, the City Council unanimously approved a $915,583 contract with the state as the first round of funding to jumpstart the program.

“With some of the compliance issues such as providing different bathrooms for adults and children with different-sized fixtures … I just don't see how that initial award of $915,000 would have been sufficient for the capital, facilities and equipment that we needed to start up the program,” Down said.

The city would have had to build one restroom for adults, one for children and one that was gender-neutral, Mayor Valerie Amezcua said at the meeting. When asked how much it would cost to build two restrooms at all seven facilities, Downs said the city was looking at $10 million.

But Councilmember Jessie Lopez disputed those costs and said smaller restrooms are required by law for facilities serving toddlers. Santa Ana's program was intended for kids between the ages of 5 and 12, which means the requirements were only for individual locking stalls and not specialized fixtures.

Downs also said the clock was ticking because the state required the city to set up facilities by May 12, which she said was an unrealistic deadline.

But Lopez said only one facility had to be set up with at least one participant enrolled, and the city had the opportunity to request an extension.

When asked for clarification, Santa Ana spokesperson Paul Eakins declined to comment any further on the grant being relinquished —which was first reported by LAist.

Why and who are applauding the decision?

Meanwhile, Amezcua and Councilmember Thai Viet Phan thanked the city for giving up on the $7 million.

“I would love to have had this in the city, but I think we need to be prepared,” Amezcua said. “It could possibly have cost us millions of dollars that we do not have.”

The city is facing a $35 million budget deficit in the next four years.

“We don't have the capacity for this,” Amezcua said. “I appreciate you guys, Mr. City Manager and your team, returning this and saying, 'Thank you, but no thank you.'""

Money comes with strings, Phan added.

“I think that with something like this, it's just so far outside the realm of something that we typically do,” Phan said. “It's not just an after-school program to keep kids off the street; it's an entirely new department that we essentially would have to set up.”

Why are some council members disappointed?

Lopez said affordable child care and youth programs are a priority for her office.

“I think it's important for everybody in this chamber to understand that even if 5-year-olds or 10 year-olds don't have lobbyists,” Lopez said. “It is our responsibility to ensure that we do anything and everything that we can to provide the services that they need to live a fulfilling and fruitful life.”

Also at issue, Lopez added, was the lack of communication between the full City Council and the city manager’s office.

“You're saying you communicated this decision to every member of this council, and we have a different recollection of that,” Lopez said. “I just want to make sure that moving forward … when your staff is receiving a directive from this council … that there is going to be an open line of communication.”

Councilmember Benjamin Vazquez said the funds could have been a helpful investment in the city’s centers and urged staff not to let this action deter them from applying for other grants.

“All our staff, thank you for the work that you do, and looking out for grants and swinging for the fences,” Vazuez said. “Think big and go out and get our grants, and we'll support you as much as we can from the dias, and we do appreciate your work.”

A request for comment to the city’s Parks and Recreation Department was also declined by Eakins.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0c9e877/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F8e%2Ffb%2F284872524a28b2cdcaabfb1248c5%2Fimg-9311.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 11:01:12.791293

Climate Risk Initiative https://www.law.berkeley.edu/research/clee/research/climate/climate-risk-initiative/ 6.","The July 4th, 2025 Central Texas Floods that struck unsuspecting residents along the Guadalupe River, during the pre-dawn hours of a holiday weekend, is the latest in a growing trend of deadly weather-related events.

This loss of life and property occurred within a year of two of the most devastating climate-related disasters in modern U.S. history: the wildfires in California and Hurricane Helene in North Carolina and the Southeast U.S. The historic damage and rebuilding costs have put a spotlight on insurance companies and the state of the insurance industry nationwide. Natural disasters continue to raise questions about insurance companies’ ability to assist in recovery and rebuilding efforts, as well as who will bear the cost in terms of rising rates.

During the early hours of July 4th, an entire summer’s worth of rain poured from a slow moving, tropical storm enriched system within a short span of time, transforming 40 miles of the Guadalupe River, nicknamed Flash Flood Alley, into a deadly torrent that ravaged neighborhoods in multiple counties, and swept away many structures, homes and recreational areas along the river. Casualty reports include a statewide death toll of at least 135 including 36 summer campers from Camp Mystic along the river.

In January 2025, Los Angeles experienced its latest in unprecedented wildfires in the region to date, spurred on by extreme drought and high sustained winds of up to 100 mph. Fires across Los Angeles and Los Angeles County saw a death toll of 28 by the end of January, scores missing, 200,000 forced to flee, 38,000 acres burned and 15,000 structures destroyed.

2024 was an above-average year for Atlantic hurricanes. In late September of 2024, hurricane Helene hit Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas, dropping more than a foot of rain in its path, devastating rural communities and causing more than 230 deaths. North Carolina, alone, estimates more than 200,000 people were impacted and upwards of 100,000 homes destroyed or damaged.

With increasingly extreme weather patterns, catastrophic events like the Central Texas floods, the fires in Los Angeles and hurricanes in the Southeast US are becoming more frequent. The growing financial burden on residents, communities, governments, and insurers has raised concerns and, occasionally, outrage about the long-term viability of private societal institutions and public safety nets.

In Texas, despite the state’s Office of Emergency Management issuing a number of National Weather Service updates warning of dramatic spikes in expected storm surge along the Guadalupe River throughout the early morning hours of July 4 in Kerr County Texas, a concerted effort to effectively alert residents of the imminent danger proved inadequate.

In the aftermath of the deadly flood, inquiries into the failure of emergency management systems have prompted local and state officials to claim there was no way to foresee the magnitude of the event. Texas Governor Greg Abbott refused to point to responsibility for failure, stating in a July 9th press conference, “Know this, that’s the word choice of losers. The way winners talk is not to point fingers.”

However, there has been ample statistical data to refute the assertion that extreme weather events, including flooding in Texas hill country, were not predictive. According to data collected and published by NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) between 1997 and 2010, billion-dollar disaster events per year averaged $6.6 billion. The average significantly increased to $17 billion disaster events per year between 2011 and 2024. https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/state-summary/US#:~:text=From%201980%2D2024%2C%20there%20were,events%20(CPI%2Dadjusted).

[Editor’s note: NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) will no longer be updating the Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters product.]

Although FEMA data analysis indicates that Texas annually sees the most damage due to flooding, in terms of loss of structures, population and agriculture, approximately 5 million Texans currently reside in areas prone to floods. According to Texas Public Radio, state officials have known the risks but have been slow to address the issue. TPR points to a Texas Water Development Board report published December 2024 which estimates a staggering 54 billion dollars required to address Texas’s most urgent flood prevention needs. To date, the state has allocated a fraction of the estimate, $669 million, towards this goal.

Increasingly, data scientists are finding FEMA mapping and weather modelling, which are based on old and limited data, woefully inadequate. In response to the denials and unpreparedness exhibited in the wake of the Central Texas floods, multiple news outlets have turned to data published by private companies like First Street, a non-profit climate risk analytics company that quantifies and reports climate risks for individuals and communities. In an interview with NPR, data scientist Jeremy Porter of First Street, found FEMA data to be outdated and that dangerous flood zones were more expansive in areas like Camp Mystic than originally known.

Accuweather estimates the disaster cost between $18 and $22 billion in damages and economic losses. In a CNBC article, Loretta Worters of the Insurance Information Institute state that about 2.5% of Kerr county homeowners have flood insurance. Respectively, First Street estimated that more than 20% of homes are in flood danger areas. This is emblematic of homeowners being uninsured or underinsured across the US. Over the past 20 years, 99% of US counties experienced a flood event. It’s estimated that 40% of national flood insurance program claims are from outside high-risk zones.” 1

It’s too soon to know the ultimate impact Texas floods will have on insurance coverage, however some locals have already assessed the financial burden of rebuilding. In an interview with NBC News, Kerrville resident, Cynthia Thomas, states “None of us have flood insurance because my next-door neighbor got a quote for his new house, and it was $6,000 per month for flood insurance… I know people who are not going to be able to rebuild.

While flooding continues to strain communities and insurers with mounting recovery costs, another threat has emerged with equally alarming potential. “A couple of years ago, when KCC released our first wildfire model, it showed insurers that there were large-loss scenarios in the tail of their loss distributions from wildfires that were comparable to hurricane losses,” Karen Clark, founder of Karen Clark and Co. tells the Royal Gazette. The implications are stark. Wildfires, once viewed as regional anomalies, now rank among the most costly catastrophes in the way insurers evaluate disaster risk today.

California is experiencing an increasing number of wildfires that require significant effort and emergency resources to contain. In 2024 alone, the state recorded 8,024 wildfires, burning over one million acres. Future modeling predictions for the state are materializing and proving accurate. Researchers studying long-term extreme climate pattern changes have reported an alarming increase in fire damage over the past 40 years. A study jointly conducted by The Nature Conservancy and emLab, UCSB, finds that between 1979 and 1988 the total acreage burned in California was 3.37 million. The figures rose to 7.08 million total acreages burned from 2009 through 2018.

Losses of natural lands and communities have prompted seven of California’s largest private property insurers to withdraw from the state, reduce coverage, or limit new homeowner policies. This response from insurers, including State Farm, Allstate, Farmers, USAA, Travelers, Nationwide and Chubb, has contributed to the uncertain state of the California home insurance market. According to the California Association of Realtors 2023 Annual Housing Market Survey, 17% of home buyers had difficulty obtaining insurance and nearly 7% of real estate deals fell out of escrow because buyers were unable to obtain insurance.

To understand California’s complex insurance landscape, one must look back to Proposition 103, the Insurance Rate Reduction and Reform Act, passed by voters in November 1988 with a 51.1% majority. According to Insurance.CA.gov, Proposition 103 aimed to protect consumers from arbitrary insurance rates, encourage a competitive marketplace, and ensure fair, available, and affordable insurance for all Californians.

Proposition 103 instituted a regulatory system known as the “prior approval” system, where the Insurance Commissioner must approve rates proposed by an insurer before the insurer can implement property and casualty insurance rates. Thorough, impartial review by the Department’s rate regulation experts has saved Californians billions of dollars in premiums while helping to maintain a solvent market able to pay consumers’ claims.

But some believe that Proposition 103 has proven to be a rigid set of regulations that, instead of stabilizing the California homeowners insurance market, it has been the cause of major insurance players withdrawing or reducing coverage. Lawrence Powell, R.J. Lehmann, & Ian Adams in the paper “Rethinking Prop 103’s Approach to Insurance Regulation” (International Center for Law & Economics on November 6, 2023) conclude that “Prop 103 has created an insurance market that struggles to work efficiently even in the best of times and is virtually impossible to sustain in periods of acute stress.” They assert that Proposition 103 has become a set of strict regulations that, instead of stabilizing the California homeowner’s insurance market, has caused major insurance companies to withdraw or reduce coverage. They conclude that Prop 103 struggles in the best of times and is likely unsustainable during periods of high stress.

Leyman and Adams highlight outdated legislative ideology that relies on historic modeling instead of forward-looking climate predictions and weather modeling. They also point out the difficulty of amending Prop 103, which requires a new statute voted on by citizens. The state legislature can only vote “in furtherance of the statute” and cannot overturn it. They state, “The recent story of California’s property & casualty insurance market has been one of uncertainty and induced dysfunction.” 3

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, California’s market was saddled by insurance availability issues stemming from a series of historically costly wildfires.

In the aftermath of increased fire events, Prop 103 appeared untenable for California homeowners insurers. They posted a combined underwriting loss of $20 billion for the massive wildfire years of 2017 and 2018 alone. In comparison, this loss was more than double the total combined underwriting profit of $10 billion generated from 1991 to 2016.

In response to those losses and the inability to adjust rates quickly, the number of non-renewals of California residential-property policies increased by 36% in 2019. Additionally, new policies written by the state’s residual-market FAIR Plan surged by 225% that same year. The FAIR Plan serves as the last-resort insurance for those unable to obtain coverage in the voluntary market.

To slow the surge in FAIR Plan insurance policies, California Department of Insurance in December 2019 enacted moratoria barring insurers from nonrenewing approximately 800,000 policies in ZIP codes adjacent to specified major wildfires. As of November 2022, nearly 2.4 million policies statewide were in ZIP codes under nonrenewal moratoria, many of them added following additional catastrophic wildfires in 2020.

In September 2024, Governor Gavin Newsom issued an emergency executive order directing Califormia’s Department of Insurance to implement reforms designed to stabilize California’s rapidly crumbling property insurance market and to attract insurers to re-enter the market.

Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara has instituted the Sustainable Insurance Strategy, that features a faster rate approval process, forward-looking catastrophe modeling, reforms to the California FAIR Plan, and allowing insurers to factor reinsurance costs into rate hikes. Consumer advocates have warned these reforms will benefit insurance companies over property owners and may result in higher costs for homeowners.

Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara has introduced the Sustainable Insurance Strategy, which includes a faster rate approval process, forward-looking catastrophe modeling, reforms to the California FAIR Plan and allowing insurers to factor reinsurance costs into rate hikes. Consumer advocates warn these reforms may benefit insurance companies over property owners and could lead to higher costs for homeowners.

As reported by local San Diego CBS 8 affiliate, Commissioner Lara defends the reforms in his interview with CBS 8. “It’s necessary to maintain a thriving insurance market in the state… I have to make sure insurance companies are making a reasonable amount of money to be able to stay in business, grow and be able to maintain their solvency.”

Dave Jones, former California Insurance Commissioner and current director of the Climate Risk Initiative at UC Berkeley’s Center for Law Energy & the Environment, forecasts a gloomy future for California residents after the destruction of recent fires. In a January 16 interview with UC Berkely News, Jones declares that the California insurance market is the “canary in a coal mine,” for the country, and that “the canary is about to expire.” He states that despite September’s emergency reforms designed to stem the tide of insurers dropping or limiting coverage, the LA wildfires highlight the continuing effect of fossil-fuel related climate change.4

Jones tells UC Berkeley News, “Insurers are not able to rate increase their way out of the climate crisis…Before the LA wildfires, insurers said they would be filing for substantial rate increases under the new regulations. After the LA wildfires, with a projected $10 to $20 billion so far in insured losses, insurers will be filing for even higher rate increases…. The fact that this occurred is not something that the insurers did not predict at the time they asked for and got the regulatory changes. So, the LA wildfires should not be a basis for insurers to renege on their commitment to start writing and renewing more insurance in California. But they might nonetheless do so.”5

UC Berkeley News reports that the warming planet’s impact on weather patterns will lead to more natural disasters, outpacing the insurance market’s ability to thrive or survive. They argue that there will be more severe weather-related catastrophes, causing greater loss of life and destruction of homes, businesses, and communities globally. Growing risks and losses from climate change-driven events will outrun rate increases and other regulatory changes granted to insurers in the longer term. All of this means that we are marching toward an uninsurable future in this country and across the globe.

The stakes are especially high for the most vulnerable populations who are unable to evacuate. Of the 27 victims of the Los Angeles wildfires, There were three recorded deaths of people with disabilities. CNN reports that Altadena residents Anthony Mitchell, an amputee who used a wheelchair and lived with his adult son, Justin, who had cerebral palsy, both perished in the fires. Hajime White, Mitchell’s daughter, says officials told her that her father’s body was found by his son’s bed. “He was not going to leave his son behind. No matter what,” she told the Washington Post. “It’s very hard. It’s like a ton of bricks just fell on me.”

CNN also reported on the death of former Australian child star Rory Callum Sykes, who perished on January 8 during the Palisades Fire at the family’s 17-acre Mount Malibu TV Studios estate. His mother Shelley Sykes wrote on X that She had tried to put out the cinders on her property’s roof using a hose but was unsuccessful. “He said, ‘mom leave me’ and no mom can leave their kid. And I’ve got a broken arm, I couldn’t lift him, I couldn’t move him,” Sykes told Australia’s 10 News First. According to CNN, “(Sykes), 32, was born blind with cerebral palsy and had become famous for his speeches on overcoming disability. He was the co-founder of Happy Charity, which according to its site offers, “Hope, Happiness & Health to those that are Hurting.”

Impact on US Insurance Rates

The effects of disasters like the fires in California can be realized across the United States. The New York Times found at least 18 states where insurers are raising rates and reducing the writing or renewing of insurance due to climate-driven extreme weather-related events.” In fact, while the nation’s greatest amount of catastrophic weather anomalies are seemingly concentrated in coastal states particularly California, Florida, Louisiana, and Texas, a July 2024 New York Times article reports that insurers are charging some customers in the middle of the country and sectors of the Southeast, far more than other homeowners with similar degrees of risk exposure, and have allocated their premium rates at higher levels relative to the value of their homes.

The New York Times reported on a study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) that shows higher premiums being charged to homeowners in states where state officials are more liable to placate insurance carrier’s request for rate increases, as compared to states like California, where officials require greater evidence and data to back up premium hikes in order to maintain affordable rates.

NBER’s findings conclude that parts of the lower Midwest, the South, and Appalachia disproportionately pay more as a share of their relative property value. Meanwhile the Northeast and West pay far lower premiums using a similar guideline. To underscore the disparity, The New York Times points to Enid, Oklahoma, with a population of 50,000, as having one of the highest insurance rates in the nation relative to home values, despite not being in a region with high exposure to weather-related risk and damage.

To add to the complicated state of insurance nationwide, 2024 saw a hyperactive hurricane season that spawned destructive back-to-back named hurricanes in the fall, causing atypical areas of the U.S. to bear the brunt of severe climate disasters. Communities established in places like the foothills of the Blueridge Mountains in Northwest North Carolina, were hit by Hurricane Helene on September 27 causing a tragic degree of human casualties.

Hurricanes in the South East US

Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida on September 26 as a category 4 before traveling a destructive path to North Carolina’s Appalachian Mountains where it struck as a tropical storm and wreaked havoc to life and property.

Cagney Guest, a long time Transylvania County, NC resident, described the event that wiped out towns like Swannanoa and destroyed pockets of town centers, like the art district in Ashville, as inconceivable and devastating. “Hurricanes are not really something that we worry very much about,” he observed. “In the past. We definitely have had a lot of rain from them, and they have caused flooding. We’re in a very rainy place. It’s considered a temperate rainforest.”

The elevated mountainside villages and towns in the area are accustomed to receiving plenty of rainfall. Ancient geological forces created this pristine and diverse biosphere of lavish natural beauty and wonder that was unprepared on September 27 for the cresting of its many tributaries that feed the French Broad River, which flows north from its headwaters in Rosman, North Carolina, through Asheville, and then into Tennessee where it joins other major rivers before emptying into the Gulf of Mexico.

Guest, whose property sits on an escarpment near Rosman, explains his house and land dodged the worst of Hurricane Helene’s fury precisely because of the 2,500 feet elevation of his little valley situated on top of a mountain. Guest surmises that in this region of many tributaries, being situated at the top of a mountain allowed him to go relatively unscathed compared to the inhabitants of the network of valleys in nearby Swannanoa, Bat Cave, and Chimney Rock, which were completely washed away.

He notes a distinct amplification of severe climate patterns affecting his part of the world. “Well, I mean, like everywhere else, it’s escalating, right? Whatever particular weather pattern you have is changing.” He continues, “And I remember distinctly when I was a kid, there was a shift–probably when I was about a teenager, somewhere in the late ’90s–that the old timers at the store would be talking about the weather. And they would say, ‘Oh, you think that was a rainstorm? You should have seen it in 1973.’ They would always talk about there having been crazier weather than this. Then there was a certain shift where they began to say that they had never seen it like this before. That’s the way that it’s been year after year.”

In mid-November 2024, over six weeks after Helene ravaged Western North Carolina, the town of Asheville had its water supply restored, the final death toll surpassed 100, and communities struggled to rebuild in the wake of the mass exodus of service workers who lost the bustling districts filled with art galleries, restaurants and cafes.

As reported by local news affiliate ABC 11, “Although life is slowly returning to normal in Asheville, the effects of the storm are long-lasting. And tourism, which historically has formed a crucial part of the city’s economy, remains a fraction of pre-storm levels. Local businesses in Asheville and Buncombe County are expected to see a loss of $585 million in visitor spending during the first quarter of 2025.” The total amount of destruction from Helene is estimated to be $250 billion, with the majority of the cost not covered by insurance since few homeowners in affected areas have flood insurance.

Those residents who are insured are preparing for insurers to raise premiums to defray the insurer’s bottom line. It is too soon to determine the impact on residents’ ability to rebuild, and they are understandably worried. There is also severe uncertainty for those who are uninsured who must turn to FEMA programs for assistance.

Guest stated, “I have heard rumors that, in general, homeowners insurance is going to go up by as much as 50 %. I don’t want to spread misinformation, but that’s what I’ve heard. And that’s based on the amount of claims that, I’m sure, they are having to pay out. I guess that’s not unreasonable, or at least it doesn’t come out of nowhere. But it’s a big shame because I think that people are tired of paying more.”

In the wake of such disasters, it is reasonable for residents to contemplate leaving. Guest said, “My fiancé and I have done a lot of talking and thinking about that. You know that climate change and the weather that comes with it are very real when it hits here because here is an oasis. To have had something that devastating illustrates that I’m not exempt.”

Pondering the concept of how to regain a sense of safety post Helene from one of the most catastrophic floods in U.S. history, Guest remarks, “Our little chunk of mountains are, I believe, the second oldest on Earth, and particularly the little Blue Ridge/Smokey Mountains down here where I have been above sea level since Pangea. Imagine the ancient continents moving around and sometimes dunking under the ocean? But this particular area has always been above the sea. And so, we have incredible biodiversity because it’s literally a primordial land, and to have had that happen here, I can’t stress enough that I’d felt exempt from the direct effects of this crazy weather. And that has been disabused.”

Less than 2 weeks after Helene, Hurricane Milton roared into southwest Florida on October 9th as a category 3 storm with winds of up to 120 mph, causing many to evacuate. Although spared a direct hit from Hurricane Milton, the Tampa coastline endured massive damage and flooding. Tampa resident Lily Milan was one of the many area residents who chose to evacuate. After receiving tornado warnings, Milan and her family, including pets, made the tense escape to her parents’ home, 200 miles away in Hollywood, FL.

Milan recalls, “I remember when I moved to Florida back in ’88. I don’t ever remember there being tornados. I’ve always thought tornadoes were like a Kansas thing. I’ve never thought about tornadoes before, and it just so happens that, during these hurricanes, we’re that getting now. I believe it was, like, 103 tornadoes in the area because of Milton. And it was crazy. There were people that, before Milton even hit, their houses had been blown away by the tornadoes.”

Days prior to landfall, around the clock weather modeling kept residents informed, causing Tampa to become a ghost town. Milan remembers the moment the decision was made to evacuate, “The amount of anxiety that I got just knowing that a Category 5 was going to hit, and you were not sure where. The uncertainty that anywhere between here and there within that cone, it’s going to hit–and at a category five. That, in itself, was enough for me to say ‘I don’t want to stay here. I need to go. I don’t want to stay anywhere near this cone.’”

Parts of Tampa Bay were still dealing with the storm surge damage and loss it incurred from Helene, but it was much smaller in comparison to the catastrophe in NC. Having to deal with yet another, greater storm, a category 5 barreling more directly towards their area kept residents on edge.

As Milan was fleeing, she contemplated the risk of staying in her community. “When that was happening, that was something I was telling my husband on the drive towards my mom’s house in South Florida. The amount of anxiety and worry, the dogs, the animals, the house. I don’t want to deal with this anymore. And I can’t even imagine being affected directly. I think that was definitely when my mind sent me over to where I wanted to say, ‘I don’t want to live here anymore.’ But where can we go? Because it’s getting worse.”

Modeling and Insurance Rate Fears

In recent years, as climate modeling has predicted an increasing intensification of severity in storms generated in the Atlantic basin, insurance companies have imposed dramatic rate adjustments for residents of Florida. Milan reports that last year she noticed an alarming spike in cost of homeowners insurance. “Last year, my premiums doubled,” she says. “In May, when my insurance was renewing, I realized that the price was outrageous. And that’s when I reached out to my agent and asked if she could please find another company or better rate. She basically said, ‘You are looking at one of the better rates that are out there.’ So I reached out to a group of my friends and realized that everyone was paying around that same rate, maybe even more.”

Learning about new insurance requirements that lower rates, Milan set about clearing brush and trees from around her home and installing a new roof. “In the past, usually when you put in a new roof, it was good for many years. That’s not the case anymore. Now they are asking that you renew your roof every 15 years versus every 30 years. And My roof is 10 years old. So that was one of the reasons they doubled my premiums. I had to get insurance inspectors to do four different types of inspections. And once those things were certified, I sent those in to my insurance company. Because of that, I was able to reduce my premiums back to, maybe, slightly more than what it was before, but not double. So that helped a lot, and that was because of all the policy changes and everything that’s been happening in Florida. A lot of insurance companies have pulled out.

Hurricane Milton caused 33 lives lost and an estimated $50 billion in damage and costs to insurers. Consumers fear what’s to come in the already strained insurance market. According to a September 2024 Bank Rate article, in recent years Florida has lost over 30 insurance companies, and most recently, AAA, Farmers and Progressive announced a reduction in coverage. As of May 2024, there are also 11 Florida home insurance companies in liquidation.6 Bank Rate reports that rate increases have been felt since 1992 when Hurricane Andrew devastated southern Florida. Along with natural disasters, a high rate of insurance fraud have led to rate increases in Florida, while Californians rate increases are partially ascribed to state regulations that have artificially depressed rates relative to risk.

Reached by ABILITY Magazine for comment on the state of Florida homeowner’s insurance, Michael Shea Jr., Executive Vice President, Acrissure Social Services Division, explains that the multi-billion dollar re-insurance fund created 24 months ago by Florida Governor Ron Desantis to curb the precarious market was meant to enable insurers to obtain re-insurance (insurance for insurance companies when claims spike) at a time when doing so is difficult.

Shea explains, “Florida technically doesn’t really have any restrictions on pricing like California., They do have to get their rates approved a lot of times by the state of Florida, they’re an ‘admitted’ market. So, they have to get their rates approved, but there’s really no cap potentially on that. If the insurance company doesn’t like the rate approval, they don’t have to, obviously, do business in the state. So, they can decide not to provide coverage.”

Asked to compare the national state of insurance in relation to climate change, Shea commented, ”I think Florida is a really hard state right now for property insurance. Also, other states right now, like Louisiana. Louisiana rates are some of the highest in the country right now. Texas has actually gotten a lot more expensive due to the fact that it had all those hailstorms. California has issues with fire. So, I think every state is having issues due to weather. Is it global warming? Is it weather pattern change? It’s having an effect on the insurance market. There’s no doubt about it.”

Shea is cautious regarding Florida residents’ concerns about looming rate increases after 2024’s turbulent hurricane season. “I think it’s hard to guess that right now,” he says. “I think the bigger issue here is actually the flood insurance program. I mean, we just had a huge flood event in Florida due to Hurricane Helene and even Milton. So, I think you’re going to have pressure on the NFIP, the National Flood Insurance Program. I think you’re going to have some challenges there. It’s going to be interesting to see on the homeowner’s side.”

Climate change’s impact differs in its effects across the U.S. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency predicts climate-driven change will result in winners and losers. In contrast to the economic impact of climate change EPA states, “earlier springs and milder winter weather can prolong growing seasons in many regions, increasing crop yields and revenues.” Yet, the American Farm Bureau Federation shows the resulting harm to farmers from extreme weather of $23 billion in loss of crops, which does not include lost livestock and infrastructure.7 With an increase of extreme weather events like wildfires, floods, mudslides, intensification of storms, and prolonged droughts, a warming planet spells a perilous future for all.

At the start of each hurricane season, residents like Lily Milan who live in effected areas prepare for evacuation with important documents like birth certificates, the deed to her house, and medical records. Yet the thought of moving to a more temperate, less risky, area of the country for safety is unthinkable. “I wouldn’t leave my parents behind. I wouldn’t leave my sister behind. What am I going to do alone in another state? So, no, that’s not even an option for me.”

In the meantime, when Cagney Guest reflects on the idea of leaving the area called home by his family for generations, he arrives at the same conclusion. “Although I’m definitely not the first to stand on these wonderful lands, there are those that came before me for sure. I have been here for quite a while. Or the family has. This still remains the high ground. I don’t have much in life, not really from a privileged background. But what I do have is my connection to this wonderful spot that, as other places become more eminently and directly impacted, I assumed that this would continue to be the last place that would still be comfortable, even if not habitable. But with something like this coming through and seeing literally 20, 30 times the devastation I’ve ever seen in my whole life. It robs you of that feeling. But no, I wouldn’t leave for a million bucks.”

Several mountain communities ravaged by Helene are rebuilding, however, Guest wistfully mourns the transformation. “We have a local author from the 1920s and ’30s, the name of Thomas Wolf, among his books is one called “You Can’t Go Home Again.” And the sentiment’s about how once you go away for long enough, when you return, your parents are no longer your parents. They’re an elderly couple. Everything is changed. Everything is different, and so home doesn’t exist anymore.

Guest observed the economic impact on surrounding communities, “A lot of that is what’s going on in Asheville. There’s an exodus. I’ve heard of people who work in service industries that have collapsed and closed down. I’ve worked in restaurants, and you’re paycheck to paycheck. The places they worked are closed indefinitely, and there’s no nest egg to lean on. What constituted the culture of the area in Asheville is physically leaving in a lot of cases or has been washed away. It will definitely rebuild. It remains in a beautiful giant valley in a beautiful part of the world, but there’s a lot of intangible things about it that got washed away and that are gone forever. Too many people’s lives changed too drastically for it to come back the same.

The increasing frequency and intensity of climate-driven disasters like the Central Texas floods, California wildfires, Hurricane Helene and more are fundamentally reshaping the insurance landscape. As traditional risk models have become outdated and National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration face cuts in both budget and services, residents nationwide face skyrocketing premiums, reduced coverage, and the daunting prospect of an “uninsurable” future. This growing crisis highlights the urgent need for adaptive policies and proactive measures to protect vulnerable communities and ensure the long-term viability of essential safety nets against the escalating impacts of a warming planet.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares have rocketed 20% in the past week, fueled by CEO Elon Musk’s bold move to scoop up about $1 billion in company stock. Disclosed on September 15,, Musk’s purchase of roughly 2.57 million shares marked his first open-market buy since 2020, signaling unshakeable confidence amid board proposals for a staggering $1 trillion pay package tied to ambitious milestones.

This insider bet propelled TSLA from year-to-date lows, flipping the stock positive for 2025 after a turbulent ride. Over the last three months, shares have surged more than 30%, while the stock is up over 78% in the past year, rebounding from April’s $212 intraday slump. With Q3 earnings slated for late October, investors face a pivotal question: lock in gains and sell now, or ride the wave?

The rally reflects optimism in Musk’s vision, but underlying sales woes and policy shifts loom large. As buyers rush electric vehicle (EV) purchases before the $7,500 federal tax credit vanishes on September 30, is this surge sustainable — or a peak before the plunge?

Navigating Sales Headwinds in Key Markets

Tesla’s EV dominance is under siege, with sales faltering across major regions. In Europe, deliveries plunged 49% year-over-year in August, battered by subsidy cuts and fierce competition from Chinese rivals like BYD.

China, Tesla’s second-largest market, saw a 2% drop last month amid a price war and economic slowdown, despite aggressive discounts. Even in the U.S., where Tesla commands 38% of the EV market — its lowest in eight years — sales dipped 6.7% in August, as consumers flock to fresher models from Ford (NYSE:F) and Hyundai.

Musk’s brief stint advising the Trump administration on the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) diverted his focus, alienating some buyers and hurting brand perception. Though he’s stepped away and pledged renewed commitment to Tesla, the damage lingers.

The board’s approval of his exorbitant pay package, potentially worth $975 billion, aims to tether him long-term, suggesting the EV pioneer is refocusing. Yet, with Musk owning about 13% of shares pre-purchase, his buy underscores a pivot toward AI and autonomy over pure vehicle sales.

A Short-Term Sales Spike?

September could deliver a silver lining, with Tesla sales potentially spiking as buyers dash to snag vehicles before the EV tax credit expires. U.S. EV sales hit records in August, up nearly 20% year-over-year, driven by the impending deadline.

Analysts predict the third quarter will be the strongest quarter ever for EVs, with Tesla possibly benefiting from this frenzy — Model Y and Model 3 remain eligible for the full $7,500 incentive if delivered or contracted by month’s end. IRS guidance allows binding contracts with payments before September 30 to qualify, even for later deliveries, easing the rush slightly.

However, this bump feels fleeting. Broader EV demand remains soft, squeezed by high interest rates and range anxiety. After the tax credit’s expiration, prices could jump effectively by $7,500, dampening momentum further. Tesla’s Q3 report next month might dazzle with a quarterly increase, but Q4 projections look grim, with Musk himself warning of “tough quarters” ahead.

Key Takeaways

The market’s euphoria seems to front-run this temporary sales lift, pricing in optimism that could unravel after earnings. A post-rush drop is likely, pulling TSLA back as EV headwinds persist. Long-term, though, the buy thesis evolves beyond vehicles.

Energy storage deployments hit 9.6 GWh in Q2, solar integrations grow, and robotics like Optimus promise transformative revenue. These segments, not just EVs, could propel the stock higher over years.

For long-term investors, Tesla remains a compelling buy — but not at current peaks. Hold off for the inevitable pullback as the real value lies in patience.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/imageForEntry29-u2e.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 11:01:20.882314

California

Rep. Young Kim (R-CA-40) noted, “I believe in an all-of-the-above energy strategy that expends clean energy, supports American jobs, and strengthens our national security. We need leases, permits, and pipelines, alongside robust investment in renewables like geothermal energy.” She added that she championed the Harnessing Energy At Thermal Sources (HEATS) Act to help lower energy costs for families, and that she is leading the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) Authorization Act to diversify supply chains and ensure energy security. “It doesn’t have to be one or the other – natural gas or renewables, environment or economy. We can do both,” she said.

Colorado

Gov. Jared Polis (D-CO) recalled that he set a goal for Colorado of 100% renewable energy by 2040. In less than five years, his administration has secured a commitment to reduce power sector emissions by more than 85% by 2030.“With the actions we’re taking, we’ve bent the cost curve for clean energy technologies, ensuring that they’re the most cost-effective solution for growing Colorado. Wind and solar are the cheapest ways to power an electrified future with EVs, modern manufacturing, and clean buildings.” He noted that his administration partnered with the state’s largest utility, Excel Energy, to announce a new procurement for 4.5 gigawatts (GW) of new wind and solar resourcing in the state. “We continue to push forward in Colorado, investing in groundbreaking technologies and strategies to protect our air and water, strengthen our economy, create good-paying jobs, and yes, save people money in the process,” he said.

Georgia

“As the number one state for business for 11 consecutive years, we have celebrated record-breaking jobs and investments coming to all four corners of the Peach State,” explained Gov. Brian Kemp (R-GA). “With that growth, we know we must continue innovating to provide the power that both hard-working Georgians and job creators need to succeed.” He pointed out that Vogtle Units 3 and 4, the first nuclear reactors built in the country in over 30 years, are located in the state, with Plant Vogtle as the largest clean energy generator nationwide. “As our nation’s industries, like manufacturing, continue to expand and drive population growth, we must continue finding innovative ways to meet the demand for reliable energy,” he concluded.

Idaho

“Idaho is a national leader in the use of clean, renewable power, and it is the fifth highest in the nation for electricity generated from these sources,” Sen. Mike Crapo (R-ID) stated. He highlighted that 68% of the total electricity generated in Idaho comes from a clean energy source and that the sector creates more than 15,000 jobs. He added that he continues “to press for collaborative solutions to our nation’s overall energy needs and encourage an all-of-the-above energy strategy that promotes our energy independence and national security.”

Michigan

Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist II (D-MI) recalled that he and Governor Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) signed a “historic clean energy law to lower costs, create jobs, and fight climate change.” Since 2022, their administration has created 127,000 clean energy jobs. “Our work has helped more Americans turn on their lights, heat or cool their homes, and charge their devices for less money,” he elaborated. “Let’s keep working together to invest in clean energy, grow our economy, and build a bright future for our state, nation, and the world.”

“This week is an important reminder that a clean energy future is critical, not only for ensuring that future generations inherit a healthy environment, but also for securing America’s energy future,” said Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-MI-06). “It’s about creating good-paying jobs, protecting our environment, strengthening our national security, and ensuring every community has access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.” She reminisced on her support for legislation that invests in clean energy innovation, reduces emissions, and leaves no community behind. “We have a responsibility to act, and to act boldly,” she said. “We’re all in this together.”

New York

Rep. Nick LaLota (R-NY-01) observed that his experience in the Navy, including three deployments across the Pacific, gave him the chance to see firsthand “how our ships, aircraft, and missions relied on reliable American energy, and how adversaries like China, Russia, and regimes in the Middle East weaponize energy to squeeze our allies, manipulate markets, and tilt the balance of power.” He voiced his support for an all-of-the-above energy strategy, including the safe and clean extraction and production of oil and gas, the growth of nuclear power, the addition of wind and solar power, and investments in grid resiliency. “I know that energy security is national security. America can never afford to be dependent on foreign nations for the energy that keeps our economy running and our military strong,” he explained. For example, he highlights that he fought to preserve energy tax credits in this year’s budget reconciliation bill. “My mission is clear: to ensure the next generation inherits a nation that is stronger, safer, and more secure, and that starts with American energy leading the way.”

North Carolina

“Facing a changing climate with determination and resilience is paramount to safeguarding America for generations to come,” observed Rep. Greg Murphy (R-NC-03). His district covers approximately 80% of North Carolina’s coast, including the Outer Banks, which presents challenges posed by hurricanes and other intense weather events. In response, he initiated the Water Adaptations to Ensure Regional Success (WATERS) Summit, a bipartisan effort to bring together leaders, experts, and stakeholders to develop solutions.

Plus, Rep. Murphy’s district plays a crucial role in advancing clean energy solutions: “For a few years now in the Outer Banks… there’s a tremendous amount of renewable energy research being conducted.” Rep. Murphy highlighted the work of the Coastal Studies Institute, a research partnership led by East Carolina University, in particular. He added, “To power our future efficiently and responsibly, we need to utilize all the energy resources at our disposal… If we can put a man on the moon, we can lead the world in transitioning to cleaner forms of energy production.”

Rep. Deborah Ross (D-NC-02), the ranking member for the Energy Subcommittee for Science, Space, and Technology, remarked that she has been working on clean energy issues for nearly two decades. “We all know that we need more energy right now,” she said, “but we also need that energy to be inexpensive and not harm our environment, and that’s where clean energy comes in.” Not only has the cost of clean energy gone down, but the number of sources has increased, “and we’ve got to make sure that we continue to invest in them and use them.”

Oklahoma

Gov. Kevin Stitt (R-OK) highlighted that Oklahoma is one of four states with 45% of its energy coming from clean energy sources. “We should be unleashing energy production and meeting the needs of American consumers. To do that, we need an energy abundance agenda. In Oklahoma, we let the free market drive our energy production.” As a result, he remarked, innovative companies have established a presence in the state. For example, USA Rare Earth developed the country’s first rare earth metal and neo-magnet manufacturing facility, and Westwin Elements opened the country’s only nickel refinery; “producing them here at home strengthens American security.” He added that the state’s behind-the-meter laws give companies more choice over their power solutions. “We’re showing the country how to take control of our own energy future. Oklahoma’s ready to meet our nation’s energy needs, and I’m declaring it the year of the energy abundance agenda.”

The study analyzes employment in industries including renewable electricity generation, biofuels, electric vehicles, energy efficiency, battery storage and grid modernization.

The analysis does not account for changes in U.S. policy since President Donald Trump took office in January. Since then, his administration has taken a string of measures to unravel federal support for wind and solar projects that were championed by his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, and instead promoted fossil fuels.

The number of Americans employed in clean energy exceeds those employed by oil, gas and coal by three to one, E2 said.

The states with the most jobs in wind and solar include California, Texas, Florida, New York and Massachusetts, according to the report.

Energy efficiency jobs, which include installing efficient heating, cooling and lighting systems and manufacturing certified appliances account for nearly 2.4 million of total sector employment.

Since President Trump took office, almost $19 billion worth of wind and solar power generation projects have been canceled, according to U.S. consultancy Atlas Public Policy. As the new administration slashed subsidies and regulatory support for wind and solar, companies involved in these industries have canceled projects worth a total $18.6 billion.

The radical change in federal government attitudes towards the wind and solar industries has already shaken them, causing bankruptcies and stock price slumps. Job losses in this context are practically inevitable, especially with local communities’ opposition to new wind and solar capacity continues to grow.

However, the study also cautioned that many of these positions are at risk due to the Trump administration’s initiatives to hinder renewable energy development.

In 2024, the clean energy sector saw a 2.8% increase in employment, adding 100,000 jobs and bringing the total to over 3.5 million people, Reuters quoted figures from the study in a report.

This data comes from an annual study on clean energy jobs conducted by E2, an environmental advocacy group, for the past ten years.

Growth in US states

In the past year, several states have demonstrated remarkable growth in the clean energy sector, significantly contributing to the nation’s transition towards sustainable energy sources.

Leading this charge were Idaho, Oklahoma, Texas, Florida, and New Jersey, each exhibiting substantial increases in clean energy job creation.

This surge in employment reflects a broader trend of investment and innovation within renewable energy technologies, energy efficiency, and sustainable practices across these diverse economic landscapes.

The growth in these states underscores the increasing economic viability and widespread adoption of clean energy solutions, fostering a green workforce and driving local economies forward.

The study revealed that clean energy accounted for over 80% of all new energy sector jobs in 2024.

“What these numbers show is that this was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024,” E2 Executive Director Bob Keefe said in a statement.

Now, clean energy job growth is at serious risk – and with it, our overall economy.

Assessment of workforce dynamics

The comprehensive study undertook a detailed analysis of employment trends and opportunities across a crucial spectrum of burgeoning industries, all of which are central to the global transition towards a more sustainable and low-carbon economy.

It also examined job creation and growth within renewable electricity generation, encompassing solar, wind, and hydropower.

Additionally, it analysed the workforce dynamics in biofuels production and the burgeoning electric vehicle industry.

The report further scrutinized employment in energy efficiency initiatives, battery storage solutions, and critical grid modernization projects, providing a holistic view of the green job market.

This analysis did not reflect shifts in US policy since President Donald Trump assumed office in January.

Trump’s administration has subsequently implemented numerous measures to dismantle federal support for wind and solar initiatives, previously championed by his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, in favor of promoting fossil fuels.

According to E2, clean energy employs three times as many Americans as the oil, gas, and coal industries combined.

According to the report, California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Massachusetts are the states with the highest number of wind and solar jobs.

Of the total jobs in the energy sector, nearly 2.4 million are in energy efficiency, encompassing the installation of efficient heating, cooling, and lighting systems, and the manufacturing of certified appliances.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 05:57:51.218821

The Advanced Aerial Mobility Activation Fund, which will receive a second round of funding through the directive, funds projects for drones, helicopters and other electric aerial vehicles.

M-Air will be a part of M-City, a public-private partnership within the University’s Transportation Research Institute that advances innovation in transportation and aerial mobility.
“I do think that at the end of the day, this is about having an integrated mobility ecosystem,” Johnson said.","On July 17, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed an executive directive to establish the Advanced Air Mobility Initiative, a program that would further the state of Michigan’s advanced aerial vehicular capabilities and support infrastructure expansion in the aviation sector. The Advanced Aerial Mobility Activation Fund, which will receive a second round of funding through the directive, funds projects for drones, helicopters and other electric aerial vehicles.

The executive directive also allocated more than $4.1 million to four new projects supporting these initiatives, including CVS Health, Traverse Connect, Jack Demmer Automotive Group and M-Air.

M-Air will become a new 40-mile air mobility corridor, or dedicated transportation route, that will connect University of Michigan’s Ann Arbor campus to Michigan Central in Detroit. M-Air will be a part of M-City, a public-private partnership within the University’s Transportation Research Institute that advances innovation in transportation and aerial mobility.

In an interview with The Michigan Daily, M-Air director Venkat Viswanathan said M-City was born to be a living lab where students, researchers and other experts could collaborate on different aerial mobility projects and test them in one space.

“The core idea being that we have amazing students and postdocs that come to University of Michigan, and in order for them to get experience beyond classroom learning and research that they do get access to a facility that has the ability to test things at a larger scale than you can typically do in a classroom setting or in a research setting,” Viswanathan said.

Engineering senior Eli Goreta, vice-president of Michigan Autonomous Aerial Vehicles, told The Daily she hopes the M-Air mobility corridor will unlock new opportunities to test different aerial vehicular projects at the University.

“I think when it’s out, it’ll definitely have a huge impact,” Goreta said. “Drone application, currently, really involves limit testing, both on distance and flight time. The way that conventional testing is currently happening is usually in a pretty confined space, usually just like a farm or a small airfield, or M-Air in a very closed, confined space, but allowing testing to take place over a very long distance with limited restriction will definitely have a huge help on long range, efficient drone research.”

Goreta said the addition of funding from the state of Michigan will strengthen the existing relationship between the private and public sectors, which is vital for advancements in aerial mobility.

“The more money that we can put into drone research, the better,” Goreta said. “But I think a technical partnership with more of a corporate setting would be useful, because then research can be more applicable towards actual use cases.”

In an interview with The Daily, Justine Johnson, chief mobility officer at Michigan Economic Development Corporation, said increased funding for the Advanced Air Mobility Initiative will introduce new employment opportunities for Michigan citizens, assist workers with a background in manufacturing for a transition into aviation and connect university students with employment opportunities.

“M-Air (is) really focusing on having a space with that connects Detroit to Ann Arbor in a very different way, really facilitating the role of bringing in startups, but also exposing students at all levels — from K through 12 — to those who are at the university level, about opportunities and career paths within Advanced Air Mobility and emerging aviation,” Johnson said.

Johnson also said there is a lot of potential for aerial vehicles to be applied across a variety of industries and to bridge gaps between land and aerial vehicular resources.

“I do think that at the end of the day, this is about having an integrated mobility ecosystem,” Johnson said. “This is not like auto versus aviation. It’s not that, right? It’s, how do these two complement each other?”

Johnson said she looks forward to seeing how Michigan will advance in its capacity for aerial aviation innovation through the executive directive.

“This is such a big opportunity for the state of Michigan to demonstrate to the world how we lean into manufacturing, how we’re good at it, the jobs that are going to be created, the industry that will be attracted and how we’re connecting the dots to really make sure we have an integrated mobility ecosystem,” Johnson said.

We’re in the midst of a global solar revolution. Don’t believe it? Just look at the latest numbers.

In the first six months of this year, the world built 64% more new solar energy capacity than it did in the first half of 2024, according to think tank Ember. The 380 gigawatts’ worth of solar installed through June of this year is roughly equal to the amount of solar installed in all of 2021 and 2022 combined.

The story of this global solar boom is, really, the story of solar growth in China.

The country, which is the world’s largest producer of solar equipment and most other clean-energy technologies, on its own deployed 256 GW of new solar over the first half of this year — more than two-thirds of the global total. That’s double the amount it installed during the same period last year.

China’s rapid buildout of solar is welcome news. The country emits more planet-warming greenhouse gases than any other, in large part because it burns prodigious amounts of coal to produce electricity for its 1.4 billion citizens. But solar and other renewables are now putting enough of a dent in the country’s coal use that some analysts expect China’s overall emissions to decline this year.

Outside of China, the rest of the world installed just 15% more solar capacity in the first half of this year than it did in the first half of last year.

The two next-biggest solar installers over this time period were India, at 24 GW, and the U.S., at 21 GW. The U.S. is still managing to push solar to new heights despite the Trump administration’s attacks on clean energy.

Overall, solar provided just 7% of electricity generated around the globe last year.

Now Orange and OptiGrid have introduced a new battery-integrated DC fast charger.
Using an onboard 180 kWh battery, the Orange Juicer steadily draws energy from on-site utility connections, and delivers it on demand.
“As more customers accelerate adoption of Orange EV trucks and electrify other site equipment, we’ve seen infrastructure upgrades cause serious holdups,” said Kurt Neutgens, co-founder and President of Orange EV.
The citrus-themed charger works with Orange EV trucks today, and is adaptable for other fleet equipment.","We’ve been covering Orange EV for a decade, during which time we’ve seen a couple dozen other commercial EV startups go out of business. Part of Orange’s winning formula: the company targeted a segment that was (and remains) a perfect use case for EVs: terminal tractors (aka yard dogs or yard goats).

Orange’s sister company, OptiGrid, addresses a couple of the most significant barriers to fleet electrification: high infrastructure costs and long waits for utility upgrades. OptiGrid’s charging platform, which originated from technology created at FreeWire, is now in its fourth generation and has undergone nearly a decade of engineering development.

Now Orange and OptiGrid have introduced a new battery-integrated DC fast charger. Using an onboard 180 kWh battery, the Orange Juicer steadily draws energy from on-site utility connections, and delivers it on demand. “The result is full charging performance with up to 85% less grid input power, resulting in a dramatic reduction of both installation timelines and upfront costs,” Optigrid explains.

“As more customers accelerate adoption of Orange EV trucks and electrify other site equipment, we’ve seen infrastructure upgrades cause serious holdups,” said Kurt Neutgens, co-founder and President of Orange EV. “The Orange Juicer solves that challenge, giving fleets a fast, scalable and cost-effective charging platform that utilizes existing on-site power.”

Optigrid says deploying the Orange Juicer allows fleets to avoid expensive utility upgrades, trenching, and construction by using existing power, so they can start running electric trucks in weeks, not years. The citrus-themed charger works with Orange EV trucks today, and is adaptable for other fleet equipment. The system features a modular design that enables it to be expanded and/or relocated as site needs change.

“Fleet operators are tired of waiting on infrastructure that doesn’t match their electrification schedule,” said Tyler Phillipi, CEO of OptiGrid. “The Orange Juicer gives them the power to deploy today, with charging performance that rivals high-capacity systems but requires just a fraction of the grid input.”

The Orange Juicer will be commercially available in Q4 2025.",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Orange_EV__1_crop__2.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 04:58:07.306267

However, the study also cautioned that many of these positions are at risk due to the Trump administration’s initiatives to hinder renewable energy development.

In 2024, the clean energy sector saw a 2.8% increase in employment, adding 100,000 jobs and bringing the total to over 3.5 million people, Reuters quoted figures from the study in a report.

This data comes from an annual study on clean energy jobs conducted by E2, an environmental advocacy group, for the past ten years.

Growth in US states

In the past year, several states have demonstrated remarkable growth in the clean energy sector, significantly contributing to the nation’s transition towards sustainable energy sources.

Leading this charge were Idaho, Oklahoma, Texas, Florida, and New Jersey, each exhibiting substantial increases in clean energy job creation.

This surge in employment reflects a broader trend of investment and innovation within renewable energy technologies, energy efficiency, and sustainable practices across these diverse economic landscapes.

The growth in these states underscores the increasing economic viability and widespread adoption of clean energy solutions, fostering a green workforce and driving local economies forward.

The study revealed that clean energy accounted for over 80% of all new energy sector jobs in 2024.

“What these numbers show is that this was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024,” E2 Executive Director Bob Keefe said in a statement.

Now, clean energy job growth is at serious risk – and with it, our overall economy.

Assessment of workforce dynamics

The comprehensive study undertook a detailed analysis of employment trends and opportunities across a crucial spectrum of burgeoning industries, all of which are central to the global transition towards a more sustainable and low-carbon economy.

It also examined job creation and growth within renewable electricity generation, encompassing solar, wind, and hydropower.

Additionally, it analysed the workforce dynamics in biofuels production and the burgeoning electric vehicle industry.

The report further scrutinized employment in energy efficiency initiatives, battery storage solutions, and critical grid modernization projects, providing a holistic view of the green job market.

This analysis did not reflect shifts in US policy since President Donald Trump assumed office in January.

Trump’s administration has subsequently implemented numerous measures to dismantle federal support for wind and solar initiatives, previously championed by his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, in favor of promoting fossil fuels.

According to E2, clean energy employs three times as many Americans as the oil, gas, and coal industries combined.

According to the report, California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Massachusetts are the states with the highest number of wind and solar jobs.

Of the total jobs in the energy sector, nearly 2.4 million are in energy efficiency, encompassing the installation of efficient heating, cooling, and lighting systems, and the manufacturing of certified appliances.

""Democrats argue that because the termination clause was no longer in subsection (h), Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill amending subsection (h) to end the credit in 2025 was legally ineffective,"" Ayers wrote in a HARDI blog post.
The Democrats' letter argues that the 25C credit remains in effect through 2032 and calls on the IRS to affirm that.
""At the time the law (OBBBA) was passed, subsection H contained the expiration date, and that’s what was amended,"" Ayers said.","Ayers said he doesn't want the Democrats' efforts to mislead consumers or contractors into thinking they'll be able to use 25C after this year. HARDI and other HVACR trade groups are aligned on the issue, he said.

""We would love to see incentives,"" Ayers said Wednesday. ""We don't want a consumer to feel they've been hurt by a contractor based on a press release.""

The 25C credit, also called the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, offers a credit of up to 30% of the cost of qualified home energy-saving measures, such as heat pumps, high-efficiency a/c units, and new windows, doors, and insulation. The credit, which reduces taxes owed, is capped at $3,200 a year, with lower limits for specific equipment and improvements.

The credit originated in 2005 and was expanded in 2022 by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which also extended it through 2032. But the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed into law in July, calls for 25C to expire after this year.

The 19 House Democrats recently wrote to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is also acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), saying the OBBBA cited the wrong subsection, in Section 25C of the Internal Revenue Code, in canceling the tax credit. The IRA had moved the provision for 25C's expiration from subsection (h) of Section 25C to subsection (i).

""Democrats argue that because the termination clause was no longer in subsection (h), Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill amending subsection (h) to end the credit in 2025 was legally ineffective,"" Ayers wrote in a HARDI blog post.

The Democrats' letter argues that the 25C credit remains in effect through 2032 and calls on the IRS to affirm that. ""Any suggestion that Section 25C has expired is not only legally incorrect but would also represent an unauthorized $21 billion tax hike on hard-working American families,"" the letter says, in part.

But Ayers said that, due to what appears to be an oversight, the IRA's changes to 25C weren't written into ""positive law"" because a drafting error left the effective date out. ""As a result, the IRA revisions remain in a note section of the (U.S.) Code, waiting for Congress to pass a technical correction,"" Ayers wrote. Changes to 25C, he said, are in what's called ""slip law,"" which, while valid, does not have the authority of positive law.

""At the time the law (OBBBA) was passed, subsection H contained the expiration date, and that’s what was amended,"" Ayers said.

The IRS is unlikely to change its position that 25C expires after this year, Ayers said. ""The only out that we see is for House Democrats to try and file a lawsuit,"" which is also unlikely, he said.

The IRS did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the offices of three of the Democrats who signed the letter to Bessent.

""Time is running out for homeowners to take advantage of the credit, and (HARDI) members should encourage contractors to schedule qualifying projects as soon as possible to avoid installation delays in December,"" Ayers wrote in his blog post.

Study Involved Onsite Participation from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Defense at Company’s RCRA-Permitted Incinerator

NORWELL, Mass., September 18, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Clean Harbors, Inc. (NYSE: CLH) (""Clean Harbors"" or the ""Company""), the leading provider of environmental and industrial services throughout North America, today announced the successful results of its latest PFAS study, which affirms that its commercial high-temperature, RCRA-permitted incineration facilities can reliably and safely destroy multiple forms of PFAS (per- and poly-fluorinated alkyl substances), the ""forever chemicals"" that pose significant human health risks. For the full results from the study click here.

The testing protocols were an extension of the initial tests the Company conducted in 2021 and 2022 using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards. The latest study was specifically designed to demonstrate that Clean Harbors’ high-temperature combustion process – ranging from 2,000-2,200 degrees Fahrenheit – could achieve destruction of PFAS compounds while testing for the EPA’s stringent new OTM-50 and 0010 (pre-cursor to OTM-55) emission standards, which were not part of the earlier testing. No other company or destruction technology has met both EPA standards.

""These study results further validate that we can safely and thoroughly destroy a wide variety of PFAS compounds in our high-temperature RCRA-permitted hazardous waste incinerators,"" said Eric Gerstenberg, Co-Chief Executive Officer. ""We have always been confident in the capabilities of our facilities as it relates to PFAS compounds. There has been misinformation around incineration and whether it is safe to destroy PFAS. We excelled using both OTM-50 and 0010 - the EPA’s strictest and newest testing standards for PFAS. We are the only company to have achieved that designation. Most importantly, we demonstrated with certainty that we can effectively eliminate the threat from forever chemicals in its multiple forms and at commercial scale with consistent outcomes.""

The testing for the latest PFAS study was conducted in November 2024 at a Clean Harbors incineration facility, in conjunction with officials from the EPA and the Department of Defense (DoD). EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin recently visited Clean Harbors Deer Park incineration facility and saw firsthand how advanced treatment technologies are being deployed to address hazardous materials, such as PFAS. Following the visit, Administrator Zeldin remarked that it is ""impressive to see new American technologies being implemented to protect the environment.""

Mike Battles, Co-Chief Executive Officer, said, ""In recent years, scientific evidence has repeatedly proven the adverse health effects of many of these PFAS chemicals. The EPA and other federal and state regulatory authorities have begun establishing frameworks to protect human health from the impacts of these compounds. The first major step at the federal level was the creation in 2024 of a drinking water standard. Further steps are needed to establish rules for soil remediation and acceptable methods for PFAS destruction. We partnered directly with the EPA for our recent testing to ensure that we not only met their latest standards but gathered the most comprehensive data to help regulators develop effective new regulations for PFAS and protect the country from its health impacts. The U.S. Department of Defense also was involved, given their commitment to protecting service members and addressing potential PFAS contamination at military installations.""

Under the testing conditions, sampling and analysis was conducted for the key PFAS compounds and any potential residual volatile and semi-volatile elements. The test data reviewed the incinerator process waste feed streams, solid and liquid process residue streams, and incinerator stack gases. AFFF concentrate, PFOA, PFOS, PFBA, PFDA, PFHxA, PFHxS, HFPO-DA and other PFAS chemicals were introduced to the incineration facilities during its normal operation. As with the previous tests conducted by Clean Harbors, the latest data showed that these PFAS compounds were not only effectively destroyed, but also that stack emissions resulted in ambient concentrations two to eight orders of magnitude safer than any state or federal ambient air limit or guideline.

The comprehensive test results were shared for review and validation of the study’s conclusions with two highly regarded third parties – Melvin E. Keener, Ph.D., Executive Director for the Coalition for Responsible Waste Incineration (CRWI) and Dr. Jens Blotevogel, a Principal Research Scientist at Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CISRO). Both researchers have spent decades evaluating the impacts of environmental organic contaminants.

""We know that many customers want safe, assured destruction of PFAS at scale to eliminate any further liabilities as these chemicals never degrade and often migrate,"" said Gerstenberg. ""There are many locations that have soil, water or both contaminated by PFAS, as well as stockpiles of compounds such as AFFF that customers need solutions to address. In addition, over the decades, PFAS chemicals have leached into groundwater and contaminated drinking supplies. Given that customers are facing PFAS in multiple forms, we introduced our ‘Total PFAS Solution’ in 2024 consisting of eight core elements and providing customers with a range of services to meet all their needs, from analysis to water filtration to remediation to disposal. Today, Clean Harbors remains the only company that can offer an end-to-end, single-source answer for any PFAS need, and at a commercially scalable level.""

Battles concluded, ""Based on the results of this latest rigorous study, we continue to view our end-to-end solution and thermal destruction at our RCRA-permitted facilities as the safest and most viable option for addressing and eliminating PFAS, which in total represents a massive market opportunity in the years ahead. The study data supports the confidence we have in our technology and state-of-the-art air pollution and emission controls; the study results should dispel any lingering doubts about PFAS incineration.""

Energy's $16.4 billion acquisition of Calpine Corp. represents a bold and calculated move to position itself at the forefront of this transformation. By merging its zero-emission nuclear and renewable assets with Calpine's low-emission natural gas and geothermal capabilities, Constellation has created the largest clean energy provider in the United States, with a combined generation capacity of nearly 60 gigawatts from zero- and low-emission sources Constellation to Acquire Calpine; Creates America’s Leading Producer of Clean and Reliable Energy[ 1 ]. This strategic pivot not only diversifies its energy mix but also aligns with the explosive growth trajectories of geothermal, nuclear, and battery storage sectors—industries projected to expand at compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) ranging from 6.6% to 22.1% through 2030 Geothermal Energy Market Size & Trends, Share, Report, 2032[ 2 ].

Strategic M&A: A Blueprint for Sectoral Dominance

Constellation's acquisition of Calpine is more than a financial transaction—it is a masterstroke in capturing the dual forces of decarbonization and grid reliability. Calpine's 22 geothermal plants and 38 natural gas facilities complement Constellation's existing nuclear and renewable portfolio, creating a hybrid model that balances the baseload stability of nuclear with the scalability of geothermal and the flexibility of battery storage Constellation to Acquire Calpine; Creates America’s Leading Producer of Clean and Reliable Energy[ 1 ]. This diversification is critical as the U.S. energy grid faces increasing pressure to integrate intermittent renewables while maintaining reliability.

The geothermal segment, in particular, is a strategic win. With global geothermal markets projected to grow to $125.9 billion by 2032 Geothermal Energy Market Size & Trends, Share, Report, 2032[ 2 ], Constellation's entry into this sector via Calpine positions it to capitalize on untapped potential. Geothermal's 24/7 availability and low operational costs make it an ideal complement to solar and wind, especially in regions like California and Texas, where Calpine's assets are concentrated. Meanwhile, the acquisition's inclusion of natural gas plants—while seemingly contradictory to clean energy goals—ensures a transitional bridge to full decarbonization, leveraging existing infrastructure to reduce costs and emissions incrementally.

Sectoral Tailwinds: Nuclear, Storage, and Policy Momentum

Constellation's long-term value creation is further bolstered by its focus on nuclear energy and battery storage, two sectors with robust policy and technological tailwinds. The U.S. nuclear market, valued at $13.3 billion in 2024, is expected to grow at a 5.1% CAGR through 2032 U.S. Nuclear Power Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis, 2032[ 3 ], driven by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and bipartisan support for zero-emission baseload power. Constellation's nuclear fleet, including the Clinton and Crane Clean Energy Centers, benefits from IRA tax credits and 20-year power purchase agreements (PPAs) with tech giants like

Battery storage, another cornerstone of the energy transition, is set to triple in market size to $186.9 billion by 2030 Geothermal Energy Market Size & Trends, Share, Report, 2032[ 2 ]. Constellation's investments in grid-scale storage and partnerships with data centers—energy-intensive industries seeking clean power—position it to meet surging demand. The company's plans to integrate battery storage with its nuclear and geothermal assets will enhance grid resilience, a critical differentiator as extreme weather events strain traditional infrastructure.

Financial Strength and Analyst Endorsement

Post-acquisition, Constellation's financials reflect immediate value creation.

Even cautious analysts like acknowledge the strategic merits, upgrading Constellation to “Buy” despite lowering their price target to $232 Constellation Energy Stock Rises As Wall Street Praises Calpine Acquisition[ 5 ].

The regulatory landscape further strengthens the investment case. The IRA's tax credits for hydrogen production and nuclear projects have already catalyzed Constellation's clean hydrogen initiative at the LaSalle Clean Energy Center Constellation Reports Second Quarter 2025 Results[ 4 ]. These incentives reduce capital costs and enhance the economics of high-margin projects, ensuring the company remains competitive in a sector where upfront costs are traditionally prohibitive.

Conclusion: A Compelling Investment Thesis

Constellation Energy's M&A strategy is a textbook example of aligning with secular trends. By acquiring Calpine, it has secured a leadership position in geothermal, expanded its nuclear footprint, and positioned itself to dominate battery storage and hydrogen markets. The company's financial performance, regulatory tailwinds, and analyst endorsements underscore its ability to deliver sustained value. For investors seeking exposure to the energy transition, Constellation offers a rare combination of strategic foresight, operational scale, and policy-driven growth.

520,000 jobs added over last five years, far surpassing growth in fossil fuel and gas and diesel motor vehicle sectors

7% of all new US jobs and 82 % of all new energy sector jobs were in clean energy in 2024

WASHINGTON – Clean energy jobs grew more than three times faster than the rest of the U.S. economy in 2024, adding almost 100,000 new jobs and bringing total number of clean energy workers in U.S. to 3.56 million, according to the tenth annual Clean Jobs America report released today by the national, nonpartisan business group E2.

Amid policy uncertainty and an overall slowing of job and economic growth in 2024, the growth in clean energy jobs dropped to its slowest pace since 2020, adding about 50,000 fewer jobs than in 2023.

Still, jobs in solar, wind, batteries, energy efficiency, storage and grid and other clean energy subsectors continued to grow faster than the broader economy, and make up an increasingly larger share of the overall U.S. workforce. More than 7 percent of all new jobs added in the U.S. and 82 percent of all new energy jobs added last year were in clean energy occupations.

E2’s 10th annual Clean Jobs America report comes as the clean energy industry is reeling from recent federal policy decisions to kill projects, revoke tax credits, cancel permits and add new regulatory red tape and legal hurdles aimed at hobbling solar, wind, electric vehicles and other industries. These federal policy assaults come even as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says the fastest-growing occupations in America are wind turbine service technicians and solar photovoltaic installers.

Though not reflected in the 2024 data, recent policy actions by Congress and the Trump administration have already resulted in major job losses in the industry, with more expected to come. According to separate E2 research, since January 2025 companies canceled more than $22 billion planned clean energy related factories and other projects that were expected to create 16,500 new jobs. Analysis by other organizations estimate more than 830,000 jobs could be lost just because of the energy policy rollbacks in President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law on July 4.

“What these numbers show is that this was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024,” said Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director. “Now, clean energy job growth is at serious risk – and with it, our overall economy,”

According to E2’s report, clean energy jobs now account for 42 of all energy jobs in America and 2.3 percent of the overall national workforce. More people now work in clean energy related occupations than work as nurses, cashiers, waiters and waitresses, or preschool, elementary, and middle school teachers.

More than 520,000 jobs have now been added by the clean energy and clean vehicle sectors over the last five years, an increase of 17 percent—far exceeding employment gains in fossil fuels, gas and diesel motor vehicles, and the overall U.S. economy.

While the sector added the fewest jobs since the pandemic-fueled unemployment crisis, clean energy still grew more than three times faster than the rest of the U.S. workforce (2.8 percent vs. 0.8 percent) amid an economy-wide slowdown in hiring and rising policy uncertainty. Over the last five years, clean energy companies have added jobs 60 percent faster than the rest of the economy.

“Every year, clean energy jobs become more intertwined and critical to our overall economy,” said Michael Timberlake, director of research and publications for E2. “These jobs are now a vital anchor of America’s energy workforce. The strength of the U.S. job market and the future of our energy economy are now inseparable from the growth of clean energy.”

Energy efficiency remains the top sector for U.S. clean energy jobs, employing nearly 2.4 million workers nationwide after adding 91,000 jobs in 2024. That’s followed by renewable generation (569,000 overall, +9,000 in 2024) and clean vehicles (398,000 overall, -12,000 in 2024). Despite an industry-wide decline across all motor vehicle sectors in 2024, clean vehicle jobs have grown 52 percent since 2020, adding 137,000 jobs.

Over the past five years, no region added more clean energy jobs and at a faster rate than the South – now home to more than 1 million clean energy workers. From Texas to Virginia, Southern states added 41,000 clean energy jobs in 2024. Western and Northeastern states added more than 20,000 jobs respectively. The Midwest added more than 13,000 jobs. See a detailed regional breakdown in the full report.

At the state level, clean energy continues to drive economic prosperity. Twenty-three states are home to at least 50,000 clean energy jobs and just eight states have more workers employed by fossil fuels than clean energy.

Seventeen states have seen their clean energy workforces jump at least 20 percent in the last five years. See table below for more detail.

Methodology

This analysis of U.S. clean energy employment is based on employment data collected and analyzed by the BW Research Partnership for the 2025 U.S. Energy and Employment Report (USEER). The USEER analyzes data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) to track employment across many energy production, transmission and distribution subsectors. In addition, the 2025 USEER relies on a unique supplemental survey of 42,800 business representatives across the United States. Created and conducted by BW Research, the methodology has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). This survey is used to identify energy-related employment within key subsectors of the broader industries as classified by the BLS and to assign them into their component energy and energy efficiency sectors.

A full methodology on the sectors and types of jobs this analysis includes and does not include is available in the report here.

It’s the latest stage in a legal impasse over the massive lithium project. Environmental groups are trying to make sure nearby residents get the benefits of lithium production, while guarding against harmful impacts. The company says critics are using court challenges to stall an important energy project.

The nonprofits Comite Civico del Valle and Earthworks filed arguments with the Fourth District Court of Appeal last week, asking the court to reconsider a claim they filed in 2024, which a superior court judge dismissed earlier this year.

In their appeal filed Sept. 11, the groups argue that the environmental impact report for the Hell’s Kitchen lithium mine neglects potential problems with air quality, water use, hazardous materials and tribal cultural resources.

“The project would create a high-water demand in an arid desert environment where the drying out of the Salton Sea worsens severe air pollution impacts,” the brief stated.

Lauren Rose, a spokesperson for Controlled Thermal Resources, the parent company of Hell’s Kitchen, denounced what she called a “frivolous legal appeal.”

“This group’s ongoing actions are a clear abuse of the original intentions of (the California Environmental Quality Act) and only serve to delay progress on clean energy projects that are essential to the community, California, and the nation,” she said in a statement to CalMatters.

Hell’s Kitchen promises to unearth thousands of kilotons of lithium, a mineral essential to electric car batteries, cellphones and other electronics. Officials with the nonprofits say they’re in favor of lithium production, but want to ensure it doesn’t compromise the health and environment of surrounding communities.

“We make the case that the project must be corrected to meet the standards that protect our community and our environment,” Luis Olmedo, executive director of Comite Civico del Valle, told CalMatters. “The lawsuit isn’t about stopping clean energy. We are for clean energy.”

The groups also released a report summarizing their call for heightened scrutiny of the project’s impacts. And they laid out demands that included creating a Lithium Valley joint powers authority with a local advisory commission, dedicating more of the state’s lithium extraction excise tax to areas closest to the project, and enacting an additional environmental mitigation fee on lithium produced there.

Under the existing formula, Bombay Beach, a small hamlet on the Salton Sea near the project, would get $8,631 to offset impacts of the project, while larger areas such as El Centro, Calexico and Imperial would get six-figure payments.

READ MORE >>> The rotten egg smell at the Salton Sea isn’t just a nuisance. It can make people sick.

Bari Bean, deputy CEO of natural resources for Imperial County, said in a statement to CalMatters that the lithium tax formula is “a practical and balanced framework that considers both population size and geographic proximity to the lithium resource.”

Bean said a joint powers authority would duplicate existing systems for community input. Imperial County wouldn’t support additional lithium fees, she said, since California already has stricter environmental protections than other states, “making development in California more challenging and often less cost competitive.”

State and federal officials have predicted that the area around the Salton Sea that they call “Lithium Valley” could become one of the world’s biggest sources of the “white gold,” freeing the U.S. from dependence on other countries for the critical mineral.

Imperial County Supervisor Ryan E. Kelley said the project will advance both regional economic growth and U.S. energy goals.

“This initiative will position Imperial County as a leader in clean energy, contribute to California’s sustainability goals, and strengthen the United States’ critical mineral supply chain,” Kelley said in a statement to CalMatters.

However, Rose said the ongoing court challenge has halted that momentum, and risks stalling lithium production in California.

“Just a few short years ago, Imperial County was leading the charge for clean energy and sustainable critical minerals development in the United States,” she said. “Now, billions of investment dollars have flowed to other states, including Nevada, Utah, Texas, and Arkansas, leaving California in the dust.”

Olmedo said his group has never called for injunctions against the project, but wants safeguards on its operations.

Hell’s Kitchen would extract lithium and other critical minerals from super-heated brine in the Salton Sea aquifer and then reinject the brine into the earth, in what the company calls a closed loop system that’s cleaner than other lithium mining systems.

Cal Poly Pomona Professor James Blair, an advisor to Comite Del Civico and member of Imperial County’s Lithium Valley Academic Taskforce, said the environmental review doesn’t prove that claim.

Blair said direct lithium extraction is framed as a “cleaner, greener method of lithium extraction compared to open mine or brine ponds,” but research on similar systems show that they use lots of fresh water. If that’s the case at Hell’s Kitchen it could worsen the decline of the shrinking Salton Sea.

“Novel technologies bring unknown results,” Blair said. “We don’t really know how much water is needed.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47635/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/021424-hells-kitchen-lithium-getty-cm1758211711.jpg?h=56d0ca2e&itok=8auwU57E,N,,2025-09-19 07:59:28.309866

The Department of Energy, or DOE, is requesting information from stakeholders including utilities and regional transmission managers on near-term investment opportunities, readiness of projects, expectations on growth in power demand, and constraints that it says it can address.

US President Donald Trump on his first day back in office in January issued an order declaring an energy emergency as artificial intelligence, data centers, and electric vehicles are boosting power demand for the first time in two decades.

The DOE has ordered several coal and natural gas plants that had planned to shut to keep operating, the latest US move supporting fossil fuels.

Trump claims that rapid adoption of solar and wind power has made US electricity unstable and expensive, justifying his bid to end most subsidies for them. Reliability has improved in Texas, the US grid with the most renewable energy, however.

The Speed to Power program will help the DOE determine how to use funding programs and national emergency authorities to expand power generation and the grid.

The DOE has billions of dollars in funds and financing through departments including its Loan Programs Office. In July, the DOE axed a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for a transmission line that was meant to send power from wind and solar energy projects in Kansas to cities in the Midwest and East.

Also on Thursday, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission took actions aimed to boost grid security. FERC approved and proposed rules to reduce the risks of the supply chain, cyber attacks and electrical grid disruptions caused by extreme cold, which can sometimes lead to blackouts. Green energy opponents say that coal plants that have been slated to retire during Trump's second term will be needed.

Tom Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, predicted that 38 coal plants that are scheduled to close through 2028 would remain open, either on Trump orders or voluntarily.

The US Energy Information Administration said in July that in the first three months of 2025 power plants burned about 20 per cent more coal than they did during that quarter in 2024.

Amid policy uncertainty and an overall cooling economy, clean energy jobs expanded at their slowest pace since 2020, with about 50,000 fewer new jobs than the year before.
Solar, wind, batteries, energy efficiency, storage, and grid jobs made up more than 7% of all new US jobs last year and 82% of new energy jobs.
More than 1 million clean energy workers are based there, and the South added 41,000 jobs in 2024.
At the state level, 23 states now have at least 50,000 clean energy jobs, and in all but eight states, clean energy employment outnumbers fossil fuel jobs.","Clean energy jobs surged in 2024, growing more than three times faster than the rest of the US economy and adding nearly 100,000 new positions. That brought the total clean energy workforce to 3.56 million people, according to the 10th annual Clean Jobs America report from E2.

But growth slowed compared to 2023. Amid policy uncertainty and an overall cooling economy, clean energy jobs expanded at their slowest pace since 2020, with about 50,000 fewer new jobs than the year before.

Even so, the sector still outpaced the broader economy. Solar, wind, batteries, energy efficiency, storage, and grid jobs made up more than 7% of all new US jobs last year and 82% of new energy jobs. Clean energy also takes a bigger share of the overall workforce: it now accounts for 42% of all US energy jobs and 2.3% of the total workforce. More people work in clean energy today than as nurses, cashiers, restaurant servers, or preschool through middle school teachers.

The report lands as the clean energy industry faces major headwinds. Federal policy moves have canceled projects, revoked tax credits, and added new regulatory hurdles targeting solar, wind, EVs, and more. While not yet reflected in 2024’s numbers, those actions are already hitting jobs hard. E2 found that since January 2025, companies have canceled more than $22 billion worth of clean energy factories and projects that would have created 16,500 jobs. Other analyses warn that more than 830,000 jobs could vanish under Trump’s big bill, signed on July 4.

“This was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024,” said E2’s executive director Bob Keefe. “Now, clean energy job growth is at serious risk – and with it, our overall economy.”

Clean energy and EV jobs have added more than 520,000 positions over the last five years, a 17% increase. That’s far more growth than fossil fuels, ICE vehicle manufacturing, or the economy overall. In fact, over the past five years, clean energy companies have added jobs 60% faster than the rest of the US economy.

Energy efficiency remains the largest employer in the sector, with nearly 2.4 million workers after adding 91,000 jobs last year. Renewable generation jobs reached 569,000 (+9,000 in 2024), while clean vehicle jobs totaled 398,000. The clean vehicle sector shrank by 12,000 jobs in 2024 due to an industry-wide decline across all vehicle sectors, but employment is still up 52% since 2020.

Regionally, the South is leading the way. More than 1 million clean energy workers are based there, and the South added 41,000 jobs in 2024. The West and Northeast each added over 20,000 jobs, and the Midwest added 13,000. At the state level, 23 states now have at least 50,000 clean energy jobs, and in all but eight states, clean energy employment outnumbers fossil fuel jobs.

“Every year, clean energy jobs become more intertwined and critical to our overall economy,” said Michael Timberlake, E2’s director of research and publications. “These jobs are now a vital anchor of America’s energy workforce. The strength of the US job market and the future of our energy economy are now inseparable from the growth of clean energy.”

This growth, however, masks underlying vulnerabilities tied to political uncertainty and shifting economic conditions. For investors, understanding the interplay between policy risks and market adaptability is critical to assessing the sector's future trajectory.

Policy Risks: The Shadow of Uncertainty

The slowdown in 2024—adding 50,000 fewer jobs than in 2023—was attributed to policy uncertainty and a cooling economy US clean energy jobs hit 3.56M in 2024 but the feds may kill[ 2 ]. This raises concerns about the sector's dependence on federal incentives, particularly the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which catalyzed $80 billion in clean energy investment in 2024 alone US clean energy jobs hit 3.56M in 2024 but the feds may kill[ 2 ]. A report by Reuters warns that potential shifts in administration priorities, such as those under a Trump-led policy agenda, could undermine this momentum by scaling back subsidies or regulatory support Renewable energy jobs surge, though data differ on where and by …[ 3 ]. For instance, wind power production, concentrated in the Great Plains and Midwest, faces risks if federal tax credits for renewables are not extended Renewable energy jobs surge, though data differ on where and by …[ 3 ]. Similarly, solar sector growth, driven by declining costs and state-level incentives, could stall without consistent policy frameworks Renewable energy jobs surge, though data differ on where and by …[ 3 ].

The IRA's success in leveraging public investment—where every $1 of federal spending stimulated $5–$6 of private capital America’s Clean Energy Jobs Boom: 313,000 New …[ 4 ]—highlights the sector's reliance on policy continuity. Yet, this also exposes it to abrupt reversals. Investors must weigh the likelihood of sustained legislative support against the potential for abrupt policy shifts, particularly in an election year.

Market Resilience: Diversification and Private Investment

Despite these risks, the clean energy sector exhibits remarkable resilience. Energy efficiency remains the largest employer, with 2.4 million jobs, while renewable generation and clean vehicle sectors added 569,000 and 398,000 jobs, respectively US clean energy jobs hit 3.56M in 2024 but the feds may kill[ 2 ]. This diversification across subsectors—solar, wind, batteries, and grid infrastructure—reduces overreliance on any single technology or policy. Moreover, private investment has surged, with 45 new or expanded manufacturing facilities for batteries, EVs, and solar energy coming online in 2024 US clean energy jobs hit 3.56M in 2024 but the feds may kill[ 2 ].

Regional dynamics further bolster resilience. The South, home to over 1 million clean energy jobs, and states like Texas, California, and Idaho—where growth rates hit 7.7%—demonstrate the sector's geographic spread US clean energy jobs hit 3.56M in 2024 but the feds may kill[ 2 ]. Notably, 23 states now have at least 50,000 clean energy jobs, and in all but eight states, these jobs outnumber fossil fuel employment US clean energy jobs hit 3.56M in 2024 but the feds may kill[ 2 ]. This decentralization mitigates regional economic shocks and aligns with local policy incentives, such as Texas's $20 billion in clean energy investment US clean energy jobs hit 3.56M in 2024 but the feds may kill[ 2 ].

Conclusion: A Dual-Track Strategy for Investors

The U.S. clean energy sector's sustainability depends on a dual-track approach: advocating for stable, long-term policies while capitalizing on market-driven innovation. While the IRA has proven its ability to amplify private investment, investors must remain vigilant about political risks. Diversifying portfolios across subsectors and geographies—particularly in regions with robust policy frameworks—can mitigate these risks.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-qwen_generated_1758256066564.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-19 01:59:03.143734

So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.
OK, let’s say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed.","Tax incentives that saved U.S. residents thousands of dollars on home efficiency upgrades, clean energy installations and electric vehicles are expiring this year. That means people who want to take advantage of them before they disappear have to act quickly.

“There is still time, but the clock is ticking,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we’ve got some tips on how to maximize savings.

Refresh my memory. What are these incentives?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren’t capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

When are they expiring?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it’s also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

The car doesn’t need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

If I’m focused on my home, what should I prioritize?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

“That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,” she said. “Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.”

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

“We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn’t mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,” Pierce said.

“Experts estimate that takes 16 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that’s quick,” said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. “You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it’s even possible.”

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?

OK, let’s say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren’t allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects — think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage — could be carried forward if you didn’t get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

Rewiring America said it’s not clear if that will continue given the accelerated expiration dates, and recommended consumers check with their tax adviser.

“I’m excited about the years ahead for agriculture and Insignum,” said Kyle Mohler, Founder & CEO.","Imagine if your plants could turn purple to let you know they’re sick? That technology has already become a reality thanks to Insignum AgTech.

The company, which is based in Indiana, has announced the successful closing of its Series Seed funding round, raising $2.4 million led by Innova Memphis, with participation from Elevate Ventures, Purdue Strategic Ventures, and others, including the first ever investment from the newly-formed FFA Ventures fund.

Insignum creates new genes out of plant DNA that enables crops to turn color in the early stages of a specific stress, such as disease. The first gene causes corn to turn purple at the site of infection seven or more days before symptoms of the disease are apparent. Research has proven it does not react to other stresses, such as insect attack or physical damage.

Growers and agronomists are empowered to address the problem:

Exactly when the true problem begins, before visible symptoms,

Precisely where to determine priority zones or fields, and

Only if needed by using data driven decisions yielding improved ROI and confidence in crop management.

Insignum’s technology has been successfully field-tested for five years. Testing in 2025 includes an additional leading seed company and the farmer-owned Keystone Cooperative.

“Insignum’s ability to give growers a visual, actionable alert is revolutionary,” said Dean Didato, partner at Innova Memphis. “By enabling precision agriculture to spot fungal pressure and treat appropriately ‘Exactly when, Precisely where, and Only if’ required, their technology is set to transform crop management and promote sustainable farming practices.”

As a result of these successful field trials, Insignum will use funds to advance their first trait through their commercial pipeline. In addition, they will begin development of a disease-signaling trait for canola.

To deliver these milestones, Insignum has hired several new employees.

Chris Cook, Insignum’s Director of Commercial Operations, started in June. Chris rose to Syngenta’s™ Head of Business Development for North America, where he signed key partnerships with Fortune 500 food and fuel companies.

Pon Samuel, Ph.D., started in September as Insignum’s Chief Innovation Officer. Pon had an illustrious career as a Distinguished Laureate at Corteva Agriscience™, most notably as one of the inventors of their Enlist E3® crop trait.

“I’m excited about the years ahead for agriculture and Insignum,” said Kyle Mohler, Founder & CEO. “Challenging times lend themselves to finding new solutions.

To what extent are prospective large load requests subject to consistent, objective screening criteria before they are included in the load forecast?
How do you forecast how the actual electricity consumption of a large load will compare to its requested level of interconnection service?","The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on Sept. 18 advanced four reliability measures for the U.S. bulk power system (BPS), formalizing frameworks around supply chain risk, cloud computing and virtual infrastructure, cybersecurity, and extreme cold weather preparedness.

The commission finalized a new supply chain risk management rule—effective in 60 days—that expands protections against vulnerabilities stemming from outside threats. In addition, FERC issued two notices of proposed rulemaking (NOPRs): one to allow utilities to use cloud computing and virtual infrastructure while maintaining security standards, and another to strengthen cybersecurity requirements for low-impact systems against coordinated cyber-attacks. The commission also approved enhanced extreme cold weather preparedness standards, which, when effective on Oct. 1, will require improved generator winterization and clearer communication protocols during cold weather events.

On Thursday, FERC Chairman David Rosner asked six grid operators how they forecast large new electric loads from rapidly growing sectors such as artificial intelligence (AI) and data centers. The query, prompted by unprecedented electricity demand growth, will seek to examine whether existing load forecasting practices can keep pace with the accelerating deployment of high-capacity industrial and commercial customers, and to identify improved methods that better protect reliability and ratepayer value as the sector’s profile evolves.

A Suite of New Rules

At the commission’s open meeting on Thursday, FERC’s three commissioners— Chairman David Rosner, and Commissioners Lindsay See and Judy Chang—voted unanimously to approve four measures that they said were “focused on modernizing the reliability and security of the nation’s Bulk Power System in the face of threats.”

Final Rule on Supply Chain Risk Management Reliability Standards Revisions (RM24-4-000 and RM20-19-000). FERC finalized a new supply chain risk management rule for the U.S. bulk power system to address vulnerabilities in equipment and services supplied by entities deemed risks to national security. The rule directs the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC) to develop revised reliability standards within 18 months that strengthen responsible entities’ supply chain risk management plans and extend protections to protected cyber assets (PCAs), which are ancillary devices inside electronic security perimeters that adversaries could exploit as pathways into bulk power system operations.

FERC has said the measure seeks to close gaps exposed by cyber incidents and compliance audits. It recognizes growing threats from nation-state actors and global supply chain insecurities that could compromise grid reliability and cybersecurity. However, owing to industry pushback, the finalized rule stops short of mandating validation of vendor-supplied data, instead encouraging voluntary or centralized approaches.

The supply chain rule traces back to FERC’s September 2020 Notice of Inquiry following heightened national security concerns about foreign equipment in critical infrastructure, particularly communication systems and other equipment, which U.S. security agencies identified as potential vectors for espionage and grid disruption. The initial inquiry drew over 25 industry comments on risks posed by potentially compromised vendors and whether existing Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards adequately addressed supply chain vulnerabilities. In September 2024, FERC issued a NOPR, which prompted NERC and regional reliability entities to submit formal comments by November 2024. FERC also held a March 2025 workshop focused on assessment protocols and vendor validation requirements, which generated additional input from more than 20 industry participants.

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Critical Infrastructure Protection Reliability Standard CIP-003-11 (RM25-8-000). FERC’s NOPR proposes to approve NERC’s CIP-003-11 standard to address the growing risk that coordinated cyberattacks on dispersed, low-impact bulk electric system (BES) cyber systems. “Most individual BES Cyber Systems within the bulk electric system are categorized as low impact,” the NOPR reads. “Individual low-impact BES Cyber Systems have less of an impact on bulk electric system reliability than medium or high-impact BES Cyber Systems and thus have fewer CIP Reliability Standard requirements. Nevertheless, low-impact BES Cyber Systems may still introduce reliability risks of a higher impact when distributed low-impact BES Cyber Systems are subjected to a coordinated cyber-attack.” The proposal stems from NERC’s December 20, 2024, petition, which incorporated recommendations from a Low Impact Criteria Review Team formed after the SolarWinds attack.

CIP-003-11 would require entities with low-impact BES Cyber Systems to:

Authenticate all users prior to permitting access to networks containing low-impact BES Cyber Systems or shared cyber infrastructure;

Protect authentication information while in transit; and

Detect malicious communications to or between low-impact BES Cyber Systems with external routable connectivity.

The Commission is seeking comment to approve the standard as well as feedback on whether NERC should be directed to conduct a study or whitepaper examining evolving threats. If adopted, entities could face significant new documentation, training, and system architecture updates. NERC’s plan calls for a 36-month implementation period following FERC approval.

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Virtualization Reliability Standards (RM24-8-000). In a parallel effort to modernize cybersecurity oversight, FERC issued a NOPR based on NERC’s July 10, 2024, filing to revise eleven CIP standards and glossary definitions to accommodate virtualization and cloud computing in bulk power operations explicitly. An errata filed May 20, 2025, adjusted five of those proposals.

The NOPR proposes to approve four new and 18 modified glossary definitions along with the eleven revised standards, clarifying how protections apply to virtual machines, cloud platforms, and software-defined networks used in EMS, SCADA, and other critical functions. The revisions aim to replace prescriptive controls with objective-based criteria, reduce the compliance documentation burden, and provide flexibility for entities to adopt protections aligned with their chosen technology stacks.

FERC is seeking comment on NERC’s proposed technical feasibility exception program to address implementation challenges unique to virtualization.

Order Approving Extreme Cold Weather Reliability Standard and Directing Data Collection (RD25-7-000). FERC approved NERC’s revised Reliability Standard EOP-012-3 (Extreme Cold Weather Preparedness and Operations), which will become effective on Oct. 1, 2025. The enhanced standard, developed in response to the Commission’s June 2024 directives clarifies how to calculate unit-specific Extreme Cold Weather Temperatures, updates the definition and validation process for Generator Cold Weather Constraints, and strengthens corrective action plan timelines so that failures are addressed before the following December. It sets 24- to 48-month deadlines and mandatory compliance enforcement authority (CEA) pre-approval for extensions

New provisions require generators entering commercial operation on or after October 1, 2027, either to meet freeze-protection measures or to declare a constraint preventing operation until mitigations are complete. A standardized, auditable list of “known” and “case-by-case” constraint circumstances (such as design limits on wind turbine towers or cost-prohibitive retrofits) is codified. Entities must also conduct 36-month reviews of all validated constraint declarations to confirm ongoing validity.

FERC also directed NERC to file biennial informational reports from October 2026 through October 2034, detailing by region: the total submitted and approved constraint declarations, the aggregate MVA of constrained capacity, and the rationale for approvals. Each filing must also include a narrative analyzing notification practices to reliability coordinators, timelines for corrective actions, and the system-wide risks of allowing up to three years for freeze mitigation.

Load Forecasting Scrutiny Targets AI-Driven Demand

On Thursday, Chairman Rosner dispatched letters to six regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and independent system operators (ISOs)—CAISO, ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO, PJM, and SPP—asking for standardized feedback on large load forecasting practices, particularly for data centers supporting artificial intelligence operations. The inquiry appears to address growing concerns about forecast accuracy as utilities project hundreds or thousands of megawatts in new demand growth.

Rosner’s letter stresses the critical importance of accurate forecasting, noting that improvements of “even a few percentage points in the right direction—up or down—can impact billions of dollars in investments and customer bills. Put simply, we cannot efficiently plan the electric generation and transmission needed to serve new customers if we don’t forecast how much energy they will need as accurately as possible,” he wrote.

Rosner asked each RTO/ISO, along with their utilities and state regulators, for their perspective on:

“How do you, the utilities in your footprint, and state regulators obtain information that verifies when and whether prospective large loads in your region will reach commercial operation?

To what extent are prospective large load requests subject to consistent, objective screening criteria before they are included in the load forecast?

How do you forecast how the actual electricity consumption of a large load will compare to its requested level of interconnection service?

How do you coordinate with utilities at the regional or interregional level to share best practices on large load forecasting and ensure that large load interconnection requests are not double-counted?”

Notably, Rosner suggested RTOs and ISOs could borrow from the generator interconnection process, which applies observable milestones (such as signed contracts, financial security deposits, and site control) as objective thresholds before speculative projects are factored into regional load forecasts.

“Our experience to date tells us that large loads, such as data centers, have characteristics that call for new and improved forecasting methods,” he wrote. “Given the size and volume of new large load interconnection requests, I’m optimistic that utilities have an opportunity to apply similar criteria to those currently used to assess the commercial readiness of large projects in the generator interconnection queue.”

The timing reflects mounting pressure from consumer advocates and state regulators concerned about cost allocation for speculative projects. Recent analysis suggests data center electricity demand projections remain highly uncertain. Inherent bias usually steers toward overestimating the number of facilities that will achieve commercial operation.

As both the digital infrastructure industry and power sector grapple with these challenges, the upcoming Data Center Power Exchange (DPX) Summit on Oct. 28 in Denver offers a critical forum for utilities, grid operators, hyperscalers, and regulators to forge practical solutions. Former FERC Chairman Mark Christie will headline the event and deliver opening remarks, setting the stage for discussions on the power demand question, forecasting algorithms, streamlined interconnection processes, and coordinated investment strategies.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Stock_FERC-Bldg_FERC.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 00:59:36.854077

© UKA, Nordex, Max Bögl Wind- One of the highest-capacity German onshore wind farms is moving into the implementation phase. Approval has been granted, and energy farm developer UKA is now ordering turbines with a total capacity of 140 megawatts from the Nordex Group. At Husum Wind, the parties signed the contracts together with Max Bögl Wind AG, the supplier of the concrete elements for the hybrid towers used in the project.

Husum (renewablepress) - One of the highest-capacity onshore wind farms in Germany shifts into the implementation phase with the Papenburg project. At a public contract signing ceremony at the Husum Wind trade fair today, the order for 20 turbines from Nordex with a total rated capacity of 140 megawatts was signed by Gernot Gauglitz, Managing Partner of the UKA Group, which is responsible for the design of the project. The concrete foundations and concrete parts for the hybrid towers, with a hub height of 164 meters, are supplied by Max Bögl Wind AG.

The wind farm will be constructed on the Mercedes-Benz automobile testing site near Papenburg in Lower Saxony. The corresponding contract was signed as recently as in May 2023, and since then UKA as the energy farm developer has completed both the planning and the approval processes in a very short timeframe.

Prior to signing the contract for the purchase order, Gernot Gauglitz, Managing Partner of the UKA Group, said: “I am proud of the fact that we, as owners of the future wind farm, will be supplying Mercedes-Benz AG with electricity for the next 25 years. This project shows that UKA, which generates its own climate-friendly electricity, is an attractive supplier of electricity even to large industrial corporations. Despite some challenges – for example at the construction site – the project team is pressing ahead with the construction of the wind farm in record time. The wind farm on the Mercedes-Benz testing area is a flagship project in our portfolio of onshore wind farms currently under construction in Germany, representing more than 1.5 GW in total.”

José Luis Blanco, CEO of Nordex Group, said: “We are pleased to be able to continue our existing collaboration with UKA in Germany. We especially appreciate the renewed trust in our technology and our project management at the Papenburg wind farm, particularly given the size and significance of this project for everyone involved.”

Stefan Bögl, CEO of the Max Bögl Group, added: “New plant generations require a stable foundation to ensure operation of the wind farm for two decades. The practical combination of state-of-the-art turbine technology from Nordex and our proven Bögl hybrid tower promises exactly this: The ability to successfully harvest power from wind. We are pleased that, together with UKA and Nordex, we are part of this major project and are thus working together to drive forward the expansion of wind power in Germany.”

Jörg Burzer, Member of the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG, responsible for Production, Quality and Supply Chain Management: “The wind farm in Papenburg is an important building block of our sustainable business strategy - from an ecological and also an economic perspective. The start of construction impressively illustrates that we are consistently putting our ambitious sustainability goals for the production network into practice and thus achieving a measurable impact. We are pleased with the great progress made and are proud as Mercedes-Benz, together with our strong partners, to expand the use of wind energy in Germany with the new wind farm in Papenburg.”

If everything goes according to plan, the first turbines will begin operation on a trial basis by as early as 2027. Once fully commissioned, the wind farm will cover about 20 percent of the annual electricity needs of Mercedes-Benz Group AG in Germany. When it is completed, it will be one of the largest onshore wind farms in Germany, with an electricity generation capacity of about 140 megawatts. The electricity supply contract was concluded for a term of at least 25 years from the start of delivery. The planned wind farm is part of energy farm developer UKA’s extensive 11-gigawatt project pipeline in Germany.

The project will involve 20 turbines from German manufacturer Nordex (N163/6.X), each with a capacity of 7 MW. The concrete foundations and concrete parts for the hybrid towers at the wind farm, with a hub height of 164 meters, are manufactured and installed by Max Bögl Wind AG.

“We’ve never produced more energy than we’re producing now, but Americans’ energy bills are up over 35%,” EQT Corp. Chief Executive Officer Toby Rice said Thursday at BloombergNEF’s Barrel of Tomorrow in the Age of AI summit in Houston. “That’s the catalyst that’s going to get people asking questions.”

High Power Bills to Drive Energy Development, EQT Says Back to video

Article content

Rice and other panelists including Chris James, founder and chief investment officer of investment firm Engine No. 1 LP, and Cynthia Hansen, head of gas transmission and midstream at Enbridge Inc., see developing more infrastructure, particularly natural gas, as the way to bring down utility bills as well as meet demand from data centers supporting artificial intelligence.

Article content

States such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, Louisiana and Texas are well positioned to add more gas infrastructure as interest from data center developers increases because of abundant supply and friendly regulatory environment, Hansen said. “It’s your supply as well as your permitting and your ability to build out,” Hansen added.

In the short term, low prices stand to squeeze some gas producers as they try to meet demand growth from liquefied natural gas exports and AI power loads and build more infrastructure.

Article content

“In the US, we believe the marginal producer is going to need around $3.50 gas price to break even,” Rice said. To generate a 10% return on enterprise value, “marginal cost of supply is going to need gas between $4 to $5 to justify the activity that’s coming out here,” Rice added.

National Grid is undertaking a 28-day statutory pre-application consultation, ahead of submitting four planning applications to both Gwynedd Council and Eryri National Park Authority.

Today, Thursday 18 September, National Grid begins four pre-application consultations on proposals to reinforce and refurbish the existing electricity network between Pentir and Trawsfynydd. The consultations are open until Wednesday 15 October.

The way electricity is generated in the UK is changing rapidly to a cleaner, more affordable and more secure energy system for the future. To meet rising energy demand National Grid needs to reinforce and refurbish the existing electricity network between Pentir and Trawsfynydd in North Wales. These upgrades will help relieve pressure on the existing network, support the Welsh government’s energy security and clean power goals, and reduce constraint costs - which are the extra costs added to bills when there is not enough grid capacity to move power where it is needed.

The project is part of the Great Grid Upgrade, the largest overhaul of the electricity grid in generations, and will help keep the network secure and resilient by enabling more clean energy to be delivered to homes and businesses.

The consultations follow a series of public information events National Grid held in May, which gave local people an early opportunity to see its plans, ask questions and meet the project team.

Suzanne Crouch, Portfolio Director for Pentir to Trawsfynydd, said:

“We will take into consideration the feedback received during this pre-application consultation to help refine our proposals before submitting our planning applications to Cyngor Gwynedd and Eryri National Park later this year.

“To meet rising electricity demand and allow new sources of clean, home-grown energy to reach homes and businesses, we need to reinforce and refurbish the existing electricity network between Pentir and Trawsfynydd. This will help to make our energy supply more secure, independent and deliver long-term benefits to bill payers.”

The statutory 28-day consultations give consultees the opportunity to feedback on the draft planning applications for the following four main elements of the project:

Installing new and replacement underground cables and other equipment within the existing substation site at Pentir

Replacing 5.8km of underground cables that run beneath the Glaslyn Estuary at Porthmadog from Wern to Minffordd

Constructing a new substation south of Bryncir

Installing new and replacement underground cables and other equipment within the existing substation site at Trawsfynydd.

Notices with information about the consultations are also being displayed on the application sites, and the draft applications are available to view on the National Grid website at www.nationalgrid.com/Pentir-Trawsfynydd

Following consultation National Grid will carefully consider the comments received as it finalises its planning applications, prior to submission to Cyngor Gwynedd and Eryri National Park Authority later this year.

Under the CWA, Michigan has assumed responsibility for the day-to-day protection, management and restoration of wetlands.
We must have a comprehensive, national approach to clean water protection.","This summer has been marked by severe flooding across our country, from New Mexicoto New York City to North Carolina to Texas, where a devastating flash flood killed more than 130people, including 37 children.

This year, the U.S. has seen reports of flooding double the average over the last two decades, and flood deaths last year were well above the 25-year average. As climate change worsens and FEMA is gutted, we are likely to see even more severe floods and even worse devastating impacts that destroy more homes and claim more lives.

Fortunately, there’s a natural solution right around us that helps offset some of the worst andmost devastating consequences of severe events -- our wetlands. Wetlands are criticallyecologically important. They purify polluted waters, provide habitats for fish and wildlife andcombat erosion.

They also act as natural sponges: during periods of intense rainfall, wetland soil can absorb, trap and then slowly release excess water over time. One acre of wetlands can store as much as 1.5 million gallons of floodwater with no human intervention; man-made barriers with similar capacities would require expensive construction and extensive maintenance. As a result, wetlands play a vital role in mitigating the severity of flooding. One acre of wetland can help avert roughly $745 in flood damage.

In Michigan, wetlands provide $4.77 billion in flood mitigation benefits annually, and between $68 billion and $159 billion in long-term flood protection benefits. Our wetlands also attract tourism, provide opportunities for recreation and support our fishing and agricultural industries. Protecting them is good economic sense, and it should be a top priority.

However, widespread development across Michigan and nationwide is eroding our wetlands.When wetlands are filled in, drained or paved over with impermeable asphalt and concrete, theground can no longer absorb excess water, and flooding becomes more severe.

Since European settlement, Michigan has lost nearly 50% of its original wetlands. Along the Detroit River,almost 90% have been lost. This environmental degradation limits our state’s ability to withstandextreme weather events and to protect our coastal communities.

For nearly 50 years, the Clean Water Act (CWA) served as an invaluable tool that empowered thefederal and state governments to safeguard and restore America’s waters and wetlands. But overtime, the Supreme Court has eroded this landmark legislation. As a result, our nation has apatchwork of laws that are not based on science, while simultaneously failing to improve areaswhere the CWA fell short, such as providing clear, expeditious permits.

Fortunately, despite devastating loss of wetland acres, Michigan now has a comprehensive set ofprograms to protect our waters and wetlands. The state has opted to oversee its day-to-daywetlands management, an authority provided under the CWA. By doing so, Michiganhas demonstrated how states can lead in protecting clean water even under a weakened federalframework.

Under the CWA, Michigan has assumed responsibility for the day-to-day protection, management and restoration of wetlands. This has benefited the state's environment and public health through flood and storm control; protection of subsurface water resources and groundwater recharge; pollution treatment; erosion prevention and nutrient cycling.

However, not all states have followed this proactive approach and exercised their CWA right. Since water does not recognize state boundaries, Michiganians remain at risk when upstream states fail to do their part in protection. We must have a comprehensive, national approach to clean water protection.

In Congress, I have introduced legislation to help other states follow Michigan’s lead. The Federal-State Partnership for Clean Water Act would establish a grant program to financially assist other states, tribes and localities in protecting, managing or restoring their wetlands, including by overseeing their own wetlands programs, just as Michigan does.

It would provide up to $300 million over four years to participant entities so that they can implementcomprehensive plans to protect and restore their wetlands. It is the first step in the right directionto safeguard our waters and help prevent the devastation of extreme, unmitigated flooding.

Protecting our wetlands protects us. By minimizing the impact of extreme natural disasters, wesave both money and lives. This legislation is an invaluable investment in our communities, ourenvironment and our future.

The Environmental Protection Agency’s “endangerment finding” provided a legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.

Through Sept. 22, the agency is collecting public comments on its proposal to rescind the endangerment finding.

Stanford research shows scientific evidence for greenhouse gases’ damaging effects on people’s health, coastal flooding, and other areas has grown stronger over time.

A key part of the federal government’s legal authority to regulate emissions from vehicles, power plants, and other sources could soon disappear. September 22 is the deadline for public comment on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposal to do away with the endangerment finding. Research by Stanford environmental scientist Chris Field and colleagues shows evidence for climate change’s damaging impacts – such as food insecurity, mass migration, and health problems – has only grown since the finding was established.

“The endangerment finding is the foundation for regulation of greenhouse gases at the federal level,” Field said. “It is not the government’s only tool for tackling climate change, but it is key to a balanced program with both carrots and sticks.”

Here are five things to know about the endangerment finding:

1. The endangerment finding identifies six greenhouse gases as a danger under the Clean Air Act.

In 2009, the EPA issued the Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act – otherwise known as the endangerment finding. Citing a massive body of scientific evidence, the finding singled out six greenhouse gases for the danger they pose to public health and welfare:

· Carbon dioxide

· Methane

· Nitrous oxide

· Hydrofluorocarbons

· Perfluorocarbons

· Sulfur hexafluoride

2. Courts have upheld the finding, which underpins federal limits on climate pollution.

The finding has its origins in a 2007 case, Massachusetts v. EPA , in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that greenhouse gases qualify as pollutants under the Clean Air Act. Because the EPA is required to set limits for damaging pollutants, the court directed the agency to determine whether these gases endanger public health and welfare. The EPA conclusion that six greenhouse gases meet this endangerment criteria unlocked the agency’s authority to regulate emissions from cars, trucks, and power plants. Although industry groups challenged the finding, a district court upheld it, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review it. Since then, the finding has provided the legal foundation for federal climate action.

3. Regulatory signals influence consumer choices and corporate investment.

The endangerment finding not only enables regulations but makes clear that the U.S. government is serious about cutting emissions, according to Field.

“It provides an indication that dealing with climate change is important for individuals when they think about a vehicle purchase or home heating system,” Field said. “It also sends a clear market signal. When companies know the government is serious about cutting emissions, they invest in innovation– better vehicles, cleaner fuels, more efficient appliances. That kind of policy certainty drives progress.”

4. Evidence of climate-related health and welfare risks in the United States has strengthened since 2009.

Since 2009, the scientific evidence for endangerment has only strengthened, according to Stanford research that finds climate change is driving more severe heat waves, larger wildfires and more wildfire smoke-related deaths, rising seas, growing food insecurity, and a range of health problems.

Together with Stanford climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh and Woods Hole Research Center president Philip Duffy, Field led a 2018 study showing that since the endangerment finding was established, scientific evidence has increased “dramatically” for each climate change impact noted in the endangerment finding. Those areas ranged from increased disease rates to coastal flooding in the original report. The 2018 study added to the list of understood negative impacts in the U.S. to include increased dangers from ocean acidification, effects on national security and economic well-being, and threats from violence.

A 2019 study Field coauthored estimated climate change had influenced as much as 20% of armed conflict risk over previous last century, and that the influence would likely increase significantly.

Most recently, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine put out a report

Sept 17 revisiting evidence for health threats from greenhouse gases, and declaring that the basis for the endangerment finding has “stood the test of time.” Michele Barry, the senior associate dean of global health in the Stanford School of Medicine, was on the committee that issued the report.

5. Higher emissions raise risks in the U.S. and abroad.

Without the endangerment finding, the U.S. would have fewer tools to curb emissions, leaving Americans more exposed to climate damages, according to Field. That could mean more cases of asthma and heart disease linked to poor air quality, higher food prices from climate-stressed crops, and economic losses as U.S. companies fall behind in global clean-tech markets.

Among other economic impacts of eliminating the endangerment finding, U.S. automakers could lose their edge, Field said. “Taking the foot off the accelerator on developing compelling electric vehicle options means the best ones will be Chinese vehicles, and American carmakers will struggle to compete,” he said. “In the long run, it's clear what direction the world is headed, and it's clear that U.S. companies are already falling behind.”

The impacts would not stop at America’s borders, according to Field: climate instability abroad could lead to a host of impacts in the U.S., including increased conflict and disruptions in trade with other countries. “A world with massive amounts of climate change is going to have millions of climate migrants. It's going to have regional conflicts driven by climate change, terrible conditions for markets for U.S. goods or suppliers of raw materials, and conflicts that eventually reach our shores or involve our forces. We ignore global impacts at our peril.”",https://woods.stanford.edu/sites/woods/files/styles/large/public/media/image/hartmut_kosig_istock_0.jpg?itok=GJu1JMdE,N,,2025-09-18 23:00:21.010213

Pilcher, Vanessa Miller",,,,,https://www.thegazette.com/environment-nature/iowa-is-at-risk-of-losing-most-of-its-water-quality-sensors-heres-why-that-matters/,"IOWA CITY — Time has run out on a short-term plan to continue funding a network of sensors that monitors the water quality in Iowa’s rivers and streams.
The Iowa Water Quality Information System — or Iowa WQIS — combines data from sensors deployed by the University of Iowa, U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The Iowa WQIS network has water sensors deployed throughout the state, working all day, every day to measure nitrate and phosphorus in the water.
“The current interest in the Office of Water at EPA is not interested in water quality monitoring in Iowa,” Weber said.
“We need more information about Iowa water quality, not less.","IOWA CITY — Time has run out on a short-term plan to continue funding a network of sensors that monitors the water quality in Iowa’s rivers and streams. Unless new funding can be secured, dozens of sensors will be taken offline next year, eliminating the ability to measure nitrate and phosphorus to see if conservation practices are working.

The Iowa Water Quality Information System — or Iowa WQIS — combines data from sensors deployed by the University of Iowa, U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The UI sensors have been funded by Iowa State University’s Nutrient Research Center. In 2023, the UI sensor network received $375,000 from ISU, with a commitment to increase that funding to $500,000.

However, in May of that year, the Iowa Legislature passed and Gov. Kim Reynolds signed Senate File 558, a budget bill for agriculture, natural resources and environmental protection. The bill, among other things, shifted $500,000 — one-third of the ISU Center’s previous state appropriation of about $1.5 million — to a water quality program in the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.

Rather than back out of its commitment to allocate money to UI and the WQIS, Nutrient Center leadership announced they would take on some of the losses at ISU rather than zero out support for the sensors.

Larry Weber, director of hydroscience and engineering in the College of Engineering at UI, said the state budget cut reduced funding to the sensor program and, as a result, fewer sensors are being deployed.

In 2024, the number of UI sensors was reduced from 75 to 65, and this year it’s down to 60.

“Then next year, if we did not find replacement funds by the first of July (2026), then we'll pull all of the sensors out, and we'll go from 75 to 65 to zero,” Weber said.

If the university’s portion of the WQIS network is cut, Weber said the USGS sensors still will be deployed because they’re operated by the federal agency.

Tom Stoeffler, an environmental field associate with the IIHR-Hydroscience & Engineering Department at the University of Iowa, said the USDA sensors likely would remain deployed as well.

How does the sensor program work?

The Iowa WQIS network has water sensors deployed throughout the state, working all day, every day to measure nitrate and phosphorus in the water. Readings are taken every five minutes, and the senors send their data to the database every 15 minutes.

“So, you're getting as close to real-time,” Stoeffler said.

Stoeffler said real-time measurements of nitrate levels is helpful, especially during rain events, because researchers can measure upticks of nitrate from runoff and see how the nitrate is moving through the water.

Jordan Barnett, an environmental research assistant with IIHR, said there is a sensor in every main Iowa river that goes into the Missouri or Mississippi rivers.

Stoeffler said some of the sensors remain in the water year-round, but most are removed during the winter months.

“It's when the ice breaks up in the spring and starts going down, it starts tearing sensors,” he said.

The sensor at Waterworks Prairie Park in Iowa City, near the University of Iowa campus, is deployed all year. Stoeffler said that’s because the Coralville dam upstream from the site keeps the water in the river from freezing.

He said the sensors are powered by a 12-volt battery and a 20-watt solar panel near the river’s bank.

Marty St. Clair, research scientist with UI’s IIHR — Hydroscience and Engineering Department, said each winter the sensors are taken back to their manufacturer to be recalibrated and rehabilitated. That annual upkeep costs about $1,200 per sensor.

Looking for a new funding pool

Weber said his team needs to raise about $600,000 annually to continue the program.

“We're living in an inflationary economy, the costs of everything are going up,” he said.

He added that some sensors need to be replaced, and other equipment needs to be upgraded too.

But the biggest expense is staffing, Weber said.

Taking sensors out of the rivers and streams, fixing them for the next year, and redeploying them takes a significant amount of time since the sensors are scatters throughout the state.

“Then all summer long we're going out and taking grab samples at the sensor location sites and doing analysis to make sure that the sensors are reporting accurately,” Weber said.

Weber said he and his team have a “no stone unturned approach” to finding a funding source to keep the network of sensors deployed, but they’re finding that cuts to federal spending have affected funders’ ability and willingness to fund a water quality project.

“There are other foundations and other private individuals that could support things like this, but in I would say all conversations with those foundations or those individuals, there's so much pressure on our social system today that they're finding the need to help support families, with food assistance needs, perhaps with immigration issues and help support families with health issues and medical needs,” Weber said. “When we think about something like a water sensor network, they don't want to fund something that should be the responsibility of our state or federal government.”

Representatives of WQIS also have met with an official from the EPA. Weber said they spoke with Bruno Pigott, who was acting administrator of the Office of Water for the Environmental Protection Agency last year.

“We told him about the network, the importance of it, the value of it, and asked him very directly, ‘Mr. Pigott, we need your help,’” Weber said.

Pigott’s EPA appointment was under former President Joe Biden’s administration. He was not reappointed under the Trump administration.

“The current interest in the Office of Water at EPA is not interested in water quality monitoring in Iowa,” Weber said.

Impacts of the shrinking program

Colleen Fowle, water program director with the Iowa Environmental Council, said if UI’s portion of the water sensors network disappears, there will be fewer data points throughout the state.

“We need more information about Iowa water quality, not less. The decision to remove funding from a critically important monitoring system is shortsighted and it hurts all Iowans by reducing access to information that has big implications on our public health,” Fowle said. “Why would Iowa ever want to reduce or remove residents’ access to data about the quality and safety of their own water?”

Fowle said the cuts come at a time when the public is “demanding more accountability for water quality” across the state.

“Water monitoring is the very first step in determining the source and scale of pollution,” she said. “Defunding the water sensor system conceals this information from the public. Iowans deserve to know what is in our water.”

St. Clair, at IIHR, said while some Iowans may dig through water quality databases on their own, the network has been “the most visible way people can in one glance” see what the nitrate levels are in their area.

When you look at the map you “see the red, yellow, green, and can get some sense immediately of what's going on with respect to nitrate in the state,” St. Clair said. “I occasionally get emails from people in public just saying, ‘Thank you, but is there any way we could get a sensor in our area?’ And it's like, well, I wish we could because I feel like the public deserves to know what's going on in their surface waters.”

Approximately 120 staff members will be laid off, including 75 based in North Carolina, where RTI has approximately 2,000 employees. Workers were notified Thursday and will lose their jobs by early October. RTI has about 6,000 employees working in 90 countries around the world.

RTI International has already cut about 500 jobs since March. That month it announced 340 U.S.-based layoffs, including 177 in North Carolina. In February, RTI announced “temporary layoffs of 226 U.S.-based workers, including 61 in North Carolina. RTI also filed a Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification (WARN) with the state Department of Commerce in March, announcing 276 job cuts in Durham, although those losses were part of the other job cuts.

RTI’s plans announced Thursday are “the next step in implementing our plan to adapt the institute for long-term strength and growth,” according to the release.

“RTI’s next chapter will demand bold thinking and strategic agility. We’re realigning our organization to lead with greater speed, enhanced collaboration, and tightened client focus, while ensuring that our scientific impact is amplified. We’ve got lots of new leaders in expanded roles and are creating new opportunities for our staff to thrive. I’m as optimistic as I’ve even been about RTI’s future,” RTI’s President and CEO Tim J. Gabel said in a statement.

The nonprofit research institute was formed in 1958 to promote research from the Triangle’s three major universities, Duke, UNC Chapel Hill and NC State. It was the first employer at Research Triangle Park, which is split between Durham and Wake counties.

Though initially a North Carolina-driven institution, the group has become heavily reliant on federal funding, including about 84% of its revenue in 2022 and 2023. RTI International received about $2.3 billion from the federal US Agency for International Development, or USAID, for nonmilitary foreign assistance between 2013 and 2022, the sixth most among all organizations, the News & Observer of Raleigh has reported.

That heavy reliance on federal funding made it vulnerable to cost-cutting efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency, which had been led by Elon Musk at the start of President Donald Trump’s second term.

Staff changes include three senior leaders taking on new roles effective Oct. 1. Those changes are:

Angela Quick was named leader and senior vice president for the new Solutions unit, which will be tasked with solving complex client challenges. Quick joined RTI in 2016 and currently leads the Education Practice Area

Nicole Barnes was named leader and senior vice president for the new Growth unit, which will lead business expansion in the public and commercial sectors. Barnes has been with RTI for 22 years, most recently leading the Sustainable Growth and Resilience unit as a municipal finance adviser.

Eric Otto Johnson will provide strategic scientific leadership to advance research excellence as Chief Science Officer. Johnson joined RTI in 2006, most recently serving as chair of the RTI Fellow Program.

The reorganization aims to help RTI deliver science-based value while expanding into new markets; engage clients proactively; and use modern technology to enhance the speed and effectiveness of its projects , according to the release.

Nationally, data centers totaling 5,242.5 megawatts were under construction in the first half of the year, down 17.4 percent from 6,350.1 megawatts in 2024, according to the brokerage.

Data center investments fell by more than half in the first six months of 2025 to less than $1 billion, CBRE reported.

“This slowdown was largely the result of delayed decision-making by investors due to economic uncertainty, geopolitical conflicts and power supply challenges,” the brokerage stated.

Companies including Microsoft and Amazon Web Services have paused or slowed their data center growth this year, while other large operators continue to expand.

Despite the constraints, demand remains strong, said Kristin Hammond, a CBRE senior vice president and broker based in Portland, Oregon.

“The infrastructure has now been outpaced by the construction of facilities,” she said. “There’s no use to having the facility if you don’t have the power poles to service it.”

The Twin Cities is among the markets seeing growth for data center operators, in part due to power and land availability, according to John McWilliams, head of Data Center Insights at Cushman & Wakefield.

Minneapolis had 65.1 megawatts of data center inventory in the first half of the year, per the CBRE data. Northern Virginia remains by far the nation’s largest data center market.

Only two data center projects, including Meta’s 140-megawatt effort in Rosemount, are currently under construction, but more than 701 megawatts are in the planning stages, according to a Cushman & Wakefield report.

The development pipeline includes projects in Rosemount, Chaska, Farmington, Shakopee, Apple Valley, Brooklyn Park and Cannon Falls, said John McWilliams, head of Data Center Insights at Cushman & Wakefield and the author of the report.

Net absorption in the first half of the year totaled 13.2 megawatts in the Minneapolis market.

Oregon remains a popular destination for data center operators, in part due to geography, relatively cheap energy and a skilled high-tech construction workforce.

Increasingly, Oregon subcontractors are being sought for data center projects in other states, said Gabe Fox, chief estimator for Mortenson in Portland.

“We have a really strong labor force that’s highly technical, which is not always the same in other markets,” he said. “We have some of the best sheet metal companies and electrical companies here in the Northwest. These companies are being sought after to bring their expertise. … They’re definitely staying busy.”

In addition to contractors’ abilities to build high-tech projects, Portland General Electric’s experience powering semiconductor facilities has given it a leg up in providing electricity to data centers, Hammond said.

“PGE has been very savvy about it,” she said.

PGE is seeking additional energy sources to alleviate the power crunch. The company in 2023 issued a request for proposals for new power sources. Then in September 2024, PGE recommended a list of chosen projects to the Oregon Public Utility Commission. PGE is now working with the bidders to update their pricing following the passage of the federal budget bill.

PGE plans to finalize contracts this year, with projects expected to come into service by the end of 2027, the utility disclosed in July.

PGE CEO and President Maria Pope told investors during a July 25 call that the company is “seeing sustained growth from data center and high-tech customers — over 16% compared to the same quarter last year.”

The Construction Worker Conundrum

This fall, as high school graduates from the Class of 2025 begin college, it’s a reminder that the share of students pursuing higher education has crept steadily upward for more than two generations—driven by the deeply ingrained belief, however outdated, that the only path to a meaningful career and middle-class security runs through the halls of academia.

Today, more business leaders, government officials, and students are recognizing that this is not the case. While a degree is essential for certain professions, the college-or-bust mentality has discouraged students from seeking alternatives that are equally vital to the health of our nation—namely the skilled trades. From my vantage point in the construction industry, this mindset shift couldn’t come at a better time, as the demand for new infrastructure has never been greater.

No Progress Without Builders

Every major technological invention, breakthrough, and leap in human progress starts with the people who build the infrastructure behind it. For example, as recent headlines make clear, artificial intelligence (AI) promises unprecedented productivity gains and life-saving breakthroughs—but only if we can build and power the data centers that drive it. That means more electrical power assets, more semiconductor factories, more transportation systems, more critical minerals for electrification, and more supporting infrastructure—all of which rely on assets built from concrete, steel, pipe, equipment, cables, and so on.

Without enough tradespeople, these mission-critical projects could face lengthy delays or fail to get off the ground at all. Rebuilding America’s construction workforce is no longer optional—it’s a national imperative.

At Bechtel, we’ve long recognized this, investing in changing perceptions of the industry and reigniting interest in the trades. And as the need for construction workers grows, we’re proud to share some of the ways we’re bringing more people into the fold.

Restoring Prestige to the Profession by Supporting Workers

Since time immemorial, builders have made life as we know it possible. They’ve turned scientists’ and engineers’ boldest ideas into physical realities—from the Roman aqueducts to the Hoover Dam, the interstate highway system, and even the internet.

By that logic, construction workers deserve the same respect we extend to military service members, first responders, or today’s top innovators for their contributions to society. Yet too often, the opposite has been true.

For decades construction work has been characterized as low-skilled, low-paid work—“a consolation” for those without college degrees. That view belongs to a bygone era.

Today’s reality is very different—and it must be recognized as such. At Bechtel, we make sure our culture reflects that. We call our builders “craft professionals,” because that’s exactly what they are: highly skilled experts who are as critical to our success as our engineers and project managers. They are the heart of our business, and we acknowledge that by embedding them into every part of our company.

Making Construction a Career of Choice

Advances in technology and the advent of much-needed regulations have made construction work safer, more productive, and more interesting—not to mention lucrative. Take welding: highly skilled welders at the beginning of their careers can earn $100,000 annually—without the crushing burden of student debt that weighs down so many of their college-graduate peers.

To that end, we make sure our construction jobs aren’t just jobs, but careers on which people can support their families. That means offering competitive wages, advanced training, robust benefits, paid vacation, and clear advancement pathways. It’s worth noting that as AI threatens to upend knowledge work, the stability of a career in construction will become an even stronger selling point.

Of course, construction, while safe, is demanding work with stressors that differ from office jobs. If the industry wants more workers, we must be more mindful in caring for their physical and mental health. That’s why Bechtel has made mental health a core part of our broader safety program. Not only do we prioritize safety and wellbeing above all, but we believe mental health belongs under the umbrella of workplace safety across our industry—and every industry.

We’ve seen these efforts pay off. Bechtel has been able to avoid many of the labor constraints plaguing the industry. We currently have more than 15,000 craft professionals working on our LNG projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast—proof that when good opportunities arise, people seize them.

Maximizing the Construction Talent Pool

To increase the construction workforce nationally—and on a timeline that meets the urgency of the moment—we must widen the pool of potential American talent. Failure to do so risks irrevocably weakening our industrial base. Worse yet, we’ll see more foreign firms, with foreign workers in tow, trying to compete for construction projects on American soil—which will only serve to stunt the U.S. labor force, as well as the local economies that depend on these jobs.

The claim that there simply aren’t enough American construction workers is a convenient excuse. Bechtel has shown otherwise. Granted, foreign labor—when it’s legal and deployed sparingly as a stopgap—is sometimes necessary. But the real solution is to work with communities, unions, and other partners to highlight career opportunities in construction and equip people with the skills they need to fill these roles.

At Bechtel, we’ve found success partnering with local high schools and colleges to create pathways into construction through training programs. We’ve also teamed up with organizations that connect with local workers and underrepresented groups. For instance, at Plant Vogtle, we partnered with the National Building Trades Unions to bring on apprentices and with the nonprofit Helmets to Hardhats to attract veterans. In the end, more than 30% of our hires were veterans and reservists, and over 40% of our apprentices were women.

Outreach to women is particularly important when you consider that, in the U.S., women comprise nearly 50 percent of the workforce but hold just 4 percent of construction jobs. Attracting new workers to the profession becomes a lot harder if we only draw from half the adult population.

The education sector has a role to play, too. Beginning in 2026, Pell Grants will cover vocational training, hopefully spurring more interest among prospective students. The next challenge is ensuring high schools, community colleges, and industry partners have the capacity to create strong vocational programs that prepare the next generation of builders. Here too, it’s incumbent on companies within our industry to broker partnerships and collaborations across these institutions.

Improving How Construction Projects Are Delivered

Contrary to popular belief, construction is far from a stagnant profession. While studies note its productivity hasn’t risen as quickly as other industries, that view misses the real story.

Continuous innovation and investment have improved the whole construction ecosystem. Environmental and social requirements run through the entire value chain, while quality standards and material traceability are central to today’s construction practice. Combined with increased safety standards, all of these improvements have increased the value of what construction delivers while steadily raising productivity.

Industry analysts also tend to separate the productivity of construction from the productivity that construction enables. Construction drives massive gains across the entire economy—building the factories, power plants, and data centers that make breakthroughs possible.

To keep pace with America’s needs, Bechtel is pushing the industry forward by embracing tools like digital delivery, modularization, real-time data analytics, and yes, AI. This not only makes construction more rewarding and exciting for young people—it unlocks growth for the nation as a whole.

Securing America’s Future, One Builder at a Time

So much of our future quite literally rests on concrete, steel, pipe, and wire—and on the men and women with the skills to turn those raw materials into infrastructure. Construction workers have always risen to the occasion. As technology, regulations, and ways of working have changed, they’ve improved safety, quality, and productivity in turn.

As millions of American students return to school and begin to envision a career, Bechtel will continue to ensure they know that construction can be one of the brightest paths forward. By becoming builders, they secure their own future—and our nation’s.

My hope is that Americans reconsider their own perceptions of the construction field and the people who choose to join it. As society evolves to see vocational training and the trades as integral to our shared success, more people—including prospective workers—will view this profession for what it is: shaping the world on the grandest scale and in millions of small ways that make ordinary life better.

The Texas Climate Jobs Project released a new report that shows ways Austin could create hundreds of local jobs and save millions in energy costs by decarbonizing buildings.

The report states that ""buildings currently account for 40% of [carbon] emissions and energy costs worldwide."" By installing solar panels to 104 city-owned buildings, it could significantly alleviate those two factors and save up to $4.42 million in annual savings.

Another avenue that's being explored is investing in projects like HVAC repairs, pipe replacements and window upgrades. According to the report, those upgrades could save the facilities between $1.63 and $2.87 million every year.

""Unfortunately, energy is becoming more expensive,"" said Jeremy Hendricks, Secretary Treasurer of Laborers' International Union of North America (LiUNA) Local 1095. ""We're having rolling blackouts in really high demand days, and this is really is a way to supplement that energy usage and make sure that we're saving money at a time when the state is constricting the city's ability to really raise revenue.""

The project would also create 303 local jobs through a union contract.

During a tour Thursday, KVUE was welcomed into the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers [IBEW Local 520], to get a first-hand look at the facility where workers would train to be part of the projects.

""We are ready to provide the city with the best highly skilled craftspeople available,"" said IBEW Local 520 business manager Ben Brenneman. ""Our workers have more issues with heat stress; it becomes more dangerous every year; we all know it's happening and something needs to be done.""

Council Member Ryan Alter said they hope to get as many panels on city buildings in 2026. However, the cost of getting them on could be a problem as the city deals with federal funding cuts and a tight budget.

""This will be millions of dollars in investments in the actual panels themselves, but that will be fully recouped within six or seven years,"" said Alter.",https://media.kvue.com/assets/KVUE/images/7cf84505-7fdf-4d67-9b8d-793a6185a9be/20250918T232442/7cf84505-7fdf-4d67-9b8d-793a6185a9be_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 20:03:33.149953

I reached out to Kates-Garnick after I reported on the circumstances surrounding a major solar project cancellation in the Western Massachusetts town of Shutesbury, which I believe was indicative of the weakening hand developers have in conflicts with activists on the ground. I sought to best understand how folks enmeshed in the state’s decarbonization goals felt about what was happening to local renewables development in light of the de facto repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean electricity tax credit.

Of course, like anyone in Massachusetts, Kates-Garnick was blunt about the situation: it’s quite bad.

The following conversation was lightly edited for clarity.

So to start, how do you feel about the state’s odds of meeting its climate goals?

My own assumption is that it was going to be tough before all of the federal changes to meet those goals. They were highly ambitious and I really support the ambition, but now it’s going to be really, really difficult to meet the clean energy goals. It’s not that we shouldn't work hard to meet them but we have to understand that in this current state of affairs, the obstacles are going to be much greater. But when you take offshore wind off the table, the challenge becomes even more enormous.

Why is offshore wind necessary to meet the state’s climate targets?

It’s because it is a large resource that would be coming into the grid over a period of time. The significance is in the megawatts, the size and scale. It was particularly important and we’re land constrained in New England. And all of the sudden you’re taking such a large opportunity in generation off the table.

We can do energy efficiency and we can do solar but as you know from the Shutesbury situation, land is at a premium. Location – you can’t site onshore wind here. We tried really hard under former Governor Deval Patrick and that hit a lot of obstacles. So offshore wind is critical to meeting those goals.

Help me understand the conflicts over this land constraint – is Shutesbury an aberration or a bit of a tale of the tape of the problems here?

The Shutesbury situation reflects how we’re not a large geographical area. We’re not Texas. We can put solar on roofs but you need larger solar installations. We’ve encouraged the solar industry as much as possible. But the area is limited. Wind off the coast provided an alternative that was realistic and not a science experiment.

How much of this problem is state permitting? It feels like there is some land in a space like Massachusetts but people don’t want to use it for this.

Any time you try to put energy infrastructure into New England – whether it's a gas pipeline or a solar installation – there’s a lot of local environmental and permitting regulations that can really hold up a project. One of the good things Massachusetts has done is we made energy permitting easier and went through a permitting reform. We have an Energy Facility Siting Council.

There’s still ways local interests can hold up projects. I think that’s just a fact of life in New England.

So that’s why offshore wind is so important to New England.

It becomes more challenging. From a resource perspective, we are at the end of the fossil fuel pipeline. The middle Atlantic has more gas pipelines coming into it than we do in New England. Offshore wind represented a great opportunity for us.

With respect to the state permitting, it is possible to now overcome some local regulations in state permitting in ways that weren’t possible before. We did address permitting reform in Massachusetts. The Energy Facility Siting Council has played a great, important role in having that happen and [towns] can be overruled to a certain extent.

Well, but it sounds like what you’re saying is that the conflicts will still exist because land is at a premium?

Yeah. And local control will always play a role in that.

The Commonwealth signed permitting reform into law in 2024 and in that there were comprehensive reforms to the process for clean energy infrastructure. This has improved siting. But again that doesn’t always ensure a project will be permitted and you can easily find ways to hold them up.

What gives you hope for the future? Where’s the light at the end of the tunnel for you?

I think that by facilitating permitting reform and also participation – local participation – as early as possible in the stages of projects… I think this is where the key lies. You can pass regulations but a lot of it has to do with doing the work ahead of time on your project and satisfying the local community so you don’t have a bigger fight on your hands.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTYxMzU5OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgwNTMxOTc0M30.dNUnRzeYLSuKrpitApylBMT-bxMpjuZ5hHbt4yfFaeU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=40%2C0%2C40%2C0,N,,2025-09-19 00:59:32.037099

Since 2009, the Endangerment Finding has required EPA to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Its recission would pose a serious threat to public health. Blunt Rochester is a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

“Your recommendation to rescind the Endangerment Finding is in direct conflict with scientific evidence—and puts the health and welfare of our constituents at risk,” wrote the lawmakers. “Without regulating GHG emissions, more Americans will feel the impacts of climate-fueled extreme weather events, increased levels of ground-level ozone and particulate matter, and a spike in vector-borne diseases.”

Analyses indicate that heavier and more frequent precipitation will increase and threaten Delaware’s nearly $8 billion agriculture industry. Increased storm events and extreme tides are already causing saltwater intrusion, degrading soil quality, and reducing corn and soy yields for Delaware farmers.”

“[The Endangerment Finding’s] rescission will put more communities at risk from environmental and climate-related health threats—and all too often the communities that will suffer the most from these risks are communities already overburdened with environmental harms,” concluded the lawmakers. “Delawareans and all communities, including our future generations, deserve an environment that supports their health and welfare. We urge you to maintain the 2009 Endangerment Finding and protect Delawareans and all communities across the country.”

The Delaware delegation’s full letter can be found here and below:

Dear Administrator Zeldin,

We are writing in response to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed rule to reconsider the 2009 Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding and Greenhouse Gas Vehicle Standards. For sixteen years, the Endangerment Finding has required EPA to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. By rescinding the Endangerment Finding, EPA would remove its authority to set standards for GHG emissions, risking public health. We strongly urge you to maintain the 2009 Endangerment Finding and Greenhouse Gas Vehicle standards to protect the public health and welfare of all Delawareans and all communities across the country.

The Clean Air Act (CAA) requires EPA to regulate air pollutants that are reasonably “anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.”In Massachusetts v. EPA (2007), the U.S. Supreme Court found that GHG emissions are air pollutants under the CAA, and mandated that EPA make a determination on whether GHG emissions endanger public health and welfare, thus requiring regulation. As a response to that mandate, the EPA issued the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which concluded that “elevated concentrations of six greenhouse gases in the atmosphere—carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride—endanger the public health and welfare of current and future generations.” It also found “that the combined emissions of greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines” pose a threat to public health and welfare. Supporting the Endangerment Finding was an overwhelming record of scientific evidence that GHG emissions do affect the public health and welfare of Americans by contributing to climate change. Since 2009, federal courts have repeatedly upheld the scientific basis of the Endangerment Finding.

That scientific evidence for the Endangerment Finding continues to grow. Your recommendation to rescind the Endangerment Finding is in direct conflict with scientific evidence—and puts the health and welfare of our constituents at risk. Without regulating GHG emissions, more Americans will feel the impacts of climate-fueled extreme weather events, increased levels of ground-level ozone and particulate matter, and a spike in vector-borne diseases.

Delaware is already feeling the effects of climate change. As the state with the lowest mean elevation, Delaware’s coastline faces extreme risks from sea level rise, a direct result of climate change. Sea levels have risen more than one foot since 1900 and are expected to rise an additional 9 to 23 inches by 2050. By the end of the century, 8 to 11 percent of Delaware could be underwater, including 99 percent of Sussex County’s saltmarshes. Sea level rise and effects of climate change are expected to have a devastating impact on local businesses, especially Delaware’s $4.7 billion tourism industry, and will cause over $69 billion in economic losses for the state by the end of the century. Analyses indicate that heavier and more frequent precipitation will increase and threaten Delaware’s nearly $8 billion agriculture industry. Increased storm events and extreme tides are already causing saltwater intrusion, degrading soil quality, and reducing corn and soy yields for Delaware farmers.

Extreme weather events are occurring at an accelerating rate due to climate change, creating growing safety and health concerns for Delaware residents. In the last five years, Delaware residents have experienced 8 extreme weather events that each caused $1 billion or more in damages, totaling over $110 billion, and led to at least 247 lives lost in the Mid-Atlantic region. Extreme storms and increased precipitation will lead to more flooding, as average precipitation is expected to increase by 10 percent by the next century. While Lewes, Delaware experienced nine days of flooding in 2019, the town is expected to experience between 50 to 135 high tide flood events annually by 2050. It’s not just our coastal communities that are feeling the effects of climate-fueled extreme weather events. During Hurricane Sandy, the Broadkill River surged, flooding local businesses across downtown Milton, Delaware.

In your confirmation hearing, you stated that EPA’s “mission is simple but essential, [it’s] to protect human health and the environment.” Your reported recommendation to rescind the Endangerment Finding is in direct contradiction with this mission. It also negates your commitment to follow the science. Rescinding the Endangerment Finding is not just detrimental to our climate; it is also a threat to public health. For example, experts report that air pollution is harmful and can lead to wheezing and coughing, asthma attacks, and even lung cancer, which leads to increased healthcare costs. Its rescission will put more communities at risk from environmental and climate-related health threats—and all too often the communities that will suffer the most from these risks are communities already overburdened with environmental harms. Delawareans and all communities, including our future generations, deserve an environment that supports their health and welfare. We urge you to maintain the 2009 Endangerment Finding and protect Delawareans and all communities across the country.

Sincerely,

Ford to replace gas-powered SUVs with less expensive, new EV line

By KEVIN WEAKS

With the current administration doing away with tax credits on electric vehicle purchases, it might seem like a head-scratcher why Ford Motor Co. is discontinuing production of two popular gas-powered models to make room for a new line of cheaper EVs, including a midsize pickup that Ford says will be as quick as a Mustang.

Last month Ford announced it would build a new midsize electric truck which is expected to launch in 2027 and cost around $30,000. That’s great news for buyers who are looking for an affordable EV pickup, opines Edmunds.com, but it’s bad news for the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair.

It’s all part of a grand plan that is built on Ford’s $5 billion “Universal EV Production System” which will go online this fall at the company’s production facility in Louisville, Ky., where the Escape and Corsair are currently built and at Ford’s Blue Oval Battery Park in Michigan. The system, which replaces the traditional assembly line with a tree-like arrangement, will simplify the assembly of vehicles built on the company’s new electric vehicle architecture. Production will stop for Escape and Corsair later this year.

Ford is taking a calculated risk that the idea of a relatively inexpensive line of electric vehicles will offset the killing of two popular entry-level models that are still selling well. In fact, the Escape was Ford’s second-best-selling SUV last year. Ford sold 133,324 Escapes in 2024, a 4.2 percent increase in sales compared to 2023. The Lincoln Corsair sold 27,513, a decline from the previous year, but up four percent in first quarter 2025. Both vehicles have stiff competition. The Escape crossover is challenged by the Chevrolet Equinox, Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and others, while the Corsair competes with luxury class SUVs including the Buick Envision and Cadillac XT4, as well as similarly priced Lexus, Audi and Volvo models.

So you have to wonder if this new line of cheap Ford EVs will dazzle the market so much as to become a game-changer. Ford thinks it will. Meanwhile, buyers looking to get their hands on an Escape or Corsair still have some time.

“We’re going to have enough inventory to sell Escape and Corsair well into 2026,” a Ford spokesperson said, so dealer inventory levels should still be relatively high for the foreseeable future.

Provided its lineup doesn’t change, that means the least-expensive Ford SUVs will be the Bronco Sport and larger Bronco; for Lincoln, that raises the entry point to the brand to the pricier midsize Nautilus. With the exception of the compact Maverick pickup, Ford has been busy removing affordable cars and SUVs from its lineup like the Fiesta, Focus, Fusion and the EcoSport that slotted beneath the Escape.

A “MODEL T MOMENT”

Ford President and CEO Jim Farley recently confirmed that Ford will stop production of the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair after the 2026 model year and gear up for the yet-to-be-named new cheap electric truck and other affordable EVs. Farley called it a “Model T moment.”

“Our Louisville-assembled midsize electric truck on this Universal EV Platform will debut in 2027. It will have a target starting MSRP at about $30,000, roughly the same as the Model T when adjusted for inflation,” Farley said. “As with the Model T, Ford is again betting big on America. In Louisville the reinvention of our company begins in earnest, with the implementation of an innovative manufacturing process to bring this platform to life.”

Ford describes the vehicle as a super affordable, all-electric, hyper-versatile small truck with impressive range that is even capable of powering one’s home in the event of a power outage for up to six days and be quicker than a Mustang EcoBoost from 0 to 60 mph. Ford also notes that it should provide more passenger room than the Toyota RAV4 and offer both a truck bed and a front trunk or “frunk.” According to Farley, it will later adopt various other body styles, including multiple SUVs and maybe even a sedan.

All of this is centered around Ford’s Universal EV platform which will allow Ford to produce vehicles across various segments without massive retooling investments. Both Stellantis and GM have developed scalable EV platforms of their own, so it figures that Ford follows suit. Road and Track magazine says the Blue Oval’s approach will focus on software-defined products, more akin to the likes of Tesla and Rivian.

The platform itself utilizes 20 percent fewer parts than a traditional vehicle, with large uni-castings making up large sections of the cars. The wiring harness for the new vehicles is lighter, for example, which allows Ford to use 25 percent fewer fasteners during production. Even the production line is drastically different. Ford calls it an “assembly tree” as opposed to the traditional assembly setup. In the new paradigm, multiple sections of the vehicle are assembled in parallel before being joined near the end of the process. This means fewer dock-to-dock stops during the assembly process itself, which allows production to move up to 15 percent faster than the current run rate at Louisville Assembly.

Ford Chief EV, Digital, and Design Officer Doug Field even noted that the way the car will be assembled is different, promising that no worker will ever need to contort an entire dashboard or other large interior or powertrain component into a body structure through a door opening again—suggesting that Ford is really looking at changing not only the design, parts sourcing, prototyping and other elements of the vehicle but also upending the way cars have been built for the better part of the last century.

“We transformed the traditional assembly line into a tree with three main branches,” explained Field. “We’ll assemble the front and rear of the vehicle on separate lines. The third branch is the vehicle’s structural battery, which we’ll pre-assemble with seats, consoles, and carpeting. These three branches come together at the end, a process that revolutionizes the factory and simplifies work for our employees.”

A RADICAL APPROACH

So far, Ford hasn’t shown what the new-age Model T will look like beyond some simple line drawings of the truck’s profile, as well as profiles of what appear to be a small SUV, large three-row SUV and a van.

“We took a radical approach to a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that delight customers in every way that matters – design, innovation, flexibility, space, driving pleasure, and cost of ownership – and do it with American workers,” said Farley.

Louisville Assembly is slated for a $2.2 billion investment as part of the initiative and is expected to add around 2,200 jobs to support the upcoming electric truck. The investment will also include a 52,000 square-foot expansion of the facility. BlueOval Battery Park will also receive approximately $3 billion to build the new battery packs, with a similar amount of jobs expected to be added.

Henry Ford’s popularization of the moving assembly line at the Highland Park Assembly Plant more than 100 years ago transformed the face of society, but as the auto industry shifts toward an electrified future, new production and development techniques like the Louisville plant will become more common. Ford is hoping to deliver what no other automaker has been able to: a family of affordable, adaptable electric vehicles that offer multiple body styles for work and play — including for export — and whose long-lifespan Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries will be assembled in America, not imported from China.",https://labortribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Yellow-Pickup.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 21:58:55.368844
,EPA,2025-09-18 23:06:20+00:00,Chemical & Engineering News,"National Academies' climate report supports endangerment finding, contradicting EPA",Leigh Krietsch Boerner,,,,,https://cen.acs.org/environment/greenhouse-gases/National-Academies-climate-report-supports/103/web/2025/09,"But according to the NASEM report released yesterday, there’s more evidence of harm now than in 2009, and the evidence is stronger.
In its proposal to rescind the endangerment finding, the EPA based its scientific justification largely on a US Department of Energy (DOE) report developed by the Climate Working Group and released July 29.
The DOE report has been highly criticized by climate scientists, who say that its conclusions “are either misleading or fundamentally incorrect.” The DOE report amassed over 59,500 comments during its public comment period, which ended Sept. 2.
Instead of reviewing the DOE report, NASEM announced on Aug. 7 that it would conduct an independent, self-funded report on the climate science published since the endangerment finding’s release in 2009.
What the EPA will do with the NASEM report and the other comments refuting the proposal’s science is unclear, Miller says.","The scientific evidence that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions cause harm to human health and welfare “is beyond scientific dispute,” the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) says in a report released Wednesday, directly contradicting statements from the US Environmental Protection Agency.

The EPA recently proposed (PDF) to rescind its endangerment finding, a 2009 report that says GHGs endanger human health and welfare and that forms the scientific and legal basis for regulating GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act. In speaking about the EPA’s proposal, Administrator Lee Zeldin said that evidence of this harm has weakened or been contradicted based on observations since 2009.

But according to the NASEM report released yesterday, there’s more evidence of harm now than in 2009, and the evidence is stronger. “Much of the understanding of climate change that was uncertain or tentative in 2009 is now resolved and new threats have been identified,” the report says.

When asked about the scientific discrepancies between the NASEM report and Zeldin’s comments, EPA press secretary Brigit Hirsch responded that GHG regulations during the administrations of Barack Obama and Joe Biden cost trillions. “As we saw in the 16 intervening years since the Endangerment Finding was made, many of the extremely pessimistic predictions and assumptions EPA relied upon have not materialized as expected,” she says in an email. Hirsch did not respond to C&EN’s repeated attempts at clarification of her statements.

In its proposal to rescind the endangerment finding, the EPA based its scientific justification largely on a US Department of Energy (DOE) report developed by the Climate Working Group and released July 29. Brought together by DOE Secretary Chris Wright, the group’s members were five known climate change denialists, including John Christy and Steve Koonin. The DOE report has been highly criticized by climate scientists, who say that its conclusions “are either misleading or fundamentally incorrect.” The DOE report amassed over 59,500 comments during its public comment period, which ended Sept. 2.

Instead of reviewing the DOE report, NASEM announced on Aug. 7 that it would conduct an independent, self-funded report on the climate science published since the endangerment finding’s release in 2009. “The study was undertaken with the ultimate aim of informing the EPA, following its call for public comments, as it considers the status of the endangerment finding,” Shirley Tilghman, professor emeritus in molecular biology at Princeton University and chair of the NASEM report committee, says in a statement. “We are hopeful that the evidence summarized here shows the strong base of scientific evidence available to inform sound decision-making.”

The group submitted the report as a public comment on the EPA’s proposal to rescind the endangerment finding. As of Sept. 18, the EPA’s proposal has elicited over 105,000 comments. The public comment period ends Sept. 22, and the EPA is scheduled to issue the final rule this month.

The NASEM finished its report in roughly the same amount of time as the Climate Working Group, using the same publicly available body of science, says Andy Miller, former senior science adviser for the EPA’s Office of Research and Development. And the difference in the reports is stark, he says. “In essence, the DOE report said there are some things [in the science] that are uncertain, therefore we don’t know enough to do anything,” Miller says. “Whereas the Academies essentially said we know a lot.”

“Perhaps the most important [thing] to note is that the [National Academy of Sciences] process that led to this Consensus Study Report involves an independent review by experts chosen for their technical expertise,” says Melissa Finucane, vice president of science and innovation at the environmental advocacy group the Union of Concerned Scientists. “This is the type of information that policymakers should rely on to make decisions that affect Americans’ health and prosperity.”

The Donald J. Trump administration has since disbanded the Climate Working Group in response to a lawsuit brought by the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). The groups claim that by not holding public meetings as it prepared its report, the Climate Working Group violated laws about transparency in federal advisory committees. On Sept. 17, a federal judge ruled that even though the Climate Working Group has been dissolved, the federal transparency laws still apply to the group and its report. Members of the group are continuing to work, the EDF says, citing a news report.

What the EPA will do with the NASEM report and the other comments refuting the proposal’s science is unclear, Miller says. “If EPA is going to reverse a decision that has been based on scientific evidence, then the evidence to reverse that decision needs to be at least as strong as that that was originally cited,” he says. That’s been the practice in government scientific decisions in the past, Miller says. “But who knows what’s going to happen now?”

The Business Council for Sustainable Energy, the Clean Energy Business Network, and the American Chemistry Council all declined to comment for this story. The US Chamber of Commerce did not reply to C&EN’s request for comment.","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/National-Academies-of-Science-report-uphold-endangerment-finding---178734:Widescreen?$responsive$&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2&fmt=webp",N,,2025-09-18 20:02:55.197640

By providing this additional capital, the One North Carolina Small Business Program can improve the trajectory of small businesses and the likelihood of commercializing their innovative solutions.
Additionally, the Matching Program helps attract small businesses to North Carolina, create jobs, and draw more investment to the state.
The One North Carolina Small Business Program is administered by the North Carolina Department of Commerce on behalf of the North Carolina Board of Science, Technology & Innovation.
Since 2006, the One North Carolina Small Business program has awarded a total of nearly $41 million to 510 businesses across the state.","Addressing a well-known gap that many innovative companies face, today the North Carolina Board of Science, Technology & Innovation announced its latest round of funding to small businesses developing and commercializing new technologies in North Carolina. In fiscal year 2024-2025, 90 small businesses in 21 counties received 102 awards from the One North Carolina Small Business Program, providing $4.12 million for innovation in a variety of industries, including pharmaceuticals, energy, advanced materials, and agriculture.

“North Carolina is home to thriving, high-demand sectors, including life sciences and advanced manufacturing, that propel our economy forward,” said Governor Josh Stein. “By supporting small businesses at a critical stage of their growth, these grants help drive job creation and economic prosperity.”

The One North Carolina Small Business Program awards state-funded grants for small businesses that apply for awards from two highly competitive federal initiatives: the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. The federal SBIR and STTR programs, collectively referred to as America’s Seed Fund™, are administered through 11 federal agencies to support technology development by small businesses, with the goal of commercialization and economic sustainability for the selected companies. SBIR and STTR are the single largest source of early-stage technology development funding for small businesses across the country, with nearly $4.3 billion awarded annually.

Since 2006, the One North Carolina Small Business Program has leveraged these federal awards to support North Carolina’s innovation ecosystem and help small businesses navigate the early stages of company growth. By providing this additional capital, the One North Carolina Small Business Program can improve the trajectory of small businesses and the likelihood of commercializing their innovative solutions.

The One North Carolina Small Business Program awarded two types of grants during the fiscal year 2025 funding round: Incentive and Matching.

Incentive grants support qualified North Carolina businesses as they prepare and submit an SBIR or STTR proposal to federal agencies, helping to offset some of the costs of developing these complex proposals. The state program aims to improve the quality of proposals, particularly from first-time applicants, and incentivizes broader technology and geographic diversity among North Carolina’s SBIR and STTR applicants. In North Carolina fiscal year 2025, 51 small businesses were awarded Incentive grants totaling $418,863.

If a company is successful in winning a Phase I SBIR or STTR federal award, the Matching Program supplements those federal funds. This supplemental funding helps the company navigate what’s often called the “Valley of Death” – the time from the launch of a business idea to the point that idea generates sustainable revenue. Additionally, the Matching Program helps attract small businesses to North Carolina, create jobs, and draw more investment to the state. In the most recent round of grantmaking, 51 small businesses in 14 North Carolina counties were awarded $3.69 million in Matching grants after receiving $14.2 million in federal funds.

Among the 51 companies awarded Matching grants, 10 are located in more economically distressed Tier 1 or Tier 2 counties. The N.C. Department of Commerce uses the Tier ranking system to designate the economic well-being in each county through a county’s unemployment rate, median household income, population growth, and adjusted property tax per capita. Tier 1 represents the 40 most distressed counties, the next 40 counties make up Tier 2, and the 20 least distressed form Tier 3. By using this Tier ranking system, state programs can focus on economically advancing the lower Tier counties, in this instance through growth of small innovative businesses. Out of the 10 total awards in Tier 1 and Tier 2, three of the awards went to companies in Tier 1 counties – the most to be awarded through the Matching program in a single year.

The One North Carolina Small Business Program is administered by the North Carolina Department of Commerce on behalf of the North Carolina Board of Science, Technology & Innovation.

“At a time when other states and nations are increasing their investments in scientific discovery and technological advancement, we need to continue to develop solutions to our greatest challenges, grow our economy, and boost our competitiveness,” said Sheila Mikhail, Chair of the Board. “By awarding grants to small businesses across the state, we are investing in our greatest natural resource – our innovative human capital – to drive economic vitality and North Carolina’s leadership in the global economy.

Since 2006, the One North Carolina Small Business program has awarded a total of nearly $41 million to 510 businesses across the state. With the support of this early-stage capital, the small, innovative businesses have gone on to maintain more than 2,000 jobs and receive more than $9.6 billion in follow-on funding from other sources to support the innovation economy within North Carolina. Combined, the businesses employ more than 4,000 people, pay $600 million in total wages, and pay per-employee average wages that are twice the state average.",,N,,2025-09-18 20:03:45.385852

GridStor on September 18 announced the acquisition of the 100-MW/400-MWh White Tank battery storage project from Strata Clean Energy, a solar power and energy storage developer based in Durham, North Carolina. Strata, also an independent power producer, has more than 300 projects in its portfolio, including more than 3 GW of its own construction. The company, a group that performs engineering, procurement, construction, along with operations and maintenance, also has more than 7 GW of solar and 21 GWh of storage in development.

GridStor on Thursday noted that the acquisition, and plans to build more standalone battery storage in Arizona, come as the state experiences rapid demand growth. APS and other utilities in the state set all-time records for peak power demand in August of this year.

The White Tank project also has a battery supply agreement and long-term service agreement with e-STORAGE, a Tier 1 global provider of energy storage solutions. That company, part of Canadian Solar, is providing about 120 of its SolBank 3.0 battery enclosures for the project, according to an announcement earlier this year.

20-Year Tolling Agreement

The White Tank project will be operated via a 20-year tolling agreement with APS, which is Arizona’s largest electric utility and which serves about 1.4 million homes and businesses. The project is sited in Maricopa County. White Tank is expected to enter commercial operation in the first half of 2027. Strata will continue to serve in a consulting role for the project during construction.

“Through this acquisition, GridStor is proud to extend our commitment to supporting Arizona utilities to meet the fast-growing power needs of their residents and businesses,” said Chris Taylor, CEO of GridStor and a former energy executive with Google. “Battery storage remains a highly scalable, cost-effective and near-term solution to powering rapidly growing energy capacity needs across the Southwest. We look forward to serving as a trusted partner to APS to meet the needs of Arizona’s residents and businesses.”

The White Tank battery storage project under its tolling agreement will allow APS to charge and discharge electricity as needed, helping to ensure customers have access to power when they need it and supporting the region’s expanding population and new industrial facilities.

“Strata is proud to play a foundational role in advancing Arizona’s clean energy infrastructure,” said Markus Wilhelm, CEO of Strata Clean Energy. “The White Tank project reflects our commitment to delivering grid-scale solutions that support utility partners like APS in meeting rising demand with reliability and resilience.”

The successful close of the project marks GridStor’s fourth acquisition within the past year, and its second in Arizona.

With respect to the state permitting, it is possible to now overcome some local regulations in state permitting in ways that weren’t possible before.
Not to mention Texas is a major hub for battery storage development, second only to California in total capacity installed onto the grid.
And while Garcia was stymied from halting that individual battery project, he then tried to block the Energy Department from streamlining federal permits for the entire battery storage system sector.
This is resulting in percolating Republican ire against battery storage, point blank.","The following conversation was lightly edited for clarity.

So to start, how do you feel about the state’s odds of meeting its climate goals?

My own assumption is that it was going to be tough before all of the federal changes to meet those goals. They were highly ambitious and I really support the ambition, but now it’s going to be really, really difficult to meet the clean energy goals. It’s not that we shouldn't work hard to meet them but we have to understand that in this current state of affairs, the obstacles are going to be much greater. But when you take offshore wind off the table, the challenge becomes even more enormous.

Why is offshore wind necessary to meet the state’s climate targets?

It’s because it is a large resource that would be coming into the grid over a period of time. The significance is in the megawatts, the size and scale. It was particularly important and we’re land constrained in New England. And all of the sudden you’re taking such a large opportunity in generation off the table.

We can do energy efficiency and we can do solar but as you know from the Shutesbury situation, land is at a premium. Location – you can’t site onshore wind here. We tried really hard under former Governor Deval Patrick and that hit a lot of obstacles. So offshore wind is critical to meeting those goals.

Help me understand the conflicts over this land constraint – is Shutesbury an aberration or a bit of a tale of the tape of the problems here?

The Shutesbury situation reflects how we’re not a large geographical area. We’re not Texas. We can put solar on roofs but you need larger solar installations. We’ve encouraged the solar industry as much as possible. But the area is limited. Wind off the coast provided an alternative that was realistic and not a science experiment.

How much of this problem is state permitting? It feels like there is some land in a space like Massachusetts but people don’t want to use it for this.

Any time you try to put energy infrastructure into New England – whether it's a gas pipeline or a solar installation – there’s a lot of local environmental and permitting regulations that can really hold up a project. One of the good things Massachusetts has done is we made energy permitting easier and went through a permitting reform. We have an Energy Facility Siting Council.

There’s still ways local interests can hold up projects. I think that’s just a fact of life in New England.

So that’s why offshore wind is so important to New England.

It becomes more challenging. From a resource perspective, we are at the end of the fossil fuel pipeline. The middle Atlantic has more gas pipelines coming into it than we do in New England. Offshore wind represented a great opportunity for us.

With respect to the state permitting, it is possible to now overcome some local regulations in state permitting in ways that weren’t possible before. We did address permitting reform in Massachusetts. The Energy Facility Siting Council has played a great, important role in having that happen and [towns] can be overruled to a certain extent.

Well, but it sounds like what you’re saying is that the conflicts will still exist because land is at a premium?

Yeah. And local control will always play a role in that.

The Commonwealth signed permitting reform into law in 2024 and in that there were comprehensive reforms to the process for clean energy infrastructure. This has improved siting. But again that doesn’t always ensure a project will be permitted and you can easily find ways to hold them up.

What gives you hope for the future? Where’s the light at the end of the tunnel for you?

I think that by facilitating permitting reform and also participation – local participation – as early as possible in the stages of projects… I think this is where the key lies. You can pass regulations but a lot of it has to do with doing the work ahead of time on your project and satisfying the local community so you don’t have a bigger fight on your hands.

“Gillespie County is subject to extreme drought, wildfires, and flash flooding events,” Roy wrote. “Naturally, residents are concerned about the environmental risks a battery storage facility poses to one of [the] most vulnerable areas in Texas, among other things.”

Peregrine told me in an email that the company then sought to assuage the congressman’s concerns, speaking with his staff over the phone. But Roy remained unmoved, now fully backing the local opposition to the project. “My office has met with representatives from Peregrine Energy, and while we appreciate the dialogue, we believe that this project warrants scrutiny,” Roy said in a statement provided by his staff when reached for comment. “We look forward to remaining engaged with Peregrine Energy and continuing to represent the people of Harper who feel strongly that this battery facility poses more harm than good.”

Republican interventions like these may feel out of the ordinary to many in the energy sector. Historically, conservative politicians like Roy often vote against writing new regulations governing the environment and public safety, and Texas has often been a bastion for that kind of policymaking. Not to mention Texas is a major hub for battery storage development, second only to California in total capacity installed onto the grid. The Lone Star state’s strained grid means there is no shortage of demand for excess back-up power.

Unfortunately for battery storage developers, national Republicans are now increasingly open to attacking individual battery storage projects in the same way they’ve sometimes fought solar and wind farms, especially when activists on the ground feel they’ve lost the fight with municipal and state regulators.

Last year, we launched The Fight with a story about the unincorporated town of Acton, California, where a battery project was approved by county officials in an area with high risk of experiencing wildfire. Local opponents of the facility, feeling that county and state courts would not fairly adjudicate their concerns, lobbied their elected representative in Congress – then-Rep. Mike Garcia – to do something, anything in response to the situation. And while Garcia was stymied from halting that individual battery project, he then tried to block the Energy Department from streamlining federal permits for the entire battery storage system sector. (The rulemaking was completed before the start of the Trump 2.0 administration. Garcia lost re-election last year.)

At the time, this was the first full-fledged example I could find of a Republican in Congress really picking up the mantle of the “BESS bomb” panic around large-scale battery facilities potentially posing an unacceptable risk to surrounding host communities. Sure, there’d been scares around lithium-ion batteries in e-bikes, for example. But battery storage in general? The sector has enjoyed bipartisan support at the national level, and definitely still does to some extent given that GOP lawmakers declined to pare back the industry’s Inflation Reduction Act credits in their recently-passed tax megabill.

But now there’s a very clear battery fire “butterfly effect” occurring in which local rage fails to get the attention of government officials focused on energy capacity so activists will just go to whatever ears are most sympathetic to them. This is resulting in percolating Republican ire against battery storage, point blank.

Indeed, Heatmap Pro’s August poll of 3,741 registered voters found that there are now three times as many strong opponents of battery storage facilities among Republicans than strong supporters.

Less than a month after Roy’s letter to Peregrine, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin personally visited his native Long Island, New York, to voice his support for those campaigning against a Key Capture Energy battery project in Hauppauge, a hamlet within the town of Islip. The EPA has no role in whether the project is built or not. But the endorsement – coupled with a New York Post op-ed declaring “battery sites are too risky for New York” – came right before a 12-month battery moratorium Islip had enacted was set to expire.

This week Islip extended the moratorium, indefinitely stopping the battery project. Next week, the New York City Council’s committee on fire and emergency management will be holding a public hearing to specifically address the local fears about storage projects.

As for Roy and Peregrine Energy, it’s unclear how the Texas Republican could stop the facility on his own. It has the permits necessary to build and Texas doesn’t have the kind of stringent environmental regulation that creates opportunities to stall construction.

But the lawmaker’s existing political clout in Washington and motivation to win the Republican primary nomination in a heated statewide contest make him a dangerous enemy for any company to have, especially energy developers linked in some way to the transition. As Garcia showed a year ago and Zeldin demonstrated over the summer, someone with a national platform and a megaphone could do a lot of damage to a single project, or worse. We’ve yet to truly see what will come from the flapping of this butterfly’s wings.

But tucked in its press release was an admission from the company’s vice president of development Derek Moretz: this was also about the town, which had enacted a bylaw significantly restricting solar development that the company was until recently fighting vigorously in court.

“There are very few areas in the Commonwealth that are feasible to reach its clean energy goals,” Moretz stated. “We respect the Town’s conservation go als, but it is clear that systemic reforms are needed for Massachusetts to source its own energy.”

This stems from a story that probably sounds familiar: after proposing the projects, PureSky began reckoning with a burgeoning opposition campaign centered around nature conservation. Led by a fresh opposition group, Smart Solar Shutesbury, activists successfully pushed the town to drastically curtail development in 2023, pointing to the amount of forest acreage that would potentially be cleared in order to construct the projects. The town had previously not permitted facilities larger than 15 acres, but the fresh change went further, essentially banning battery storage and solar projects in most areas.

When this first happened, the state Attorney General’s office actually had PureSky’s back, challenging the legality of the bylaw that would block construction. And PureSky filed a lawsuit that was, until recently, ongoing with no signs of stopping. But last week, shortly after the Treasury Department unveiled its rules for implementing Trump’s new tax and spending law, which basically repealed the Inflation Reduction Act, PureSky settled with the town and dropped the lawsuit – and the projects went away along with the court fight.

What does this tell us? Well, things out in the country must be getting quite bleak for solar developers in areas with strident and locked-in opposition that could be costly to fight. Where before project developers might have been able to stomach the struggle, money talks – and the dollars are starting to tell executives to lay down their arms.

The picture gets worse on the macro level: On Monday, the Solar Energy Industries Association released a report declaring that federal policy changes brought about by phasing out federal tax incentives would put the U.S. at risk of losing upwards of 55 gigawatts of solar project development by 2030, representing a loss of more than 20 percent of the project pipeline.

But the trade group said most of that total – 44 gigawatts – was linked specifically to the Trump administration’s decision to halt federal permitting for renewable energy facilities, a decision that may impact generation out west but has little-to-know bearing on most large solar projects because those are almost always on private land.

Heatmap Pro can tell us how much is at stake here. To give you a sense of perspective, across the U.S., over 81 gigawatts worth of renewable energy projects are being contested right now, with non-Western states – the Northeast, South and Midwest – making up almost 60% of that potential capacity.

If historical trends hold, you’d expect a staggering 49% of those projects to be canceled. That would be on top of the totals SEIA suggests could be at risk from new Trump permitting policies.

I suspect the rate of cancellations in the face of project opposition will increase. And if this policy landscape is helping activists kill projects in blue states in desperate need of power, like Massachusetts, then the future may be more difficult to swallow than we can imagine at the moment.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTYxMzU2MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NTMwNDgyMH0.1TaDpGAwTbQaE0_tjCCI4IMoemLdU5tb1pGDgKMHcvU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C143%2C0%2C143,N,,2025-09-18 20:03:55.903637

“Without the air nuisance rule available to citizens, polluters will be free to deluge fence line communities with air pollution.

The Ohio EPA says that state regulations similar to the air nuisance rule will remain.","The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency is inching closer to removing a 50-year-old rule that Ohioans have used to combat air pollution.

The proposal is currently open to comments from residents. At a meeting Monday, some took the opportunity to push back on the change.

It’s often referred to as the air nuisance rule, and it can be found in Ohio’s state implementation plan (SIP) of the Clean Air Act. Local governments and Ohio residents have used it to enforce the federal law for decades.

The rule defines air pollution as a public nuisance and allows Ohioans to file federal lawsuits against companies whose emissions they claim jeopardize air quality.

Ohio’s budget bill, which passed earlier this year, directed the Ohio EPA to try to remove this rule from the plan.

“Over time it has become clear that the ANR [Air Nuisance Rule] has not been used and is not needed for attainment or maintenance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS),” the Ohio EPA wrote in its draft demonstration. “Over the years, many states have removed their respective ANR as part of the SIP.”

Removal of the rule has received backing from some U.S. legislators and industry stakeholders. The U.S. EPA has already removed the rule once before, but it was reinstated earlier this year.

Two Southwest Ohio residents spoke at Monday’s hearing.

Cincinnati-area resident Marilyn Wall said she’s helped local Ohio communities use the rule to enforce air quality standards where the Ohio EPA wouldn’t.

“Without the air nuisance rule available to citizens, polluters will be free to deluge fence line communities with air pollution. It's time for Ohio officials to hear the voices of Ohio communities and not just the polluters,” Wall said.

Wall and Middletown resident Donna Ballinger filed an appeal in 2022 after the rule was removed from the SIP back in 2020. The pair claimed that its removal “deprived [them] of the ability to pursue relief from this continuing pollution.”

Ballinger lives near a steel mill and industrial coke oven, which can be sources of air emissions. She described the impact of the 2020 removal at the hearing.

“We sent a letter saying we are going to file a citizen suit for the violations of the air nuisance rule,” Ballinger explained. “The state blocked my lawsuit by entering into a consent decree with the Middletown [steelworks], but the pollution never did stop.”

She hopes to once again attempt to use the air nuisance rule to give her relief.

“Ohio EPA has not stopped the pollution even though I call them nearly every day,” she said. “I need to have the air nuisance rule available so I can use it to protect me, my family and my community.”

The Ohio EPA is seeking comments on its proposed plan to remove the air nuisance rule. The deadline for submission is Sept. 22. Once the comments are considered, the Ohio EPA will then submit the requested revision to the U.S. EPA.

The Ohio EPA says that state regulations similar to the air nuisance rule will remain. But they will not allow for citizens to file federal lawsuits for enforcement:

“Although state law does not allow third-party lawsuits like the federal Clean Air Act, under Ohio Law citizens can file a Verified Complaint if they believe there are violations of Ohio EPA rules,” Ohio EPA spokesperson Bryant Somerville wrote in an email.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5437ab8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+91/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa8%2F04%2F0df0d3bb4bedb95aabd64928b6b5%2Fpollution-4846741-1280pixabay.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 19:02:07.495456

This positions Australian industry to compete in a global net zero economy.
Rewiring the Nation provides low‑cost finance to expand, modernise and connect renewables to Australia’s electricity grid – particularly transmission lines and renewable energy zones.
This enhanced grid infrastructure allows large‑scale renewable energy generation to reach industrial centres, supporting the shift towards renewable electricity.
This collaboration is exemplified through the National Energy Transformation Partnership, the Capacity Investment Scheme and Renewable Energy Transformation Agreements.","The Australian Government has set an ambitious and achievable emissions reduction target for Australia 62–70% below 2005 levels in 2035. A strong foundation of Commonwealth policies and initiatives encouraging decarbonisation across the economy will underpin emissions reduction in the industry and waste sectors. These initiatives provide the direction, funding and market mechanisms that support the transition to low‑emissions technologies and practices.

Complementing this, state and territory governments play a critical role in reducing emissions through regionally‑tailored regulatory settings, planning systems and infrastructure development. Together, all governments can coordinate to support meaningful progress towards reducing industrial emissions while ensuring the continued growth and resilience of our industrial base.

The industry and waste sector can meaningfully contribute to Australia’s 2035 target and in many instances can act now. For industrial facilities that use low heat processes, immediate decarbonisation opportunities include using commercial technologies such as heat pumps and electric boilers where there is access to electricity, as well as improving energy performance. Others will need to use new technologies or alternative feedstocks and supply chains.

The Safeguard Mechanism gives industry the clearest and most direct signal to reduce emissions in line with Australia's climate targets. It applies a declining emissions baseline to facilities emitting more than 100,000 tonnes of CO2‑e a year and covers approximately 56% of industrial sector scope 1 emissions. The Safeguard Mechanism supports long‑term investment certainty and operational planning as well as encourages investment in commercially viable abatement technologies and alternative inputs. See the Net Zero Plan for more information on the Safeguard Mechanism.

The Safeguard Mechanism will continue to be the main framework for industry facilities to adopt decarbonisation technologies, particularly for heavy industrial facilities. The 2023–24 Safeguard Data Insights from the Clean Energy Regulator shows that Safeguard facilities are already reducing their emissions, abating 2.7 Mt CO2‑e in the first year of operations of the reformed scheme (CER, 2025a). The Safeguard Mechanism can incentivise the uptake of technologies in the near to medium term. These include electric boilers for alumina refining, alternative fuels for cement production, tertiary abatement catalysts for chemicals and improvements to blast furnaces for ironmaking.

The Australian Government is creating a positive investment environment through A Future Made in Australia. This environment lets industry, government and investors share the risks and rewards of investing in clean, low‑emissions industries such as green metals production and battery manufacturing. To support the net zero transformation of existing industries and the growth of new industries, the Australian Government has announced over $22.7 billion to promote industrial development where Australia has comparative advantages. This positions Australian industry to compete in a global net zero economy.

A Future Made in Australia is underpinned by a robust National Interest Framework which will ensure significant public investments incentivise private investment at scale. Government support is in 2 streams:

The Net Zero Transformation Stream for industries that will make a significant contribution to the net zero transition and are expected to have an enduring comparative advantage.

The Economic Resilience and Security Stream for industries that are necessary for domestic economic resilience and require the encouragement of public funding.

To unlock this opportunity, the Australian Government has introduced several funding initiatives:

Green Iron Investment Fund: A $1 billion fund to support early movers in establishing commercial‑scale green iron facilities that use lower emissions technologies such as direct reduction using gas or hydrogen. Up to $500 million of this fund will be used the help support the Whyalla transformation.

Green Aluminium Production Credit: A $2 billion initiative to support aluminium smelters to transition further to renewable electricity, helping position Australian aluminium as some of the greenest in the world.

Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund (external link): A $1.5 billion fund that includes $750 million to support the new technologies needed for green metals through pilot and demonstration projects, and early‑stage development.

Battery Breakthrough Initiative: A $500 million fund to strengthen economic resilience and critical battery manufacturing capabilities, particularly those for high‑value battery products in Australia’s areas of competitive advantage.

Green Metals Innovation Network (external link): A $10 million network run by the CSIRO in collaboration with the Heavy Industry Low‑carbon Transition Cooperative Research Centre, which brings together research, government and industry to address key technical and economic challenges for green metals.

The Australian Government is also funding co‑contributions to capital investment and providing attractive financing options through initiatives to support decarbonisation and low‑emissions technologies. The $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund (NRF) finances investments in priority areas like renewables and low emissions technologies to support early‑stage startups, growth‑stage companies and mature businesses. The Net Zero Fund will be a new $5 billion sub-fund of the NRF to support major investments by large industrial facilities in decarbonisation and energy efficiency, and scale up manufacturing low emissions technologies. The Net Zero Fund will buttress and modernise domestic industrial capability. The funds will be drawn from existing NRF capital and will be a refocusing of the NRF’s priorities. The Powering the Regions Fund will continue to support a range of decarbonisation investments in Australian industry through:

the $600 million Safeguard Transformation Stream (STS)

the $400 million Industrial Transformation Stream (ITS)

the $400 million Critical Inputs to Clean Energy Industries (CICEI) programs.

The STS and ITS will open new rounds soon. The Australian Government will continue to consider the needs, resourcing and priorities of the fund over time in light of program priorities, the Net Zero Plan and this sector plan.

The Clean Energy Finance Corporation’s Rewiring the Nation program further supports industrial decarbonisation through electrification and renewables. Rewiring the Nation provides low‑cost finance to expand, modernise and connect renewables to Australia’s electricity grid – particularly transmission lines and renewable energy zones. This enhanced grid infrastructure allows large‑scale renewable energy generation to reach industrial centres, supporting the shift towards renewable electricity. The Capacity Investment Scheme provides a long‑term revenue‑underwriting framework that lowers investor risk for new renewable generation and firming resources (like battery storage). The National Electricity Market wholesale market settings review will further help to deliver reliable, competitively priced and secure electricity services. Together, these initiatives allow industries to electrify processes, reduce exposure to volatile fuel markets and adopt renewables at scale – making meaningful, practical industrial decarbonisation achievable. Some important technologies that these measures can enable include deployment of heat pumps and electric boilers.

The Future Gas Strategy and National Hydrogen Strategy are vital pillars to Australia’s industrial decarbonisation by supporting the scale up and adoption of alternative fuels and inputs. The Future Gas Strategy outlines how gas can support the transition towards renewable energy, especially where electrification is not yet viable. Consistent with Future Gas Strategy, the Gas Market Review will examine existing government policies and ensure sufficient gas supply in the longer term. Switching from coal to gas is also an important transition step for industries to reduce their emissions before alternative lower emission inputs and technologies become available.

Renewable hydrogen is critical to industrial decarbonisation for key subsectors. The National Hydrogen Strategy will guide Australia’s production, use and export of hydrogen. The Australian Government’s Hydrogen Headstart program and Hydrogen Production Tax Incentive helps catalyse renewable hydrogen and clean energy industries. These strategies and supporting measures are particularly important for industries that require renewable hydrogen such as green iron and green ammonia production.

Green industries that are supported by the Future Made in Australia investments help deliver a stronger Australian economy. As the global economy decarbonises, existing Australian fossil fuel exports will decline. Clean industries could offset the loss of fossil fuel export revenue. In Treasury’s Renewable Exports Upside Scenario, export revenue from green commodity sectors is projected to reach $178 billion in 2050, provided there is effective coordination, strong ambition and steady technological progress.

Australian governments are increasingly aligning their efforts to coordinate industrial decarbonisation, recognising the need to reduce emissions from hard to abate sectors while maintaining economic competitiveness. All governments are working together to develop and deploy low‑emissions technologies, including renewable hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and electrification of industrial processes. This coordination is critical to ensuring regulatory consistency, supporting shared infrastructure investments and planning the industry transition across jurisdictions.

Australian states and territories are actively developing and implementing strategies, legislation and roadmaps to reduce emissions and support the industrial transition. The state and territory governments are working in close alignment with Australia’s ambitious and achievable target of net zero by 2050. All governments are collaboratively advancing Australia’s industrial decarbonisation through the National Transformation Principles. These underscore a shared commitment to a fair and inclusive transition, emphasising place‑based approaches, First Nations partnerships and regional economic diversification. This collaboration is exemplified through the National Energy Transformation Partnership, the Capacity Investment Scheme and Renewable Energy Transformation Agreements.

Immediate decarbonisation opportunities are available for industrial facilities that use low heat processes. These facilities can use commercially available technologies such as heat pumps and electric boilers and optimise their energy efficiency. Industrial sub‑sectors that use high heat will be on a slower decarbonisation trajectory. They will need new technologies or alternative feedstocks and supply chains to support their transition (Climate Change Authority, 2024). The 4 key areas of decarbonisation focus are:

1. Optimise energy use now to reduce costs

Energy performance upgrades to optimise energy use across the economy could achieve more than 13% of the emissions reductions needed to achieve net zero by 2050 (ANZ; EEC, 2024). It is particularly important for the industrial sectors (DCCEEW, 2024a) and is the first logical step in the decarbonisation pathway for all business in the 9 sub‑sectors. Energy performance upgrades will deliver immediate benefits, are deployable now, and will help reduce the cost of future upgrades (IEA, 2025a).

Energy performance is also a pathway to modernise Australian businesses, improving competitiveness and productivity while reducing emissions (even in hard‑to‑abate sectors). Energy efficiency upgrades that use less energy to do the same job, is an ideal first step in the decarbonisation of industrial processes and can achieve immediate reductions in emissions and energy costs. For example:

The use of heat recovery or thermal energy storage to reduce the amount of gas needed for process heat and to reduce emissions. Thermal energy storage systems can also help businesses better harness renewables and solar to further reduce operational costs (CSIRO, 2023).

Upgrading old equipment such as pumps, refrigeration and hot water systems to improve efficiency. In addition to being more efficient, upgraded equipment typically operates more quickly, with more capacity for optimisation through the incorporation of digitisation and AI technologies. For example, a new air compressor helped a paint maker reduce electricity use by 23% (ANZ; EEC, 2024).

Deploying smart technologies to help monitor and optimise manufacturing processes and energy use.

Many of these energy efficiency measures can be deployed now using commercial technologies that do not require costly whole of plant upgrades. Studies have shown that energy efficiency can deliver an average 11% per annum in energy savings, with some having a payback period of under one year (IEA, 2025b). The $56.7 million Energy Efficiency Grants for Small and Medium Sized Enterprises program supports businesses to upgrade or replace inefficient equipment and implement other energy efficiency activities. The program assists businesses lower their energy use and improve their energy efficiency.

Industries can also optimise energy through demand flexibility to better harness times of peak renewable generation where cost of electricity is low. Demand flexibility is discussed in further detail in the ‘Enabling the Transition’ section below as well as in the Electricity and Energy Sector Plan, but in summary, demand flexibility for industry includes:",https://www.industry.gov.au/sites/default/files/2022-08/Default-publication-tile-1.png,N,,2025-09-18 19:01:15.587705

,IRA Tax Credits,2025-09-18 21:20:54+00:00,LAist,"Students, schools race to save clean energy projects in face of Trump deadline - LAist","The Hechinger Report, laist.com, the-hechinger-report",,,,,https://laist.com/news/clean-energy-projects-trump-deadline-schools-education,"Now, access to those funds is disappearing, leaving Tucson and other school systems across the country scrambling to find ways to cover the costs of clean energy projects.
The law discontinues many clean energy tax credits, including those used by schools for solar power and electric vehicles, created under the IRA.
As a result, many students, consultants, and sustainability leaders said, they have no plans to abandon clean energy projects.
Lily Strehlow, campus sustainability coordinator at the University of Wisconsin, Eau-Claire, said the planning cycle for clean energy projects at the school can take 10 years.
“At this point, everybody’s holding their breath,” said Rick Brown, founder of California-based TerraVerde Energy, a clean energy consultant to schools and agencies.","This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news outlet focused on education.

Tanish Doshi was in high school when he pushed the Tucson Unified School District to take on an ambitious plan to reduce its climate footprint. In October 2024, the availability of federal tax credits encouraged the district to adopt the $900 million plan, which involves goals of achieving net-zero emissions and zero waste by 2040, along with adding a climate curriculum to schools.

Now, access to those funds is disappearing, leaving Tucson and other school systems across the country scrambling to find ways to cover the costs of clean energy projects.

The Arizona school district, which did not want to impose an economic burden on its low-income population by increasing bonds or taxes, had expected to rely in part on federal dollars provided by the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, Doshi said.

But under HR1, or the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” passed July 4, Tucson schools will not be able to receive all of the expected federal funding in time for their upcoming clean energy projects. The law discontinues many clean energy tax credits, including those used by schools for solar power and electric vehicles, created under the IRA. When schools and other tax-exempt organizations receive these credits, they come in the form of a direct cash reimbursement.

At the same time, Tucson and thousands of districts across the country that were planning to develop solar and wind power projects are now forced to decide between accelerating them to try to meet HR1’s fast-approaching “commence construction” deadline of June 2026, finding other sources of funding, or hitting pause on their plans. Tina Cook, energy project manager for Tucson schools, said the district might have to scale back some of its projects unless it can find local sources of funding.

“Phasing out the tax credits for wind and solar energy is going to make a huge, huge difference,” said Doshi, 18, now a first-year college student. “It ends a lot of investments in poor and minority communities. You really get rid of any notion of environmental justice that the IRA had advanced.”

The tax credits in the IRA, the largest legislative investment in climate projects in U.S. history, had marked a major opportunity for schools and colleges to reduce their impact on the environment. K-12 school infrastructure releases an estimated 41 million metric tons of emissions per year, according to an analysis from the New Buildings Institute. The K-12 school system’s buses — some 480,000 — and meals also produce significant emissions and waste. Clean energy projects supported by the IRA were helping schools not only to limit their climate toll but also to save money on energy costs over the long term and improve student health, advocates said.

As a result, many students, consultants, and sustainability leaders said, they have no plans to abandon clean energy projects. They said they want to keep working to cut emissions, even though that may be more difficult now.

Sara Ross, co-founder of UndauntedK12, which helps school districts green their operations, divided HR1’s fallout on schools into three categories: the good, the bad, and the ugly.

On the bright side, she said, schools can still get up to 50% off for installing ground source heat pumps — those credits will continue — to more efficiently heat and cool schools. The network of pipes in a ground source pump cycles heat from the shallow earth into buildings.

In the “bad” category, any electric vehicle acquired after Sept. 30 of this year will not be eligible for tax credits — drastically accelerating the IRA’s phaseout timeline by seven years. That applies to electric school buses as well as other district-owned electric vehicles. Electric vehicle charging stations must be installed by June 30, 2026, at an eligible location to claim a tax credit. EPA’s Clean School Bus Program still exists for two more years and covers two-thirds of the funding for all electric school buses districts acquire in that time. The remaining one-third, however, was to be covered by federal and state tax credits.

The expiration of the federal tax credits could cost a district up to $40,000 more per vehicle, estimated Sue Gander, director of the Electric School Bus Initiative run by the nonprofit World Resources Institute.

Solar projects will see the most “ugly” effects of HR1, Ross said.

Los Angeles Unified School District is planning to build 21 solar projects on roofs, carports, and other structures, plus 13 electric vehicle charging sites, as part of an effort to reduce energy costs and achieve 100% renewable energy by 2040. The district anticipated receiving around $25 million in federal tax credits to help pay for the $90 million contract, said Christos Chrysiliou, chief eco-sustainability officer for the district. With the tight deadlines imposed by HR1, the district can no longer count on receiving that money.

“It’s disappointing,” Chrysiliou said. “It’s nice to be able to have that funding in place to meet the goals and objectives that we have.”

LAUSD is looking at a small portion of a $9 billion bond measure passed last year, as well as utility rebates, third-party financing and grants from the California Energy Commission, to help make up for some of the gaps in funding.

Many California State University campuses are in a similar position as they work to install solar to meet the system’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2045, said Lindsey Rowell, CSU’s chief energy, sustainability, and transportation officer.

Tariffs on solar panel materials from overseas and the early sunsetting of tax credits mean that “the cost of these projects is becoming prohibitive for campuses,” Rowell said.

Sweeps of undocumented immigrants in California may also lead to labor shortages that could slow the pace of construction, Rowell added. “Limiting the labor force in any way is only going to result in an increased cost, so those changes are frightening as well,” she said.

New Treasury Department guidance issued Aug. 15 made it much harder for projects to meet the threshold needed to qualify for the tax credits. Renewable energy projects previously qualified for credits once a developer spent 5% of a project’s cost. But the guidelines have been tightened — now, larger projects must pass a “physical work test,” meaning “significant physical labor has begun on a site,” before they can qualify for credits. With the construction commencement deadline looming next June, these will likely leave many projects ineligible for credits.

“The rules are new, complex, [and] not widely understood,” Ross said. “We’re really concerned about schools’ ability to continue to do solar projects and be able to effectively navigate these new rules.”

Schools without “fancy legal teams” may struggle to understand how the new tax credit changes in HR1 will affect their finances and future projects, she added.

Some universities were just starting to understand how the IRA tax credits could help them fund projects. Lily Strehlow, campus sustainability coordinator at the University of Wisconsin, Eau-Claire, said the planning cycle for clean energy projects at the school can take 10 years. The university is in the process of adding solar to the roof of a large science building, and depending on the date of completion, the project “might or might not” qualify for the credits, she said.

“At this point, everybody’s holding their breath,” said Rick Brown, founder of California-based TerraVerde Energy, a clean energy consultant to schools and agencies.

Brown said that none of his company’s projects is in a position where it’s not going to get done, but the company may end up seeing fewer new projects due to a higher cost of equipment.

Tim Carter, president of Second Nature, which supports climate work in education, added that colleges and universities are in a broader period of uncertainty, due to larger attacks from the Trump administration, and are not likely to make additional investments at this time: “We’re definitely in a wait and see.”

For youth activists, the fallout from HR1 is “disheartening,” Doshi said.

Emma and Molly Weber, climate activists since eighth grade, said they are frustrated. The Colorado-based twins, who will start college this fall, helped secure the first “Green New Deal for Schools” resolution in the nation in the Boulder Valley School District. Its goals include working toward a goal of “zero net energy” by 2050, making school buildings greener, creating pathways to green jobs, and expanding climate change education.

“It feels very demoralizing to see something you’ve been working so hard at get slashed back, especially since I’ve spoken to so many students from all over the country about these clean energy tax credits, being like, ‘These are the things that are available to you, and this is how you can help convince your school board to work on this,’” Emma Weber said.

The Webers started thinking about other creative ways to pay for the clean energy transition and have settled on advocating for state-level legislation in the form of a climate superfund, where major polluters in a community would be responsible for contributing dollars to sustainability initiatives.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cc64006/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x2999+0+508/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F11%2F9b%2Ff45f4154487fb97ed7ab45a60697%2Flausd-new-electric-buses-dale.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 18:03:08.103232

The federal government leases federal lands to private companies to extract taxpayer-owned oil and gas, collecting revenue through bids, rents, and royalties. Several pending rules would weaken recent reforms and restore outdated practices:

Bureau of Land Management – Oil and Gas Leasing Rule

Would rescind the 2024 “Fluid Mineral Leases and Leasing Process” rule, which raised outdated fees, rents, and royalties; strengthened bonding requirements; and directed leasing to strategic areas. Congress already rolled back most legislative updates in July, lowering royalty rates from 16.67% back to 12.5% and reopening a loophole for noncompetitive leasing.

Bureau of Land Management – Rescission of the Management and Protection of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska Regulations

Would rescind a 2024 final rule that established new standards for development in the Reserve and restricted drilling in designated “Special Areas.”

Forest Service – Oil and Gas Resource Revision

Would modify oil and gas leasing and operations on national forests and grasslands. The rule was originally noticed in 2020 under the first Trump Administration.

Management of Public Lands and Other Taxpayer-Owned Resources

America’s public lands and natural resources are owned by taxpayers and must be managed in a way that balances economic use, environmental stewardship, and long-term sustainability. Several new rules could cost taxpayers by picking winners and losers and undervaluing our taxpayer-owned resources:

Bureau of Land Management – Rescission of Conservation and Landscape Health Rule

Would undo a final rule that designated conservation as a legitimate use under the “multiple use” framework.

Bureau of Land Management – Rescission of the Intermittent Energy Rule

Would repeal a final rule that expediates solar and wind energy project development on public lands, including by decreasing rents and capacity fees, allowing noncompetitive leasing inside Designated Leasing Areas (DLAs), and extending maximum lease terms.

Methane

Oil and gas operations remain among the largest methane emitters in the U.S., wasting billions of cubic feet annually through flaring, venting, and leaks. Several new rules could undercut recent progress to reduce waste and protect taxpayers:

Bureau of Land Management – Royalty for Oil and Gas Lost from Onshore Federal and Indian Leases

Would rescind the March 2024 “Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation,” rule requiring waste minimization plans, leak detection and repair, and royalties on avoidable losses.

Environmental Protection Agency – Extension of Deadlines in Standards of Performance for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources: Oil and Natural Gas Sector Climate Review

Would delay compliance deadlines for the EPA’s 2024 rule “Standards of Performance for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources: Oil and Natural Gas Sector Climate Review,” which established emission standards for new facilities and guidelines for state plans to regulate emissions from existing facilities.

Environmental Protection Agency – Additional Reconsideration of Standards of Performance for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources: Oil and Natural Gas Sector Climate Review

Would “reconsider” the same 2024 standards mentioned above.

Environmental Protection Agency – Reconsideration of Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: Revisions and Confidentiality Determinations for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (Subpart W)

Would revisit the 2024 rule “Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: Revisions and Confidentiality Determinations for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems,” which increased transparency of emissions from the oil and gas sector, mandated under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) as part of the Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP).

Department of Transportation – Pipeline Safety: Repair Criteria for Hazardous Liquid and Gas Transmission Pipelines

Would change when operators must repair hazardous liquid pipelines.

Timber and the Roadless Rule

The U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management manage timber sales on federal lands. Two new rules would repeal the Roadless Rule, leading to money-losing timber sales and costly road construction:

U.S. Forest Service – Special Areas: Roadless Area Conservation Repeal

Would repeal the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule (Roadless Rule) that prohibits road construction, road reconstruction, and timber harvesting in inventoried roadless areas.

U.S. Forest Service – Alaska Roadless Area Management

Would repeal 2023 final rulemaking “Special Areas, Roadless Area Conservation: National Forest System Lands in Alaska” and reinstate the 2020 rule that exempts the Tongass National Forest from the 2001 Roadless Rule.

Bioenergy

Bioenergy—produced from recently living organic materials, or biomass—can be used to generate fuel, electricity, heat, and other products. Proposed rules could increase federal subsidies for biofuels, further distorting markets, raising food and fuel prices, increasing emissions, and undercutting other federal priorities:

Environmental Protection Agency – Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Program: Set 2

Would set 2026 blending volumes for cellulosic biofuel, biomass based diesel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS).

Department of Agriculture – Unleashing American Energy and Economic Prosperity under Title 7 Code of Federal Regulations Part 4280 Subpart B

The proposal will simplify and streamline requirements and processes in the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP), a program established by the 2008 farm bill to provide loans and grants to agricultural producers and small businesses to install renewable energy systems and improve energy efficiency.

Carbon Capture and Storage

Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) refers to a suite of technologies designed to capture carbon emissions from power plants, industrial processes, or directly from the air. The captured carbon is either stored underground or utilized—often to extract more oil and gas. Proposed rules will create new guidelines for CCS activities and risk increasing federal subsidies:

Department of the Interior – Carbon Sequestration

Would establish regulations for transporting and storing captured carbon on the Outer Continental Shelf.

Environmental Protection Agency – Reconsideration of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program

Would end reporting requirements for nearly all major emitters, fuel and industrial gas suppliers, and CO2 injection sites under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP).

Energy Tax Credits

The federal tax code includes billions of dollars in annual subsidies for the energy sector, delivered through tax credits and preferential treatments that allow companies to significantly lower their effective tax rates. Proposed rules would govern implementation of changes made to energy tax credits in the FY2025 reconciliation bill:

Internal Revenue Service – Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit

Would implement a per-gallon tax credit for low-GHG transportation fuels. First created by the IRA, the 45Z tax credit was modified and extended in the FY2025 reconciliation bill.

Internal Revenue Service – Section 45U Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit

Would govern implementation of the 45U tax credit, which provides up to $15 per MWh for electricity produced by qualifying nuclear facilities. Created by the IRA and later modified to sunset early in the FY2025 reconciliation bill.

I spent 10 weeks interning at Counterpart International, a nongovernmental organization (NGO) that provides lifesaving humanitarian relief to communities around the world and works to empower them to build a more resilient future.

At Counterpart, I had the privilege of working with and learning from such amazing, mission-driven people who have devoted their lives to improving the lives of others. My interactions with Counterpart’s CEO and UD alum, Ann Hudock ’90, were especially influential. Ann’s leadership, wisdom, kindness and unwavering belief in fighting for a more just world inspired me and gave me hope for my future.

Before my experience in D.C., I often felt overwhelmed and uncertain about pursuing a career in environmental protection. My doubts were deepened when someone close to me suggested that I pursue something more tangible, where the impact of my work could be easier to see. Promoting climate resilience and working to address climate change started to feel like an overly ambitious, even naive goal.

This summer was especially difficult for the climate community, with the EPA losing funding, national priorities shifting, and experiencing countless rollbacks to environmental regulations. In the face of all of these challenges, I was able to find glimmers of hope.

Seeing firsthand how Counterpart continued to fight for communities despite the unprecedented changes to the sector of international development greatly inspired me. It showed me that there is always a path forward. Despair can be crippling, but hope for a better, more just and sustainable future is the foundation of real change.

Not only did my time at Counterpart help me come to this realization, but so did the opportunity to talk to so many incredible environmental professionals in the D.C. area. Some of these amazing opportunities included meeting with members of the State Department’s Office of Environmental Affairs and a former EPA official. I was also able to join Citizens’ Climate Lobby for a committee hearing and testify on the importance of maintaining climate funding.

Additionally, I learned a lot about international climate policy and climate change from attending a panel on environmental justice at Howard University and a seminar at the Environmental Law Institute.

These experiences opened my eyes to the many ways one can contribute meaningfully to protecting our beautiful planet. Witnessing such persistence and action towards sustainability this summer has made me more excited to continue my journey in environmental advocacy and protection.

While I’m not sure exactly where my career will take me, I have hope and a renewed confidence that this work is exactly what I am called to do. Our Earth deserves people who are willing to fight for it and I hope that more people will continue to realize that they could have an impact, too.",,N,,2025-09-18 21:59:33.556422

Refresh my memory. What are these incentives?

Article content

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

Article content

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Article content

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren’t capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it’s also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

,IRA Tax Credits,2025-09-18 21:06:21+00:00,LAist,Schools and clean energy - LAist,Not Available,,,,,https://laist.com/brief/news/clean-energy-projects-trump-deadline-schools-education,"But under HR1, or the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” passed July 4, Tucson schools will not be able to receive all of the expected federal funding in time for their upcoming clean energy projects.
The law discontinues many clean energy tax credits, including those used by schools for solar power and electric vehicles, created under the IRA.
Clean energy projects supported by the IRA were helping schools not only to limit their climate toll but also to save money on energy costs over the long term and improve student health, advocates said.
As a result, many students, consultants, and sustainability leaders said, they have no plans to abandon clean energy projects.
“At this point, everybody’s holding their breath,” said Rick Brown, founder of California-based TerraVerde Energy, a clean energy consultant to schools and agencies.","This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news outlet focused on education.

Tanish Doshi was in high school when he pushed the Tucson Unified School District to take on an ambitious plan to reduce its climate footprint. In October 2024, the availability of federal tax credits encouraged the district to adopt the $900 million plan, which involves goals of achieving net-zero emissions and zero waste by 2040, along with adding a climate curriculum to schools.

Now, access to those funds is disappearing, leaving Tucson and other school systems across the country scrambling to find ways to cover the costs of clean energy projects.

The Arizona school district, which did not want to impose an economic burden on its low-income population by increasing bonds or taxes, had expected to rely in part on federal dollars provided by the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, Doshi said.

But under HR1, or the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” passed July 4, Tucson schools will not be able to receive all of the expected federal funding in time for their upcoming clean energy projects. The law discontinues many clean energy tax credits, including those used by schools for solar power and electric vehicles, created under the IRA. When schools and other tax-exempt organizations receive these credits, they come in the form of a direct cash reimbursement.

At the same time, Tucson and thousands of districts across the country that were planning to develop solar and wind power projects are now forced to decide between accelerating them to try to meet HR1’s fast-approaching “commence construction” deadline of June 2026, finding other sources of funding, or hitting pause on their plans. Tina Cook, energy project manager for Tucson schools, said the district might have to scale back some of its projects unless it can find local sources of funding.

“Phasing out the tax credits for wind and solar energy is going to make a huge, huge difference,” said Doshi, 18, now a first-year college student. “It ends a lot of investments in poor and minority communities. You really get rid of any notion of environmental justice that the IRA had advanced.”

The tax credits in the IRA, the largest legislative investment in climate projects in U.S. history, had marked a major opportunity for schools and colleges to reduce their impact on the environment. K-12 school infrastructure releases an estimated 41 million metric tons of emissions per year, according to an analysis from the New Buildings Institute. The K-12 school system’s buses — some 480,000 — and meals also produce significant emissions and waste. Clean energy projects supported by the IRA were helping schools not only to limit their climate toll but also to save money on energy costs over the long term and improve student health, advocates said.

As a result, many students, consultants, and sustainability leaders said, they have no plans to abandon clean energy projects. They said they want to keep working to cut emissions, even though that may be more difficult now.

Sara Ross, co-founder of UndauntedK12, which helps school districts green their operations, divided HR1’s fallout on schools into three categories: the good, the bad, and the ugly.

On the bright side, she said, schools can still get up to 50% off for installing ground source heat pumps — those credits will continue — to more efficiently heat and cool schools. The network of pipes in a ground source pump cycles heat from the shallow earth into buildings.

In the “bad” category, any electric vehicle acquired after Sept. 30 of this year will not be eligible for tax credits — drastically accelerating the IRA’s phaseout timeline by seven years. That applies to electric school buses as well as other district-owned electric vehicles. Electric vehicle charging stations must be installed by June 30, 2026, at an eligible location to claim a tax credit. EPA’s Clean School Bus Program still exists for two more years and covers two-thirds of the funding for all electric school buses districts acquire in that time. The remaining one-third, however, was to be covered by federal and state tax credits.

The expiration of the federal tax credits could cost a district up to $40,000 more per vehicle, estimated Sue Gander, director of the Electric School Bus Initiative run by the nonprofit World Resources Institute.

Solar projects will see the most “ugly” effects of HR1, Ross said.

Los Angeles Unified School District is planning to build 21 solar projects on roofs, carports, and other structures, plus 13 electric vehicle charging sites, as part of an effort to reduce energy costs and achieve 100% renewable energy by 2040. The district anticipated receiving around $25 million in federal tax credits to help pay for the $90 million contract, said Christos Chrysiliou, chief eco-sustainability officer for the district. With the tight deadlines imposed by HR1, the district can no longer count on receiving that money.

“It’s disappointing,” Chrysiliou said. “It’s nice to be able to have that funding in place to meet the goals and objectives that we have.”

LAUSD is looking at a small portion of a $9 billion bond measure passed last year, as well as utility rebates, third-party financing and grants from the California Energy Commission, to help make up for some of the gaps in funding.

Many California State University campuses are in a similar position as they work to install solar to meet the system’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2045, said Lindsey Rowell, CSU’s chief energy, sustainability, and transportation officer.

Tariffs on solar panel materials from overseas and the early sunsetting of tax credits mean that “the cost of these projects is becoming prohibitive for campuses,” Rowell said.

Sweeps of undocumented immigrants in California may also lead to labor shortages that could slow the pace of construction, Rowell added. “Limiting the labor force in any way is only going to result in an increased cost, so those changes are frightening as well,” she said.

New Treasury Department guidance issued Aug. 15 made it much harder for projects to meet the threshold needed to qualify for the tax credits. Renewable energy projects previously qualified for credits once a developer spent 5% of a project’s cost. But the guidelines have been tightened — now, larger projects must pass a “physical work test,” meaning “significant physical labor has begun on a site,” before they can qualify for credits. With the construction commencement deadline looming next June, these will likely leave many projects ineligible for credits.

“The rules are new, complex, [and] not widely understood,” Ross said. “We’re really concerned about schools’ ability to continue to do solar projects and be able to effectively navigate these new rules.”

Schools without “fancy legal teams” may struggle to understand how the new tax credit changes in HR1 will affect their finances and future projects, she added.

Some universities were just starting to understand how the IRA tax credits could help them fund projects. Lily Strehlow, campus sustainability coordinator at the University of Wisconsin, Eau-Claire, said the planning cycle for clean energy projects at the school can take 10 years. The university is in the process of adding solar to the roof of a large science building, and depending on the date of completion, the project “might or might not” qualify for the credits, she said.

“At this point, everybody’s holding their breath,” said Rick Brown, founder of California-based TerraVerde Energy, a clean energy consultant to schools and agencies.

Brown said that none of his company’s projects is in a position where it’s not going to get done, but the company may end up seeing fewer new projects due to a higher cost of equipment.

Tim Carter, president of Second Nature, which supports climate work in education, added that colleges and universities are in a broader period of uncertainty, due to larger attacks from the Trump administration, and are not likely to make additional investments at this time: “We’re definitely in a wait and see.”

For youth activists, the fallout from HR1 is “disheartening,” Doshi said.

Emma and Molly Weber, climate activists since eighth grade, said they are frustrated. The Colorado-based twins, who will start college this fall, helped secure the first “Green New Deal for Schools” resolution in the nation in the Boulder Valley School District. Its goals include working toward a goal of “zero net energy” by 2050, making school buildings greener, creating pathways to green jobs, and expanding climate change education.

“It feels very demoralizing to see something you’ve been working so hard at get slashed back, especially since I’ve spoken to so many students from all over the country about these clean energy tax credits, being like, ‘These are the things that are available to you, and this is how you can help convince your school board to work on this,’” Emma Weber said.

The Webers started thinking about other creative ways to pay for the clean energy transition and have settled on advocating for state-level legislation in the form of a climate superfund, where major polluters in a community would be responsible for contributing dollars to sustainability initiatives.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cc64006/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x2999+0+508/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F11%2F9b%2Ff45f4154487fb97ed7ab45a60697%2Flausd-new-electric-buses-dale.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 18:03:12.087850

OPmobility plans to assemble bumpers in Normal for Rivian’s new lower-cost R2 model that goes into production next year. It's expected to start at $45,000.

OPmobility said Thursday it will hire 81 employees in Normal for logistics, assembly, loading, and other roles. They’ll make at least 20% above the average wage for that job classification across McLean County. The company also said it will make a “significant capital investment” in Normal.

In exchange, OPmobility will get an unspecified amount of tax breaks as part of the state's Reimagining Energy and Vehicles in Illinois [REV Illinois] program, aimed at clean energy production and manufacturing. Rivian itself has lined up hundreds of millions of dollars in state incentives through that program in support of the R2 launch.

“We appreciate the State of Illinois's partnership and support in helping attract key suppliers to the Normal area,” Rivian Founder and CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement. “Our Normal supplier park will provide improved material supply logistics as we increase production in 2026 to build R2, in addition to R1 and our commercial vans.”

Rivian announced the new 1.2 million-square-foot supplier park in May, but no tenants were named at that time. Rivian also is getting millions in state and local tax incentives for the supplier park located across the street from the main manufacturing plant.

“In Illinois, we aren’t just making electric vehicles: we are creating an entire ecosystem — attracting investments, bolstering our workforce, and strengthening the EV manufacturing supply chain,” said Gov. JB Pritzker. “Rivian’s investment will attract suppliers from across the globe to invest in Illinois and continue to create good-paying jobs, providing Illinois with the competitive edge to thrive in the clean energy economy.”

OPmobility is a global company, with 26 plants and nine research-and-development centers in North America.

“This step reflects OPmobility’s commitment to scaling innovation and delivering value across key markets. The U.S. is a key pillar of our strategy, and we’re excited to deepen our presence in a market that continues to shape the future of mobility with this facility in Illinois,” said Thibaut Stern, president for North America of OPmobility Exterior & Lighting.

A bipartisan House group released a permitting reform “framework” on Thursday that aims to make it easier to build transmission lines, pipelines and other power projects in the face of rising energy demand.

The 47-member Problem Solvers Caucus intends to turn the framework into legislation. The framework calls for streamlining the permitting process, partly by setting deadlines for court reviews of permitting decisions.

“The number one issue Americans are concerned about is the cost of living,” Rep.Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y. and Problem Solvers Caucus co-chair, said in a press release. “Sky-high energy costs play an enormous role — electricity prices rose more than 6.5% in just the last year, and demand is skyrocketing.”

However, it can take years and in some cases decades for green energy and other projects to get built and connected to the grid, according to Suozzi.

The framework calls for:

Reducing the statute of limitations for permitting lawsuits to one year or less, with 150-day limits for FAST-41 projects;

Restricting judicial standing for litigating projects to parties who submitted detailed comments during public review;

Clarifying that Clean Water Act Section 401 certifications by states should focus only on water quality impacts of a project that result from the federally permitted or licensed activity;

Requiring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to initiate interregional transmission planning while prohibiting allocating costs to customers who receive no or trivial benefits from the projects;

Amending the National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors process to allow for individual national interest high-impact transmission lines;

Promoting grid-enhancing technologies to maximize capacity on existing transmission lines; and,

Expediting geothermal project permitting by allowing for simultaneous consideration of multiple project phases, while requiring agencies to approve or deny applications within 30 days after completing all legal and regulatory reviews.

The framework comes amid calls for addressing permitting reform in Congress this year.

“Rapid deployment of new energy infrastructure — including generation, transmission, and pipelines — is the lynchpin to providing more energy to our customers, meeting growing energy demand, and winning the AI race,” Drew Maloney, president and CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, said in a letter to House and Senate leaders on Tuesday.

Maloney said Congress needed to “act now” to streamline permitting processes and make sure that the National Environmental Policy Act and the Clean Water Act aren’t used to delay infrastructure projects.

EEI, a trade group for investor-owned utilities, and other utility groups support the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act, which would make various changes to NEPA requirements and was discussed during a House hearing on Sept. 10.

During the hearing, Democrats said actions by the Trump administration — rescinding funding, reducing the federal workforce and hampering solar and wind development — undermined the prospect of compromise on permitting reform, according to ClearView Energy Partners.

If the SPEED Act passed the House in its current form, it would likely face “an uphill climb” in the Senate where a stand-alone bill could face a filibuster, the research firm said in a Sept. 11 client note. However, it could be attached to “must-pass” spending bills, ClearView analysts noted.

In a blog post calling for permitting reforms, Martin Durbin, U.S. Chamber of Commerce senior vice president for policy, decried the Trump administration’s recent stop-work orders for offshore wind projects.

An earlier report from Wood Mackenzie forecast that residential solar installations will slow in the coming years in the wake of Trump’s ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill’, which was passed in July, and the passage of the Net Energy Metering (NEM 3.0) bill in industry leader California has hampered the business case for installing residential solar projects in the state.

Indeed, California is one of the “leading states” for VPP penetration, according to the Wood Mackenzie report. Along with Texas, New York and Massachusetts, these states account for 37% of VPP deployments, while the PJM and ERCOT grids have the largest utility commitments to data centre capacity, and the greatest disclosed VPP offtake capacity.

“While data centers are the source of new load, there’s an enormous opportunity to tap VPPs as the new source of grid flexibility,” said Hertz-Shargel.

The report also notes that over half of all offtakers increased the number of deployments under them by at least 30%, compared to 2024 figures, with 192 unique offtakers and 433 programmes monetised in 2025, representing increases of 38% and 35% compared to the previous year.

Looking ahead, the Wood Mackenzie report identifies “regulatory pushback” as a key obstacle to further VPP integration, pointing to utilities’ practice of rate basing distributed energy resources – including the cost of distributed energy systems in the utilities’ asset base, from which they can earn a return – as one that limits opportunities for new distributed energy investment.

The Trump administration has moved to block several offshore wind projects that were approved and got permits to build during the Biden administration.
Members of the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group of moderate members of both parties, on Thursday proposed a new framework for a potential bipartisan deal.
Even prior to the moves to block offshore wind, Democrats were raising concerns about the Trump administration’s assault on renewables.
Still, other Democrats are seeking a bipartisan agreement, even with the Trump administration’s anti-renewable policies.","The Trump administration’s attacks on renewable energy are making it more difficult for lawmakers to reach a bipartisan energy deal.

Key Democrats say they are not willing to play ball to achieve a deal on permitting reform unless the administration stops going after green energy projects — especially those that have already been approved.

“The elephant in the room now is the stop-work orders that the administration has put out because if you can ignore the law and you can stop someone’s job on a fully permitted project, then does permitting law really matter?” Sen. Martin Heinrich (N.M.), the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, asked The Hill in a recent interview.

The Trump administration has moved to block several offshore wind projects that were approved and got permits to build during the Biden administration.

The Trump administration has said in a series of court filings that it hopes to block at least three of those projects, including one in New England that was already about 80 percent constructed.

The White House has carried out multiple attacks on green energy. It has previously slashed tax subsidies for renewables, sought to slow down federal approval of wind and solar projects and said it would try to block projects that take up a lot of room, which would disproportionately impact the sector.

At the same time, the administration has expressed support for cutting red tape, which lawmakers say they hope to do with a bipartisan deal.

Members of the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group of moderate members of both parties, on Thursday proposed a new framework for a potential bipartisan deal.

Their framework includes provisions supported by Republicans to limit lawsuits over energy projects while also giving Democrats wins they’re seeking to build out more power lines — which they hope could get renewable energy onto the grid more quickly.

At the same time, the framework’s backers said the Trump administration will have to stop targeting renewables in order for a deal to actually be achieved.

“If we keep on going in this process and we get near the finish line, and the argument becomes, ‘Hey, you guys are making this deal, and they’re not going to approve any of the green projects anyway,’ then it’s going to be very hard for us to keep the deal going forward,” said Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.).

“We need to see good faith, not only from our colleagues, which we’ve been seeing in our Problem Solvers Group, we need to see good faith in the White House also,” Suozzi added.

Spokespeople for the White House, as well as the Interior Department, which has made several of the anti-renewable moves, did not respond to The Hill’s requests for comment.

Even prior to the moves to block offshore wind, Democrats were raising concerns about the Trump administration’s assault on renewables.

“We are stuck in a pickle of not being able to trust the Trump administration to execute fairly, faithfully in the words of the Constitution, whatever law we would pass,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) told The Hill in July.

Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said lawmakers will have to “get the assurances that we’re going to need from the Trump administration that whatever we agree to is actually going to be implemented by them and they’re not just going to cherry-pick” to only benefit “fossil fuel and Republicans” rather than “clean energy or Democrats.”

“They’ve got to come to us and make a case that is convincing,” he said.

During an Environmental Protection Agency-led roundtable on Monday, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) told players in the tech sector that “the way to get certainty on all accounts is to have regulatory reform through Congress.”

Asked by The Hill this week whether the Trump administration’s actions are making it harder to reach a deal, Capito said, “Time will tell.”

Many in the business community, especially the energy industry, have been pushing Congress to reach an accord.

“Our message to lawmakers right now is that this stands to benefit every sector of the American economy,” said Dustin Meyer, senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory affairs at the American Petroleum Institute, a major oil and gas lobbying group.

On oil and gas specifically, he said that a faster process “will help bring more supply into the marketplace … and that plays a critical role in putting downward pressure on prices.”

Lawmakers have sought to put together an agreement to speed up approvals for energy and other infrastructure projects for a long time, with Republicans hoping to bolster fossil fuels while many Democrats have sought to bolster renewable energy.

Nevertheless, it’s an issue that has divided Democrats, as progressives have argued that faster projects could mean less environmental scrutiny and more pollution.

Still, other Democrats are seeking a bipartisan agreement, even with the Trump administration’s anti-renewable policies.

Heinrich told The Hill he hopes to ultimately get an arrangement across the finish line.

“If we can get some clarity and confidence that the administration is going to respect the law with respect to permitting, then I do think we can negotiate a path forward,” he said.",https://www.louisianafirstnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2025/09/heinrichmartin_032525gn01_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-18 20:03:59.245701

BALTIMORE, Sept. 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- CPower Energy (""CPower""), a leading Virtual Power Plant (VPP) platform, today announced that it has been named a VPP market leader by Wood Mackenzie for the third year running. As with past reports, the Wood Mackenzie 2025 North America virtual power plant report ranked CPower for its dispatchable load under management and number of market and utility demand response programs, among other criteria.

The report is published as grid operators and utilities nationwide struggle with unprecedented demand growth from artificial intelligence computing, data centers and the electrification of transportation, housing and other sectors of the economy.

According to Wood Mackenzie, company deployments, unique offtakers and utility and market programs monetized grew over 33% in North America year-over-year. A frigid winter and relentless summer heat waves have driven up demand peaks this year, underscoring the value of VPPs in enhancing grid reliability and flexibility.

Year-to-date, CPower has dispatched customers across more than 900 events, 40% more this year than last. The resulting relief provided by big-box retailers, data centers, manufacturers, hospitals, schools and other large load customers has helped keep the lights on and the economy going in communities nationwide.

""We are honored that Wood Mackenzie has again validated CPower's leadership in Virtual Power Plants. Fast, reliable demand response has never been more critical because it empowers energy users to be part of the solution,"" said Michael D. Smith, CEO, CPower. ""Without tapping into existing customer-sited assets, the U.S. risks missing out on billions of dollars in market growth from AI alone over the next five years due to a lack of energy.""

Wood Mackenzie's VPP report found that while data centers drive demand growth, CPower counterbalances their impact. With nearly 23,000 sites nationwide, CPower leverages the flexible energy of customers across all major industries, including data centers, hyper scalers and bitcoin miners, making them grid assets.

""CPower's leadership in the VPP space is rooted in its approach to customer performance across every different industry,"" said Ben Hertz-Shargel, Global Head of Grid Edge, Wood Mackenzie. ""There's finally widespread recognition that VPPs can put money back in the pockets of businesses, rather than just raising rates on them through infrastructure development.""

“Too many people lost access to water when Hurricane Helene struck, and in some places, it took months to be able to guarantee potable water,” said Governor Josh Stein.
This project will create a new emergency interconnection between the towns of Morganton, Drexel, and Valdese to establish water system resiliency in the wake of an extreme weather event.
The SRF Helene funds for western North Carolina towns that have experienced Helene damage will continue to be available through year-round applications until 2026.
The Division of Water Infrastructure conducted four preliminary SRF Helene information sessions for prospective western North Carolina applicants in May in Boone, Hickory, Rutherfordton, and Asheville.","Governor Josh Stein announced today that five western North Carolina counties will receive more than $86 million in funding for 14 drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects as part of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency program for disaster-affected states. North Carolina is the first state impacted by Helene to award grants from this program.

The awards require that drinking water and wastewater funds be used to improve flood resilience in systems that were impacted by Hurricane Helene, and septic system funds must be used to improve flood resilience to septic systems in Helene-affected areas.

“Too many people lost access to water when Hurricane Helene struck, and in some places, it took months to be able to guarantee potable water,” said Governor Josh Stein. “These grants will help towns across western North Carolina strengthen their water infrastructure so that it can better withstand future storms.”

“These are the first awards from the $686 million from the Environmental Protection Agency for drinking water, wastewater, and septic system repairs and upgrades in the wake of Helene,” DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson said. “Importantly, all funded projects must ensure that the systems will be more resilient to future flooding events. Having clean and reliable water is critical for the health of our people. Everyone expects and deserves to turn on the tap and receive water that is safe to drink.”

Notable projects include:

The Town of Gamewell (Caldwell County) will receive $775,200 in Principal Forgiveness (PF) to replace/relocate gravity sewer lines and incorporate resiliency through various measures, including stream bank stabilization. High water from excessive rainfall during Helene caused erosion of the riverway and damaged pipe and support piers.

The Town of Waynesville (Haywood County) will receive $5 million in PF to convert a gravity sewer line to a force main with a new pump station and to relocate an existing junction box outside of the 500-year flood plain.

Town of Drexel (Burke County) will receive $5 million in PF to fortify lines in the floodplain and to convert a treatment unit into an equalization basin. The pump station was flooded during Helene, and installing an equalization basin would help reduce Sanitary Sewer Overflows and provide resiliency.

The City of Morganton (Burke County) and the Town of Drexel (Burke County) individually submitted separate applications for the Morganton-Valdese-Drexel interconnection project. This project will create a new emergency interconnection between the towns of Morganton, Drexel, and Valdese to establish water system resiliency in the wake of an extreme weather event. Drexel will receive $5.1 million for its share of this project. Morganton will receive $10 million in funding for its share.

Junaluska Sanitary District (Haywood County) will receive $10 million to rebuild and provide resilience to withstand floods. The shifting of the Pigeon River due to Helene flooding adversely impacted its old system. The proposed project will replace outdated, undersized, and aged water mains that service more than 300 residential connections along the Pigeon River. These lines are dead-end lines and are not looped or connected to other water mains. New water mains, along with valves, new water supply wells outside of the 500-year flood plain, and installation of backup power will provide resiliency, specifically for Haywood Community Hospital and Haywood County Emergency Services.

Woodfin Sanitary District (Buncombe County) will receive $5 million to install emergency standby power and replace inoperable control valves at the water treatment plant to ensure operators can properly operate and maintain the system during emergencies.

The Town of Hot Springs (Madison County) will receive $5 million in PF to include flood resiliency improvements to three pump stations and to improve approximately 5,600 linear feet of gravity sewer. Generators and flood protection walls will be added, and wet wells and electrical equipment will be elevated.

The Town of Hot Springs (Madison County) will receive an additional $5.2 million to install a new redundant transmission line beneath the French Broad River from the well system to the distribution system and to install a new redundant waterline under Spring Creek to feed the 200,000-gallon water storage tank; to construct a new 200,000-gallon water tank adjacent to an existing tank to provide redundant system storage; to replace approximately 6,000 linear feet of damaged water lines; to rehabilitate and improve the existing supervisory control and data acquisition system to ensure operability and access during flood events; to install radio read meters, which will allow the town to quickly identify water leaks and provide repairs for customers; and to install back-up standby power to increase resiliency.

A list of all Hurricane Helene projects approved forfunding (Opens in new window) at the State Water InfrastructureAuthority's (Opens in new window) (SWIA’s) Sept. 17meeting (Opens in new window) is available on the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) website. The Authority is an independent body with primary responsibility for awarding federal and state funding for water infrastructure projects.

The Hurricane Helene funding came from the federal Supplemental Appropriations for Hurricanes Helene and Milton and the Hawai’i Wildfires (SA-HMW), referred to in North Carolina as State Revolving Fund (SRF) Helene funds.

The Division will continue to accept applications on a rolling basis for the new federal SRF Helene funds from the 2025 American Relief Act to build resilience to water infrastructure for Hurricane Helene-impacted communities. The SRF Helene funds for western North Carolina towns that have experienced Helene damage will continue to be available through year-round applications until 2026.

Applications received by the dates below will be reviewed and presented at a subsequent SWIA meeting as follows:

First round of applications received by August 1 were presented to SWIA and awarded on September 17.

Applications received by November 3 will be presented to SWIA on December 10, 2025.

Applications received by January 9, 2026, will be presented to SWIA on February 18, 2026.

Applications received by March 2, 2026, will be presented to SWIA on April 15-16, 2026.

Drinking Water SRF Helene and Clean Water SRF Helene funding is available to local government units (LGUs) and nonprofit water corporations (and investor-owned drinking water corporations for the DWSRF) in the form of zero-interest loans and principal forgiveness. Applicants must document impacts from Hurricane Helene and the proposed project must include resiliency with the purpose of reducing flood damage risk and vulnerability to rapid hydraulic change or natural disaster.

The Division of Water Infrastructure conducted four preliminary SRF Helene information sessions for prospective western North Carolina applicants in May in Boone, Hickory, Rutherfordton, and Asheville. These were followed by in-person applicationtrainings (Opens in new window) in July and August, directly related to applying for the SRF Helene funds, in Clyde, Hickory, Boone, and Research Triangle Park/Durham.

The company has secured $40 million in Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credits by selling credits generated from U.S.-made inverters produced in Austin, Texas SolarEdge Announces First Section 45X Credit Sale[ 1 ]. This marks a pivotal moment in the maturation of the tax credit transfer market, demonstrating how manufacturers can monetize domestic production incentives to fund further expansion.

By Q4 2024, SolarEdge aims to produce residential systems with 35.6% domestic content, enabling customers to access bonus tax credits under the IRA's 45L program SolarEdge Announces First Section 45X Credit Sale[ 1 ]. This creates a virtuous cycle: higher domestic content in SolarEdge's systems translates to greater tax credit eligibility for installers, which in turn drives demand for its products. The company has already signed safe harbor agreements with major residential solar installers, including

Global Expansion: Leveraging U.S.-Made, Non-PFE Technology

While SolarEdge's domestic focus is clear, its global ambitions are equally strategic. In Q3 2025, the company began exporting U.S.-manufactured residential solar products to Australia, with plans to expand to additional international markets by year-end SolarEdge Announces First Section 45X Credit Sale[ 1 ]. This move leverages SolarEdge's non-PFE (Prohibited Foreign Entity) status, a critical differentiator in regions wary of geopolitical supply chain risks. CEO Shuki Nir emphasized that exporting American-made products reinforces the company's commitment to quality and innovation, both domestically and abroad SolarEdge Announces First Section 45X Credit Sale[ 1 ].

The global solar market is projected to grow at a 12% CAGR through 2030, and SolarEdge's U.S.-based production positions it to capitalize on this demand without compromising on supply chain security SolarEdge Marks Milestones in U.S. Manufacturing Strategy[ 3 ]. By producing in the U.S., the company avoids the tariffs and trade barriers that often plague imported solar equipment, making its solutions more competitive in international markets.

Investment Implications: A Resilient, Policy-Aligned Play

SolarEdge's expansion of U.S. manufacturing is not just a defensive move—it's a proactive strategy to dominate a rapidly evolving market. The company's ability to monetize IRA tax credits, secure long-term partnerships, and scale production at a rapid pace suggests strong financial discipline and operational agility. With over 2,000 new U.S. jobs created and a production roadmap that includes commercial inverter output by early 2025 SolarEdge Expands U.S. Manufacturing in Salt Lake City, Utah[ 2 ], SolarEdge is building a durable competitive moat.

For investors, SolarEdge represents a compelling intersection of policy tailwinds, supply chain innovation, and global market access.

Sheldon Whitehouse announced a probe on Tuesday into the role that industry groups and other organizations played in the proposed roll back of the federal government’s key “endangerment finding” for greenhouse gases.

But in July, the Trump administration announced its intention to revoke that finding.
However, the request is not enforceable and there is no legal requirement for those groups to provide the requested documents.

Sheldon Whitehouse announced a probe on Tuesday into the role that industry groups and other organizations played in the proposed roll back of the federal government’s key “endangerment finding” for greenhouse gases.

The endangerment finding, issued by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2009, has served as the basis for the agency’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles, power plants and oil and gas operations for more than a decade. But in July, the Trump administration announced its intention to revoke that finding.

In a statement announcing the proposal, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the agency had heard from “stakeholders” that “EPA’s [greenhouse gas emissions] standards themselves, not carbon dioxide … was the real threat to Americans’ livelihoods.”

Whitehouse, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and a longtime climate hawk, pushed against those claims on Tuesday and questioned whether fossil fuel interests had unduly influenced the administration’s decision.

“I am concerned about the role that fossil fuel companies, certain manufacturers, trade associations, polluter-backed groups and others with much to benefit from the repeal of the endangerment finding … played in drafting, preparing, promoting, and lobbying on the proposal,” Whitehouse wrote in his requests for documents.

The senator sent records requests to 24 companies and organizations, including oil and gas trade association the American Petroleum Institute (API), conservative and libertarian organizations like the Heritage Foundation, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and automotive manufacturers.

The letters set a deadline of Sept. 30 for those groups to provide internal and external communications with executive branch officials, the Trump campaign, Trump’s presidential transition team and other relevant parties.

However, the request is not enforceable and there is no legal requirement for those groups to provide the requested documents.

Whitehouse wrote that if the repeal of the endangerment finding is approved, “it would hand massive benefits to polluting industry actors and their enablers, allowing them to reap billions in profit while shifting the burdens of climate disasters onto the American families, businesses, and taxpayers.”

Inside Climate News has separately filed Freedom of Information Act requests with the EPA requesting copies of all communications between the agency and representatives, employees or lobbyists for some of the groups listed in Whitehouse’s letter, including the American Petroleum Institute.

A source within the oil and gas industry denied that API was involved in “developing or drafting” the EPA’s proposal to rescind the endangerment finding.

And in an emailed statement, a spokesperson for API said that “although we believe that the federal government has a role to play in regulating greenhouse gases—including methane—the previous administration’s unlawful and unpopular EV mandates were a clear abuse of the federal government’s authority.

“As the administration begins this process, we look forward to working with them in the months ahead to finalize a smart and effective regulatory approach,” the statement said.

Still, fossil fuel interests haven’t shied away from engaging with the Trump administration this year to achieve their priorities.

In July, the EPA published a rule extending deadlines for companies working with oil and natural gas to limit emissions of methane and other harmful pollutants. A separate source within the industry confirmed to Inside Climate News that industry leaders had requested that extension, despite the fact that many parties were already meeting the requirements of that emissions rule.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act has also been criticized as a handout to the fossil fuel industry, as it increases lease sales for drilling and mandates that millions of acres of federal lands be made available for mining, while accelerating the phaseout of tax credits for wind and solar development.

Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, told CNBC at the time that the bill “includes almost all of our priorities.”

The oil and gas industry also spent about $71 million lobbying the federal government in the first and second quarters of 2025. That puts the industry slightly behind its pace from 2024.

However, watchdog organizations told Inside Climate News that the lack of increased spending on lobbying by the industry amid major policy wins actually underscores its existing influence, and cited the number of industry insiders placed into key government positions and Trump’s already-friendly attitude toward fossil fuels.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2235747236-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 19:01:59.338677

""The Great Nicobar project is being implemented with a sense of responsibility and in full compliance with ecological and tribal policies.","Synopsis

Bhupender Yadav, the Union Environment Minister, has criticized the Congress party. He accused them of opposing the Great Nicobar infrastructure project. Yadav stated the project is vital for national security. Sonia Gandhi had earlier criticized the project. She cited environmental and tribal concerns. Yadav defended the project. He emphasized its strategic importance and adherence to environmental safeguards.

Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav on Thursday hit out at the Congress for opposing the Great Nicobar infrastructure project, accusing it of spreading confusion and indulging in ""negative politics"".

Speaking at an event organized by The Public Affairs Forum of India here, Yadav asserted that the mega project is crucial for national security and strategic connectivity in the Indian Ocean Region.

Yadav said only 1.78 per cent of Great Nicobar's forest area will be used for the project.

""Does the country not even have the right to use this much land for its security, transport capacity and modern technology? Questioning every institution, raising doubts over every developmental effort and writing columns when it comes to national security is nothing but negative politics,"" he said.

The minister maintained that policies for indigenous tribes have been fully respected and implemented.

Live Events

""For the indigenous tribes living there, policies have been made and fully implemented. We are committed to protecting the nation's ecology. Moreover, our premier institutions... ZSI, BSI, WII have prepared management plans, and we have followed them entirely,"" Yadav said.

He added that ecology and economy should progress together.

""Politics should be for building the nation, not for spreading misinformation. Unfortunately, some people are indulging in the politics of spreading confusion,"" he said.

Yadav's remarks came days after Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi, in an article in The Hindu, termed the Rs 72,000 crore project a ""planned misadventure"" that threatens the survival of the Shompen and Nicobarese tribes, destroys one of the world's most unique ecosystems and is highly susceptible to natural disasters.

Gandhi alleged the project was being pushed through by ""making a mockery of all legal and deliberative processes"".

""The ancestral villages of the Nicobarese tribals fall in the project's proposed land area. The Nicobarese were forced to evacuate their villages during the 2004 tsunami. This project will now permanently displace this community, ending its dream of returning to its ancestral villages,"" Gandhi had said.

She also argued that the Shompen face an even greater threat as the project denotifies a significant part of their reserve and will bring a large influx of people and tourists to the island.

In response, Yadav recently authored a column in the same newspaper, defending the project as one of strategic, defence and national importance.

He said the plan is designed to transform Great Nicobar into a major hub of maritime and air connectivity in the Indian Ocean Region, with an international container transhipment terminal, a greenfield international airport, a 450 MVA gas- and solar-based power plant and a township over 16 sq km.

The minister stressed that detailed environmental impact assessments, wildlife conservation plans, disaster management strategies and compensatory afforestation provisions had been put in place to minimise ecological impact.

He also argued that development on less than two per cent of the island's total forest cover cannot be equated with the threats portrayed by the Congress.

""Even today, 90 per cent of the island remains under forest cover. Compensatory afforestation has to be carried out somewhere, and if it has been done (in Haryana), it also contributes to cleaning Delhi's air. Does the country not even have the right to pursue development on less than two per cent of land?"" he said at Thursday's event.

Yadav reiterated that the project is essential for national security, while dismissing Congress criticism as politically motivated.

""The Great Nicobar project is being implemented with a sense of responsibility and in full compliance with ecological and tribal policies. Raising doubts over it amounts to misleading the people. This is not healthy politics,"" he said.

Advocates already emphasise CCS as a key mitigating solution in the transition to a low-carbon future, especially as power producers accommodate continued rising demand while also pursuing emissions reductions.

In February, the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecast global electricity consumption to rise at its fastest pace in recent years – nearly 4% annually through 2027 – as power-hungry segments like data centres and air-conditioning expand, and developing nations industrialise.1

Why does carbon capture matter?

Leaders in boardrooms in nearly every segment across the energy production spectrum are taking note, including fossil fuel-fed power producers, LNG exporters, hydrogen and derivatives producers, downstream oil and gas firms and gas refineries and petrochemical businesses. In the U.S. electric power sector alone, Energy Information Administration (EIA) figures offer a compelling case for effective, technology-driven mechanisms, such as CCS. In 2023, the sector accounted for 33% of total U.S. primary energy consumption - and about 30% of total U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions. Specifically, in electric power production, natural gas contributed 50% and coal 49%, of CO2 emissions.2

Carbon capture as an industry solution

Measured against the Paris Agreement to limit a global temperature rise to 1.5°C, impactful emissions reduction solutions are critical across the energy ecosystem.

CO2 traps heat close to the ground when released and can remain for hundreds of years. Industrial facilities, including power stations, produce CO2 when burning fossil fuels.

CCS equipment helps to change that paradigm by separating CO2 before it exits the smokestack. From there, it can be compressed and shipped – usually via pipeline – to long-term, deep underground storage locations, such as defunct coal seams.

Whether through retrofitting or engineering into new facility construction, this route to CO2 reduction can offer existing and emerging infrastructure opportunities to contain emissions, while energy producers embrace the likes of lower-carbon LNG and scale to meet future demand with renewables such as hydrogen.

Both industry, prosumers and governments are paying attention – and collaborating as they create more effective pathways toward net-zero.

Findings from 2024’s Global Status of CCS report revealed significant year-on-year CCS momentum worldwide with strong project growth across all stages of development. It said global CO2 capture capacity is on track to double to more than 100 million tons per year (Mtpa) of CO2, once facilities currently under construction commence operation.3

The global CCS landscape

According to the Global CCS Institute’s Global CCS Institute’s Global Status of CCS 2024 report4, there are 50 CCS facilities operating globally with more than 628 facilities in the development pipeline across sectors including chemicals, ethanol, ammonia/fertiliser, natural gas/LNG, oil refining, gas and coal power generation, and heat, waste-to-energy, plus hard-to-abate industries such as cement/concrete, iron and steel.

The efficacy of CCS can go further and can create a pathway to net-negative emissions; for example, when linked with bioenergy - which uses organic matter from plants or animals to produce power - and hydrogen production derived via biomass.

CCS can, in short, be a potent bridging partner as grids are modernised to be more energy efficient and reliable, by enabling the integration of variable renewable energy sources, managing peak demand and decarbonising existing fossil fuel power plants.

Potential implications for businesses that fail to decarbonise

Beyond climate motivation, pressure on power regenerators and other energy businesses to decarbonise can surface at various levels - each with potential implications including cost and reputation.

Emissions regulations can bring stiff penalties for non-compliance, hiking operational costs. Additionally, customers and investors may demand it. As with most technologies, CCS faces critics and challenges.

Broader adoption can promote accessibility and yield implementation savings. Growing investment can drive innovations which squeeze price and encourage scalability, so CCS can fulfil its potential in net-zero energy strategies.

Making carbon capture accessible and scalable

Governments recognise incentives are required to make CCS economically viable for industries. Among them, the U.S.’ 45Q tax credit was recently reaffirmed at $85/ton for point-source capture5, and the UK government’s $21.7 billion funding package over 25 years supports CCS clusters.6 Australia was recently offering grants of up to A$25m for pilot/pre-commercial projects via its Carbon Capture, Use and Storage Development Fund, beside tax breaks.7

As a technology leader in both the CCS and energy space and backed by over a century of innovation solving challenges across the energy production network and numerous other industries, Honeywell brings deep expertise to carbon capture. With advanced technologies across the energy sector, customers can tailor solutions to their specific needs – providing support for Honeywell’s forecasted cumulative impact of mitigating approximately 320 million metric tons of CO₂e between 2023 and 2030.8

NIPSCO wants to create a subsidiary to charge data centers for all the new infrastructure they'll need to operate, insulating its current customers from big rate hikes. But the consumer and environmental advocacy group Citizens Action Coalition has concerns.

CAC's Ben Inskeep said NIPSCO hasn't provided a lot of info on how this would work — so there's no guarantee that customers won't end up paying for new power plants in the long run.

""[That the contract] has the terms included in it that are going to require that data center to pay for these generation assets in full. And that there's not some sort of residual risk that could fall — or be borne by other customers should something go wrong,"" he said.

The subsidiary would negotiate with tech companies privately rather than going through Indiana's public ratemaking process.

""The public will have no idea whether or not this is a fair deal overall or maybe the data centers are getting a sweetheart deal that the public is being kept from seeing because of that confidential nature,"" Inskeep said.

Indiana Michigan Power requires tech companies to make long-term financial commitments to pay for new power plants built to serve them. Inskeep said these agreements have been made public.

New York Climate Week is just a few days away and the clean tech news is flying thick and fast. Why, it’s almost as if the rest of the world is still chasing the renewable energy rainbow, despite the U-turn taken by the US. Even the well known hater of wind and solar power, US President Donald Trump, has gotten into the Climate Week spirit — whether he knows it or not, that is. Read on for more on that and other clean tech news in the runup to New York Climate Week 2025.

Lower Interest Rates Are Good For Renewable Energy

Our friends over at Heat Map have the scoop on the relationship between lower interest rates and renewable energy. Their newsletter of September 18 leads off with a quote from reporter Matthew Zeitlin, who reported that Wednesday’s Federal Reserve rate cut may “provide some relief to renewables developers and investors, who are especially sensitive to financing costs.”

Zeitlin cited Center for Public Enterprise climate analyst climate Advait Arun, who said that “high rates are never going to be exactly a good thing … it’s going to be good that we’re finally seeing cuts.”

“Since solar and wind rely on basically free fuel, the bulk of developers’ costs to build panels or turbines are upfront. That requires borrowing money, meaning interest rates have an outsize impact on the total cost of renewable projects,” Zeitline added. “Renewables carry more debt than fossil fuel plants. When interest rates rise by 2 percentage points, the levelized cost of electricity for renewables rises by 20%, compared to 11% for a gas fired plant, according to a report last year by the energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.”

That won’t be much help to the US offshore wind industry, which is all but dead in the water after Trump suspended the federal offshore lease program upon which the industry depends. Still there is plenty of activity in the solar industry field to go around, and the onshore wind repowering field may see some benefits, too.

Trump has been insisting all year on a rate cut, a rate cut, a rate cut. That’s what he got, and according to the law of unintended consequences that may help his arch enemies, the US wind and solar industries, stay afloat over the next three years or so, until he leaves office as scheduled — peacefully one hopes, this time — on January 20, 2029.

Carrier Carries The Torch For Battery-Enabled HVAC, With Heat Pumps

In other news to hit the CleanTechnica inbox before Climate Week, on September 17 Carrier Global Corporation announced that it is trialing battery-enabled HVAC systems. If all goes according to plan, the new storage-plus-HVAC model will enable ordinary households to sock away renewable energy when excess wind and solar power are available, and deploy it under a strategic scenario to help grid managers stabilize the grid through periods of peak demand.

The experiment comes under the wing of Carrier’s new “Carrier Energy” branch. “Carrier has been shaping the future of climate technology since Willis Carrier invented modern air conditioning in 1902,” explained Carrier Chairman and CEO David Gitlin in a press statement. “Now, we’re installing our first battery-enabled HVAC systems in homes to validate performance. These systems can help strengthen the grid, support renewable integration and maintain comfort — all while adapting to evolving energy demands.”

The renewables-friendly effort hooks Carrier Energy up with EPRI, the independent Electric Power Research Institute, which is still carrying on the important task of modernizing the US grid in synch with the decentralized principles of Distributed Energy Resources, meaning wind and solar power among other scalable resources.

“Through these trials, Carrier is assessing how its next-generation HVAC system — pairing more efficient variable-speed heat pumps with battery storage — can help reduce peak demand by shifting energy use from on-peak to off-peak periods, providing greater grid flexibility and resilience,” the company explains.

To put the impact of the storage-plus-HVAC model on the pace of decarbonizing the US grid into perspective, Carrier suggests that we consider that about 30 million of its HVAC units are spinning their fans in homes across the US and Canada, cumulatively accounting for a 100-gigawatt potential for flexible demand. “At scale, these systems could offer utilities a powerful tool to manage electricity demand,” Carrier emphasizes.

So Much Winning For Renewable Energy, For Now

To be clear, Trump, his Cabinet, and his Republican allies in Congress are not hating on all forms of renewable energy. They just hate wind and solar. Hydropower, geothermal, biomass, and even the new field of marine energy are all in the clear, covered by the protective embrace of Trump’s “American Energy Dominance” plan, along with nuclear energy.

As for why wind and solar failed to make the American Energy Dominance cut, perhaps the US solar industry just had the misfortune to get caught in the crossfire when Trump aimed the full force of his perch in the White House to promote his personal vendetta against wind turbines.

If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread. Before you do, consider that “reliability” is the key word in Trump’s otherwise whackadoodle American Energy Dominance plan. As for what “reliability” actually means, your guess is as good as mine, but it probably refers back to an anachronistic, 20th century standard referring to the 24/7 availability of power generation regardless of the weather. Applied to the 21st century, though, the reliability standard conveniently skips over the modern world of energy storage, smart grid technologies, and virtual power plants. However, it does lend a thin veneer of respectability to an otherwise cockamamie energy policy that can only be ascribed to the whims of a dictator. After all, wind and solar — especially solar — are easily the most abundant, accessible and affordable domestic energy resources available today.

Come to think of it, though, since when has Trump needed to veneer anything? After all, this is the man who famously said, “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose any voters, OK?”

Well, if the US solar industry is going out, it’s going out with a bang. In yet another email to sail into the CleanTechnica inbox, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis reminded us that renewable energy in general, and solar energy in particular, has been saving the Texas grid from imploding under its own weight. Almost the entire Texas grid is managed by ERCOT, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which has been scrambling for all the in-state power generation resources it can get because Texas can’t depend on inter-state electricity sharing the way other states can (long story).

That’s where the Texas solar industry comes in. “Solar set a new ERCOT record (last Tuesday) on Sept. 9, generating almost half of total demand in the fast-growing Texas electricity market while providing more than 40% of the state’s electricity for seven straight hours, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.,” IEEFA reported earlier this week.

“The latest record is the 17th of 2025, an astounding 7,785 megawatts (MW) higher than the first record of 22,092 MW set Jan. 24,” IEEFA continued. “New data from ERCOT — the Electric Reliability Council of Texas — also highlights solar’s reliability over the summer: For the period from June 1 through Aug. 31, solar met 15.2% of all demand in the ERCOT system, more than coal’s 12.5% market share.”

Ohhhh there’s that reliability thing again. If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread. Better yet, find your representatives in Congress and tell them what you think.

Energy bills are a political flashpoint, and Hochul called affordability “our greatest short-term challenge” in a February letter assailing ConEd’s proposed hikes.","You may have noticed your energy bills going up recently. It’s not just you, and it’s about to get worse.

Electric bills in New York are the highest they’ve been in over a decade, even when taking inflation into account. More than a million households are at least two months behind on payments, owing utilities close to $2 billion. And record numbers of households had their electricity or gas shut off this spring, including more than 61,000 in May — the highest number the Public Utility Law Project (PULP), a decades-old consumer advocacy group, has ever seen.

Anxiety about unaffordable bills only mounted over the summer. Laurie Wheelock, PULP’s executive director, said this August was the group’s busiest month ever, with a surge in calls to its hotline. The top concern on people’s minds: rate hikes.

Utilities are successfully jacking up prices. At the same time, electricity demand is surging: New York, like many other states, is bringing new data centers, high-tech manufacturing, and other energy-hungry industries onto the grid, while also electrifying more home heating and transportation. And President Donald Trump’s onslaught of policies aimed at hindering renewables is only adding fuel to the fire.

Meanwhile, both the federal and state governments are eyeing deep cuts to assistance programs meant to help keep energy bills under control.

What’s behind the surging costs? Here’s what you need to know.

Utility Rate Hikes

Every energy bill in New York breaks down into two main parts: supply, which reflects the costs of producing the energy that you use, and delivery, which reflects what your local utility charges to get that energy to your home.

The delivery side is what’s mainly driven up bills over the last decade, and it’s still the fastest-growing part. It’s set through the state’s well worn “rate case” process: Utilities ask regulators for bill increases to cover their operating costs and pay for new infrastructure. After negotiations, the state’s Public Service Commission, or PSC, approves a compromise deal. Then rates go up, though usually by less than the utility had asked for.

In recent years, utilities have requested far bigger hikes.

“We used to see single-digit rate hikes and now we see double-digit rate hikes,” said Jessica Azulay, executive director of the advocacy group Alliance for a Green Economy. Since the pandemic, several utilities have requested increases of 25 percent or more to their delivery rates — and this year, as much as 39 percent. “That’s a new normal that is unacceptable,” Azulay said.

As of September, some 75 percent of the state’s electric customers and almost half of gas customers had rate hikes pending or recently approved. The latest proposals, from upstate utilities NYSEG and RG&E, would increase electric bills by $33 a month. NYSEG’s proposal would increase gas bills by the same amount — a whopping one-third increase. (Regulators are unlikely to approve the full requests.)

The companies said in July that the hikes were needed “to pay for rebuilding an aging grid and expanding its capacity to meet residents’ and businesses’ service demands,” including making repairs after storms. They said the plan would create more than 1,000 jobs.

PSC spokesperson James Denn said the hikes that the commission approves owe largely to factors outside the state’s control.

Much of New York’s utility infrastructure is getting too old to operate efficiently and safely, and is in urgent need of upgrading. But the cost of those upgrades has spiked “due to inflation, higher interest rates, supply chain disruptions, the global push to upgrade electrical infrastructure, and, most recently, the rising risk and uncertainty from tariffs,” Denn said.

Many have blamed New York’s clean energy efforts for the hikes, but official estimates suggest they remain a minor factor. A long-awaited PSC report presented on Thursday found that state climate policies accounted for anywhere from 5 to 9.5 percent of the average household’s electric bill in 2024, or $10 to $12 per month, depending on the utility. (The impact on gas bills was far smaller, at 2 percent or less.)

Those costs straddle both the supply and delivery sides of the bill. They include transmission upgrades aimed at greening the grid, utility programs to switch households to electric appliances like heat pumps, and subsidies for renewable and nuclear energy statewide, among other expenses.

Those expenses are still outweighed by more traditional utility spending. The companies are investing heavily to harden their infrastructure against extreme weather — adapting in part to the impacts of climate change, as efforts to slow it fall ever further behind target. They’re still pouring billions into maintaining and expanding local gas systems, even as homes and businesses use less of the fuel. They’re also hiring more staff, paying higher property taxes, and confronting equipment shortages. The amount New Yorkers are shelling out for the energy transition still looks small by comparison.

Energy Supply Costs Also Growing

The cost of producing energy in the first place is getting more expensive, too — and Trump’s policies could push it up higher.

Trump’s multi-pronged attack on renewables has jeopardized the kinds of energy projects that, in states like New York, are the closest to being built. That’s stifling new supply to the grid, even as demand surges, and increasing reliance on gas.

Under Trump’s July megabill, solar and wind projects will lose a longstanding 30 percent federal tax credit unless they begin construction by mid-2026 or complete it by the end of 2027. That alone will make them more expensive to build. But Trump has also thrown up a slew of other new hurdles to renewable development, rewriting everything from tax rules to bird conservation laws in ways that will make investments riskier, at best. That, too, will come at a cost, experts say.

Tariffs, and the constant threat that they will be increased, add another layer of expense and uncertainty.

All told, Trump’s policies will likely kill a large share of wind and solar projects, particularly in states like New York, where new energy is already challenging and pricey to build. The state Department of Public Service — the agency working alongside the PSC — estimates that the full gamut of Trump’s policy changes will cost New York $60 billion in renewable energy investment.

Developers remain bullish that some projects will survive, but they will come at a premium.

“It just means more expensive power,” said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.

Less renewable energy means even greater reliance on gas, which already supplies roughly half of New York’s electricity, and close to two-thirds of its home heating. With fewer alternatives coming onto the grid than expected, New York’s energy markets will likely be hitched to the fuel for years to come.

That means they will also be increasingly tethered to global markets. The US’s gas export capacity is set to more than double by 2028 and continue growing from there, a policy Trump has championed — and a key reason that the US Energy Information Administration expects gas prices to climb sharply again this year after dropping to a historic low in 2024.

The more gas the US sells around the world, the more vulnerable domestic consumers will be to price shocks driven by geopolitical events like Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, said Dennis Wamsted, an analyst at the pro-renewable Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

“In some ways you can’t fault the exporters for passing along those costs,” Wamsted said. “But it does raise the very real question of, what kind of risk are we putting rate payers at or consumers at going forward… if we become more reliant on gas-fired electricity generation?”

The Trump administration has offered a straightforward answer: “drill, baby, drill,” and supply will outpace growing demand to keep prices down.

“Joe Biden’s Green New Scam agenda crushed America’s energy industry with stifling regulations, causing electricity prices to soar by more than 30 percent in just four years,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers in an emailed statement. “Beginning on Day One, President Trump began rolling back these policies and unleashed American energy to lower costs for families and businesses.”

Trump’s most direct foray into New York energy politics has been pressuring Governor Kathy Hochul to revive two controversial pipeline projects that the state previously rejected. Backers of the two pipelines argue that they will save consumers money by increasing energy supply to the region.

Some analysts have challenged that claim, pointing to the substantial up-front construction costs. The utility National Grid estimates its downstate gas customers will pay an extra $7.50 per month, on average, to build the NESE pipeline, in exchange for cheaper electricity statewide. A recent report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis suggests the utility is likely underestimating the upfront costs and exaggerating the savings.

On Thursday, the PSC endorsed the pipeline in an order approving National Grid’s long-term gas plan for New York, saying it was needed for reliability. The pipeline still needs environmental permits from New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.

Even if Trump and his allies succeed in bringing more gas to the northeast, it may only offer a stopgap to the state’s strained energy system. Roughly a quarter of New York’s fossil fuel plants are reaching retirement age in the next few years, according to the state’s grid operator, and numerous hurdles stand in the way of replacing them.

One of the biggest is the supply chain. Wait times for the central component of gas plants — turbines — are as long as seven years.

Moreover, in New York — which is targeting a zero-emissions grid by 2040 — there is not a single new gas plant currently on the table. Even if the state government were to reverse course and begin approving them again, such plants would likely take years to plan, permit, and build.

“Those constraints don’t go away by making it harder to build renewables now,” said Julia Hoos, Head of USA East at the firm Aurora Energy Research; under Trump’s policies, it just becomes harder to build energy in general. Those kinds of supply constraints could contribute to rising costs.

What Is to Be Done?

Energy bills are a political flashpoint, and Hochul called affordability “our greatest short-term challenge” in a February letter assailing ConEd’s proposed hikes. But critics charge that the governor is making the problem worse by cutting a key program to help New Yorkers fix up their homes and cut their bills.

The Empower+ cuts come as the state’s new draft energy plan highlights energy efficiency as a key way to rein in costs and improve quality of life for low- and moderate-income households. “The prospect of massive funding cuts for that program … goes against what the state’s own analysis says needs to happen to help bring down energy bills for households,” said Azulay.

Asked about her record on energy affordability, Hochul’s office touted $1.4 billion in utility bill savings, mainly delivered through Covid-era bailouts; support for rooftop and community solar; and the state’s recent expansion of the Energy Affordability Program, which will give more moderate-income households access to monthly bill discounts funded by utility customers as a whole.

“At a time when the federal government has waged war on renewable energy, the Governor is focused on a all-of-the-above approach to energy to increase supply and drive costs down,” Hochul spokesperson Ken Lovett said in an email.

Some lawmakers are seeking structural reforms to rein in utility profits. The PSC already sets the profit rates that utilities are allowed to earn on their investments; Denn, the spokesperson, said that recent increases were a product of post-pandemic inflation, and that New York keeps utility shareholder returns well below the national average. But critics have argued that state regulators are granting rates far higher than market conditions warrant, allowing utility shareholders to line their pockets at customers’ expense.

A New York bill sponsored by Senator Shellie Mayer and Assemblymember Didi Barrett aims to shave those profits by revamping the accounting that the PSC uses to set them. The bill has passed the Senate three times with bipartisan support, but has yet to gain traction in the Assembly. Hochul hasn’t taken a position on it.

Watchdogs say there are more savings to unlock in other technical aspects of the ratemaking process, known as “rate design.” The negotiations that decide them are close to impenetrable for non-experts, but mounting outrage is inspiring more New Yorkers to try and crack open the process.

“There is definitely a groundswell of concern,” said PULP’s Wheelock. “We go to meetings and we’re getting questions about rate design, like, ‘What is the revenue decoupling mechanism?’ Never had that question before.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47661/3ZCqPgWQlWTg3quTgD3Pne0w9vprEQLx2ZeDyiH3bOo/w%3A820/h%3A546/rt%3Afill/g%3Afp%3A0.5%3A0.5/q%3A90/el%3A1/ahr0chm6ly9zmy51cy1lyxn0ltiuyw1hem9uyxdzlmnvbs9uexnmb2n1cy9syxrllwhpa2vzlnbuzw1758221832.png?h=4bc2b340&itok=l3LPcWyS,N,,2025-09-18 16:02:46.667270

Lobbying & Government.,"Poll: Clean energy popular among everyone, even Republicans - Florida Politics",Janelle Irwin Taylor,,,,,https://floridapolitics.com/archives/756749-poll-clean-energy-popular-among-everyone-even-republicans/,"A new poll shows that Floridians overwhelmingly support clean energy, with about 78% of respondents indicating they prefer a clean alternative.
“Working families and small businesses will continue to feel the pinch of higher electricity prices if Florida is over-reliant on any one energy source,” Conservatives for Clean Energy Florida Executive Director Zachary Colletti said.
But while an overwhelming majority of Republicans support clean energy, there still lies a notable drop-off when it comes to strong support, the poll found.
While 63% say they support clean energy, only 18% of Republicans strongly support it, compared to 44% overall.
And there is a political divide when it comes to nuclear energy, with Republicans supporting restarting previously decommissioned plants more than Democrats, at 75% to just 41%.","A new poll shows that Floridians overwhelmingly support clean energy, with about 78% of respondents indicating they prefer a clean alternative. That includes more than 60% of Republicans.

The poll, taken by Cygnal Aug. 26-27 for the group Conservatives for Clean Energy, found the vast majority of Floridians (82%) are frustrated by rising utility costs, a sentiment likely driving support for alternative energy sources, including solar and nuclear.

Two-thirds of voters (67%) say they are more likely to support a candidate who backs solar energy expansion, while 68% say they are more likely to support candidates who back rooftop solar-friendly policy.

Meanwhile, 62% of respondents say they support expanded production of nuclear energy, including restarting decommissioned plants.

“Working families and small businesses will continue to feel the pinch of higher electricity prices if Florida is over-reliant on any one energy source,” Conservatives for Clean Energy Florida Executive Director Zachary Colletti said. “Florida voters are ready to support leaders who protect their pocketbooks and peace of mind. Expanding solar and getting serious about nuclear are key to delivering both for Floridians.”

About 70% of respondents believe that energy independence is a matter of national security.

The results are likely driven by respondents’ top priorities centering on pocketbook issues, with inflation and cost of living (25%), taxes and government spending (15%) and housing affordability (10%) dominating the top three issues. Pair that with the 82% of respondents who say energy prices are getting more expensive, and it’s easy to see how respondents’ financial concerns are shaping their views.

But while an overwhelming majority of Republicans support clean energy, there still lies a notable drop-off when it comes to strong support, the poll found. While 63% say they support clean energy, only 18% of Republicans strongly support it, compared to 44% overall. Still, 57% of Republicans polled say they are less likely to vote for a candidate who opposes policies that increase U.S. energy production.

And there is a political divide when it comes to nuclear energy, with Republicans supporting restarting previously decommissioned plants more than Democrats, at 75% to just 41%.

The poll provides useful insight ahead of the 2026 Midterms as candidates build their campaigns, indicating potential winning strategies on energy issues.

It also offers insight into the Governor’s race, with a generic Republican candidate dominating at 51% to just 38% for a generic Democrat; The remaining respondents are undecided. It’s worth noting that even though more than 89% of Republicans say they would support a Republican candidate for Governor, 5% say they would support a Democrat and another more than 5% are still unsure.

The poll was taken among 1,000 likely 2026 General Election voters, with a sample consisting of 46% Republicans, 32% Democrats, 18% no-party voters and 2% each who indicated another affiliation or who did not provide information.

Performed in November 2024 and released in September 2025, the study validates that Clean Harbors’ high-temperature, RCRA-permitted incineration process destroys PFAS over 99.9999% effectively, meets or exceeds the strictest EPA emissions standards, and does so at scale.
Key findings: The incineration process was evaluated by stringent standards including OTM-50 and Method 0010 and showed no detectable fluorinated emissions.
What remains to be seen is the pace at which state and federal regulations will integrate validated incineration into mandated PFAS cleanup and disposal frameworks.
Bottom line: Clean Harbors’ joint study with the EPA and DoD provides the strongest evidence yet that PFAS can be safely, effectively and permanently destroyed.","For years, PFAS (“forever chemicals”) have posed a growing public health and environmental concern. Found in firefighting foams, industrial products, water supplies, soils and more, PFAS compounds are difficult to destroy, resist degradation, and have been linked to cancer, immune system disruptions, and other serious health effects. With regulatory and community pressure mounting, the need for safe, verifiable destruction has never been more urgent.

A new study out of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted in concert with the Department of Defense (DoD) and Clean Harbors, offers what may be the most compelling commercial-scale solution yet.

Performed in November 2024 and released in September 2025, the study validates that Clean Harbors’ high-temperature, RCRA-permitted incineration process destroys PFAS over 99.9999% effectively, meets or exceeds the strictest EPA emissions standards, and does so at scale.

Key findings:

The incineration process was evaluated by stringent standards including OTM-50 and Method 0010 and showed no detectable fluorinated emissions.

Ambient air emissions from the process were 2-8X lower than any state or federal limit.

A broad range of PFAS compounds were tested, including AFFF (aqueous film-forming foam) concentrate, PFOA, PFOS, PFBA, PFDA, PFHxA, PFHxS, and “GenX” (HFPO-DA), among others.

Third-party experts reviewed the data independently – Dr. Melvin Keener (CRWI) and Dr. Jens Blotevogel (CSIRO) both affirmed the study’s findings.

Why this matters:

This study represents a milestone in PFAS remediation for several reasons:

Many prior methods promised degradation, containment, or filtration, but few at scale with this level of measurement and third-party validation.

For communities, industries and regulators, proof of permanent destruction rather than long-term containment or recycling means compliance pathways that reduce risk and worry.

Lower emissions, verified under stringent methods, matter not just for regulatory compliance but for public trust and environmental safety.

What remains to be seen is the pace at which state and federal regulations will integrate validated incineration into mandated PFAS cleanup and disposal frameworks.

Bottom line:

Clean Harbors’ joint study with the EPA and DoD provides the strongest evidence yet that PFAS can be safely, effectively and permanently destroyed. For industries grappling with PFAS liability, for communities demanding removal, and for regulatory bodies seeking enforceable solutions, this is the breakthrough many have been waiting for.

“The evidence for current and future harm to human health and welfare created by human-caused GHGs is beyond scientific dispute,” the report says, referring to greenhouse gases.
“Much of the understanding of climate change that was uncertain or tentative in 2009 is now resolved and new threats have been identified,” it says.
The endangerment finding also underlies climate regulations, and the proposal to overturn it came alongside a proposal to revoke car emission rules.
“As we saw in the 16 intervening years since the Endangerment Finding was made, many of the extremely pessimistic predictions and assumptions EPA relied upon have not materialized as expected.","In response to the Trump administration repeatedly saying otherwise, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine on Wednesday issued a report that emphasized that climate change’s harms are “beyond scientific dispute.”

The report from the National Academies, which seek to provide science that informs the government, comes as a rebuke to the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to overturn a 2009 determination that planet-warming greenhouse gases pose a threat to the public.

“The evidence for current and future harm to human health and welfare created by human-caused GHGs is beyond scientific dispute,” the report says, referring to greenhouse gases.

“Much of the understanding of climate change that was uncertain or tentative in 2009 is now resolved and new threats have been identified,” it says. “The United States faces a future in which climate-induced harm continues to worsen and today’s extremes become tomorrow’s norms.”

The National Academies undertook the report after the EPA proposed to overturn the 2009 “endangerment finding,” which determined that greenhouse gas emissions threaten public health and welfare.

The endangerment finding also underlies climate regulations, and the proposal to overturn it came alongside a proposal to revoke car emission rules.

Shirley Tilghman, chair of the committee that wrote Wednesday’s report, said in a written statement the study was done “with the ultimate aim of informing the EPA … as it considers the status of the endangerment finding.”

“We are hopeful that the evidence summarized here shows the strong base of scientific evidence available to inform sound decision-making,” Tilghman added.

In response, an EPA spokesperson reiterated the administration’s concerns with the Obama-era finding.

“The Endangerment Finding has been used by the Obama and Biden Administrations to justify trillions of dollars of greenhouse gas regulations covering new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines,” the spokesperson said in a written statement.

“As we saw in the 16 intervening years since the Endangerment Finding was made, many of the extremely pessimistic predictions and assumptions EPA relied upon have not materialized as expected. EPA welcomes all public comments on the proposal through September 22, 2025, and the agency looks forward to responding to a diverse array of perspectives on this issue,” the statement continued.

In their report, the National Academies concluded the 2009 finding “was accurate, has stood the test of time, and is now reinforced by even stronger evidence.”

“Changes in climate resulting from human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases harm the welfare of people in the United States,” the report says, pointing to “negative impacts on agricultural crops and livestock,” as well as “climate-related changes in water availability and quality” and harmful algal blooms and other stressors on communities and infrastructure.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/wildfire_climate_change_09112024_AP_AP24255519680761.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-18 18:03:03.454397

The cost to charge at Level 2 charging stations in Batavia has been reduced from 40 cents to 25 cents per kWh.
The charging stations at the high school are expected to be operational by the end of the month.
Gas-powered vehicles parked at charging stations will be subject to $100 fines and can be towed, regardless of the length of time they are parked.
Police Chief Eric Blowers said a state statute imposes a $75 fine for gas-powered vehicles that park at EV charging stations.","The Batavia City Council has made it less expensive to charge an electric vehicle in town while adding restrictions and fees for prolonged parking at charging stations.

Council members unanimously approved an ordinance during their Monday meeting to reduce charging rates at EV stations within the city and to add loitering fees.

The cost to charge at Level 2 charging stations in Batavia has been reduced from 40 cents to 25 cents per kWh. Batavia’s incoming Level 3 chargers, which operate at a significantly faster rate, will cost 50 cents per kWh.

Batavia has a Level 2 station at the Government Center downtown and is installing Level 3 chargers at Batavia High School and another location that’s yet to be determined. The charging stations at the high school are expected to be operational by the end of the month.

The newly approved ordinance allows for owners of EVs left at Batavia stations after they’re fully charged to be fined $1 per minute for parking, with a maximum fee of $120. That would kick in following a 30-minute grace period allowed for owners to move their EVs when they’re done charging.

Gas-powered vehicles parked at charging stations will be subject to $100 fines and can be towed, regardless of the length of time they are parked.

EV charging is monitored through apps that alert owners once their vehicle is fully powered, which is when the grace period begins.

Council member Alan Wolff asked how the parking at charging stations would be monitored.

Steve Allen, Batavia’s electric superintendent, said if an EV is left plugged in, the time would be shown on the charging equipment. If an owner unplugs a vehicle but leaves it parked there, that timing would have to be monitored through other surveillance measures.

Police Chief Eric Blowers said a state statute imposes a $75 fine for gas-powered vehicles that park at EV charging stations. He said municipalities can increase the fine to $100 and reserve the right to tow those vehicles at the owners’ expense.",https://imengine.public.prod.pdh.navigacloud.com/?uuid=b51d4028-cf77-57fe-83dd-0b80f21ee66f&function=fit&type=preview,N,,2025-09-18 16:03:39.041061

This reduction is aimed at supporting India’s renewable energy targets, job creation, and clean energy transition.

The tax rate rationalisation is expected to lower the costs of clean energy projects, directly benefiting domestic households, farmers, industries, and developers.

The capital cost for utility-scale solar projects, which is typically between Rs35m ($398,493) to Rs40m per megawatt, will now see savings of Rs2m to Rs2.5m per megawatt.

For a 500MW solar park, this equates to cost reductions exceeding Rs1bn, enhancing tariff competitiveness.

The reduction in GST rates is projected to decrease the levelised tariffs for renewable energy, thereby reducing the economic strain on distribution companies.

This could potentially lead to an annual reduction in power procurement expenses across the country, ranging from Rs20bn to Rs30bn.

The initiative will also reduce the expense of installing solar panels on residential rooftops.

Households can expect to save approximately Rs9,000 to Rs10,500 on a standard 3kW rooftop setup, promoting mass uptake through the PM Surya Ghar: Free Electricity Scheme.

Farmers benefitting from the PM-KUSUM scheme will see substantial savings as well. A 5HP solar pump, previously costing about Rs250,000, will now be cheaper by nearly Rs17,500.

With an estimated one million solar pumps, farmers could collectively save Rs17.5bn, making irrigation more affordable and sustainable.

It will also foster economically viable decentralised options such as mini-grids, applications for enhancing livelihoods, and solar-powered water pumps, offering significant benefits for rural and underprivileged areas.

With India’s aim to incorporate approximately 300GW of renewable energy by 2030, even a slight cost decrease of 2-3% could unlock an investment potential of up to Rs1.5tn.

Given that each gigawatt of production generates roughly 5,000 employment opportunities, these changes could facilitate the creation of 500,000 to 700,000 direct and indirect jobs throughout the coming ten years.

Additionally, it is projected that every gigawatt of solar energy capacity can reduce carbon emissions by approximately 1.3 million tonnes per annum (mtpa). With the streamlining of GST, this could lead to a reduction of up to 70mtpa of emissions annually by 2030.

Key Takeaways

The U.S. interest rate has fluctuated considerably over the decades, reaching above 19% during the early 1980s and later falling to near zero in the 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic.

The Federal Reserve made their first interest rate cut of this year of 25 basis points on September 17th, and projects rates to decline to 3.50–3.75% by the end of 2025.

In the U.S., raising or lowering the interest rate is one of the Federal Reserve’s most powerful tools for shaping the economy. It influences everything from borrowing costs for households to global capital flows.

With the Federal Reserve cutting the interest rate for the first time in 2025 this week, this graphic takes a look back at how this cut and rate projections to the end of 2025 look in historical perspective.

This chart shows how the Federal Funds Rate has changed from 1954 to September 2025 with projections through the end of 2025, using data from the Federal Reserve and their latest Summary of Economic Projections.

How the Interest Rate Has Changed Since 1954

Over the past seven decades, the U.S. interest rate has moved through cycles of extreme highs and historic lows.

The table below includes the data of the average interest rate each year since 1954, with the 2025 average including the Federal Reserve’s projections of two additional cuts by the end of the year.

In their most recent interest rate announcement on September 17, 2025, the Federal Reserve announced their first interest rate cut of 2025 of 25 basis points (bps).

The Federal Reserve’s Summary of Economic Projections was released alongside the announcement, where more than half of the board members projected at least an additional two 25 bps rate cuts this year.

If these further rate cuts were to manifest, the interest rate would move down from its current target range of 4.00–4.25% to 3.50–3.75%.

The Volcker Era and Double-Digit Rates

The early 1980s marked the most dramatic spike in interest rates.

With inflation climbing into double digits but economic growth slowing (also known as stagflation), the Fed pushed rates above 19%, triggering a recession but eventually restoring price stability.

This remains the highest point in the modern history of U.S. interest rates, and is known as the “Volcker Shock”: when Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker broke the back of rising inflation.

The 2008 Financial Crisis and Pandemic Era’s Near-Zero Rates

In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the Fed slashed the interest rate to almost zero. By December 2008, the effective Federal Funds Rate had fallen to the lowest positive range of 0.00–0.25%.

This was the start of a prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates that lasted nearly a decade. While the Federal Reserve had engaged in raising the interest rate back up from late 2015 to 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the Fed to return to near-zero rates.

During this stretch, the interest rate was slashed to the 0.00–0.25% target range to provide liquidity and a more supportive economic environment amidst an unprecedented global shutdown.

Not long after, the interest rate was rapidly raised in 2022–2023 to a high range of 5.25–5.50% to combat the sharpest surge in inflation in 40 years.

Three rate cuts at the end of 2024 brought the interest rate down to the 4.25–4.50% range for most of 2025, before this most recent cut.

Salary by Education Level in the United States

This was originally posted on our Voronoi app. Download the app for free on iOS or Android and discover incredible data-driven charts from a variety of trusted sources.

Key Takeaways

Earnings increase with higher levels of education, ranging from a median annual salary of $48,360 for those with just a high school diploma to $122,876 for professional degree holders.

The largest salary jump occurs at the bachelor’s degree level, highlighting the value of a four-year college education.

In the U.S., the connection between education and income is stark, with higher education leading to higher median earnings consistently.

This visualization highlights how median annual salaries change at each successive level of educational attainment in the United States, using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for 2024.

Earnings by Education Level in the U.S. in 2024

Annual median earnings vary significantly across education levels in the U.S., ranging from a median of just $38,376 for those with no high school education to a high of $122,876 for professional degree holders.

The data table below has the annual median salary by education level in the United States for 2024:

Education levelAnnual median earnings Professional degree$122,876 Doctoral degree$118,456 Master's degree$95,680 Bachelor's degree$80,236 Associate's degree$57,148 Some college (no degree)$53,040 High school diploma$48,360 Less than a high school diploma$38,376

Doctoral degree holders in the U.S. earn an annual median of $118,456, and have one of the largest salary differences the previous level of education, earning $22,776 more than masters degree holders (who earn an annual median of $95,680).

The earnings increase of getting a master’s degree after a bachelor’s isn’t as large of a gap at $15,444, due to the relatively high median salary of $80,236 for bachelor’s degree holders.

The Bachelor’s Degree Salary Premium

The most pronounced gap appears between associate and bachelor’s degree holders. Earning a bachelor’s degree adds $23,088 to the median salary compared to an associate degree. That’s a 40% increase over associate degree holders’ annual median salary of $57,148.

This underscores the financial advantage of completing a four-year college program, even if graduate study is not pursued.

While not as large of a dollar increase, earning a high school diploma is also quite valuable, adding $9,984 to annual median earnings.

This ends up being a 26% salary increase over the $38,376 median for those with no high school diploma, and is the second-largest salary increase between education levels after that of the bachelor’s degree.

It’s worth keeping in mind that along with boosting earning power, each level of education also likely improves job stability and long-term career growth.

Aidala,,,,,https://www.lawbc.com/proposed-cuts-to-wind-energy-undermine-investment-certainty-across-sectors/,"An earlier executive order also suspended all new offshore wind leasing and permitting, triggering a government-wide review of prior approvals.
These developments are significant not only for the offshore wind industry, but for all sectors that rely on a stable, predictable, permitting and approval process.
The offshore wind cancellations arrive at a moment of declining capital investment in U.S. clean energy.
The wind energy cancellations also risk destabilizing confidence in the energy sector as a whole.
The consequences reach far beyond wind energy — affecting every sector that depends on long-term investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, and innovation.","In recent weeks, the Trump Administration has taken a series of actions to curtail federal support for offshore wind development. The most visible step was the U.S. Department of Transportation’s cancellation of roughly $679 million in funding for 12 offshore wind projects across 11 states. In addition, the Administration halted construction of the nearly complete $4 billion Revolution Wind project serving Rhode Island and Connecticut, citing national security concerns. An earlier executive order also suspended all new offshore wind leasing and permitting, triggering a government-wide review of prior approvals. These developments are significant not only for the offshore wind industry, but for all sectors that rely on a stable, predictable, permitting and approval process.

The offshore wind cancellations arrive at a moment of declining capital investment in U.S. clean energy. According to recent reporting, renewable energy investment fell by more than 36 percent in the first half of 2025 compared to the previous six months. While renewables are most directly affected, the broader message is one that resonates across industries: even projects that are well advanced, heavily capitalized, and already employing thousands of workers may be at risk. The implications extend beyond offshore wind. If energy developers, manufacturers, or chemical producers cannot rely on federal approvals to endure from “start to finish,” the result is widespread uncertainty in long-term planning and capital allocation — the true nemesis of business.

Halting projects that are nearly complete raises important questions about government efficiency and stewardship of public funds. Taxpayer dollars have already been allocated to support these projects. Private capital has already been deployed. Labor forces and supply chains are already engaged. Reversals at this stage risk creating stranded assets — facilities, equipment, and infrastructure that may never be used for their intended purpose. The cost is not only financial, but reputational: industries across the economy take note when government approvals no longer provide reliable assurances of project completion.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce (USCC) recently underscored the importance of “permitting certainty from start to finish.” Its argument is straightforward: businesses can adapt to new requirements, longer timelines, or higher compliance costs — but they cannot adapt to unpredictability. When a $4 billion project that is more than 80 percent complete can be halted on short notice, it signals to all investors that risk exposure is no longer calculable. That perception chills investment, slows innovation, and drives capital — domestic and international — to markets where regulatory frameworks are viewed as more stable.

The wind energy cancellations also risk destabilizing confidence in the energy sector as a whole. While natural gas and other conventional energy sources may appear insulated, investors understand that regulatory reversals in one segment of the energy economy may presage similar actions elsewhere. Pipeline projects, port expansions, and transmission upgrades are equally vulnerable if the underlying principle — that federal approvals can be relied upon — no longer holds. Customers and contractors who depend on long-term contracts for energy production can no longer count on the security and stability these projects provide. In fact, consumers’ energy prices will likely go up as a result of the offshore wind project’s cancellation.

For states, the fallout is immediate. Governors in California, Rhode Island, and Connecticut have raised concerns about job losses and stranded investments in their regions. Litigation challenging the Administration’s actions is already underway. For policymakers, the lesson is clear: regulatory consistency is as critical as regulatory stringency. Industry stakeholders can and do invest in compliance, innovation, and adaptation. What undermines confidence is not the presence of rules, but the absence of predictability.

As the USCC noted, permitting certainty is a cornerstone of competitiveness. Without it, projects stall, taxpayer dollars are wasted, and private capital flees to more stable markets. The consequences reach far beyond wind energy — affecting every sector that depends on long-term investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, and innovation. Both domestic and international capital markets are less likely to get involved in projects that could be cancelled even when they are eighty percent complete. Such policies could cause businesses to opt out of producing products in the United States entirely.

The Administration’s recent actions on offshore wind highlight a broader challenge: balancing evolving policy priorities with the need for regulatory stability. For the energy sector, and indeed for the U.S. economy at large, ensuring that government approvals provide genuine certainty “from start to finish” will be essential to maintaining investment, creating jobs, and achieving long-term energy and economic goals.",https://www.lawbc.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-453997027-e1758218428883.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 15:02:19.071323

U.S. policymakers have become increasingly explicit: China’s control of rare earth refining, estimated at 80–90% of global capacity, represents a strategic vulnerability.
“This agreement represents a shared mission to lessen China’s grip on the rare earth ecosystem in the West,” Mr. Ryan said.
Rare earth markets are notoriously cyclical, with prices prone to sharp swings that can challenge even well-prepared producers.
Outlook As autumn approaches, Ucore Rare Metals finds itself in a position of rare leverage.","On the site of a once-quiet Air Force base in central Louisiana, crews are remaking an 80,000-square-foot warehouse into what could become a cornerstone of America’s critical minerals supply chain. Ucore Rare Metals Inc. (TSXV: UCU | OTCQX: UURAF), a small Canadian company with big ambitions, broke ground this summer on its Strategic Metals Complex (SMC) in Alexandria. If successful, the facility will separate rare earth oxides used in electric vehicles, wind turbines, and defense systems — materials long dominated by China.

Since June, Ucore has moved from concept to execution, supported by both government funding and renewed investor interest. Its stock, which traded near C$1.20 in early summer, is now at approximately C$3.44* on the TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV: UCU) and around US$2.49* on the OTCQX (OTCQX: UURAF). That represents a threefold increase and brings the company close to a multi-year high. The momentum reflects a growing belief that Ucore is positioned to deliver on its long-stated plan to establish a North American rare earth supply chain. (*Stock prices were taken at 10:47 AM EST on September 18, 2025.)

Investor Sentiment Turns Positive

For much of the past decade, Ucore was a speculative name — its Alaska deposit at Bokan Mountain widely discussed but years from development. What changed this summer was tangible progress in Louisiana, backed by Pentagon funding and state incentives. A June financing raised C$15.5 million, earmarked for advancing the SMC and securing offtake agreements. The raise was oversubscribed, and the pricing close to market levels signaled that institutional investors were willing to support the project without deep discounts.

The market’s response has been swift. Trading volumes increased through July and August, with the stock climbing more than 150% from its June lows. Analysts covering the sector note that Ucore’s market capitalization, now approximately C$285 million, still represents anticipation rather than current earnings. But the shift in sentiment suggests that investors see a more credible pathway to commercial revenue — an uncommon level of visibility for a junior mining company.

Fast-Tracking the Louisiana Refinery

The centerpiece of Ucore’s strategy is the Louisiana SMC. The facility will employ the company’s proprietary RapidSX™ technology, an evolution of conventional solvent extraction that promises faster and more efficient separation of rare earth elements. At a demonstration plant in Kingston, Ontario, Ucore has logged thousands of hours refining mixed concentrates, de-risking the technology before commercial deployment.

The Alexandria complex is being built in stages. The first phase targets about 2,000 tons per year of separated oxides by 2026, scaling up to 5,000–7,500 tons by 2028. Company statements suggest an even more ambitious target of 12,000 tons annually by 2027 if financing and market conditions allow. For context, that would represent roughly one-third of projected U.S. demand outside of China.

Location offers strategic advantages. The SMC sits within a Foreign Trade Zone, allowing duty-free import and export of materials. Feedstock could arrive from allied nations such as Australia or Greenland, be processed in Louisiana, and shipped to customers in Japan or the U.S. without tariff penalties. As CEO Pat Ryan shared with me earlier this year, “You can bring inputs from Brazil, process the material, and send it back to Japan for magnet making with no tariff consequence coming in or going out.”

Government as Backstop

What distinguishes Ucore from many rare earth hopefuls is the extent of government backing. In June, the company secured an $18.4 million award from the U.S. Department of Defense, bringing its total Pentagon funding to $22.4 million since 2022. The money will help build and commission the first full-scale RapidSX production line in Louisiana. Unlike traditional loans or equity raises, these funds are non-dilutive, a direct subsidy to accelerate Ucore’s development.

The grant comes under the DoD’s Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment program, which supports projects deemed essential for national security. U.S. policymakers have become increasingly explicit: China’s control of rare earth refining, estimated at 80–90% of global capacity, represents a strategic vulnerability. Earlier this year, China imposed new export controls on seven rare earth elements — samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium — underscoring the fragility of existing supply chains.

Louisiana’s state government has also contributed, providing roughly $15 million in incentives including tax abatements and infrastructure upgrades. Ottawa and Ontario have supplied smaller grants to support the Kingston pilot plant. The cumulative effect is that Ucore is advancing its refinery with a meaningful portion of costs underwritten by public funds.

Securing Feedstock and Partnerships

Processing capacity is only as valuable as the material it can refine. In late August, Ucore announced a preliminary 10-year offtake agreement with Critical Metals Corp. (NASDAQ: CRML), which is developing the Tanbreez rare earth project in Greenland. The agreement would see up to 10,000 tons per year of concentrate shipped to Ucore’s Louisiana and Canadian facilities, beginning as early as 2027. Tanbreez is notable for its high proportion of heavy rare earths like dysprosium and terbium, metals with critical defense and EV applications.

“This agreement represents a shared mission to lessen China’s grip on the rare earth ecosystem in the West,” Mr. Ryan said. For Critical Metals, the deal validates the Greenland project’s commercial potential, while for Ucore it secures a non-Chinese source of critical feedstock just as its refinery is expected to scale.

Earlier this week, Ucore also partnered with Metallium Ltd. (ASX: MTM | OTCQX: MTMCF) of Australia to explore processing unconventional feedstocks — including magnet scrap, electronic waste, and fluorescent lamp phosphors. Metallium’s “Flash Joule Heating” process can break down such materials into concentrates that RapidSX can then separate into oxides. If proven at scale, this partnership could give Ucore flexibility to diversify inputs and bolster its green credentials by recycling materials already in circulation.

A Broader Geopolitical Contest

The backdrop to Ucore’s progress is a shifting geopolitical landscape. The U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia have all declared rare earths essential to their energy and defense futures. China, meanwhile, has demonstrated a willingness to wield its dominance as a strategic tool. In this context, Ucore’s Louisiana plant is not just a commercial venture but part of a broader industrial policy.

The risks are real. Rare earth markets are notoriously cyclical, with prices prone to sharp swings that can challenge even well-prepared producers. Execution risk also looms: Ucore must bring its refinery online on budget and on schedule, scale a new technology to commercial levels, and secure binding contracts with customers willing to pay for non-Chinese supply.

Yet the opportunity is equally stark. Global demand for rare earth magnets is forecast to grow at more than 8% annually through 2035, fueled by electric vehicles, renewable energy, and advanced defense systems. If Ucore meets its timelines, it could emerge as one of the first Western companies to provide significant heavy rare earth output at scale — a position that would attract not just investors but long-term customers and potentially further government support.

Outlook

As autumn approaches, Ucore Rare Metals finds itself in a position of rare leverage. It is well-funded, backed by the Pentagon and state incentives, and is building a refinery that could start producing within 18 months. Its shares have surged, its partnerships are broadening, and its mission aligns neatly with national security priorities.

For investors, the bet is clear: can a once-obscure junior miner translate policy momentum and pilot-plant success into commercial output at scale? If so, Ucore could become a pivotal player in reshaping how the West sources materials at the heart of the 21st-century economy.",https://investornews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/f1abb47a-0d07-4fc8-91e3-0068de9fce26.png,N,,2025-09-18 16:04:12.604339

That includes another 250,000 vehicles out of Pune, India; and 200,000 more at Hyundai’s electric vehicle plant in Ulsan, South Korea.
The automaker said it would also deliver parts for assembly into an additional 250,000 vehicles at plants in Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and North Africa.","ATLANTA (AP) — Hyundai Motor Group on Thursday confirmed it is going forward with previously announced plans to expand its Georgia plant, just weeks after an immigration raid delayed the startup of an electric vehicle battery plant at the site.

As part of a broader investment strategy, Hyundai said it would spend $2.7 billion to increase production capacity at the Ellabell site by 200,000 over the next three years, to a total of 500,000 vehicles a year.

The company first announced the expansion in March at the grand opening of the plant west of Savannah, and had said in August that it would invest an additional $5 billion in United States overall. But the raid, which included arrests of more than 300 South Korean citizens, led to questions about the wisdom of the Asian nation investing in the U.S..

The company said it now plans to produce 10 models of electric and hybrid gas-electric vehicles in Georgia, up from the current two the plant has been assembling as it ramps up production. Hyundai says it’s still on track to expand production worldwide to 5.6 million vehicles a year by 2030. The automaker pledged that 60% of those vehicles will be electric or hybrid powered, targeting sales in South Korea, North America and Europe.

Hyundai said that it plans to make more than 80% of vehicles sold in the United States domestically by 2030, with total domestic content increasing from 60% to 80%. For the first time, the vehicles would include a mid-sized pickup truck, a key vehicle class in the U.S. market. The company already makes the Santa Cruz model, a four-door compact pickup, that it started selling in 2021.

Hyundai CEO José Muñoz has said the immigration raid will delay opening the battery plant by at least two to three months. Spokesperson Michael Stewart said Thursday that the facility will open in the first half of 2026.

Both Hyundai executives and Georgia officials have been trying to calm the situation since the raid, which mushroomed into a diplomatic dispute between South Korea and the United States.

Republican Gov. Brian Kemp told reporters Tuesday at a ceremony marking the groundbreaking of a Rivian Automotive electric vehicle plant that he remains confident Georgia’s business advantages would “win out” in terms of foreign investment. The raid may even wind up smoothing the way for South Korean employees to more easily obtain legal permission to help build and operate facilities in the United States, he said.

“I’ve had good conversations with companies that are here doing business in Georgia, companies that are looking to do business here,” Kemp said. “And I’ve had good conversations with people in the White House about the visa issue.”

Brent Stubbs, the chief administrative officer of the Ellabell site, wrote in an opinion piece published Wednesday in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the company is still committed to Georgia.

“This situation doesn’t change our plans to continue expanding and localizing in the United States,” Stubbs wrote. “Our investments in America are part of a long-term strategic plan.”

The $2.7 billion investment confirmed Thursday will go to expanding capacity at the plant and group affiliates, Stewart said. Hyundai and its onsite affiliates currently have 3,129 employees in Ellabell, he said.

Hyundai and its joint-venture partner in the battery plant, LG Energy Solution, had previously announced $12.6 billion of investments at the Georgia site, with pledges to hire at least 8,500 workers by the end of 2031. State and local governments have promised $2.1 billion in tax breaks and other incentives.

The boost at the Ellabell site is the biggest part Hyundai’s plan to raise production by 1.2 million vehicles a year worldwide. That includes another 250,000 vehicles out of Pune, India; and 200,000 more at Hyundai’s electric vehicle plant in Ulsan, South Korea. The automaker said it would also deliver parts for assembly into an additional 250,000 vehicles at plants in Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and North Africa.

Hyundai underlined a previous announcement to deepen its investment in robotics and said that by 2027 it would launch extended-range electric vehicles with gasoline motors to extend the range of its electric batteries to more than 600 miles (960 kilometers).",https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/preview-1462.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 15:03:09.901293

Lawmakers emphasized growing bipartisan recognition that America’s permitting system needs to be modernized to keep pace with the country’s energy and infrastructure needs.

Fixing a Broken Process

The SPEED Act (Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-AR) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME)) would update the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the federal law that sets environmental review standards for major projects. Originally intended to ensure careful evaluation of environmental impacts, NEPA has grown into a lengthy and costly process that can stall projects in energy, infrastructure, and technology. The bill would impose clear deadlines for environmental review, limit litigation abuse, and create certainty across projects and administrations.

Committee Chairman and bill sponsor Bruce Westerman (R-AR) noted that the reform is not just about economics, but also about protecting the environment:

“The results of permitting are not only hurting economic development but often times we are missing opportunities to protect and enhance the environment…It is not just people who vote republican coming in my office to tell me that.”

He later added that Congress must seize the opportunity to establish a system that “doesn’t change when the administration changes” and that provides regulatory certainty across sectors.

Rep. Tim Walberg (R-MI) added that the existing system is a “bureaucratic maze,” emphasizing that:

“The SPEED Act presents an opportunity to make lasting change, and I hope we can move this bill forward in the House soon.”

Industry Leaders Sound the Alarm

Industry voices have also echoed the need for permitting reform. The American Petroleum Institute (API) unveiled a policy roadmap calling for durable solutions to clear the backlog of stalled projects. API President and CEO Mike Sommers said:

“American energy is ready to go, but Washington’s broken permitting system is standing in the way. As energy demand rises, critical infrastructure to deliver it is stuck behind red tape. It’s time for Congress to act on durable reforms that ensure access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy – because when America builds, America wins.”

API thanked lawmakers on the bill, posting on social media:

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also weighed in, highlighting its support in a post:

The IPAA has also repeatedly stressed the need for permitting reform, highlighting the abuse of NEPA in a recent letter with the Foundation for American Innovation:

“While laws like the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) were written with good intentions, they have evolved into procedural gauntlets. In the 1970s, the NEPA process for highway projects took a mean of 2.2 years to complete. The average time to complete an Environmental Impact Statement and obtain a Record of Decision now takes an average of almost 4 years. The full process is often further slowed because energy projects of all types run into a ‘litigation doom loop’, years of lawsuits and delay that create uncertainty and chill investment. These delays don’t improve environmental outcomes, but they do prevent America from building the infrastructure we need.”

Building Toward Bipartisan Reform

The hearing also made clear that support for reform is not limited to one party or sector. Chairman Westerman told Politico that his goal is to keep the SPEED Act “technology- and project-neutral to create a transparent and fair process.” While debates remain over specific provisions, lawmakers on both sides have acknowledged the need for compromise.

Rep. Seth Magaziner (D-R.I.) expressed interest in advancing permitting reform, noting:

“We need to make it easier to build in this country again.”

Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME), a co-sponsor of the SPEED Act, stressed the importance of reforming permitting rules to strike a balance between environmental stewardship and efficient project approvals. He argued that protecting the environment should not require tolerating a yearslong process that is overly complex and ripe for litigation abuse.",https://www.energyindepth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/New-API-TWEET.png,N,,2025-09-18 14:03:22.118763

“Too many people lost access to water when Hurricane Helene struck, and in some places, it took months to be able to guarantee potable water,” said Governor Josh Stein.
This project will create a new emergency interconnection between the towns of Morganton, Drexel, and Valdese to establish water system resiliency in the wake of an extreme weather event.
The SRF Helene funds for western North Carolina towns that have experienced Helene damage will continue to be available through year-round applications until 2026.
The Division of Water Infrastructure conducted four preliminary SRF Helene information sessions for prospective western North Carolina applicants in May in Boone, Hickory, Rutherfordton, and Asheville.","Governor Josh Stein announced today that five western North Carolina counties will receive more than $86 million in funding for 14 drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects as part of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency program for disaster-affected states. North Carolina is the first state impacted by Helene to award grants from this program.

The awards require that drinking water and wastewater funds be used to improve flood resilience in systems that were impacted by Hurricane Helene, and septic system funds must be used to improve flood resilience to septic systems in Helene-affected areas.

“Too many people lost access to water when Hurricane Helene struck, and in some places, it took months to be able to guarantee potable water,” said Governor Josh Stein. “These grants will help towns across western North Carolina strengthen their water infrastructure so that it can better withstand future storms.”

“These are the first awards from the $686 million from the Environmental Protection Agency for drinking water, wastewater, and septic system repairs and upgrades in the wake of Helene,” DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson said. “Importantly, all funded projects must ensure that the systems will be more resilient to future flooding events. Having clean and reliable water is critical for the health of our people. Everyone expects and deserves to turn on the tap and receive water that is safe to drink.”

Notable projects include:

The Town of Gamewell (Caldwell County) will receive $775,200 in Principal Forgiveness (PF) to replace/relocate gravity sewer lines and incorporate resiliency through various measures, including stream bank stabilization. High water from excessive rainfall during Helene caused erosion of the riverway and damaged pipe and support piers.

The Town of Waynesville (Haywood County) will receive $5 million in PF to convert a gravity sewer line to a force main with a new pump station and to relocate an existing junction box outside of the 500-year flood plain.

Town of Drexel (Burke County) will receive $5 million in PF to fortify lines in the floodplain and to convert a treatment unit into an equalization basin. The pump station was flooded during Helene, and installing an equalization basin would help reduce Sanitary Sewer Overflows and provide resiliency.

The City of Morganton (Burke County) and the Town of Drexel (Burke County) individually submitted separate applications for the Morganton-Valdese-Drexel interconnection project. This project will create a new emergency interconnection between the towns of Morganton, Drexel, and Valdese to establish water system resiliency in the wake of an extreme weather event. Drexel will receive $5.1 million for its share of this project. Morganton will receive $10 million in funding for its share.

Junaluska Sanitary District (Haywood County) will receive $10 million to rebuild and provide resilience to withstand floods. The shifting of the Pigeon River due to Helene flooding adversely impacted its old system. The proposed project will replace outdated, undersized, and aged water mains that service more than 300 residential connections along the Pigeon River. These lines are dead-end lines and are not looped or connected to other water mains. New water mains, along with valves, new water supply wells outside of the 500-year flood plain, and installation of backup power will provide resiliency, specifically for Haywood Community Hospital and Haywood County Emergency Services.

Woodfin Sanitary District (Buncombe County) will receive $5 million to install emergency standby power and replace inoperable control valves at the water treatment plant to ensure operators can properly operate and maintain the system during emergencies.

The Town of Hot Springs (Madison County) will receive $5 million in PF to include flood resiliency improvements to three pump stations and to improve approximately 5,600 linear feet of gravity sewer. Generators and flood protection walls will be added, and wet wells and electrical equipment will be elevated.

The Town of Hot Springs (Madison County) will receive an additional $5.2 million to install a new redundant transmission line beneath the French Broad River from the well system to the distribution system and to install a new redundant waterline under Spring Creek to feed the 200,000-gallon water storage tank; to construct a new 200,000-gallon water tank adjacent to an existing tank to provide redundant system storage; to replace approximately 6,000 linear feet of damaged water lines; to rehabilitate and improve the existing supervisory control and data acquisition system to ensure operability and access during flood events; to install radio read meters, which will allow the town to quickly identify water leaks and provide repairs for customers; and to install back-up standby power to increase resiliency.

Litzsinger said this is an important time for people to learn more about electric vehicles, because tax credits for purchasing them will end on September 30, 10 days after the expo. People who buy an EV before that date can get a $7,500 federal tax credit or $4,000 when purchasing a used EV.

There will be a variety of cars in the expo that meet many different consumer needs. Some of these vehicles will be:

2025 Rivian R1S

2025 GMC Hummer SUV

2026 KIA EV9

To date, 19 cars are registered for the show.

Speakers for the event include Mayor Brian Blad and a representative from Yellowstone-Teton Clean Cities starting at 10 a.m.

Both owners and representatives of car dealerships with electric vehicles will be present at the expo, available to talk to attendees about the vehicles, and address any commonly held misconceptions about them. Litzsinger also went on Sustainable Idaho, a KISU radio program, on September 16 to talk about the car show, as well as address misconceptions.

“(The owners) give you that boots-on-the-ground information that maybe is causing a potential EV owner to give pause,” Litzsinger said.

DEEP Approves Three-Year Energy Savings Plan for Connecticut

The 2025-2027 Conservation & Load Management Plan Guides the State’s Energy Efficiency Programs, Helping Residents and Businesses Save on Their Energy Bills

(HARTFORD) — The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) has issued its Final Determination on the 2025-2027 Conservation and Load Management (C&LM) Plan, a comprehensive strategy which guides the priorities, design, and incentives for Connecticut’s energy efficiency and demand management programs. These programs, administered by Eversource and Avangrid under the brand name Energize Connecticutsm, drive down energy costs by supporting efficient building upgrades such as insulation, air sealing, heating and cooling system improvements, and building controls and industrial process improvements for businesses.

Since energy efficiency is cheaper than the cost of supply and reduces the need for infrastructure upgrades, it reduces costs for all utility ratepayers. The 2025-2027 C&LM Plan will deliver $2.35 billion in lifetime benefits to Connecticut residents, municipalities, and businesses through a $705 million investment (that’s a return of $3.30 for every dollar invested). In 2024, the programs completed over 29,000 weatherization projects in residential homes, and completed energy upgrades in over 3,800 businesses. The C&LM programs invested $238.9 million that year, which delivered $408.2 million in lifetime bill savings to participating Connecticut residents, municipalities, and businesses.

Savings Available to Residents and Businesses

The average residential customer who participates in the C&LM residential weatherization programs receives $1,129 of value in services and achieves lifetime average savings of $2,068 on their home energy bills.

There are significant energy savings benefits for participating businesses as well. For example, small businesses in Connecticut receive an average of over $9,500 in services and achieve an average of over $35,000 in lifetime savings on their energy bills.

All utility ratepayers benefit from these programs. For example, the cost of electric supply is nearly double the cost of energy efficiency. By reducing the need to purchase more expensive energy supply and reducing peak demand, these programs lower costs on everyone’s natural gas and electric bills and also improve grid resilience.

“Energy efficiency remains Connecticut’s lowest cost energy resource, and the most direct action residents and businesses can take to lower their energy bills,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. “At significantly less than the cost of energy supply, investing in building efficiency is a win-win-win for program participants, all Connecticut ratepayers, and the environment.”

Increased Access and Transparency

The 2025-27 C&LM Plan also advances ongoing efforts by DEEP, the EEB, and the Utilities to ensure ease of access and transparency of program data and reporting. Work on revamping the existing Energy Efficiency Dashboard is already underway, and the updated version is expected to go live in 2026. The new program dashboard will provide stakeholders with a user-friendly platform where they may gather a wide variety of programmatic data to assess program performance. In addition, this Plan supports continued improvements to information provided to customers at the time of their energy assessments. Beginning in 2026, customers will be provided with a bill impact analysis which will further assist them in the decision-making process when considering energy efficiency upgrades.

Additional Program Benefits

DEEP’s Determination finds that the 2025-2027 C&LM Plan, approved with conditions by the Energy Efficiency Board and as amended by DEEP, positions Connecticut for continued success in delivering energy savings and improved affordability to ratepayers. Beyond direct bill savings, participants can expect to improve building comfort and indoor air quality while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Local contractors install the building upgrades supported by Energize CT, and serve as a vital part of Connecticut’s skilled economy. In 2024, Connecticut supported an energy efficiency workforce of nearly 35,000 professionals, many of which can be found on the insulation installers network and heat pump installers network.

What stakeholders are saying about the C&LM Plan and CT’s Energy Efficiency Programs:

""Eversource is proud to help administer Connecticut’s energy efficiency programs, which in 2024 have generated over $400 million in lifetime savings for customers,"" says Vice President of Energy Efficiency and Electric Mobility for Eversource, Tilak Subrahmanian. ""As a Sponsor of Energize Connecticut, we’re committed to helping residents, businesses and municipalities across the state lower their energy use and bills, while enhancing grid reliability and resiliency.""

Anthony Kosior, Energy Efficiency Board Chair, said, “As Chair, I wish to formally recognize the hard work and dedication of the volunteer members of the Energy Efficiency Board, whose contributions played a critical role in the development of this three-year Plan. It has been a distinct privilege to collaborate and work alongside such engaged and knowledgeable individuals in pursuit of our shared mission. I look forward to continuing to guide these programs through equitable implementation that maximizes program benefits, strengthens energy efficiency, and enhances affordability for all Connecticut ratepayers.”

Vivian Perez, Co-owner of HE Energy Solutions, said, “As a qualified contractor working in the field serving residential customers for over 15 years, I can attest to the importance of these programs in helping people save money on their energy bills, enhance home safety, and improve the comfort of their homes. We consistently receive positive feedback from our customers about the programs and the services that we provide. Funding for these programs allows our company to develop and maintain a highly skilled and technically competent workforce, and also helps support good paying jobs here in Connecticut.”

DEEP encourages all ratepayers to participate in these programs. To get started, schedule an appointment with a qualified C&LM program contractor through the EnergizeCT.com website or by calling 877-WISE-USE. Until December 31, 2025, the normal $75 co-pay for a home energy assessment has been waived, so it’s a great time to get started. Plus, federal tax credits for technologies like heat pumps and insulation upgrades remain available only through the end of 2025, so now is a good time to maximize savings.

Rivian Plans $1.5B Illinois Plant Expansion While Georgia Project Paused

Federal Loan Support

The U.S. Dept. of Energy Loan Programs Office announced in January it had closed on a loan of up to $6.57 billion to Rivian New Horizon LLC, the entity building the Georgia plant. DOE described the financing as support for “Project Horizon,” encompassing site development, construction and manufacturing facilities.

“By investing in American innovation, we are securing our supply chains, strengthening our workforce and ensuring the U.S. leads the clean transportation future,” DOE Loan Programs Office Director Jigar Shah said in the loan announcement.

Rivian’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings describe the loan as including capitalized interest and explicitly intended “for the construction of its next manufacturing facility in Stanton Springs North.”

Regional Impact and Construction

Early work at the site, which local media reports has since commenced, includes electrical and water utility hookups and road access. ENR has not yet independently verified those reports, nor has Rivian confirmed its pick for general contractor.

The car company temporarily paused the Georgia project in 2024 to conserve cash while launching its R2 line at its Normal, Ill., plant. It restarted the Georgia build after securing federal financing and reconfirming its long-term strategy.

The factory represents one of the largest single industrial investments in Georgia history and adds to a growing cluster of EV and battery plants in the Southeast. State leaders see the Rivian facility as a keystone for attracting suppliers and bolstering the region’s automotive sector.

State officials project the plant will reach the mandated 7,500-employee target by 2030, with another 2,000 construction jobs created during the build-out.

“This agreement ensures that the project follows locally required standards,” Wilson, the state’s economic development commissioner, said when the incentive package was announced, highlighting that clawback provisions protect taxpayers “in the extremely unlikely event of company goals not being met.”",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/09/17/Rivian-Plant---TOF.jpg?height=635&t=1758154964&width=1200,N,,2025-09-18 13:03:29.541198

Washington, D.C.—As President Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) continues to roll back regulations to address climate change and protect public health, U.S. Representative Lloyd Doggett (D-Austin), a member of the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (SEEC), led most Texas Democratic Congressmembers this week in opposing EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s proposal to eliminate any federal ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and resultant protections.

Established in 2009, the endangerment finding is a science-based determination by the EPA that six greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, including carbon dioxide, are harmful to public health and welfare. Even with modest existing regulations, Texans continue to suffer from intensifying extreme weather that costs lives and billions in infrastructure and property damage.

In the letter, the Texas members write, “The climate crisis is not a far-off event or a theory–it is already here and endangering our constituents. Extreme storms and temperatures create dangerous conditions for Texans. This July, Central Texas floods exacerbated by climate change killed at least 137 people. Greenhouse gas emissions worsened the damages of Hurricane Harvey, as half of residential flooding was attributed to climate change. Rising temperatures lead to rising deaths, with the number of heat-related deaths in Texas breaking state records consecutively from 2020 to 2023. Tick- and mosquito-borne tropical diseases further threaten Texans’ health as diseases move northward and threaten our health infrastructure. It is clear that regulating greenhouse gas emissions is necessary to protect human health and the environment.”

The Trump Administration’s proposal to undo standards backed by decades of scientific evidence is not only a giveaway for our nation’s biggest polluters, but it will undoubtedly force American families to pay more for health care because such pollutants can lead to heart disease, respiratory illnesses like asthma, cancer, and more.

E-1 – Critical Infrastructure Protection Reliability Standard CIP-003-11 – Cyber Security – Security Management Controls (Docket No. RM25-8-000). On December 20, 2024, pursuant to Section 215(d)(1) of the Federal Power Act (FPA) and Section 39.52 of the Commission’s regulations, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) filed for approval of proposed Reliability Standard CIP-003-11 (Cyber Security – Security Management Controls). In its filing, NERC stated that the purpose of Reliability Standard CIP-003 is to specify consistent and sustainable security management controls that establish responsibility and accountability to protect BES Cyber Systems (BCS) against compromise that could lead to misoperation or instability in the Bulk Electric System (BES). NERC argued that proposed Reliability Standard CIP-003-11 would mitigate the risks posed by a coordinated attack utilizing distributed low impact BES Cyber Systems by adding controls to authenticate remote users; protecting the authentication information in transit; and detecting malicious communications to or between assets containing low impact BES Cyber Systems with external routable connectivity. Agenda item E-1 may be an order on NERC’s proposed Reliability Standard CIP-003-11.

The proposed Reliability Standard EOP-012-3 is a cold-weather reliability standard promoting the reliability of the Bulk Electric System (BES) in North America. On May 12, 2025, the ISO/RTO Council (IRC) submitted comments, generally supporting the proposed reliability standard but requested that the Commission clarify its expectation with respect to one particular component of EOP-012-3, specifically that the Commission should recognize the need for additional work to ensure that appropriate and effective compliance mechanisms are established as part of the implementation of the revised standard. On May 12, 2025, the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) filed comments, raising concerns regarding proposed generator cold weather preparedness Reliability Standard EOP-012-3, specifically several of the circumstances that may qualify as Case-by-Case Determinations of Generator Cold Weather Constraints under Attachment 1 to the proposed standard. UCS requested that the Commission direct NERC to make certain changes to the standard, including removing or revising several of the situations on the case-by-case list. On May 28, 2025, NERC filed a reply to UCS’ comments and argued that the Commission should not direct the changes requested by UCS.

On September 19, 2024, in Docket No. RM24-4-000, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) to direct the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), the Commission-certified Electric Reliability Organization, to develop and submit for approval new or modified Reliability Standards that address the sufficiency of responsible entities’ supply chain risk management plans related to the identification of, assessment of, and response to supply chain risks, and applicability of Reliability Standards’ supply chain protections to protected cyber assets. On November 22, 2024, NERC and the Regional Entities submitted its comments to the NOPR. On March 20, 2025, the Commission hosted a Supply Chain Workshop among the parties, focusing on the “assessment” aspect of supply chain risk management (SCRM) and to discuss the proposed NOPR directive to require entities establish steps in SCRM plans to validate the completeness and accuracy of information received from vendors during the procurement process to better inform the identification and assessment of supply chain risks associated with vendors’ software, hardware, or services. On May 13, 2025, the Commission published the transcript from the March 20 workshop. Subsequently, over 20 industry participants submitted comments in response to the NOPR and the Supply Chain Workshop. On September 17, 2020, the Commission issued a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) in Docket No. RM20-19-000 seeking comments on the potential risks to the bulk electric system posed by using equipment and services produced or provided by entities identified as risks to national security. The NOI sought comments on: (i) the extent to which equipment and services provided by such entities are used in the operation of the bulk electric system; (ii) the risks to bulk electric system reliability and security posed by the use of equipment and services; (iii) whether the current Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Reliability Standards adequately mitigate the identified risks; and (iv) possible actions the Commission could consider to further address the identified risks. Over 25 industry participants submitted comments. Agenda item E-4 may be an order on the NOPR and NOI with respect to Reliability Standards covering supply chain protections to cyber assets.

E-5 – New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (Docket No. ER25-1812-000). On March 28, 2025, the New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYISO) submitted a compliance filing pursuant to Order No. 904 as issued by the Commission on October 17, 2024. Specifically, Order No. 904 instructed NYISO to effectuate revisions to its Market Administration and Control Area Services Tariff (Tariff) in order to eliminate compensation to resources for the provision of reactive power within a standard power factor range of 0.95 lagging to 0.95 leading. Additionally, NYISO proposed to eliminate charges to transmission customers, customers, and load serving entities (LSEs) for the provision of reactive power within the referenced power factor range. NYISO also stated that, in the proposed revisions to its Tariff, it addressed the potential implications of the change on its Installed Capacity Demand Curves for the 2025-2029 “reset period.” A number of stakeholders filed motions to intervene. On April 18, 2025, the New York Department of State Utility Intervention Unit (UIU) filed a protest, contending that the Commission should reject the proposed Tariff revisions and require that NYISO implement a compensation structure that reflects an actual delivered reactive service that falls outside of the standard power factor range. UIU stated that the Commission should not allow compensation to a generator for providing reactive power if it falls outside of the standard power factor range and there is no effective interconnection agreement enabling such payment. On May 7, 2025, NYISO filed an answer to the UIU protest, asserting that its proposed compensation structure for reactive power support outside of the standard power factor range remains just and reasonable. Agenda item E-5 may be an order on the NYISO compliance filing in accordance with Order No. 904.

E-6 – Southwest Power Pool, Inc. (Docket No. ER22-1697-003). On April 28, 2022, Southwest Power Pool, Inc. (SPP) submitted its initial compliance filing with respect to Order No. 2222. On March 1, 2024, the Commission issued an order accepting the compliance filing, subject to a further compliance filing and information filing to be filed by April 30, 2024. On March 18, 2024, SPP filed a request to extend the deadline of the further compliance filing to August 28, 2024, in order to engage with stakeholders and perform the additional analysis noted in the order, which the Commission granted on March 26, 2024. On March 29, 2024, American Electric Power Service Corporation, Evergy, Oklahoma Gas & Electric Company, and Xcel Energy (collectively, the Joint Utilities) filed a request for rehearing of the March 1 order. In the rehearing request, the Joint Utilities allege that SPP has indeed satisfied the locational requirements of Order No. 2222, despite the Commission finding it had failed to. The Joint Utilities assert that SPP demonstrated that a single-node aggregation of distributed energy resources is the only suitable option in SPP, and, pursuant to Order No. 2222, provided a ""detailed, technical explanation"" to support that design. Additionally, the Joint Utilities request clarification on the effective date for Order No. 2222 compliance; per the March 1 order, SPP was directed to propose an effective date in the third quarter of 2025. The Joint Utilities referred to the length of time that passed during the initial Order No. 2222 compliance filing (15 months) and, accordingly, expressed concern that the Commission has imposed an impractical and unattainable effective date given the similar length of time for compliance. On June 27, 2024, the Commission issued an order addressing the arguments raised on rehearing and granting clarification in part. The order modified the prior discussion but retained the same result in the proceeding, such that SPP is able to move to extend time to implement its Order No. 2222 compliance proposal and that the Commission would not prejudge any such potential motion. On December 13, 2024, SPP filed its compliance filing pursuant to Order No. 2222, requesting an effective date of December 31, 9998 (i.e., in order to allow SPP staff to develop and implement the necessary software systems). SPP stated that its proposed implementation date is the second quarter of 2030. Several stakeholders filed comments responsive to the compliance filing, including concerns with respect to the proposed multi-nodal model for locational requirements as well as its proposed revision to double counting restrictions to permit a distributed energy resource in participating in retail programs and markets. Agenda item E-6 may be an order on the Order No. 2222 compliance filing by SPP.

E-7 – Southwest Power Pool, Inc. (Docket No. ER16-1341-003). On April 1, 2016, SPP filed a petition in order to waive certain provisions of its Tariff related to the implementation of the revenue crediting process in Attachment Z2 for the historical period due to the delay in development of the necessary software. Section I.7.1 of the SPP Tariff furnished the reasons and methods for billing adjustments, such as a one-year limitation in the adjustment of past invoices. Attachment Z2 in the SPP Tariff contains the provisions for revenue credits which compensate entities that pay for Network Upgrades subsequently used to provide transmission service, and specifically, that a Creditable Upgrade is to considered one that was paid for, in whole or in part, through revenues collected from customers through Directly Assigned Costs. Accordingly, SPP sought a waiver to implement a clarified revenue crediting process and recalculate, collect, and pay revenue credits. On July 7, 2016, the Commission granted the waiver petition, finding that SPP had provided sufficient notice to stakeholders during the process and that transmission customers in SPP had benefited from upgrades that were paid for by upgrade sponsors without having provided compensation to those sponsors during the historical period. Several parties filed respective requests for rehearing of the July 7 order. On November 6, 2017, the Commission issued an order denying the rehearing requests. On February 28, 2019, the Commission issued an order on remand, stemming from a decision by the United Stated Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (DC Circuit) relating to the notification and statements used by Old Dominion that it had argued were tantamount to tariff language furnished by the PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM). The DC Circuit ruled that a statement posted on the PJM website did not constitute adequate notice. Subsequently, the Commission sought voluntary remand due to the determination of the DC Circuit (i.e., certain unofficial communications and notices did not adhere to the filed rate doctrine). Ultimately, the order on remand found that the Commission is unable to grant the waiver request of section I.7.1 of the SPP Tariff due to the filed rate doctrine. On June 28, 2019, SPP filed a compliance report detailing the proposed plan for implementing refunds under Attachment Z2 for the historical period. On August 5, 2025, certain project sponsors filed a request for prompt action by the Commission in order to stop the accrual of interest on the refund portion of the SPP proposal. Agenda item E-7 may be an order on the SPP compliance report.

E-8 – PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (Docket No. ER24-98-002). On October 13, 2023, PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM) submitted proposed revisions to its Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) and the Reliability Assurance Agreement (RAA), pursuant to section 205 of the Federal Power Act (FPA). Specifically, PJM sought to enhance the rules governing the Market Seller Offer Cap (MSOC) by: 1) establishing a standardized methodology to calculate unit-specific Capacity Performance Quantifiable Risk; 2) allowing Capacity Market Sellers to reflect their cost of risk associated with capacity performance in their capacity market offers; 3) allowing segmented unit-specific offer caps; 4) aligning the MSOC rules that may be applied to Planned Generation Capacity Resources with the costs that may be incurred; and 5) providing more flexibility for PJM in approving a unit-specific MSOC. PJM also proposed to align the eligibility of Performance Payments during Performance Assessment Intervals (PAI) to only committed Capacity Resources as well as clarify and revise certain other conditions of PAI obligations. PJM requested that the Commission approve the proposed OATT revisions such that implementation could go into effect by the 2025/2026 Base Residual Auction. A number of stakeholders filed motions to intervene, substantive comments, and protests. Generally, the protests alleged that PJM did not demonstrate that precluding demand response resources from being eligible for Performance Payments is just and reasonable, that PJM should adopt a more incremental approach with stakeholders to address immediate reliability concerns rather than the proposed OATT revisions, and the potential impacts of changes to the parameters by which locational deliverability areas are set. On February 6, 2024, the Commission issued an order, with guidance, rejecting the proposed revisions to the PJM OATT. A number of parties filed respective requests for rehearing of the February 6 order. Agenda item E-8 may be an order on the rehearing requests.

E-9 – ISO New England Inc., Central Maine Power Company, The Connecticut Light and Power Company, Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Company, Green Mountain Power Corporation, New England Power Company, New Hampshire Transmission, LLC, NSTAR Electric Company, Public Service Company of New Hampshire, The United Illuminating Company, Unitil Energy Systems, Inc., Vermont Electric Cooperative, Inc., Vermont Transco LLC and Versant Power (Docket No. ER20-2054-000). On June 15, 2020, the above-captioned New England Transmission Owners (NETOs), joined by ISO New England (ISO-NE), filed a joint offer of settlement and request for ruling. The settlement between the NETOs and ISO-NE purported to resolve all issues in Docket No. EL16-19, an FPA section 206 proceeding relating to the formula rates for transmission service in the ISO-NE Open Access Transmission Tariff (ISO-NE OATT). Namely, the FPA section 206 proceeding addressed the transparency and challenge procedures for formula rates in ISO-NE; the level of detail utilized in deriving certain costs in the transmission formula rate, including cost recovery mechanisms; and the timing and synchronization between Regional Network Service and Local Network Service formula rates. On August 18, 2020, the Commission issued a certification of uncontested settlement. On December 28, 2020, the Commission issued a letter order approving the joint offer of settlement between the parties. On January 27, 2021 and July 29, 2022, respectively, the NETOs submitted Informational Filings in compliance with the approval order. On January 31, 2023, RENEW Northeast, Inc. (RENEW NE) submitted a formal challenge to the Annual Informational Filing submitted by the NETOs on July 29, 2022. Namely, RENEW NE asserted that the NETOs failed to provide adequate rate input information in the Annual Informational Filings and, accordingly, certain Network Upgrade costs were unjustly assigned to interconnection customers. RENEW NE also contended that the NETOs may be over-collecting operations and maintenance costs in their respective transmission rates. On March 24, 2025, the Commission issued an order dismissing the formal challenge. On July 31, 2025, the NETOs submitted the latest Annual Informational Filing. Agenda item E-9 may be an order related to the Annual Informational Filing.

E-10 – Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC, Duke Energy Progress, LLC and Duke Energy Indiana, LLC (Docket No. EL25-89-000). On May 30, 2025, Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC, Duke Energy Progress, LLC and Duke Energy Indiana, LLC (collectively, Duke Energy) filed a petition for declaratory order, blanket authorizations, and waivers. Duke Energy requested that the Commission make certain findings to permit the operation of each new wholly-owned procurement company as a direct subsidiary of its parent public utility. Duke Energy stated that the Commission granted the same manner of relief to Duke Energy Florida, LLC in 2022. Agenda item E-10 may be an order on the petition.

Hydro

H-1 – Alutiiq Tribe of Old Harbor and Alaska Village Electric Cooperative, Inc. (Docket No. P-13272-008). On April 21, 2025, Alutiiq Tribe of Old Harbor (Alutiiq Tribe) filed a request for a stay of Article 301 of the license for the Old Harbor Hydroelectric Project. On April 29, 2016, Alaska Village Electric Cooperative, Inc. (AVEC) received the initial Operating License from the Commission. In the fall of 2023, AVEC filed an agreement to transfer the project license to the Alutiiq Tribe. On July 24, 2024, the Commission issued an order approving the license transfer. In the request for stay, Alutiiq Tribe provided several examples of progress, including securing design and construction funding as well as retaining a design, build, and permitting contractor. The stay request is necessary due to a pending Right of Way agreement with the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge. Agenda item H-1 may be an order on the request for stay by the Alutiiq Tribe.

H-2 – Southeast Oklahoma Power Corporation (Docket No. P-14890-006). On December 23, 2024, Southeast Oklahoma Power Corporation (SEOPC) filed a notice to submit a license application and a pre-application document for the proposed Pushmataha County Pumped Storage Project. SEOPC also filed the initial Proposed Study Plan concurrently with the pre-application. On January 8, 2025, the Commission issued a letter finding the initial pre-application to be insufficient and directing SEOPC to explain why certain studies, requested by participating agencies and stakeholders, were not conducted. SEOPC submitted an updated pre-application on February 6, 2025. On April 14, 2025, the Commission issued a letter order terminating the pre-application proceeding, concluding that SEOPC failed to comply with the study requirements. On May 13, 2025, SEOPC filed a request for rehearing of the April 14 termination letter order. Agenda item H-2 may be an order on the rehearing request by SEOPC.

H-3 – Alabama Power Company (Docket No. P-349-250). On December 21, 2023, Alabama Power Company (APC) submitted a proposed update of the Shoreline Management Plan in association with the Martin Dam Hydroelectric Project, of which APC is the license holder. On April 9, 2025, the Commission issued an order approving, in part, the Shoreline Management Plan for the Project. On May 5, 2025, William M. Campbell, III submitted a request for rehearing of the April 9 order. Agenda item H-3 may be an order on the rehearing request.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.12122_4252.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 13:04:57.144368
,Clean Energy ,2025-09-18 16:37:08+00:00,www.nytimes.com,What Will China's Green-Tech Ambitions Cost the World? - The New York Times,"Brook Larmer, www.nytimes.com, brook-larmer",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/magazine/china-green-tech-laos.html,"“The bombs fell like rain.” Where once American bombs fell, Chinese wind turbines now rise.
The $950 million Monsoon Wind Power Project whirred into commercial operation at the end of August.
But what is happening outside its borders — in the proliferation of China’s clean-energy exports — may have a more enduring impact on the climate and geopolitics.
When China’s clean-energy companies first looked to foreign markets more than a decade ago, their main targets were Europe and the United States.
The Monsoon Wind Power Project sells 100 percent of its electricity to Vietnam through a 44-mile transmission line across the border.","On a remote mountain ridge in southeastern Laos, a gigantic white blade emerged from the clouds, seemingly suspended in midair. The blade rose to the height of a 50-story building, more than 600 feet above a nearby cluster of wooden houses, and spun back into the clouds. Another blade followed, then another. The clouds shifted, unveiling a phalanx of giant wind turbines marching down the ridge far into the distance.

This was not the first time that some villagers in the district of Dak Cheung had seen powerful new technologies materialize in the skies over their isolated homeland. More than half a century ago, American warplanes dropped millions of pounds of bombs in this region during the Vietnam War. In Dak Cheung, where most inhabitants are members of the Triang ethnic minority, many huts still stand on stilts fashioned from the shells of American bombs. Earlier this year, a tribal elder pointed his bamboo cane at the dirt road in front of his village. “This is the old Ho Chi Minh Trail,” he said, reminiscing about the concealed transportation network built by the North Vietnamese Army and targeted by relentless American attacks. “The bombs fell like rain.”

Where once American bombs fell, Chinese wind turbines now rise. Today, along the same stretch of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, a state-owned Chinese company has just finished constructing what is touted as the largest onshore wind farm in Southeast Asia — 133 turbines planted across a vast swath of one of Asia’s poorest countries. The $950 million Monsoon Wind Power Project whirred into commercial operation at the end of August. Built by the Power Construction Corporation of China, or PowerChina, and run by a Thai-led consortium, Monsoon is expected to save more than 32 million tons of carbon emissions over the next 25 years. All of the electricity it generates, however, will be sold across the border to Vietnam, a deal that bolsters Laos’s role as “the battery of Southeast Asia” even as it brings limited benefits to the people of Dak Cheung.

The first wind farm in Laos hardly stands out amid China’s clean-energy revolution, but it illuminates how the world’s most prolific producer of greenhouse gases has come to dominate the global trade in renewable energy. China’s investments in clean tech — $625 billion in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency — have fueled a staggering transformation. China now produces about two-thirds of the world’s electric vehicles, more than 60 percent of its wind turbines and more than 85 percent of its battery capacity. Last year, the I.E.A. predicted that China’s export of clean-energy technologies in 10 years will reach $340 billion annually, roughly the same as the current oil exports from Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. combined.

The world’s two superpowers are speeding in opposite directions. As America abandons its commitment to wind, solar and electric vehicles — the Trump administration’s so-called “big beautiful bill” slashes support for all three — China is strengthening its hold over nearly every link in the supply chains for renewable energy. “There are tectonic shifts underway in clean energy that cut to the core of the great power competition between the U.S. and China,” says Milo McBride, a clean-energy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “The U.S. is doubling down on its position as the largest oil and gas producer and exporter. Across the Pacific, China is expanding its prowess as the world’s manufacturer and exporter of clean-energy technologies of the future.”

The changes inside China are vital for the planet. But what is happening outside its borders — in the proliferation of China’s clean-energy exports — may have a more enduring impact on the climate and geopolitics. The flood of relatively low-cost Chinese green technology now reaches nearly every corner of the world. Sleek new Chinese electric vehicles fill the streets of Bangkok, São Paulo and Addis Ababa. Chinese-built solar panels blanket the sun-drenched cities of Pakistan and the 13,000-foot altiplano of Argentina. Wind farms with towering Chinese turbines dot the narrow coast of Bosnia, the plains of Kenya and, of course, the highlands of southeastern Laos. Last year, astonishingly, China exported clean-energy technology to 191 of the 192 other U.N. member states, according to an analysis by Lauri Myllyvirta of the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) in Helsinki. The only country not on the list: the Central African Republic.

Regardless of the motivations at play — Chinese manufacturers selling off their excess capacity, less-developed nations seeking a cheaper route to energy security — these exports are already taking a bite out of global carbon emissions. China’s clean-tech exports in 2024 alone will represent a 1 percent reduction in global emissions outside China, according to Myllyvirta’s calculations. Put another way, the rapid expansion of Chinese clean-energy exports will help forestall the emission of 220 million metric tons of carbon in a single year, roughly equivalent to the annual emissions from 50 million gas-powered cars. “That is huge,” says Myllyvirta, CREA’s co-founder and lead analyst, before adding, “but it’s much less than is needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.”

A quarter-century ago, the pillars of China’s export economy were known as the “old three” (lao san yang): clothing, furniture and home appliances. Now there are the “new three” (xin san yang): solar, E.V.s and lithium-ion batteries (and maybe a future fourth in wind turbines). China’s interest in clean energy began as a hedge against its heavy reliance on oil, much of which is delivered through the strategically vulnerable Strait of Malacca. But as early as 2010, a group of Chinese leaders and scholars began to see clean energy as a once-in-a-generation opportunity for economic growth and geopolitical clout, as well as energy security. One of those figures argued that, historically, countries that develop new energy technologies before anyone else can change the balance of global power.

When China’s clean-energy companies first looked to foreign markets more than a decade ago, their main targets were Europe and the United States. The financial crisis and rising protectionism, especially in the United States, forced a radical shift in that approach. Chinese companies moved some factories overseas to evade tariffs — making solar panels in Indonesia, for example — even as they scoured the world for new markets. “The mentality of Chinese companies is so global,” says Kelly Sims Gallagher, a China energy expert and dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University. “In the case of Chinese solar firms, they first looked outside for export-led growth and then, after costs had come down, they saturated their own market.” With prices plunging because of overproduction in China — the cost of solar panels has dropped 50 percent in the past two years — there has been no shortage of countries lining up for Chinese clean tech. One side effect: China doesn’t depend on American consumers. According to Myllyvirta, only 4 percent of its wind, solar and E.V. exports go to the United States. “In a market where global sales volumes are growing 30 percent a year,” he has written, “the U.S. is a footnote.”

For all its dominance, China has struggled to turn clean tech into soft power. To effect that kind of alchemy, some advocates are urging Beijing to initiate a green Marshall Plan modeled on the aid program the United States implemented in Europe after World War II. So far, though, Beijing has taken a narrower, more nationalistic approach. Chinese firms, for the most part, have shown more interest in offloading products and cornering markets than in helping countries build their own clean-tech economies. “Chinese companies are going where the demand is,” says Joanna Lewis, a professor of energy and environment at Georgetown University. “They’re not primarily choosing countries based on diplomatic aims.”

For countries like Laos, with its crumbling finances, clean-energy projects from China can be irresistible. They offer a cheap alternative to fossil fuels, an affordable way to take on climate change, a chance to gain energy security in a volatile world. But beyond this promise lies the peril of dependence. Laos, in many ways, has become a test case for countries trying to walk the tightrope with China. How can they benefit from the clean energy on offer without becoming so reliant on China — or so mired in debt — that they can’t stand up on their own? The question reverberates in the mountains of southern Laos, where the Indigenous Triang people now share their homeland with the whirling turbines of Southeast Asia’s largest wind farm.

A light rain was falling in the town of Dak Cheung when the big boss from PowerChina arrived to mark the completion of the Monsoon Wind Power Project. It was early July, the actual monsoon season, and the project’s Chinese managers had arranged a celebratory dinner at a restaurant in town, a step up from the canteen at the workers’ main camp half an hour down the dirt road. Money flowing in for the construction of the wind farm has turned this outpost near the Vietnam border into a mini-boomtown, with a new hotel, a Chinese barbershop, a karaoke bar and five brightly lit stores selling competing brands of Chinese mobile phones. There’s a Sichuanese restaurant that is so new its name is scrawled in Chinese characters on a piece of cardboard taped to the wall outside. But the town’s defining feature is the row of gently spinning wind turbines on the hills across its scenic reservoir.

That night, the boss rode to the restaurant in a black Toyota Land Cruiser with a big red “#1” sticker on the windshield and vanity plates whose numbers (6688) sound like “flowing wealth” when spoken in Mandarin. Inside the restaurant, 13 men (there were no women) stood up to welcome the boss. They were all dressed, almost identically, in white or blue button-down shirts. After gobbling down their dinner, the Chinese men stood up, one by one, and exchanged toasts and shots of Lao whiskey with their leader. There was much to celebrate. The last turbine for the 600-megawatt Monsoon project had been installed in April. Now the test run for all 133 turbines was complete. What PowerChina describes as the biggest wind farm a Chinese company has ever built outside of China’s borders was ready to go. “Gongxi, gongxi, Laoban!” the men called out. (“Congratulations, Boss!”)

China’s efficiency is palpable in Laos, a poor, landlocked communist nation that Joshua Kurlantzick of the Council on Foreign Relations calls “a satellite state” of China. PowerChina built the entire Monsoon project in just 27 months, in a stretch of mountainous terrain 12 times the size of Manhattan. Before the company broke ground, bomb-removal squads scoured the area for unexploded ordnance from the Vietnam War. Access roads were built along the forested ridges so the Chinese-made turbines could make the long journey up to the high plateau. Working straight through the monsoon season, with its rain and high winds, the company faced engineering challenges — along with the more delicate complexities of dealing with an Indigenous local population on whose sacred ground it was treading.

Spurred by Beijing to go global, PowerChina has built renewable-energy projects around the world — geothermal in Indonesia, hydropower in Nigeria, solar in Chile, wind in Pakistan. Nowhere is the company more deeply embedded, however, than in Laos. Over the past three decades, it has been involved in more than 150 projects in the country, including the $6 billion Laos-China railway and a $2.7 billion cascade of hydroelectric dams on a tributary to the Mekong River. (These hydropower projects provoked public discontent for damaging the environment and displacing Indigenous inhabitants from more than 100 villages.)

PowerChina is almost single-handedly responsible for establishing Laos’s identity as Southeast Asia’s battery. Three-quarters of the country’s generated electricity, most of which comes from hydroelectric dams, is now sold to its neighbors, including Thailand, Cambodia and Singapore. The Monsoon Wind Power Project sells 100 percent of its electricity to Vietnam through a 44-mile transmission line across the border. The Laos government will receive foreign currency from the deal, partly through royalty fees, but there’s a rub: In 2021, to cancel a portion of its debt, Laos handed over 90 percent of the national power grid to a Chinese state-owned company, putting China in charge of all electricity flowing to both domestic and international customers, such as Vietnam.

So far, these foreign deals have not alleviated debt or poverty in Laos, where the average rural income is estimated to be around $18 a month. Even if official corruption can be avoided, analysts say, a good portion of Laos’s energy revenues ends up servicing the country’s ballooning external debt. It’s a Catch-22: Costly infrastructure projects meant to bolster the economy have saddled Laos with more than $10 billion in external debt, about half of which is owed to China. The Lao government is not only unable to repay its debt to China; it struggles even to make the interest payments. “Whether by design or neglect, China has created a debt trap in Laos,” an April 2025 report by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, concluded. “Even under the most optimistic scenarios, Laos cannot escape the crisis in the absence of substantial debt relief.”

Regardless of its motivations, Beijing wields ever-increasing influence over its cash-strapped neighbor. “The debt is having a crippling effect on the economy,” says Ian Baird, a specialist on Laos at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “Economic debt has translated into political influence.” China’s operational takeover of the national power grid, which went into effect last year, seemed almost inevitable, given that the grid was largely built by Chinese firms, with Chinese financing, using Chinese technology. PowerChina, which did not respond to requests for an interview, is pressuring Laos to pay its debts, too. This year, a company subsidiary sued Laos’s state utility for $555 million in unpaid bills from its hydroelectric projects. What other state assets will Laos have to hand over if it can’t come up with the cash?

The wind farm in Dak Cheung, at least, will not deepen Laos’s debt, according to Narut Boakajorn, the general manager of the Monsoon Wind Power Company Ltd. The Lao government is not party to any loans, he says, nor does it have an ownership stake in the project. (PowerChina, despite its huge contracting role, is not an owner, either.) “We think the project could help reduce debt somehow,” Boakajorn says. But in its weak position — having given up control of the land (to Monsoon), the grid (to China) and the electricity (to Vietnam) — the Lao government may earn only $100 million, mostly in royalties and taxes, over the next 25 years, he says. It’s better than debt. And the wind farm, Boakajorn believes, shows the Lao government something more valuable: a path to clean energy — and to Laos’s goal of cutting emissions 60 percent by 2030 — with a far lighter impact than an old standby like hydropower.

Wind power, in fact, is gusting hard in Laos. A wind farm with more than double the capacity of Monsoon is under construction north of Dak Cheung. And Boakajorn says another project, still in the planning stages, will be built alongside the existing wind farm in Dak Cheung. Monsoon is preparing to be in the area for the next quarter-century. Bomb-removal squads have already swept the hills for unexploded ordnance. And on a large red-dirt lot down the road from the former main camp, men and women in PowerChina helmets have begun construction on a two-story office complex that will serve as a new base of operations. It won’t be long, it seems, before another flood of workers arrives — many of them Chinese — to erect more monuments to the wind.

China portrays its embrace of renewable energy as a reflection of its concern for “ecological civilization.” Globalizing that commitment has been a conscious effort. “No matter how the international situation changes,” President Xi Jinping said in April, “China will not slow down its efforts to address climate change.” For all the seeming altruism, China’s pivot toward clean-energy development has also been driven by its own needs for energy security, economic growth and geopolitical advantage. Alex Wang, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of a forthcoming book, “Chinese Global Environmentalism,” notes how China’s green-energy statecraft balances global concerns and nationalistic self-interest. “China was able to find a dynamic that dovetails well with the Paris Agreement,” Wang says, “but is also very effective in achieving all of these other national security goals.”

If this is a global competition, what happens when one side, the United States, abandons the field? By phasing out tax credits and incentives for solar, wind and E.V.s, the Trump administration has already torpedoed tens of billions of dollars in planned clean-energy investments — and set back renewables in the U.S. for years, perhaps even a generation. “Strictly in terms of U.S. and China competition, that is a massive own goal,” Myllyvirta says. The starkest contrast came in late August, when the U.S. government halted construction of an almost-completed $4 billion wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island — on the very same day that the Monsoon Wind Power Project began commercial operations. Trump isn’t simply surrendering clean-energy industries to America’s biggest rival; he’s also relinquishing to China a global leadership role on climate issues.

In Beijing, some influential voices believe this is the perfect moment for China to intensify its green-energy statecraft. Until now, the global expansion of green technology has been led mainly by Chinese enterprises searching for markets that can absorb their excess manufacturing capacity — not by a premeditated government strategy to build soft power. Most of China’s exports, moreover, have been sales of equipment or construction services, not the deeper transfer of technological know-how or manufacturing experience. Still, some analysts believe that there are benefits in keeping China’s influence in the realm of business, not politics. As Javier Borràs of the Barcelona Centre for International Affairs has written: “China is managing to create a new kind of green soft power that doesn’t need Beijing’s stultifying propaganda.”

Creating a green Marshall Plan would be the ultimate expression of soft power, but Beijing seems reluctant to make that commitment. It doesn’t help that China is still hooked on coal and oil, and is responsible for 90 percent of the growth in CO2 emissions since 2015, according to CREA. Even so, says Geall of Chatham House, China could benefit from thinking smaller — for example, by exporting products like the cheap solar water heaters that are ubiquitous in the Chinese countryside. “If China were really into soft power, and pushing South-South climate cooperation, you’d think it would be all over exporting things like that to poorer countries,” Geall says. That would “unlock such great development benefits. Yet what ends up happening is often very high-tech, flashy, modern projects.” He adds, “China is really missing a trick in terms of soft power.”

For countries concerned about becoming over-reliant on China, one goal is to build low-carbon industries of their own. “I do not see evidence of a grand strategy in the way that China has exported clean-energy technologies,” Lewis, the Georgetown professor, says. “There is a huge opportunity for China to play a much greater role in the low-carbon energy transition across the Global South, not just by exporting solar, wind and other technologies but by helping these countries build their own green industries and to learn from China’s own green industrial policy model.”

This process is already starting to happen from the bottom up. In Kenya, for example, an E.V. distributor is reportedly transitioning from already-built Chinese imports to locally assembled equivalents. Deals like this are win-win: They provide locals with jobs, technical expertise, even profits, while offering Chinese manufacturers more direct access to dynamic new markets. It doesn’t always work, though. In Chile, two Chinese companies recently backed out of plans to build lithium cathode plants, dealing a blow to the South American country’s ambition to move beyond the export of raw lithium. So far the country that has partnered with China most successfully may be Brazil, the host of a global climate summit in November. Even as the United States targets the country with punitive tariffs, Brazil has secured deals with Chinese companies that include E.V. factories and a wind-turbine assembly plant.

Less than a mile from the Monsoon main camp, the village of Dak Dor is nestled in the curves of a river. Across the rickety wooden footbridge, the rituals of daily life continue unabated. In one house, a half-dozen women attended to a mother and her newborn, warding off evil spirits with herbs and heating up cloths to place on the mother’s abdomen. Around the corner, a group of men and boys pulled an aging water buffalo to the ground to be slaughtered for a communal feast. Amid the traditional scenes were hints of foreign influence, too. Like many huts, a rice shed stood on stilts made from the shells of American cluster bombs. Nearby, a modern two-story cement house was under construction, its owner said to be a man who got a job with PowerChina.

A hillside pasture above the nearby village of Dak Rant offered an even clearer view of recent history. In the foreground, a herd of cows meandered around a cluster of circular holes, nibbling on vegetation so peacefully it was easy to forget that these craters came from bombs unloaded by American planes more than 50 years ago. The only trees and bushes on the denuded hill were growing out of the craters. Rising up behind the pockmarked hill, radiating into the distance, row after row of sleek new Chinese turbines extended to the horizon. Under that canopy of turbines lie 32 villages with about 17,000 inhabitants, roughly 90 percent of whom are members of the Triang ethnic minority.

During construction, Monsoon scrambled to deal with grievances from villagers ranging from the loss of agricultural land to the disturbance of what an impact report refers to as “environmental spirits.” In the hamlet of Dak Bong, villagers voiced their anger about PowerChina’s plans to put a transmission line over the sacred cemetery where their ancestors were buried. According to Boakajorn, the company agreed to change the route of the transmission line so as not to disturb the spirits of the villagers’ venerated ancestors. Often when foreign contractors had to work close to a village, the locals would conduct rituals. Boakajorn says that overall, the company has paid out $1.3 million in compensation for the loss of land, trees, income and cultural heritage. It’s a small line item in a project that cost nearly a billion dollars. But the attentiveness to local needs did have one big success: Boakajorn says that not a single family was forcibly resettled because of Monsoon.

As disorienting as the arrival of the wind farm may have been, hundreds of villagers found temporary jobs as construction workers, cooks, security guards or truck drivers. Truck drivers received the best salary, one villager said, worth more than $200 a month, which is many times the local average. But most jobs ended after PowerChina installed the last turbine in April. Few villagers have the education or skills to qualify for a job in operations, though Boakajorn says that Monsoon still employs 120 villagers to work in everything from forest protection to community relations. With more than a million dollars set aside annually for the community development fund, Monsoon has become almost a mini-government in the area, awarding scholarships, teaching locals about coffee farming and providing solar modules to a few villages that are furthest off the electricity grid. The company is even turning its main camp into a training facility for the community. For all this, there is still one inescapable fact: The local people do not receive a single watt of electricity from the wind farm that now occupies their land.

Out next to the road, a barefoot woman in her early 20s was managing her family’s open-air convenience store as clients sat at a wooden table perched on beer crates. Asked if the Monsoon project had brought changes to the village, she pointed to the old boarded-up wooden house next door. “The shop used to be there,” she said, “but business was good so we built this new one.” The new cement building boasts whitewashed walls and linoleum tiles, along with a new refrigerator and freezer. Chinese workers often stopped by on their way up and down the road — “They only buy Pepsi and sweets,” she said — but the real uptick in business came from local villagers, many of them subsistence farmers receiving cash wages for the first time.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/21/magazine/21mag-Laos-14/21mag-Laos-14-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 13:03:15.164478

The coexistence of both aid frameworks with similar objectives does not facilitate the application of State aid rules.
CMS has the widest coverage and largest team of State aid specialists in Europe.
Below is a link to the CMS expert guide on State aid:","On 25 June 2025, the European Commission adopted the State aid framework supporting the Clean Industrial Deal (CISAF). The CISAF, which replaces the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework (TCTF), provides for several categories of aid that can be granted by Member States to improve access to affordable energy, to boost demand and supply of tech products, to unlock public and private investments, to power the circular economy, to develop international partnerships and to secure skills and quality jobs for social fairness. It was drafted following a survey on the impact of the TCTF, a public consultation and multilateral meetings with Member State experts on the contemplated measures to be adopted.

The CISAF, which will be in force until 31 December 2030, aims at supporting the Clean Industrial Deal (CID), a major initiative to enhance industrial competitiveness and decarbonisation across the EU.

The CISAF provides the following key provisions designed to streamline and facilitate State aid measures for Member States:

Measures accelerating the rollout of renewable energy and low carbon fuels through aid schemes: firstly, the CISAF aims at simplifying the procedures for approval and accelerating implementation of investments in renewable energy, investments in storage of RFNBOs, biofuels, bioliquids, biogas and biomass fuels (where the storage is exclusively for renewable energy), and investments in electricity, as well as thermal storage.

The category of measure also provides aid schemes to ‘fast-track’ the rollout of low-carbon fuels, such as blue and green hydrogen, provided certain conditions are met. These measures empower Member States to invest more efficiently and swiftly in clean energy projects, a key step in meeting the decarbonisation objectives of the CID and accelerating the transition to renewable energy.

Finally, the CISAF also provides new rules on flexibility measures and capacity mechanisms; they give Member States tools to integrate variable renewables such as wind and solar power while ensuring reliable electricity supply. The CISAF’s 'target model' capacity mechanisms may qualify for fast-track approval, while other designs are assessed under the Climate, Energy and Environmental Aid Guidelines (CEEAG).

Temporary measures supporting electricity cost relief for energy-intensive users: these aim at ensuring the transition to low-cost clean electricity by enabling Member States to support electricity prices for companies in sectors that are energy-intensive, highly exposed to international competition and face higher energy costs than other competitors in regions with less ambitious climate policies. In return, the companies are required to invest in decarbonisation.

Measures facilitating industrial decarbonisation of existing production facilities: these focus on supporting investments in a broad range of decarbonisation technologies, such as electrification, hydrogen, biofuels, biomass, hydrogen derived fuels, carbon capture utilisation and storage of natural gas. Member States may also design tender-based and direct aid schemes to support these projects based on predefined aid amounts. For larger projects (more than EUR 200 million), the aid will be capped according to the project’s funding cap. As an alternative, Member States can also choose to determine the maximum aid amount under an aid scheme by a competitive bidding process that complies with certain conditions.

Measures ensuring sufficient manufacturing capacity in clean technologies in the EU: under the CISAF, Member States can support investments in new manufacturing capacity. This includes support through schemes for all technologies covered by the Net-Zero Industry Act, as well as individual aids for net-zero manufacturing projects when necessary to prevent their relocation outside Europe. This aid is extended to provide support for the production and processing of critical raw materials necessary for manufacturing such technologies. Also, the CISAF authorises Member States to offer higher levels of aid to match support provided in third countries, preventing investments from being diverted from the EU. Finally, the CISAF allows Member States to offer tax incentives, such as allowing companies to deduct the cost of clean technology investments from their taxable income more rapidly.

Measures to de-risk private investments: Member States can adopt measures to reduce the risks associated with private investment in projects covered by the CISAF, including industrial decarbonisation, clean technologies, clean energy, energy infrastructure projects and projects supporting the circular economy. Support may consist of equity, loans or guarantees given to a fund or a special purpose vehicle managing eligible projects.

The CISAF therefore sets up various new categories of aid to encourage Member States to finance the implementation of the CID. However, national budgets have been under strain and priorities are switching in the current international context.

Moreover, the conditions are restrictive as most of the aid may only be granted under an aid scheme and after prior notification to the European Commission. This is therefore a missed opportunity for a fast, streamlined process and simplified compatibility conditions.

In parallel with the CISAF, the CEEAG remains in force and may be used by Member States to grant different or individual aid. The coexistence of both aid frameworks with similar objectives does not facilitate the application of State aid rules.

In addition, Member States may continue to implement State aid in this area under the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER), without prior notification to the Commission. The GBER, which expires on 31 December 2026, is currently under revision and should in future include additional categories of aid under simplified compatibility conditions.

So far, the European Commission has only adopted a French aid scheme relating to offshore wind farms. It is therefore too early to evaluate the real impact of the CISAF on Member State policy.

OK, let’s say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed.","By CALEIGH WELLS

Tax incentives that saved U.S. residents thousands of dollars on home efficiency upgrades, clean energy installations and electric vehicles are expiring this year. That means people who want to take advantage of them before they disappear have to act quickly.

“There is still time, but the clock is ticking,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we’ve got some tips on how to maximize savings.

Refresh my memory. What are these incentives?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren’t capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

When are they expiring?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it’s also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

The car doesn’t need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

If I’m focused on my home, what should I prioritize?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

“That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,” she said. “Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.”

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

“We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn’t mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,” Pierce said.

“Experts estimate that takes 16 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that’s quick,” said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. “You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it’s even possible.”

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?

OK, let’s say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren’t allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects — think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage — could be carried forward if you didn’t get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

Rewiring America said it’s not clear if that will continue given the accelerated expiration dates, and recommended consumers check with their tax adviser.

“Duke Energy’s reckless expansion of fossil gas is saddling North Carolinians with skyrocketing utility bills and deadlier extreme weather.","DURHAM, N.C.— More than 200 businesses and nonprofit groups have joined prominent climate scientists in pressing North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein to challenge Duke Energy’s huge expansion of fossil fuels.

In a letter sent to Stein today, the groups said Trump administration policies that will accelerate catastrophic climate change make it crucial for the governor to press Duke Energy to stop expanding fossil fuel use. Duke Energy, headquartered in North Carolina, is one of the world’s worst climate polluters.

“Your leadership could help inspire other states to realize they must also directly contest the climate-wrecking actions of corporate polluters in our midst,” the letter said. “You must be clear with the public, corporate leaders and state policy makers that the time is now for us to finally make the dramatic changes that climate scientists say we desperately need.”

The letter was signed by 71 North Carolina community groups and businesses, adding to some 160 groups endorsing a similar appeal in March.

“Now more than ever, we need strong local and state action to combat climate change,” said Mark Marcoplos, a leader in the green building community and former local elected official. “Stopping Duke Energy's anti-climate policies would be a huge step in the direction of less climate chaos.”

In an April letter to Stein, 61 scientists wrote: “We implore you to lead in the transition away from fossil fuels and to the renewable, resilient, equitable, affordable, and sustainable energy future that humanity desperately needs.”

The scientists said a genuine transition to renewable power by such a significant corporate polluter would bolster global efforts to avert full-blown climate, economic and social chaos.

“As attorney general, Stein contested Duke Energy’s gas expansion, suppression of solar and rate hikes,” said Jim Warren, director of NC WARN. “Now, as governor, he’s been pushing to assist communities devastated by Helene and Chantal but seems to be dodging the reality that Charlotte-based Duke Energy is a leading driver of global climate change. So far, the governor won’t even admit that North Carolina is making climate change worse instead of better. That simply has to change.”

Today’s letter suggests two commonsense steps Stein can take to begin weaning North Carolina off fossil fuels while helping communities that are facing more intense and more frequent weather disasters:

Champion installation of solar power and battery storage on critical public facilities such as fire/rescue stations, medical facilities and buildings used as shelters during severe weather and outages. Prioritize communities most vulnerable to power outages and other harm from fossil fuel-driven extreme weather. This would also reduce regional power demand during normal conditions.

Require data centers and other large power-using facilities to maximize solar power on rooftops, parking areas, lawns and south-, west- and east-facing walls, along with battery storage. This should be a standard part of investing in new facilities, which receive large taxpayer subsidies. The groups say there is a huge amount of misleading hype about the need for new data centers.

These steps would help protect communities during storms and power outages and create good solar power jobs. They also would help eliminate Duke Energy’s justification for building fracked gas and nuclear power plants — projects that would cause utility bills to soar while the climate crisis worsens.

“The governor can be a climate leader at a time when this country and this planet desperately need this kind of courage,” said Jean Su, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s energy justice program. “Duke Energy’s reckless expansion of fossil gas is saddling North Carolinians with skyrocketing utility bills and deadlier extreme weather. Politicians need to step up and take on the fossil fuel industry before more lives are lost.”

Duke Energy has one of the largest planned gas buildouts of any utility this decade and has announced it would consider delaying the retirement of its coal fleet in response to the Trump administration’s climate protection rollbacks. The corporation generates only 1.4% of its power from solar.",https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/images/center-frog-logo-300.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 13:04:45.822460

Dive Brief:

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced a probe into the nation’s largest proxy advisors, Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, on Tuesday.

Paxton said he had presented civil investigative demands to the firms “for potentially misleading institutional investors and public companies by issuing voting recommendations that advance radical political agendas,” according to the release.

The Texas probe comes shortly after a federal court issued a preliminary injunction on the state’s latest anti-ESG law, which targeted proxy advisory firms and restricted use of ESG factors. The law was passed earlier this year, and ISS and Glass Lewis sued in July to stop the law from going into effect on Sept. 1.

Dive Insight:

Paxton’s office said in the release that it is targeting the two firms for their collective influence in the international proxy advisory market and alleged they “routinely issue proxy voting recommendations in conflict with the best financial interests of their fiduciaries.” The office cited recommendations in favor of management decisions to implement DEI practices, gender-based hiring practices and climate policies.

ISS and Glass Lewis commanded 48% and 42%, respectively, of the proxy advisory market’s assets under advice in 2021, according to the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance. The two firms grew to collectively account for 97% of the market share by 2024, according to a separate post from Harvard Law’s corporate governance forum.

“Proxy firms like Glass Lewis and ISS too often sacrifice sound financial guidance to advance left-wing political goals, cheating not only investors but the American people as a whole,” Paxton alleged in the release. “Proxy advisors play a massive role in shaping corporate governance decisions in our country, affecting tens of billions of dollars.”

An ISS spokesperson told ESG Dive Thursday that the firm is aware of the announcement, and “ISS is confident that it has complied with all applicable laws and will vigorously defend itself from any allegations of wrongdoing.”

The Texas state legislature passed Senate Bill 2337 earlier this year, that would require proxy advisors who advise companies headquartered, incorporated in or re-domesticating to Texas to make that advice solely on financial interests and publish a disclosure if ESG or diversity, equity and inclusion concerns play a role in the advice, law firm Foley & Lardner said in an analysis.

ISS and Glass Lewis argued in their lawsuit that the Texas law would violate the firms’ First Amendment right to free association and the First Amendment’s prohibition on viewpoint discrimination. The proxy advisors also argued that the law is unconstitutionally vague and preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

In late August, U.S. District Court Judge Alan Albright of Texas’ Western District granted a preliminary injunction and ruled that the proxy firms are likely to succeed on the merits of their arguments on the law’s ERISA preemption and vagueness. Albright also ruled that the plaintiffs are also likely to succeed on the merits of their First Amendment challenge to the law.

Texas is not the only state going after ISS and Glass Lewis over their DEI and ESG policies. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced a probe into the firms over such policies in March, and Mississippi Secretary of State Michael Watson said in May that the state’s securities division had begun investigating the proxy advisors over their ESG policies.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/TgCJKPyiJ8x9c3vhnHdvCOu4FnZIFYlWAyicQODZI4g/g:nowe:0:0/c:4026:2274/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzI4MTgxNTE1LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-18 14:03:44.542195

(NASDAQ:FSLR), the largest vertically integrated solar manufacturer in the United States, stands at a critical juncture as it navigates a complex landscape of regulatory changes, technological advancements, and global market dynamics. With a market capitalization of $22.6 billion and a ""Good"" financial health rating from InvestingPro, this comprehensive analysis examines First Solar’s strategic position, financial performance, and future prospects in light of recent developments in the solar industry.

Company overview and market position

First Solar has established itself as a leader in the solar energy sector, specializing in the production of cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film solar modules. The company’s unique technology differentiates it from competitors who primarily focus on silicon-based panels. With a strong domestic manufacturing presence, First Solar is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for renewable energy solutions in the United States and globally.

The company’s strategic focus on utility-scale solar projects has allowed it to build a substantial backlog, providing revenue visibility well into the future. As of the latest reports, First Solar’s backlog stands at an impressive 66.3 GW through 2030, underscoring the long-term demand for its products.

Financial performance and guidance

First Solar’s financial performance has been a mixed bag in recent quarters, reflecting the volatile nature of the solar industry and the impact of policy changes. The company reported first-quarter 2025 revenue of $845 million, which fell short of analyst expectations. With trailing twelve-month earnings of $11.74 per share and a gross profit margin of 42.8%, the company maintains strong profitability despite market challenges. According to InvestingPro analysis, First Solar is currently trading near its Fair Value, suggesting balanced market pricing.

Looking ahead, First Solar has revised its full-year 2025 guidance, reflecting the uncertainties in the market. The company now projects revenue in the range of $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion, down from previous estimates of $5.3 billion to $5.8 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) guidance for 2025 has been adjusted to $12.50-$17.50, a decrease from the earlier projection of $17.00-$20.00.

Despite these near-term challenges, analysts remain optimistic about First Solar’s long-term prospects. Projections for 2026 and 2027 suggest significant growth in revenue and profitability, with some estimates pointing to EPS reaching $25.92 by 2027.

Regulatory environment and policy impacts

The regulatory landscape plays a crucial role in shaping First Solar’s business environment. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has been a game-changer for the company, providing substantial benefits for domestic solar manufacturing. First Solar is particularly well-positioned to benefit from the IRA’s provisions, including tax credits that could contribute significantly to its bottom line.

However, the solar industry is also grappling with the impact of tariffs on imported solar modules. The U.S. Department of Commerce’s recent determinations on antidumping and countervailing duties (AD/CVD) for solar imports from several Southeast Asian countries have created both challenges and opportunities for First Solar. While these tariffs may increase costs for some competitors, they also reinforce First Solar’s competitive advantage as a domestic manufacturer.

The implementation of Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions has further bolstered First Solar’s position in the U.S. market. These restrictions limit the eligibility of certain foreign-made components for government incentives, potentially increasing demand for First Solar’s domestically produced modules.

Technology and innovation

First Solar’s commitment to technological innovation remains a key driver of its competitive edge. The company’s CdTe thin-film technology offers several advantages over traditional silicon-based panels, including better performance in high-temperature and low-light conditions. Ongoing research and development efforts focus on improving module efficiency and reducing production costs.

The company has set ambitious targets for increasing its manufacturing capacity, aiming to reach 25 gigawatts of annual nameplate capacity by 2026. This expansion will not only allow First Solar to meet growing demand but also to benefit from economies of scale, potentially improving profit margins. The market appears confident in these growth plans, as evidenced by the stock’s impressive 65.5% return over the past six months. Want deeper insights?

Global expansion and manufacturing capacity

While First Solar’s core strength lies in its U.S. manufacturing capabilities, the company also maintains production facilities in Vietnam and Malaysia. However, recent policy developments, including potential reciprocal tariffs, have raised questions about the long-term strategic role of these international assets.

The company faces decisions regarding the utilization of its Southeast Asian facilities in light of changing global trade dynamics. Some analysts suggest that First Solar may consider idling or repurposing these plants if tariffs make their operation less economical. Conversely, the company could leverage these facilities to serve non-U.S. markets, diversifying its global footprint.

Bear Case

How might changes to IRA tax credits impact First Solar’s profitability?

First Solar’s current financial projections rely heavily on the benefits provided by the Inflation Reduction Act, particularly the tax credits for domestic solar manufacturing. Any significant changes or reductions to these credits could materially impact the company’s profitability. The uncertainty surrounding the long-term stability of these incentives poses a risk to First Solar’s earnings forecasts.

Moreover, if the IRA provisions were to be scaled back or eliminated, it could erode First Solar’s competitive advantage over foreign manufacturers. This scenario would likely lead to increased price competition in the U.S. market, potentially squeezing profit margins and reducing the company’s market share.

What risks does First Solar face from potential supply chain disruptions?

While First Solar benefits from its vertically integrated manufacturing model, it is not immune to supply chain challenges. The global semiconductor shortage and volatility in raw material prices could affect the company’s ability to meet production targets or maintain cost efficiencies.

Additionally, geopolitical tensions and trade disputes could disrupt the flow of critical components or materials needed for solar panel production. Any significant supply chain disruptions could lead to production delays, increased costs, and potential loss of market share to competitors who may have more diversified supply networks.

Bull Case

How could First Solar benefit from stricter FEOC restrictions?

The implementation of stricter Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions could significantly enhance First Solar’s competitive position in the U.S. market. As these restrictions limit the eligibility of foreign-made components for government incentives, demand for First Solar’s domestically produced modules could increase substantially.

Stricter FEOC policies would create a more favorable pricing environment for First Solar, potentially allowing the company to command premium prices for its products. This could lead to expanded profit margins and increased market share, as developers and utilities prioritize compliance with FEOC requirements to access government incentives.

What opportunities does First Solar have for international expansion?

While First Solar has a strong focus on the U.S. market, there are significant opportunities for international expansion. The global shift towards renewable energy presents numerous growth prospects in emerging markets across Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

First Solar’s technological advantages, particularly in high-temperature performance, make its products well-suited for many developing regions. By leveraging its existing manufacturing facilities in Southeast Asia and potentially establishing new production centers, First Solar could tap into growing demand in these markets while diversifying its revenue streams beyond the U.S.

Furthermore, as other countries implement their own clean energy incentives and domestic content requirements, First Solar’s experience in navigating complex regulatory environments could provide a competitive edge in establishing a presence in new markets.

Just over the past two months, the global battery recycling landscape appears to be going through an inflection point. It’s evident that activity is ramping up quickly in various markets, from North America to Europe, with a flurry of new facilities, partnerships and research breakthroughs suggesting the sector is shedding its pilot-project roots and committing to full-scale operations.

Investments in infrastructure

Interestingly, these developments are taking place at a time when end-of-life EV batteries have not yet flooded the market. The scale of investment signals that the industry is preparing for what’s coming.

Princeton NuEnergy opened its flagship recycling facility in Chester, South Carolina, this past August. The team is focused on manufacturing scrap, leftover materials and rejected components generated during the battery production process and producing battery-grade cathode materials, reportedly boasting recovery rates above 97% for lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese, with initial capacity targeted at 5,000 tons per year.

In Nevada, I tracked Aqua Metals’ progress as they guided stakeholders through their proprietary AquaRefining process during industry tours and workshops in August of this year. Aqua Metals is laying the groundwork for a strengthened supply chain in domestic battery recycling through joining a $4.99 million Department of Energy consortium with Penn State in 2024.

American Battery Technology Company is also pushing ahead in Nevada, buoyed by a $144 million DOE grant awarded late last year for expansion into a second recycling facility.

Over in Europe, Clarios acquired three additional plants in Germany and Austria, while Glencore wrapped up a takeover of Li-Cycle’s US assets. It’s hard to miss how these moves are consolidating black-mass processing under major global players.

Policy plays catch up

Policy is evolving too. When Alberta, Canada launched upgraded battery collection services with smart containers on September 4, I noticed how consumer-facing initiatives are catching up, if slowly, to industrial trends.

For the first time, battery producers, not local governments, are now held accountable for the end-of-life management of batteries under Alberta’s Extended Producer Responsibility regulations. This means producers fund and operate recycling programs, bringing more drop-off locations, better safety and more efficient pickups to residents. It’s a move toward making battery recycling more accessible and sustainable, setting an example that other regions may follow.

Collaborate and innovate

Partnerships between automakers and battery recyclers are gaining momentum. On the supply side, Ace Green Recycling and Gold Star Metals recently announced a multi-year partnership in Texas to supply Ace’s new facility with tens of thousands of tons of used lead-acid batteries each year, primarily sourced from automotive and industrial applications across the region. This agreement is a major step toward ensuring a stable feedstock for large-scale battery recycling, strengthening resource recovery efforts and supporting the region’s environmental goals.

In 2024, BMW of North America teamed up with Redwood Materials, a Nevada-based company, founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, and focused on recycling lithium-ion batteries from electric vehicles and consumer electronics. Redwood recovers up to 98% of valuable battery metals like lithium, nickel and cobalt and returns them to the supply chain. The company’s work with BMW may be a model of how car makers can manage battery end-of-life and help push the industry toward more advanced, circular recycling practices.

Universities and research labs are increasingly tackling battery design to make recycling easier. MIT researchers announced a new “self-assembling electrolyte,” a material inside the battery that serves as the pathway for ions. What’s unique about their approach is that this material is specially engineered to break apart in a simple liquid at the end of the battery’s life. So, instead of shredding a battery and dealing with a mix of metal and plastic, the battery can be cleanly separated into its components, making it far easier to recover valuable materials and prepare them for reuse. This kind of innovation could ultimately make EV batteries much more recyclable and sustainable.

So why this momentum now? The vast majority of feedstock is still limited because it essentially comes from manufacturing scrap, warranty returns and consumer electronics. The real focus of these movements will be in the 2030s, when retired EV batteries will finally arrive in volume. Investment decisions made this summer, from facility builds to supply contracts, are about the shift to large-scale, strategic positioning aimed at securing raw materials and market leadership down the road.

Growth on the horizon

Despite all this momentum, I recognize that the battery recycling industry is still in its infancy. Most incoming material isn’t post-consumer EV batteries. It’s primarily manufacturing scrap, warranty returns and batteries collected from electronic devices like phones, laptops and power tools. So today’s boom is more about preparation than short-term payoff. The true tsunami of battery retirement is years away, with most EVs sold since 2020 destined to stay on the road well into the next decade.

Looking at the data, forecasts are optimistic. GlobeNewswire valued the sector at $22.75 billion in 2024, potentially jumping to $41.66 billion by 2030. Knowledge Sourcing Intelligence projects $23.39 billion by 2030, up from $11.48 billion. In this case, the underlying driver is that electric vehicles are proliferating. According to the IEA’s Global EV Outlook 2025, more than 17 million electric cars sold worldwide in 2024, putting total stock near 58 million, with 2025 new sales expected to top 20 million.

What I see in leading recyclers and technology developers is a keen acknowledgment that long-term competitiveness hinges on building partnerships, securing feedstocks and investing in regulatory credibility now, before the volume surge begins, assuming that the market will grow exponentially.

Over the next couple of years, I expect to see more investments across North America, Europe and beyond in the battery recycling industry, in particular among private equity.

Conclusion The post-election energy landscape presents a dual challenge for solar ETF investors: short-term policy-driven volatility and long-term structural opportunities.","The 2024 U.S. presidential election has reshaped the energy sector's trajectory, with Donald Trump's re-election signaling a stark pivot toward fossil fuels and regulatory rollbacks. For investors in solar exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the implications are profound.

These measures, alongside the suspension of offshore wind permits and the centralization of renewable energy permitting under Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, have created a climate of uncertainty for clean energy marketsThe Impact of Trump's Energy Order on Solar Power[ 2 ].

Policy Shifts and Immediate Market Reactions

The Trump administration's emphasis on “drill, baby, drill” has already triggered volatility in solar ETFs. Following the election, the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) and Invesco Global Clean Energy ETF (PBD) fell by 7.3% and 6.3%, respectively, as investors recalibrated portfolios to favor fossil fuel energy funds like the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE), which surged 4% post-electionU.S. Energy Growth Opportunities Under Trump (2024–2030)[ 3 ]. This shift reflects a broader reallocation of capital toward sectors perceived as politically insulated, such as oil and gas, while renewables face headwinds from policy-driven uncertainty.

The phase-out of federal tax credits under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is particularly concerning. According to a report by Bloomberg, the elimination of investment and production tax credits by 2027 could reduce U.S. solar installations by 30% compared to pre-2024 projectionsUS solar installation forecast slashed due to Trump policies, …[ 4 ]. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) has warned that these rollbacks, combined with tariffs on imported solar panels, could stifle innovation and delay cost reductions that have historically driven sector growthThe solar industry’s top 10 priorities for Trump[ 5 ].

Historical Resilience and Long-Term Considerations

Despite these challenges, solar ETFs have demonstrated resilience in past policy cycles. From 2014 to 2024, the

A key factor in the sector's potential recovery lies in state-level policies and private-sector momentum.

Additionally, private equity and corporate sustainability goals are sustaining demand for solar infrastructure, particularly in onshore wind and distributed energy systemsSolar Under Trump: What To Expect In 2025[ 9 ].

Strategic Positioning for Investors

For investors seeking to navigate this volatile landscape, diversification and hedging are critical. Energy ETFs like XLE and the Vanguard Energy ETF (VDE) offer exposure to fossil fuel beneficiaries, but their performance may be tempered by long-term energy price trends. Conversely, renewable energy ETFs such as ICLN and TAN require careful risk management, given their sensitivity to policy shifts.

Conclusion

The post-election energy landscape presents a dual challenge for solar ETF investors: short-term policy-driven volatility and long-term structural opportunities. While Trump's agenda prioritizes fossil fuels, the renewable sector's resilience—bolstered by state-level incentives and private-sector innovation—suggests a path forward. Strategic positioning requires a balance of hedging against regulatory risks and capitalizing on the sector's enduring growth drivers.

For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.
Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price.
So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.
OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed.","Tax incentives that saved U.S. residents thousands of dollars on home efficiency upgrades, clean energy installations and electric vehicles are expiring this year. That means people who want to take advantage of them before they disappear have to act quickly.

“There is still time, but the clock is ticking,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we've got some tips on how to maximize savings.

Refresh my memory. What are these incentives?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren't capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

When are they expiring?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it's also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

The car doesn't need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

If I'm focused on my home, what should I prioritize?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

“That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,” she said. “Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.”

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

“We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn’t mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,” Pierce said.

“Experts estimate that takes 16 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that’s quick,” said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. “You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it’s even possible.”

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?

OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren't allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects — think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage — could be carried forward if you didn't get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

Rewiring America said it's not clear if that will continue given the accelerated expiration dates, and recommended consumers check with their tax adviser.

Washington – Yesterday Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the EPA would retain and defend the rule designating PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under the Superfund law or CERCLA (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act), which granted the agency more power to hold polluters accountable to pay for clean-up costs. Last year, the Biden administration finalized this rule, which is currently subject to an industry lawsuit led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

More than 20,000 Food & Water Watch members have urged Zeldin to defend this rule. New analysis from Food & Water Watch found that the PFAS industry spent up to $60 million in the first half of the year lobbying the EPA on PFAS and related matters. Late last week the administration filed a motion in a separate lawsuit asking a federal court to throw out other rules limiting the level of four common and dangerous PFAS chemicals in drinking water.

In response, Mary Grant, the Public Water for All Campaign Director at Food & Water Watch said:

“Across the country, people of all stripes have demanded that polluters be held accountable to pay to clean up the dangerous PFAS contamination in drinking water. For decades, families have lost loved ones to cancers and other diseases associated with these lab-made chemicals. It’s a positive development that the EPA is choosing to keep the Biden-era polluter-pay rule for PFOA and PFOS.

“While this is a good decision, Lee Zeldin’s record is marred by his recent decisions to eliminate key protections to limit PFAS in drinking water following an avalanche of industry lobbying and the appointment of industry insiders to key positions at the EPA. Our country, our communities and our families deserve better. The EPA must immediately cease its efforts to gut and delay limits on PFAS in drinking water, require all polluters to pay to clean up the entire class of thousands of toxic PFAS chemicals, and ban all nonessential uses of PFAS to stop the pollution in the first place.

Without intervention, American families and businesses will find it increasingly challenging to access dependable and affordable electricity.

As the U.S. Department of Energy recently warned in its reliability outlook, this is not a distant challenge, and protecting existing baseload power may not be enough to protect against future shortages. While the long-term horizon provides ample time to ramp up, the next decade looks far less promising as retirements of fossil fuel-based power plants will rapidly outpace new deployments. Electricity bills and brownouts could become a reality. Energy abundance lowers prices and generates economic activity, economic security and national security. On the other hand, energy poverty results in scarcity, high prices, and insecurity.

Fortunately, solutions are within reach. Initiatives like the Desert Southwest pipeline, which will deliver natural gas from West Texas to Arizona, demonstrate how targeted infrastructure can stabilize energy supplies in high-demand regions. Coupled with modernized grids and expanded transmission networks, these efforts can support emerging technologies while ensuring reliability. The focus must clearly align with an energy mix composed of multiple sources of energy. Such an approach removes politics and ensures that energy is available, reliable, and affordable.

Policymakers have a vital role in ensuring that a lack of energy does not become America’s Achilles heel. The previous administration assumed that demand would create capacity and that installed renewable capacity was the same as 24/7 generating capacity. The reality is that demand builds faster than capacity, and we are falling behind.

The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and Inflation Reduction Act provide initial support, but more funds must prioritize grid upgrades and reliable baseload power over renewable-heavy projects. The DOE’s National Transmission Planning Study calls for tripling transmission capacity by 2050 to prevent bottlenecks. Streamlining permitting and regulatory processes for pipelines and power lines is critical to deliver energy where it’s needed most.

We must refrain from prematurely phasing out reliable and inexpensive fossil fuels until adequate new capacity is fully operational. The Department of Energy and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should collaborate to develop a cohesive, long-term strategy to guarantee uninterrupted energy transmission across state boundaries.

Although renewable sources are essential, it is not the magic answer. A diverse energy portfolio includes a proper all-in approach. That means fossil fuels, as well as low-carbon alternatives such as hydroelectric, geothermal, and nuclear energy sources, along with wind and solar energy, are essential for affordability and reliability.

America’s energy future demands more than optimism. It requires a pragmatic, all-of-the-above strategy that prioritizes infrastructure investment, preserves dependable power sources, and fosters innovation. By acting with foresight and resolve, America can harness the opportunities of new technologies while securing the energy foundation that powers our nation’s progress.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/uHVw5MYJf-dSWPPuxTgEJfDC-91M4kLHkNmJUSzKiJs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzU2NTYyMDY5LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-18 12:07:33.104074

“That they’ll truly take on the responsibility that they have to promote and ensure that environmental justice is carried out across the commonwealth.”","CHESTER, Va.—For the first 60 years Duane Brankley lived here, about a mile and a half from a coal plant owned by Dominion Energy, coal ash coated the shingles on his roof and the insides of his lungs.

The coal plant finally closed in 2023, but soon Brankley could be facing an even more insidious air pollutant: fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5, from a new natural gas plant, the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center, that Dominion wants to build on the site of the old coal facility.

Given what he’s experienced, Brankley is concerned about the future air quality in his neighborhood as the utility seeks a needed air permit for its new facility, one of six future natural gas plants the utility claims are necessary to meet periods of peak demand on the electric grid that it says could soon be strained in Virginia by data center development.

Along with an air permit review, the proposed natural gas plant needs a construction permit that includes Dominion’s environmental justice analysis that purports to evaluate the harm facing surrounding underserved community members, like Brankley. But attorneys from the Southern Environmental Law Center, representing the Chesterfield County Branch NAACP, Mothers Out Front and the Central American Solidarity Association, say it lacks community health information and does not adequately assess risk exposure to the plant.

“They don’t care about the pollution harming people,” said Brankley. “It’s the cha-ching they’re worried about. Money, money, money.”

Brankley is not alone. Aliya Farooq, another community member, lives a few miles away from the plant and is a plaintiff alongside Brankley and former Virginia Sierra Club Chapter director Glen Bessa in a lawsuit, now heading to the Virginia Court of Appeals, that challenges a local land use approval.

The utility’s service requirements, outside of the peak periods, are projected to grow from a demand of 17.7 gigawatts in 2023 to 33.7 gigawatts in 2048. While it is pursuing carbon free nuclear, offshore wind and solar and storage, the utility claims renewables can’t be relied on in the early morning and evenings when the sun isn’t shining, as well as when the wind isn’t blowing to meet periods of high stress.

Asked about the utility’s environmental justice analysis of environmental impacts on nearby communities, spokesperson Aaron Ruby pointed to public comments that Cedric Green, senior vice president of generation, made before Virginia’s environmental regulators.

The peaker plant’s air permit requires maximum reduction of emissions, Green said. “This project is located on the site of long-standing coal units, and I would emphasize that there will be less emissions from this project than from the coal units it replaces.”

Many in attendance at a Department of Environmental Quality hearing on the peaker plant earlier this month, including a Dominion Energy-backed group called the Virginia Reliability Alliance, spoke in support of the project because of what they said was its reliability promise. But opponents pointed to the project running counter to the state’s decarbonization law, the Virginia Clean Economy Act and an opportunity for battery storage to increase reliability of renewables.

Coal Plant Continuing to Give

Although transitioning from burning coal to natural gas, the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center would be allowed to release new pollutants into the community despite community members’ concerns.

The former coal plant began operations in 1944 and had four coal units that retired between March 2019 and 2023. Two natural gas fired turbines have remained, with a combined capacity of 420 megawatts.

The utility initially proposed the peaker plant in 2019 but shelved it as the state passed, with Democrats in control of the governor’s mansion and both legislative chambers, the Virginia Clean Economy Act. It required that Dominion transition to a 100 percent clean energy portfolio by 2045.

When the coal plant operated two units that phased down between 2020 and 2022 before their retirement in 2023, about 43.99 tons of PM 2.5 and 221.96 tons of PM 10 were emitted on average each year, along with 165.28 tons of carbon monoxide, 19.29 tons of volatile organic compounds and 1.7 million tons of greenhouse gases.

The new facility will annually emit a maximum amount of 153.96 tons of each PM 2.5 and PM 10, 825.3 tons of carbon monoxide, 162.5 tons of volatile organic compounds, 2.215 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, 353.3 tons of nitrous oxide, 27.8 tons of sulfur dioxide, 17.92 tons of sulfuric acid and .01 tons of lead, according to Dominion’s application to DEQ.

While Dominion claims that is a decrease in emissions from when the coal units ran, the SELC contends the gas units will produce an increase in PM 2.5, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and greenhouse gases compared to 2022 levels.

During the administration of former President Joe Biden, air quality standards for power plants were made more stringent, but now the Trump administration and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin are seeking to roll those rules back.

According to the American Lung Association, PM 2.5 exposure can lead to more asthma attacks, respiratory illnesses and more, including early deaths.

“There is no safe threshold to breathe in fine particles,” the association states.

A “Desktop Review”

Under the Virginia Environmental Justice Act, another law Virginia passed in 2020, an environmental justice community is defined as either a community of color or a low-income community that faces an increased health risk by being in close proximity to air pollution or disproportionate impacts from any “industrial, governmental, or commercial operation, program, or policy.”

Chesterfield County, with a population of about 364,548 people, has about 80,000 Black people and 40,000 Hispanic people. Biden’s environmental justice screen, a tool showing a demographic background for an area, found that 50 to 90 percent of people living in areas surrounding the plant are of color. Trump has since removed the tool.

Dominion’s EJ analysis found that 22 of the 24 census block groups within a three-mile radius of the plant qualify as an environmental justice community under Virginia’s law. While acknowledging those communities, the utility asserts the project “minimizes potential environmental impacts such that local community health and other aspects of the environment will be protected.” Dominion also adds that its analysis for the DEQ “will show no significant adverse and disproportionate impacts to EJ communities.”

DEQ officials did not respond to requests for comment.

James, with the SELC, is critical of Dominion’s EJ analysis, calling it a “desktop review,” without further evaluating the community’s actual health conditions. When cross referencing the proposed location with a 2023 Chesterfield-Colonial Height Health Assessment, residents west of the site comprise a high social vulnerability index making them more at risk of disease.

Loren Hopkins, a professor at Rice University in Houston who was hired by the SELC, noted a lack of community health information and only three air monitors 12, 11.5 and 7.5 miles away from the site, providing insufficient data.

“In this respect, to accurately project the plant’s health impacts, Dominion must not only complete a robust baseline study of community health (e.g., current rates of asthma attack, asthma incidence, cardiac events, stroke, diabetes, and cancer), but must also determine the existing concentrations of harmful pollutants at the site,” Hopkins wrote in a report.

Community members have conducted their own study. It involves work with Lakshmi Fjord, an environmental justice anthropologist with the University of Virginia, who helped compile data showing that a natural gas compressor station in Buckingham County had a disproportionate impact on Black people living within the surrounding area. That finding led the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn the compressor’s permit. Now, those Buckingham Community members are speaking up again.

“Dominion came out with the same story, the same line, how it’s going to be productive, how its going to make a difference,” said Richard Walker, a leading activist against the Buckingham compressor station at a DEQ public hearing last week. “But the key thing that they do, they didn’t do an environmental justice impact study, and here we go again.”

Any environmental justice determination DEQ makes will be based on guidance that has remained in a draft form under the administration of Gov. Glenn Youngkin and had issues in the eyes of James’ group.

“Our hope is that DEQ will consider the various comments that are submitted and evaluate the concerns that people have raised about the potential disproportionate health impacts,” James said in an interview. “That they’ll truly take on the responsibility that they have to promote and ensure that environmental justice is carried out across the commonwealth.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_9543-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 12:07:36.791743

WASHINGTON – Following a roundtable with AI and data center leaders at the White House on Monday, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that it will be prioritizing the review of new chemicals under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) that are intended for use in data center projects or for the manufacturing of covered components, as defined by Executive Order 14318, “Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure.” This prioritization of reviews will start with submissions received on or after September 29, 2025.

“We inherited a massive backlog of new chemical reviews from the Biden Administration which is getting in the way of projects as it pertains to data center and artificial intelligence projects. The Trump EPA wants to get out of the way and help speed up progress on these critical developments, as opposed to gumming up the works. We are taking every step possible to make America the artificial intelligence capital of the world. The American people demand it. President Trump and his team are getting it done,” said EPA Administrator Zeldin.

The expeditious review of new chemicals, especially those needed to support our nation’s investment, advances innovation and helps to grow our nation’s economy. This effort advances Administrator Zeldin’s Powering the Great American Comeback initiative by streamlining the review of critically needed chemicals and ensuring data centers and related facilities can be powered and operated in a clean manner to make the U.S. the AI capital of the world.

Section 7 of the Executive Order directs the EPA to expedite permitting on Federal and non-Federal lands under laws including TSCA that impact the development of qualifying projects such as AI data centers and the infrastructure that powers them (i.e. high voltage transmission lines and other equipment). In line with this directive, EPA will prioritize review of certain new chemicals to reduce the regulatory burden to companies looking to invest in them.

EPA will prioritize the review of submissions for new chemicals that are intended for use in data center projects or in the manufacturing of covered components, in each case, which pertain to a data center project that is a qualifying project, as defined by the Executive Order. New chemical manufacturers may also seek to prioritize the review of a new chemical under the directives of this Executive Order if the chemical has such an intended use. While the agency is prioritizing the review of new chemicals related to this Executive Order, EPA is committed to reviewing all new chemical submissions in a timely manner and continues work to reduce the backlog of new chemicals under review.

To help companies determine if their chemical and intended use qualify for prioritized review, EPA has provided instructions for the best way for submitters to make their request and provide necessary information to support the request. Companies with new chemicals qualifying for prioritized review can identify their submission as a chemical intended for use in a data center project or for the manufacturing of covered components by submitting a cover letter through the Central Data Exchange (CDX) with their new chemical submission identifying the use and the data center where the new chemical or covered component will be used.

EPA will assess this method of identifying relevant submissions as time goes on to ensure the timely review of new chemicals to make the U.S. the AI capital of the world.

Background

President Trump’s Executive Order 14179, “Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence (AI),” boldly calls for America to advance dominance in technological innovation through the creation of an AI Action Plan. “America’s AI Action Plan,” released in July 2025, is comprised of three pillars—innovation, infrastructure, and international diplomacy and security—that provide the foundational framework for victory in this hypercompetitive global race. Inspired by this vision, EPA is focused on strengthening America’s energy foundation and ensuring our nation remains the global leader in AI and the infrastructure that powers it.

Making America the AI Capital of the World is a core pillar of Administrator Zeldin’s Powering the Great American Comeback Initiative. In July, Administrator Zeldin attended the Pennsylvania Energy & Innovation Summit and participated in a roundtable alongside President Trump and National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC) partners where industry leaders announced over $90 billion in investments in the Keystone State, creating jobs and helping to unleash American energy to power the AI revolution.",https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-news-releases-og.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 12:07:51.035958

This week, we’re celebrating National Clean Energy Week across the state to highlight our efforts to build the clean energy future Wisconsin deserves.

Folks, we don’t have to choose between mitigating climate change and protecting our environment and good-paying jobs and economic development—we can and should do both.

And a clean energy economy is as much about protecting the health of our communities as it is about protecting the health of our environment.

So, as governor, I’ve made protecting our environment and investing in a clean energy economy to support our 21st-century needs a top priority of my administration since Day One.

We’ve joined the U.S. Climate Alliance, created a Office of Sustainability and Clean Energy, and developed our state’s first-ever Clean Energy Plan.

We also created the Green Ribbon Commission on Clean Energy and Environmental Innovation and our Green Innovation Fund, and so much more!

And I was thrilled to sign legislation to advance the state’s nuclear energy innovation to continue our work towards ensuring Wisconsin has 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2050.

Through these efforts, we’re working to lower energy bills for families, reduce reliance on out-of-state energy sources, and invest in jobs and apprenticeship training all while building a brighter, healthier, and more prosperous future.

And while leaders in Washington continue to slash and claw back millions of dollars of federal funding for clean energy initiatives across our state, sending us backwards, this work is more important than ever.

Now is the time to roll up our sleeves and get to work, and here in Wisconsin, that’s exactly what we are going to continue to do.

In a news release, EPA said, “This proposal is an important step in the EPA’s tireless work to repair the damage done after four years of the Biden-Harris administration neglecting key components of the RFS program, including threats to transform the RFS program into a subsidy for electric vehicle charging stations as part of a larger strategy to electrify the transportation sector. The Trump administration reaffirms its renewed commitment to honor the program’s purpose to support biofuels as an essential part of a thriving liquid fuels market.”

Renewable Fuels Association President and CEO Geoff Cooper said, “While we continue to question whether any SREs for 2023-2025 are truly justified in the first place, we are encouraged that EPA is proposing to add the exempted volumes back to future RFS requirements for 2026 and 2027. We support EPA’s proposed option to fully reallocate 2023-2025 SREs and believe such an approach will ensure intended levels of renewable fuel consumption are maintained over the long-term. We appreciate that EPA continues to focus on SRE approaches that minimize marketplace disruptions, while honoring the congressional purpose and intent of the RFS program. EPA clearly recognizes that an unmitigated influx of RIN credits from SREs could devastate markets and undermine renewable fuel production and consumption. As this is only a proposal, we look forward to working with EPA to ensure its final rule appropriately upholds the integrity of the RFS program, supports America’s farmers, and strengthens our nation’s energy and economic security.”

Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor said, “With this proposal, EPA acknowledges how important biofuels like ethanol are to the rural economy. We commend the Trump EPA for being the first-ever EPA to propose a way to ensure past-year SRE gallons don’t compromise renewable fuel demand. Full reallocation of exempt gallons is a surefire way to drive income to America’s rural communities. We look forward to providing detailed comments on how EPA can align the final rulemaking with the president’s energy dominance agenda while maintaining the integrity of the RFS and delivering the greatest possible benefit to American agriculture.”

The American Soybean Association said the rule offers two options for reallocation — 100% or 50% of exempted renewable fuel volumes — and said ASA “strongly supports 100% reallocation to uphold the integrity of the Renewable Fuel Standard.”

Clean Fuels Alliance America Vice President of Federal Affairs Kurt Kuvarick said, “Clean Fuels commends EPA for proposing to ensure that the RFS volumes it finalizes for upcoming years are not eroded by small refinery exemptions. U.S. biodiesel and renewable diesel production supports 10% of the value of every bushel of soybeans grown here. It is one bright spot in the agricultural economy this year.”

National Oilseed Processors Association President and CEO Devin Mogler said, “We appreciate EPA’s thoughtful approach in addressing the small refinery exemptions inherited from the previous administration and urge the agency to fully account for all waived gallons. NOPA applauds the EPA for maintaining the policy of prospectively accounting for future SREs, and encourages the agency to swiftly finalize the 2026-2027 RVO proposal, inclusive of the import-RIN discount, to provide the certainty the market needs to invest and grow.”",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/12/2025/09/18084505/RFS-RFP-092225.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 13:03:23.633153

To accelerate sectoral growth, the policy encourages collaborations with state governments, international partners, oil and gas companies, and research institutions. It also calls for the creation of a strong public-private ecosystem supported by capacity building, knowledge sharing, and human resource development, laying the foundation for long-term sustainability of India’s geothermal sector.

As part of its initial rollout, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has sanctioned five geothermal projects, comprising both pilot demonstrations and resource assessment initiatives.

This framework was developed by the Problem Solvers Caucus Permitting, Energy & Environment Working Group, led by Reps. Scott Peters (CA-50) and Gabe Evans (CO-08), along with Co-Chairs Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01) and Tom Suozzi (NY-03).
The framework reflects months of bipartisan collaboration with energy producers, industry experts, Members across committees of jurisdiction, and stakeholders across the political spectrum.

The Problem Solvers Caucus is changing that,” said Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01).","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, the Problem Solvers Caucus announced its endorsement of a bipartisan permitting reform framework. As momentum builds for Congress to act on permitting reform, the recommendations in this framework offer a commonsense, two-party roadmap to streamline the permitting process, boost energy production of all kinds, and give investors the clarity and confidence they need to invest in America.

This framework was developed by the Problem Solvers Caucus Permitting, Energy & Environment Working Group, led by Reps. Scott Peters (CA-50) and Gabe Evans (CO-08), along with Co-Chairs Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01) and Tom Suozzi (NY-03).

The framework reflects months of bipartisan collaboration with energy producers, industry experts, Members across committees of jurisdiction, and stakeholders across the political spectrum. It lays out a path forward to update the permitting system so the United States can compete globally and remain a responsible steward of the environment.

With the country poised to see one of the largest increases in energy demand in decades, Congress needs to act now. Communities and businesses across the country are facing rising costs and growing demand for affordable, reliable energy. Yet, too many projects remain stalled for years — some more than a decade — due to outdated regulations, duplicative reviews, and endless litigation, stifling innovation and driving up costs for families.

Key elements of the framework include:

• Cutting red tape for linear infrastructure projects

• Meeting growing energy demand across sectors

• Reforming outdated and duplicative NEPA requirements

• Establishing clear, enforceable permitting deadlines

• Strengthening domestic supply chains

The full framework can be viewed here.

""America faces a choice between cheap, abundant energy from all of the above sources or higher energy prices, falling behind China, and an increased risk of blackouts,"" said Congressman Scott Peters (CA-50). ""It’s obvious where we need to go. To get there, we know we need to update our environmental laws to meet the challenges of today and invest in a grid for this century. This platform represents a bipartisan commitment to set aside ideology and solve this problem for the American people. I look forward to working with my colleagues to keep the momentum going and turn this into legislation that can pass both chambers of Congress.""

“Reforming our permitting system is crucial, and this framework meets the moment for much-needed change. The demand for affordable and reliable energy of all kinds becomes increasingly urgent,” said Congressman Gabe Evans (CO-08). ""By cutting through red tape, we can meet energy demand, lower costs, strengthen national security, and create high-quality jobs in America, while being responsible stewards of the environment and maintaining our position of global leadership and not cede ground to China. The urgency is real, and I am proud of this bipartisan push for change.”

“The number one issue Americans are concerned about is the cost of living,” said Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Tom Suozzi (NY-03). “Sky-high energy costs play an enormous role—electricity prices rose more than 6.5% in just the last year, and demand is skyrocketing. Right now it takes years, even decades, for new green energy and other projects to get connected to the grid and start generating energy to meet demand. We need commonsense, bipartisan solutions to cut red tape, bring projects online faster, and make energy more affordable for American families. That’s exactly what this framework does.”

“America wins the future by building faster, smarter, and cleaner than our competitors — lowering costs, creating jobs, and strengthening security here at home. But our permitting system has been holding us back. The Problem Solvers Caucus is changing that,” said Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01). ""Our bipartisan framework sets clear rules, enforces real deadlines, unleashes investment in every form of American energy, and strengthens our security and supply chains while protecting our environment. This is the model for governing in the 21st century: two parties coming together to clear the path for innovation, jobs, and affordable energy — proving that when both parties lead together, America leads the world.”

“Too much government red tape drives up costs for Nevada families and industries alike. As one of the top two geothermal states in the country, red tape is currently preventing us from unleashing our full clean power potential and getting reliable and affordable energy on the grid,” said Congresswoman Susie Lee (NV-03). “I’m thrilled to have a bipartisan framework that includes my proposed geothermal permitting reforms.“

“As Co-Chair of the Climate Solutions Caucus, I believe we need to move energy and infrastructure projects forward in a way that strengthens our economy, lowers costs, and protects our environment,"" said Congressman Andrew Garbarino (NY-02). ""This permitting reform framework is a step toward cutting through red tape so we can build cleaner, more reliable energy, create good-paying jobs, bolster our supply chains, and secure American energy dominance for the future.”

“There is still time, but the clock is ticking,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we’ve got some tips on how to maximize savings.

Refresh my memory. What are these incentives?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren’t capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

When are they expiring?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it’s also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

The car doesn’t need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

If I’m focused on my home, what should I prioritize?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

“That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,” she said. “Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.”

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

“We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn’t mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,” Pierce said.

“Experts estimate that takes 16 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that’s quick,” said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. “You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it’s even possible.”

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?

OK, let’s say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren’t allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects — think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage — could be carried forward if you didn’t get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

Rewiring America said it’s not clear if that will continue given the accelerated expiration dates, and recommended consumers check with their tax adviser.

The Accelerating Resilient Infrastructure Initiative is designed to help rapidly scope, finance and deploy resilient energy infrastructure, such as microgrids, while federal incentives remain available. The initiative comes at a pivotal moment for U.S. energy infrastructure. With federal incentives currently available for clean energy projects, communities have a unique opportunity to accelerate deployment of resilient energy infrastructure. Acting now allows organizations to take advantage of existing funding mechanisms before key deadlines shift—making timely planning essential.

Participants joining forces to support the initiative at launch include:

Global technology leader Microsoft, bringing cloud, AI and data capabilities

Infrastructure providers AlphaStruxure, AZZO, Celsius Energy, CDM Smith EVerged, Mainspring Energy, Pisgah Energy, Sprocket Power, Sunrock Distributed Generation, Sustainability Partners, Unison Energy, Verdant Microgrid and Viridi.

Consulting firms Arcadis, Baringa and Viridi Edge; electrical distributor Graybar; global insurer Zurich; and the nonprofit Resilient Cities Network.

Strategic integrator Schneider Electric, connecting customers with project developers and providing advanced energy technologies.

""Communities are under increasing pressure to maintain reliable, affordable power in the face of aging infrastructure, extreme weather, rising demand and evolving cyber threats,"" said Jana Gerber, North American President of Microgrids for Schneider Electric. ""With power outages costing the U.S. economy an estimated $150 billion each year, the need for resilient energy infrastructure has never been more urgent. This initiative brings together industry leaders to accelerate the deployment of local, future-ready energy solutions, helping communities reduce risk, control costs and ensure continuity of critical services.""

""The initiative is a powerful example of how industry collaboration and digital innovation can accelerate the deployment of resilient energy infrastructure at scale,"" said Darryl Willis, Corporate Vice President, Energy & Resources Industry at Microsoft. ""By combining Schneider Electric's expertise with Microsoft's trusted cloud and AI technologies, we are helping communities strengthen critical infrastructure, unlock new business value and advance a more sustainable, secure and resilient energy future.""

By 2028, the U.S. power grid is expected to reach a critical inflection point, where peak electricity supply may no longer meet peak demand, threatening grid reliability. The initiative aims to ease grid stress and curb rising energy costs by scaling distributed energy resources (DERs). These include solar panels, battery energy storage, geothermal heat pumps, and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. By deploying these technologies, the initiative helps communities reduce reliance on the centralized grid, mitigate the impact of rising utility rates, strengthen energy resilience and support long-term sustainability goals.

Financing and Delivery at Scale

Project developers AlphaStruxure, AZZO, EVerged, Unison Energy, Verdant Microgrid and Sunrock have identified $7.5 billion in capital to finance energy resilience projects for sites such as municipal facilities, airports, campuses, hospitals, schools, seaports and water-treatment plants.

Projects can be delivered as turnkey solutions through long-term service agreements such as Energy as a Service (EaaS) contracts. These convert upfront capital costs into predictable, recurring payments, making advanced energy systems more accessible. For organizations seeking to fund upgrades through operational savings, Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) offer a proven model, allowing improvements to be paid for over time using guaranteed energy savings. This approach eliminates the need for upfront investment and enables communities to reinvest savings into essential services and local priorities.

Microgrids for Reliability and Cost Certainty

Resilience solutions can include Schneider Electric's EcoStruxure™ Microgrid Flex system and Energy Control Center, along with solar, battery storage, fuel cells or flexible-fuel generators. Digital controls and advanced analytics connect these assets to optimize cost, resilience and sustainability.

Microgrids are localized energy systems that can operate independently from the centralized grid, providing reliable power during outages or grid stress. Schneider Electric's network of EcoXpert™ partners will support the national rollout. In addition to resilience, microgrids offer cost certainty and faster time to power by overcoming grid constraints.

Examples of resilient energy systems already being deployed include:

Montgomery County, Maryland: AlphaStruxure microgrids at two bus depots - Brookville and the David F. Bone Equipment Maintenance and Transit Operations Center (EMTOC) - support the county's 100% carbon emissions reduction goal. Brookville powers up to 70 electric buses with a 6.5-megawatt microgrid; EMTOC, currently at 6.84 megawatts, will eventually support 200 zero-emission buses.

Piscataway, New Jersey: Through its ""Piscataway Goes Green"" initiative, the township is deploying a 2.9-megawatt solar and microgrid system across eight municipal buildings, including Town Hall and Public Safety buildings. The project includes 28 EV charging stations - the largest municipal deployment in New Jersey - and battery energy storage to provide up to five days of backup power. It's expected to reduce the township's carbon footprint by more than 50% by 2026 and deliver $19 million in savings over 20 years.

Middle Tennessee Electric: A microgrid in Murfreesboro integrates solar, battery storage and smart energy management to serve 750,000 residents across four counties - ensuring continuity and advancing clean energy goals.

Longview Independent School District, Texas: A 4.2-megawatt solar project across 10 school buildings is projected to save the district $450,000 annually in utility costs. The project also will eliminate approximately 9 million pounds of carbon emissions, supporting both fiscal responsibility and environmental stewardship.

,Clean Energy ,2025-09-18 14:38:13+00:00,pv magazine USA,"German engineering with U.S. production,: SMA America returns through partnership with ...",Rachel Metea,,,,,https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2025/09/18/german-engineering-with-u-s-production-sma-america-returns-through-partnership-with-create-energy/,"SMA America is bringing back its inverter production to the U.S. through a partnership with Create Energy in Tennessee.
However, in 2023 SMA announced it planned to return to the U.S. this year.
With SMA partnering with Create Energy, the two companies together will manufacture the Sunny Highpower PEAK3 and the new fully-integrated PowerSkid.
SMA and Create signed a memorandum of understanding to advance localized clean energy solutions for the U.S. market.
“SMA and I have a long history,” said Dean Solon, founder and CEO of Create Energy.","SMA America is bringing back its inverter production to the U.S. through a partnership with Create Energy in Tennessee.

SMA used to produce its inverters in Denver up until about 10 years ago, but in 2016 the German company announced it was moving its U.S facility overseas due to pricing pressures. At the time SMA said the move would avoid additional capital expenditure in production and test equipment, citing the flexibility its production plants.

However, in 2023 SMA announced it planned to return to the U.S. this year. SMA said it was in discussions with several U.S. states and potential partners, as it was still looking to find “the most strategically advantageous production location and the right approach.”

Production will take place in Portland, Tenn. at Create Energy’s facility. SMA said manufacturing in Tennessee brings shorter lead times, localized support and a more resilient supply chain for U.S. developers and EPCs.

With SMA partnering with Create Energy, the two companies together will manufacture the Sunny Highpower PEAK3 and the new fully-integrated PowerSkid.

While SMA typically manufactures its inverters, Marc Nerius, SMA’s vice president of marketing and communications told pv magazine USA that in this partnership, SMA will serve as the designer while Create will serve as the manufacturer.

To note, the inverters produced at the Tennessee facility will be U.S.-based, however, the inverters will likely contain components manufactured in Germany, Jose Colom, an SMA applications engineer manager, told pv magazine USA.

As for what percent of the inverter’s components are made at the U.S. facility, Colom said “it depends.”

“Now they’re also coming up with a skid solution that we’re going to be selling,” he said, which will likely increase the product’s U.S.-made parts.

SMA initially said it planned to start its production at 3.5 GW per year back when it announced its plans to return to U.S. production this year. But with its new partnership in place, Nerius said the production size is now to be determined.

The companies said they are targeting to begin manufacturing in Q1 2026.

SMA and Create signed a memorandum of understanding to advance localized clean energy solutions for the U.S. market. The agreement outlines plans for joint sales and business development activities, which the companies said is the start of a strategic partnership.

“SMA and I have a long history,” said Dean Solon, founder and CEO of Create Energy. “They are not only industry leaders but also a strong team to work with. This collaboration will advance renewable energy and deliver American-built inverters and skids.”

Solon also formed a partnership with RECOM Technologies CEO Hamlet Tunyan, first announced last year, to develop a solar manufacturing facility in Tennessee, with planned production of up to 5 GW of modules and 5 GW of cells for the North American and European markets. Their venture is called “ReCreate,” a hybrid between their companies’ names. Solon is also the founder and former CEO of Shoals Technologies.

Nerius said SMA currently has two partners in the U.S. for domestic integration with its legacy medium food power station.

“One of the partners will manufacture our transformers for us, and one will do the integration of the skid here in the US, so more domestic content from SMS,” Nerius said.

When asked about whether SMA plans to begin developing inverters for the 2000 V transition on the horizon, Colom said SMA likes to take a conservative approach.

“We want to see how the market is moving before we come up with a real product that that can meet those standards,” he said. However, SMA is certainly looking in that direction, he said, which to his estimates may arrive by the end of the decade.

China’s JinkoSolar was the first solar module supplier to receive a UL certification for a 2000 V product. GE Vernova debuted its 2000 Vdc inverter last September, before moving its overseas operations back to the United States where it now manufactures the inverters at its new Pittsburgh facility.

However, it will take time for fully formed certification processes to emerge and even longer for manufacturers to align their products with these standards. Convincing developers to invest in 2000 V projects poses another challenge, as these new sites will be inherently riskier than standard 1500 V projects, with higher costs and a smaller selection of suppliers.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/SMA_US-Produktion_print-scaled-e1702387974866.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 12:07:18.120332

Photo by: Slate Slate's concept is one of my favorite things to happen to the auto industry in years.","Hyundai isn't letting its recent immigration-related issues slow it down. Despite the unpleasant developments in Georgia, the automaker isn't letting up and has promised to kick-start the second phase of its Metaplant expansion into gear by injecting $2.7 billion that will create another 3,000 local jobs to support made-in-America electric vehicles and hybrids.

Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things electric and tech in the automotive space. Also on deck: Europe says an influx of Chinese EVs would be more costly to jobs than the move away from internal combustion, and Slate Auto says there's at least one upside to the EV tax credit going away. Let's jump in.

30%: Hyundai's Metaplant Grows Again With $2.7 Billion Cash Infusion

Photo by: Patrick George

Hyundai's Georgia Metaplant is getting a huge infusion of cash from Korea as it enters Phase 2 of its expansion. The $2.7 billion investment will add an estimated production capacity of 200,000 units, bringing the total annual output coming out of Georgia to a whopping half-million vehicles by 2028, between 10 hybrid and full battery-electric models.

The automaker will announce this at its annual CEO Investor Day event in New York today.

To support that production, Hyundai says the investment will create around 3,000 jobs. That number is worth pausing on—3,000 jobs. It's no small promise. Between Hyundai, Rivian, SK, and the numerous other e-mobility companies operating out of the region, the EV industry makes up a whopping 26,000 jobs in the region.

Hyundai's labor pledge is an increase of 11.5% jobs. Its cash infusion is also significant, representing an additional 10% of the $27.3 billion pledged in Georgia's local economy since 2018 from EV manufacturers and their downstream suppliers. This will help Hyundai reach its goal of manufacturing 80% of the cars it sells in the State domestically, and its investments in local supply chains will increase locally-sourced parts from 60% to 80%. Pretty darn impressive.

The Metaplant itself is supposed to be Hyundai's next-gen manufacturing hub in the U.S. In fact, the company brags that the Metaplant is its new ""software-defined factory,"" which is basically a buzzword to say that the factory will feature fancy automation systems and robotics tech derived from its investments in Boston Dynamics.

All part of its plan to crank out an additional 1.2 million cars by the top of the decade, bringing its total electrified output to 3.3 million units per year. And the Metaplant? It will build 15% of those cars.

Numbers aside, the subtext here is what's important. Georgia has somehow managed to become the unofficial EV capital of the Southeast and Hyundai's cash promise should be seen as a vote of confidence in the community. It's also a corporate promise to build where it sells (right on U.S. soil). The bet that building cars in America is the best way to sell them—and sell them fast—is the one that makes Hyundai feel is the safest way to keep its EV future on track.

In the meantime, relations between the U.S. and South Korea will need some patching up after the massive immigration raid, but continued investment between the countries may just help.

60%: The Shift From EV To ICE Might Cost Jobs, But China's EV Push Could Cost More

Photo by: BYD

There's a phrase that Valeo CEO Christophe Perillat said during his presentation at the IAA Mobility Show last week that will breathe cold air down your back in a blizzard: “When an industry is gone, it’s gone, it doesn’t come back.""

He's talking about Europe's auto industry. Specifically, the double-gut-punch threats it faces—not just from a significant shift away from combustion engines towards EVs (and the potential factory automation that comes with it), but also the looming threat of inbound Chinese EVs that could undercut everything that the European automaker has to offer.

Perillat echoed warnings that trade groups like the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA) have issued, calling for what some call “smart protectionism” rules across Europe to prevent a rapid overrun of the auto industry. Without it, the industry has raised flags that the repercussions could be far worse in both numbers and reach than the jobs lost by moving from ICE powertrains to EVs.

Automotive News explains:

European content requirements are a “flagship action” in the European Commission’s action plan for the automotive industry that was released in March, but Perillat and lobby groups say there is no time to waste.

On the one hand, Perillat says, the shift from ICE to BEV will cost jobs because it takes fewer hours to build EVs and electric-car components. The lobbying group CLEPA and others have said hundreds of thousands of positions are likely to disappear in the next 15 years.

CLEPA said in a study released Sept. 10 that “without urgent EU action,” Europe could lose up to 350,000 jobs, through “the combined effect of powertrain transition and value transfer outside the EU.”

Chinese automakers such as BYD, Chery and Leapmotor are building assembly plants in Europe, or have announced plans to produce on the continent. If the cars coming from those plants are built from pressambled kits (semi-knockdown or complete knockdown) then more jobs could be affected, Perillat said.

“One erosion is a lot,” he said of the shift to EVs, “but when you consider that the content of cars that is produced locally might decrease and go to China, then this double erosion starts to be unacceptable.”

Those pre-assembled kits are a big concern, especially as automakers like Chery set up shop in Spain just to handle the final assembly of the kits. And even though local jobs will be retained to handle final assembly, the downstream supplier jobs that would otherwise be created to build the batteries, powertrains and other components may no longer be local to Europe.

That's why those advocating for protectionist rules to safeguard Europe's auto industry are calling for as local European content sourcing requirement as high as 80%. For comparison, the ICE industry has a local sourcing figure of around 90% local content versus 35% to 45% for BEVs.

This feels significantly reminiscent of the local sourcing requirements for the EV tax credit under the Biden administration, no? If an automaker wanted to qualify for the tax credit, it had to meet certain parts sourcing requirements—otherwise, it was effectively priced above the competition. And in Europe's case, it's meet it or beat it. ""When it’s gone, the expertise is gone as well,"" Perillat said. ""The ecosystem is gone.”

90%: Slate Outlines One Battery-Related Upside To The EV Tax Credit Phase-Out

The end of the EV tax credit is a pretty dismal thing to think about. Maybe we're a bit desensitized to it now, but it's still going to sting the next time a new car buyer signs on the dotted line for their shiny electric crossover, knowing that it almost cost them $7,500 less. But there is one upside, according to that new up-and-coming EV startup, Slate: battery availability.

As automakers taper production to meet an anticipated lull in EV demand, the effects are beginning to ripple down the supply chain. Battery makers, for example, are reporting that they have some production capacity breathing room for the first time in years. While that might not be great news for the accountants, it's awesome news for startups like Slate or just about any company that has been overpaying on batteries due to inflated demand.

Here's what Slate CEO Chris Barman said at a recent Fortune conference:

“It’s opened up some opportunity for us,” Chris Barman, CEO of the emerging EV company, said on stage on Tuesday at Fortune’s Brainstorm Tech conference in Park City, Utah. Slate Auto had been “very focused” on making sure it could offer that rebate, she said, which required the company to meet certain mineral and manufacturing location requirements.

“What we’ve done is we’ve stepped back and surveyed multiple battery suppliers, and what we’re seeing is there are others in the industry that are pulling back as well on their EV launch plans—so it’s opening up capacity,” Barman said. “So we’re going out and seeing…taking survey on what’s there, and see what we can do to look at pricing.”

Barman's words echo that of others in the EV industry following EV battery prices. Historically, battery prices have followed that of raw materials, and as demand for EV batteries increased, so did the price. However, economies of scale also helped to bring down the overall cost per kilowatt-hour to record lows. It's easy to see why so many automakers and partners invested in domestic battery manufacturing capacity over the last few years.

If demand falls for EV battery cells, prices are expected to follow. Eventually, the two will fall into a natural cadence that reflects the true market price. That's good news for manufacturers looking to cut costs with a sudden perceived price hike, and even better news for small EV startups.

But for Slate in particular, the chance to actually buy cells without being forced into a corner is something that the brand is undoubtedly excited about.

It gives Slate the opportunity to evaluate multiple manufacturers and price points to help offset costs for its uber-cheap electric pickup. And, hey, maybe it'll even help to drive down the price a bit, too (we can dream).

100%: Would You Really Buy A Stripped Down EV? Where's Your Limit?

Slate's concept is one of my favorite things to happen to the auto industry in years. Every time I think about those plastic panels, I think of Saturn and the mission that General Motors originally penned for the brand: autonomy (not the self-driving kind) to reinvent the small, affordable car market.

But here's the thing—Slate takes it further. All of those modern amenities that Slate strips out to save on the last few dollars eventually start to add up. Sure, we say we want roll-up windows and no stereo, but do we really? What if you could option the truck without air conditioning? Or how about falling back to sealed beam headlights? Or (and hear me out), a battery that only mustered 100 miles of range around town?

How much would you sacrifice in a cheap car, and what would you pay even with all of those missing features? Let me know in the comments.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/40xP6K/s1/cm-hyundai-metaplant.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 12:11:04.728145

BALTIMORE, Sept. 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- CPower Energy (""CPower""), a leading Virtual Power Plant (VPP) platform, today announced that it has been named a VPP market leader by Wood Mackenzie for the third year running. As with past reports, the Wood Mackenzie 2025 North America virtual power plant report ranked CPower for its dispatchable load under management and number of market and utility demand response programs, among other criteria.

The report is published as grid operators and utilities nationwide struggle with unprecedented demand growth from artificial intelligence computing, data centers and the electrification of transportation, housing and other sectors of the economy.

According to Wood Mackenzie, company deployments, unique offtakers and utility and market programs monetized grew over 33% in North America year-over-year. A frigid winter and relentless summer heat waves have driven up demand peaks this year, underscoring the value of VPPs in enhancing grid reliability and flexibility.

Year-to-date, CPower has dispatched customers across more than 900 events, 40% more this year than last. The resulting relief provided by big-box retailers, data centers, manufacturers, hospitals, schools and other large load customers has helped keep the lights on and the economy going in communities nationwide.

""We are honored that Wood Mackenzie has again validated CPower's leadership in Virtual Power Plants. Fast, reliable demand response has never been more critical because it empowers energy users to be part of the solution,"" said Michael D. Smith, CEO, CPower. ""Without tapping into existing customer-sited assets, the U.S. risks missing out on billions of dollars in market growth from AI alone over the next five years due to a lack of energy.""

Wood Mackenzie's VPP report found that while data centers drive demand growth, CPower counterbalances their impact. With nearly 23,000 sites nationwide, CPower leverages the flexible energy of customers across all major industries, including data centers, hyper scalers and bitcoin miners, making them grid assets.

""CPower's leadership in the VPP space is rooted in its approach to customer performance across every different industry,"" said Ben Hertz-Shargel, Global Head of Grid Edge, Wood Mackenzie. ""There's finally widespread recognition that VPPs can put money back in the pockets of businesses, rather than just raising rates on them through infrastructure development.""

That means people who want to take advantage of them before they disappear have to act quickly.

“There is still time, but the clock is ticking,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we’ve got some tips on how to maximize savings.

Refresh My Memory. What Incentives?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren’t capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

When Are They Expiring?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it’s also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

The car doesn’t need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

If I’m Focused on My Home, What Should I Prioritize?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

“That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,” she said. “Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.”

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

“We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn’t mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,” Pierce said.

“Experts estimate that takes 16 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that’s quick,” said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. “You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it’s even possible.”

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

But What if the Tax Credits Exceed What I Owe?

OK, let’s say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren’t allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects — think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage — could be carried forward if you didn’t get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

Rewiring America said it’s not clear if that will continue given the accelerated expiration dates, and recommended consumers check with their tax adviser.

Between March 2023 and February 2025, the losses at the coal units totaled more than $150 million.","West Virginia customers of Appalachian Power and Wheeling Power (American Electric Power’s subsidiaries in the state) will pay tens of millions of dollars more in electric rates because of economic losses at the companies’ coal-fired power plants.

The coal plants in question are John Amos, Mitchell and Mountaineer. The three-unit Amos plant has 2,900 megawatts (MW) of net summer capacity; the two-unit Mitchell plant has 1,560MW of capacity; and the single-unit Mountaineer plant has 1,299MW of capacity. The age range of the six units ranges from 45 to 54 years.

Why did these utilities run their coal plants at a loss? To burn coal. This is the second consecutive year that AEP has found itself in the situation of having contracted for significantly more coal than needed to operate the plants economically. To avoid exceeding the physical limits for its coal stockpiles at the plants, the utility ran them even at times when it did not make economic sense.

Between March 2024 and February 2025, the three coal plants incurred $66 million in losses from the difference between the revenue earned from selling electricity into the regional market and the cost of operating the units. As IEEFA testified to the West Virginia Public Service Commission, West Virginia electricity customers will pick up the tab for $36 million (the utility also has customers in other states).

In part, this reflects the ongoing poor economics of coal plants. Natural gas plants continue to out-compete coal on an economic basis. During the year from March 2024 to February 2025, the coal plants’ costs averaged more than market prices for all months except January and February, when cold winter temperatures (including a polar vortex) drove up energy market prices.

The losses also reflect poor foresight on the part of AEP, given that the declining economics of coal generation is a longstanding trend. Utilization of coal units in PJM (the regional electricity market covering D.C. and parts of 13 states, including all of West Virginia) has been on a downward trajectory since 2014, as shown in the following graph. Yet this is the second year in a row that Appalachian Power and Wheeling Power have found themselves in the position of having bought too much coal. Between March 2023 and February 2025, the losses at the coal units totaled more than $150 million.",https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/coal-mine-shutterstock_638354632.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 11:01:42.014368

Several major U.S. tech companies will be involved in the deal, including Microsoft, which pledged about $42 billion in U.K. investment. Other American technology companies include NVIDIA, Google, OpenAI and CoreWeave.

Under the partnership, the U.K. and U.S. will pool together joint resources and expertise into emerging technologies that can benefit from both nations. The investment from U.S. companies will help boost British AI infrastructure, from building data centers to computer chips.

The “Tech Prosperity Deal” was struck on the second day of Mr. Trump’s state visit to the U.K., which kicked off Wednesday with a day of ceremony hosted by King Charles and the royal family at Windsor Castle.

The new tech alliance announced Thursday will focus on developing new drugs, improving cancer care and producing life-saving treatments. It will also include investments in nuclear technology, clean energy, artificial intelligence and quantum computing.

Mr. Trump called the deal “the next logical step” for the two countries, while Mr. Starmer hailed it as “a win for both sides.”

“The deals and announcements you’re announcing today break all records,” Mr. Starmer told the crowd at a reception that included several top business executives.

For Mr. Starmer, the deal is also a potential lifeline for his political future, which has been thrown into doubt by a British economy plagued by massive debt, high cost of living and low productivity.

Economic growth in the country flatlined in July, according to the most recent data published last week by the U.K. Office for National Statistics. In July, production output contracted by 0.9%, following a 0.4% drop in June.

Mr. Starmer is betting the deal will revive Britain’s reputation as a destination for overseas investment and tech innovation. The U.S. is Britain’s largest trading partner and several American tech companies have already invested billions of dollars in the U.K.

As part of the deal, a northeast portion of the U.K. will be designated an AI “growth zone” and receive special support in planning and energy provision for hosting AI infrastructure such as data centers.

OK, let’s say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed.","Tax incentives that saved U.S. residents thousands of dollars on home efficiency upgrades, clean energy installations and electric vehicles are expiring this year. That means people who want to take advantage of them before they disappear have to act quickly.

“There is still time, but the clock is ticking,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we’ve got some tips on how to maximize savings.

Refresh my memory. What are these incentives?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren’t capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

When are they expiring?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it’s also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

The car doesn’t need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

If I’m focused on my home, what should I prioritize?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

“That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,” she said. “Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.”

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

“We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn’t mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,” Pierce said.

“Experts estimate that takes 16 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that’s quick,” said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. “You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it’s even possible.”

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?

OK, let’s say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren’t allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects — think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage — could be carried forward if you didn’t get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

Rewiring America said it’s not clear if that will continue given the accelerated expiration dates, and recommended consumers check with their tax adviser.

0 investor@americanresourcescorp.com SOURCE: American Resources Corporation View the original press release on ACCESS Newswire","American Resources Corporation's (NASDAQ: AREC) portfolio company, ReElement Technologies (""ReElement""), a leading U.S. innovator in rare earth element (REE) and critical mineral refining, has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with POSCO International Corporation (""POSCO International"" or ""POSCO""), a global leader in steel, magnetic materials, and advanced industrial solutions. The agreement aims to strengthen the rare-earth supply chain and explore cooperation on establishing an integrated rare-earth and permanent-magnet production complex in the United States.

The signing ceremony, held at the POSCO Center in Seoul, was attended by Kye-In Lee, President & CEO of POSCO International; Mark Jensen, CEO of ReElement Technologies; Na Sung-hwa, Director General for Industrial Supply Chain Policy; and Joseph Yun, U.S. Deputy Ambassador to Korea.

The planned Integrated Rare Earth and Permanent Magnet Production Complex would be the first U.S. facility to achieve full vertical integration of rare-earth and permanent-magnet production within an integrated industrial complex. It is designed to manage every stage-from securing rare-earth raw materials and conducting separation and refining, to manufacturing permanent magnets and recycling manufacturing scrap and end-of-life magnets-all within one facility.

Under the partnership, POSCO International will oversee sourcing of rare-earth intermediate materials and the permanent-magnet business, while ReElement will provide advanced separation, refining, and recycling technology. The governments of Korea and the United States also discussed potential policy, financial, and regulatory support should the project move into full-scale implementation.

Currently, the global rare-earth supply chain relies heavily on a limited number of countries. Because rare-earth elements are indispensable for industries such as electric vehicles, semiconductors, and wind power, this concentration poses geopolitical risks and supply-chain uncertainties that threaten global industrial stability.

This collaboration seeks to diversify and de-risk supply chains, mitigating such risks and creating a foundation for flexible responses to changes in demand. By securing a more stable supply of rare-earth raw materials and strengthening permanent-magnet production capabilities, the initiative will enable long-term, stable, and flexible delivery of critical materials to automakers worldwide.

POSCO International is already expanding its presence in the global permanent-magnet market. In 2023, the company signed a contract with a major North American automaker to supply approximately 7,700 tons of permanent magnets-enough for about 3.85 million electric-vehicle motors-between 2026 and 2031. It also concluded an agreement with a premium European automaker to supply roughly 800 tons-sufficient for about 400,000 electric-vehicle motors-from 2025 through 2034.

ReElement is rapidly advancing its economically viable and eco-friendly critical mineral refining platform in Indiana at its Noblesville Commercial Qualification Facility and its Marion Supersite. Leveraging advanced chromatographic separation and purification methods, ReElement is addressing the most complex segment of the supply chain while building strategic alliances to strengthen global critical mineral supply chains.

Building on this cooperation, POSCO International plans to broaden its value chain to solidify its position as a key supplier of electric-vehicle drivetrain components. Future plans include offering complete packages of all parts required for drive-motor-core rotors and stators to automakers domestically and internationally.

""The agreement will help strengthen resource security and diversify supply chains in both Korea and the United States,"" said Kye-In Lee, President & CEO of POSCO International. ""It provides an opportunity to reduce the risks of supply-chain concentration and to establish a stable system for supplying critical materials to domestic and global automakers.""

""Our collaboration with POSCO marks an important step forward,"" added Mark Jensen, CEO of ReElement Technologies. ""By combining our patented refining technology with POSCO's industrial capabilities, we are scaling rare earth processing and strengthening the U.S.-Korea partnership to build resilient and sustainable supply chains for critical materials. Together, we are proving that innovation and collaboration can deliver secure, long-term solutions for industries and nations that depend on these materials.""

According to InvestingPro data, the company has shown remarkable momentum with a 144% price return over the past six months, though it operates with significant debt challenges. With a commanding 17% market share in residential rooftop panel installations and 42% in storage installations, Sunrun has established itself as a formidable force in the renewable energy sector. However, the company faces significant challenges as it seeks to maintain its growth trajectory in an increasingly competitive and policy-driven environment.

Financial Performance and Strategic Initiatives

Sunrun’s recent financial performance has been a mixed bag of impressive growth and ongoing challenges. In the second quarter of 2025, the company reported strong results, surpassing revenue expectations with $569.3 million, marking an 8.7% year-over-year increase. InvestingPro analysis reveals that while the company maintains a healthy current ratio of 1.41, it faces significant challenges with its debt burden, as evidenced by a debt-to-equity ratio of 4.84. The company’s total revenue for the last twelve months stands at $2.13 billion, with a gross profit margin of 19.71%. This growth was primarily driven by consumer agreements, which saw an 18% year-over-year increase to $458 million, offsetting an 18% decline in solar systems sales.

The company’s strategic focus on subscription services over equipment sales has proven to be a sound approach, with over half of its revenue now coming from capacity leasing. This shift has helped Sunrun maintain a steady revenue stream and mitigate some of the volatility associated with equipment sales.

In response to the evolving regulatory landscape, Sunrun has implemented a proactive safe harboring strategy for equipment. This approach aims to extend the benefits of solar tax credits beyond their potential expiration, positioning the company to maintain competitive pricing and margins in the face of policy changes. Analysts view this strategy as a significant potential upside driver for Sunrun post-2025, particularly as cash-strapped competitors may struggle to implement similar measures.

Sunrun has also been expanding its product offerings to capture additional value from its customer base. The introduction of the ""Flex"" product aims to increase customer consumption post-solar installation, potentially enhancing margins over time. Additionally, the company’s focus on storage-first solutions and grid services expansion presents opportunities for diversification and growth in high-value segments of the renewable energy market.

Regulatory Environment and Market Dynamics

The regulatory environment remains a critical factor in Sunrun’s outlook. The company’s performance is heavily influenced by policies such as the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). While these policies have historically provided significant support for the solar industry, ongoing uncertainty regarding their future has created challenges for Sunrun and its peers.

The potential expiration of the ITC for residential solar installations poses a significant risk to Sunrun’s business model. The company has been leveraging these tax credits to reduce costs for homeowners, and their removal could lead to a substantial decrease in annual installations. However, Sunrun’s management has been proactively scenario planning for various policy outcomes, including exploring alternative financing structures such as pooled residential Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to continue capturing ITC benefits.

Market dynamics are also shifting in ways that could benefit Sunrun. As the residential solar market potentially contracts by around 25% in 2026 due to policy changes, Sunrun’s scale and market leadership position it well to gain market share. The company’s strong balance sheet and greater negotiating power with suppliers could provide a competitive advantage in a consolidating industry.

Bear Case

How might the expiration of tax credits impact Sunrun’s business model?

The expiration of tax credits, particularly the ITC, could significantly disrupt Sunrun’s current business model. The company has relied heavily on these credits to make solar installations more affordable for homeowners. Without them, Sunrun may face challenges in maintaining its current growth rate and profitability.

The potential loss of tax credits could lead to higher costs for consumers, potentially reducing demand for residential solar installations. This could result in lower installation volumes and decreased revenue for Sunrun. Additionally, the company may need to adjust its pricing strategy or find alternative ways to finance installations, which could pressure margins and cash flow.

What risks does Sunrun face from potential regulatory changes?

Beyond tax credits, Sunrun is exposed to a range of regulatory risks that could impact its operations. Changes to net metering policies, interconnection rules, or building codes could affect the economics of residential solar installations. For instance, some states have considered or implemented changes to net metering policies that reduce the value of excess electricity sold back to the grid, potentially making solar less attractive to homeowners.

Moreover, uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act and potential changes to safe harbor provisions could impact Sunrun’s ability to plan and execute its long-term strategy effectively. The company’s reliance on regulatory frameworks for its business model makes it vulnerable to shifts in the political landscape and energy policy priorities.

Bull Case

How could Sunrun’s market leadership position benefit it in a consolidating industry?

Sunrun’s position as the market leader in residential solar installations provides several advantages in a consolidating industry. With its scale and established brand, Sunrun is well-positioned to capture market share as smaller competitors struggle or exit the market. The company’s strong balance sheet and access to capital allow it to weather market fluctuations more effectively than its peers.

In a consolidating market, Sunrun’s size also gives it greater negotiating power with suppliers, potentially leading to cost advantages. This could allow the company to offer more competitive pricing to consumers while maintaining profitability. Additionally, Sunrun’s extensive customer base provides opportunities for upselling and cross-selling new products and services, such as energy storage solutions and grid services.

What potential does the expansion into grid services offer for Sunrun’s growth?

Sunrun’s expansion into grid services represents a significant growth opportunity. As the penetration of distributed energy resources increases, utilities and grid operators are increasingly looking for ways to manage grid stability and optimize energy distribution. Sunrun’s large installed base of solar and storage systems positions it well to provide valuable grid services.

By aggregating its customers’ systems into virtual power plants, Sunrun can offer services such as demand response, frequency regulation, and voltage support to utilities. This not only creates new revenue streams for the company but also enhances the value proposition for customers by potentially reducing their energy costs further. Analysts project that grid services revenue could reach $245 million by 2035, representing a substantial growth avenue for Sunrun.

On Monday, Tucker United—a group of Tucker County citizens who are against the project—and the environmental groups West Virginia Highlands Conservancy and Sierra Club, appealed the air quality permit the WVDEP granted for the project, putting a roadblock in the way of construction.

The data center is a project by Fundamental Data and would include building and operating a 500-acre gas-fired power plant just a few miles from the town of Davis. Many local residents have been vocal about opposing the project which they believe will negatively impact the area’s environment and tourism industry.

According to a press release from the Sierra Club, many citizens are still in the dark about the possible environmental implications of the proposed plant because many details in the permit application were redacted.

“We’re taking the next step in this fight because we believe the WV-DEP wrongfully hid critical information about this facility and incorrectly classified the gas- and diesel-fired power plant as a synthetic minor source of emissions instead of a major source,” Nikki Forrester of Tucker United said in the release.

Environmental groups are concerned that the application downplayed the role the power plant’s construction and operation might have and that the permit will allow Fundamental Data to pollute one of the most unique and remote areas of the state, including areas like Canaan Valley.

09/18/2025 - 09:00 AM

American Resources Corporation's (NASDAQ:AREC) portfolio company, ReElement Technologies (""ReElement""), a leading U.S. innovator in rare earth element (REE) and critical mineral refining, has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with POSCO International Corporation (""POSCO International"" or ""POSCO""), a global leader in steel, magnetic materials, and advanced industrial solutions. The agreement aims to strengthen the rare-earth supply chain and explore cooperation on establishing an integrated rare-earth and permanent-magnet production complex in the United States.

The signing ceremony, held at the POSCO Center in Seoul, was attended by Kye-In Lee, President & CEO of POSCO International; Mark Jensen, CEO of ReElement Technologies; Na Sung-hwa, Director General for Industrial Supply Chain Policy; and Joseph Yun, U.S. Deputy Ambassador to Korea.

The planned Integrated Rare Earth and Permanent Magnet Production Complex would be the first U.S. facility to achieve full vertical integration of rare-earth and permanent-magnet production within an integrated industrial complex. It is designed to manage every stage-from securing rare-earth raw materials and conducting separation and refining, to manufacturing permanent magnets and recycling manufacturing scrap and end-of-life magnets-all within one facility.

Under the partnership, POSCO International will oversee sourcing of rare-earth intermediate materials and the permanent-magnet business, while ReElement will provide advanced separation, refining, and recycling technology. The governments of Korea and the United States also discussed potential policy, financial, and regulatory support should the project move into full-scale implementation.

Currently, the global rare-earth supply chain relies heavily on a limited number of countries. Because rare-earth elements are indispensable for industries such as electric vehicles, semiconductors, and wind power, this concentration poses geopolitical risks and supply-chain uncertainties that threaten global industrial stability.

This collaboration seeks to diversify and de-risk supply chains, mitigating such risks and creating a foundation for flexible responses to changes in demand. By securing a more stable supply of rare-earth raw materials and strengthening permanent-magnet production capabilities, the initiative will enable long-term, stable, and flexible delivery of critical materials to automakers worldwide.

POSCO International is already expanding its presence in the global permanent-magnet market. In 2023, the company signed a contract with a major North American automaker to supply approximately 7,700 tons of permanent magnets-enough for about 3.85 million electric-vehicle motors-between 2026 and 2031. It also concluded an agreement with a premium European automaker to supply roughly 800 tons-sufficient for about 400,000 electric-vehicle motors-from 2025 through 2034.

ReElement is rapidly advancing its economically viable and eco-friendly critical mineral refining platform in Indiana at its Noblesville Commercial Qualification Facility and its Marion Supersite. Leveraging advanced chromatographic separation and purification methods, ReElement is addressing the most complex segment of the supply chain while building strategic alliances to strengthen global critical mineral supply chains.

Building on this cooperation, POSCO International plans to broaden its value chain to solidify its position as a key supplier of electric-vehicle drivetrain components. Future plans include offering complete packages of all parts required for drive-motor-core rotors and stators to automakers domestically and internationally.

""The agreement will help strengthen resource security and diversify supply chains in both Korea and the United States,"" said Kye-In Lee, President & CEO of POSCO International. ""It provides an opportunity to reduce the risks of supply-chain concentration and to establish a stable system for supplying critical materials to domestic and global automakers.""

""Our collaboration with POSCO marks an important step forward,"" added Mark Jensen, CEO of ReElement Technologies. ""By combining our patented refining technology with POSCO's industrial capabilities, we are scaling rare earth processing and strengthening the U.S.-Korea partnership to build resilient and sustainable supply chains for critical materials. Together, we are proving that innovation and collaboration can deliver secure, long-term solutions for industries and nations that depend on these materials.""

Maximizing existing power grid capacity is critical to maintaining reliability and supporting long-term modernization.

As the United States races to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and accelerate electrification, the nation faces a significant challenge: ensuring its aging power grid can keep pace with rapidly escalating energy demands. To respond to this challenge, incentives are needed to encourage infrastructure upgrades and support power capacity enhancement in the long run. Any viable roadmap takes time, and this means that for now, policymakers and industry leaders must focus on maximizing the use of existing power grid capacity.

Growing Strain on the Power Grid

The scale and speed of anticipated AI-driven electricity needs—alongside the impact of decarbonization and industrial growth—are putting extraordinary pressure on the power grid. Much of the US power grid infrastructure is over 25 years old, and key upgrades will require at least a decade to implement. Meanwhile, data centers and other critical sectors will drive electricity demand upward, risking shortfalls and reliability threats. The estimated electricity for AI needs alone may well exceed the net energy capacity in the US power grid by 2030. If US companies cannot access reliable and affordable power, the option of moving operations abroad becomes more appealing. With America’s AI leadership at stake, stakeholders in government and industry could expect the AI energy race to be one of the immediate battles to fight.

Strategies for Maximizing Existing Power Grid Capacity

The United States can still take actions, starting from better management and clever investments, to maximize utilization of existing power grid capacity. A RAND research team identified several actionable strategies to do so by 2030, buying valuable time for grid modernization:

Prioritize completion of high-probability projects, especially in storage and flexible generation, to realize near-term capacity gains. This strategy focuses on advancing projects with high-capacity accreditation factors (CAF), such as battery storage and gas. We estimate the potential increase in available capacity from prioritizing the interconnection of high-CAF projects to reach 64 gigawatts (GW) by 2030. At the same time, fast-tracking projects that have already reached advanced milestones in the interconnection process—like finalized construction services agreements—can unlock significant additional capacity quickly. Policies that prioritize shovel-ready projects can deliver up to 63 GW of available capacity if completion rates are maximized.

Delay planned retirements of existing gas and coal plants where it is safe and responsible. Where feasible, postponing the retirement of older thermal plants can immediately boost power grid reliability and resource adequacy. For example, authorizations such as California’s extension of certain natural gas and nuclear facilities granted short-term relief to grid stability. Delaying half of the scheduled retirements could result in an additional 22 GW of available capacity. Planners must also consider the environmental and health impacts associated with these older resources, but short-term actions are feasible.

Integrate battery storage with stand-alone renewables to transform intermittent resources into a reliable supply. Co-locating battery storage with existing or new solar and wind projects enables intermittent generation to be used more reliably and dispatched when needed most. Hybridizing all solar and wind resources with storage could unlock up to 30 GW of additional capacity between 2025 and 2030.

Make improvements to the interconnection process, both in the short term (e.g., temporary staffing, outsourcing, queue rationing) and medium term (e.g., surplus interconnection service, generation replacement, energy-only service), to reduce project backlogs and accelerate new capacity additions. Streamlining the interconnection process can significantly shorten project lead times. Measures such as prioritizing projects with higher readiness, utilizing surplus interconnection rights, and developing expedited pathways can address the current backlog and accelerate integration of capacity. Our analysis of interconnection queue data indicates that a 1-percentage-point improvement in all completion rates is equivalent to a 5-GW increase in available capacity. If completion rates increase by up to 5 percentage points, an additional 26 GW may become available, increasing net available capacity to approximately 58 GW. Longer-term reforms should focus on more flexible interconnection service models and enhanced coordination between power grid operators and developers.

Laying the Foundation for the Future of Energy and AI

Implementing these recommendations would have a measurable impact on available net capacity by 2030 and delay the necessity of sourcing power from outside the United States. These actions are just the beginning for sustainable solutions to support AI-driven energy demands, but taking the right first steps now can buy valuable time for infrastructure upgrades and build the foundation for longer-term competitive edges.

Digital controls and advanced analytics connect these assets to optimize cost, resilience and sustainability.

Microgrids are localized energy systems that can operate independently from the centralized grid, providing reliable power during outages or grid stress. Schneider Electric's network of EcoXpert™ partners will support the national rollout. In addition to resilience, microgrids offer cost certainty and faster time to power by overcoming grid constraints.

Examples of resilient energy systems already being deployed include:

Montgomery County, Maryland: AlphaStruxure microgrids at two bus depots – Brookville and the David F. Bone Equipment Maintenance and Transit Operations Center (EMTOC) – support the county's 100% carbon emissions reduction goal. Brookville powers up to 70 electric buses with a 6.5-megawatt microgrid; EMTOC, currently at 6.84 megawatts, will eventually support 200 zero-emission buses.

Piscataway, New Jersey: Through its ""Piscataway Goes Green"" initiative, the township is deploying a 2.9-megawatt solar and microgrid system across eight municipal buildings, including Town Hall and Public Safety buildings. The project includes 28 EV charging stations – the largest municipal deployment in New Jersey – and battery energy storage to provide up to five days of backup power. It's expected to reduce the township's carbon footprint by more than 50% by 2026 and deliver $19 million in savings over 20 years.

Middle Tennessee Electric: A microgrid in Murfreesboro integrates solar, battery storage and smart energy management to serve 750,000 residents across four counties – ensuring continuity and advancing clean energy goals.

Longview Independent School District, Texas: A 4.2-megawatt solar project across 10 school buildings is projected to save the district $450,000 annually in utility costs. The project also will eliminate approximately 9 million pounds of carbon emissions, supporting both fiscal responsibility and environmental stewardship.

Independent energy activity delivers critical tax revenue that funds services at every level of government.","Independent producers are the cornerstone of U.S. energy and economic security. New research by the American Exploration & Production Council (AXPC) and Rystad Energy underscores the importance of independent producers who accounted for 87 percent of the sector’s total economic contributions for 2024.

From millions of jobs nationwide to significant growth in state revenue, the research – which builds on prior economic studies by the Independent Petroleum Association of America and IHS Markit – affirms that oil and natural gas are essential for economic progress. As AXPC CEO Anne Bradbury states:

“The contributions of these producers go far beyond delivering reliable and secure energy that powers the economy, they also catalyze the creation of millions of jobs and provide substantial government revenues that strengthen communities across the country. The foundation of America’s energy security is built on the investment and innovation of independent producers.”

Energy Security Meets Economic Progress.

Independent producers across the United States are significant contributors to our energy mix. Between 2022 and 2024, onshore independents accounted for more than 85 percent of U.S. crude and condensate output and over 90 percent of natural gas production. In addition, independents operated 95 percent of all producing onshore wells and drilled 90 percent of new wells in the same time frame.

Their production output directly translates to economic contributions. In 2024 alone, U.S. independents:

Provided 3.1 million industry jobs nationwide

Paid $277 billion in labor income

Paid $129 billion in taxes in 2024.

Overall, independents generated $488 billion in GDP output with each dollar invested producing $1.26 in secondary contributions. That’s nearly 87 percent of the total upstream oil and gas U.S. GDP contribution ($563 billion) in 2024.

Independents also accounted for 87 percent of total taxes collected from the domestic upstream sector last year. This translates in over $129 billion in government revenue to support critical needs like infrastructure development and public services.

Source: “Economic Impact of US Independent Operators”, conducted by Rystad Energy for the American Exploration & Production Council in August 2025.

Local Operators Drive Statewide Success

Shale regions across the country have become economic engines, fueling growth not just nationally but in the communities where development takes place.

Throughout the energy supply chain, activity from independents generated 2.6 million jobs in 2024, led by Texas with 1.1 million jobs created. The state also captured nearly half of all labor income from independents, putting $107 billion into the pockets of workers and communities.

The impact doesn’t stop there. Independent energy activity delivers critical tax revenue that funds services at every level of government. About 51 percent goes to the federal government, while 49 percent stays with state and local governments. That near-even split shows just how essential independents are to supporting public budgets.",https://www.energyindepth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Picture1.png,N,,2025-09-18 12:09:33.790615

Renewable-energy trades now top the fastest-growing U.S. careers, driven by policy and climate urgency. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that wind turbine service technicians and solar photovoltaic installers will be among the fastest-growing careers in the country from now through 2034.

Top 5 Fastest Growing Green Jobs

These roles highlight how clean energy and hands-on technical skills are becoming central to the workforce of the future. Below are some of the fastest growing green jobs through 2034, and what moves them, from private and federal investment to infrastructure demand.

1. Wind Turbine Service Technicians

Wind turbine technicians maintain and repair turbines that generate renewable energy. Their work requires mechanical aptitude, comfort with heights, and technical training. Despite criticisms, wind farms are quickly expanding in different U.S. states and other countries. The BLS projects job growth of about 50 to 60 percent over the next decade, far outpacing most occupations. Median annual pay is about $62,580.

Although the total number of jobs remains relatively small compared to larger sectors like healthcare, the rate of growth is striking. States such as Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Indiana already have some of the highest per-capita concentrations of wind energy jobs, reflecting the geographic reach of the industry.

2. Solar Photovoltaic Installers

Solar installers assemble and maintain systems that convert sunlight into energy. The BLS projects growth of about 42 percent by 2034. Median annual pay is about $51,860. As solar panels become more affordable and communities expand renewable infrastructure, demand for skilled installers will continue to climb. Like wind energy, the number of jobs is modest compared to major industries, but the trajectory signals a fundamental shift in how electricity will be produced in the coming decades.

3. Climate and Environmental Data Scientists

While not topping the growth charts as visibly as wind and solar, data scientists working on climate and environmental issues are in increasing demand. They help governments, companies, and nonprofits analyze climate risks, emissions, and adaptation strategies. Pay is competitive, often exceeding $100,000, and growth aligns with broader trends in data analytics.

4. Carbon Capture and Storage Specialists

Carbon capture technology is an emerging field with significant potential. As governments and companies invest in reducing emissions, jobs in design, installation, and monitoring of carbon storage systems are expected to grow. Salaries vary widely, but skilled engineers and technicians in this space often earn six figures.

5. Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems Experts

Jobs in sustainable farming, regenerative practices, and food innovation are also expected to rise. These roles are crucial for reducing emissions tied to land use and ensuring food security in a changing climate. Salaries vary by role and location, but the demand for green-skilled workers is expanding in both rural and urban settings.

Vila-Biaggi, Financial Analysis (IEEFA), co-founder, president of CAMBIO, implements sustainable policies",,,,,https://ssir.org/articles/entry/texas-puerto-rico-renewable-energy-boom,"At first glance, Texas and Puerto Rico appear almost nothing alike.
It’s these clear benefits that have helped renewables make big gains in both Texas and Puerto Rico despite political headwinds.
Puerto Rico’s Solar Boom Puerto Rico has one of the least reliable central energy systems.
As a result of the hurricanes that have affected Puerto Rico since 2017, the federal government allocated over $16 billion to rebuild the energy sector.
These moves, along with proposals for a 400 MW gas plant and multiple gas conversion projects, stand as the greatest threats to renewable energy in Puerto Rico right now.","At first glance, Texas and Puerto Rico appear almost nothing alike. They are thousands of miles from one another, and have vastly different economies, cultures, languages, and political landscapes. But they do have at least one thing in common: Both are hotspots for the renewable energy revolution that is well underway, despite recent regulatory rollbacks and growing anti-renewable rhetoric in Washington. What’s happening in Texas and Puerto Rico shows the potential for renewables to meet the United States and its territories’ electricity demand and to improve the lives of residents and businesses in the process.

The United States’ grid is struggling to keep up with energy demand. Decrepit fossil fuel-dependent infrastructure is failing at a time when severe weather events are becoming more frequent and, in many places, energy demand is rising. All of this means higher energy bills for consumers and increased chances of power outages. Adding more fossil fuel-powered plants is neither an affordable nor a speedy fix. Parts for gas-fired power plants are in short supply with wait times for turbines topping five years. This equipment crunch has sent construction costs for new gas plants skyrocketing. Proponents of nuclear energy are pushing for new small modular reactors, but those are extremely expensive to build, present important safety risks, and aren’t expected to come online until the 2030s at the earliest. It doesn’t make sense to consider these as an alternative.

Meanwhile, wind, solar, and dispatchable battery storage are growing fast enough to meet the challenge. Their infrastructure is quick to deploy, cost-effective, and better for the climate, addressing both national and global environmental concerns. Crucially, renewables can improve the overall quality of life for all Americans because they’re more reliable and affordable compared to their oil- and gas-powered alternatives. It’s these clear benefits that have helped renewables make big gains in both Texas and Puerto Rico despite political headwinds.

Success in Texas

Texas is the energy capital of the country, producing and consuming more oil and gas than any other state and serving as a hub for the fossil fuel industry. As its population expands, the deeply conservative Lone Star state’s energy demand is rising. Yet for the last decade, nearly all of that increased demand has been met with new renewable energy. Wind and solar alone accounted for more than 40 percent of the electricity generated in Texas during the first half of 2025.

Some anti-renewables politicians and pundits have tried to single out solar and wind as being to blame for power outages that have downed Texas’ grid in recent years when, in fact, renewables have made Texas’ grid more reliable and resilient during extreme weather. Case in point: The state’s main grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), recently projected the chance of rolling blackouts during this summer’s peak energy demand was just 0.3 percent, down significantly from last year’s 12 percent, thanks largely to new battery storage installations that make it possible to store solar and wind power and deploy it when needed.

Renewables are also saving Texans money: The state’s electricity prices are 24 percent lower than the national average. Is it any wonder the majority of Texans, regardless of political party, are now in favor of renewables as part of an “all of the above” energy mix? The state’s legislature is on board, too: In June, lawmakers across party lines resoundingly defeated a package of three bills that would have kneecapped renewables’ growth. If this kind of transformation is possible in Texas, it’s possible in any state.

Puerto Rico’s Solar Boom

Puerto Rico has one of the least reliable central energy systems. The archipelago’s power grid, which is heavily dependent on fossil fuels, is failing due to a chronic lack of investment, crippling debt load, incompetent management, and repeated hits from powerful hurricanes. The government handed control of its power plants to a subsidiary of private gas firm New Fortress Energy in 2023, deepening the commonwealth’s long-term reliance on fossil fuels and exacerbating the grid crisis. The result? Puerto Rico’s population is plagued by regular, widespread, life-disrupting blackouts including island-wide outages in December 2024 and April 2025.

Many Puerto Ricans have responded by taking matters into their own hands, adopting rooftop solar at a rapid pace, even without any kind of government support or incentives: On average, 4,700 systems are installed each month, and most of those include battery storage. As of March 2025, about 10 percent of households across the island had rooftop solar, representing over 1,100 megawatts of installed capacity, a five-fold increase since 2021. Although rooftop solar has been adopted mainly by households that can afford the cost, communities and organizations have also come together to facilitate rooftop solar and storage installation in marginalized sectors and homes with elderly or medically compromised residents. This has already benefited Puerto Ricans whose lives may well depend on access to reliable electricity during grid outages and hurricanes. Indeed, decentralized rooftop solar and storage are helping to bolster community resilience and equity throughout Puerto Rico.

Although this progress is remarkable, it is just the beginning. Analysis shows Puerto Rico’s renewable energy potential could meet—and exceed by more than tenfold—the commonwealth’s current and projected total annual electricity demand through 2050. Distributed solar and storage paired with larger solar installations at commercial spaces and brownfields could do the job, completely dismantling the government’s narrative of the need for the so-called “natural gas bridge.” Moreover, there is potential for cost savings for residents. As a result of the hurricanes that have affected Puerto Rico since 2017, the federal government allocated over $16 billion to rebuild the energy sector. If part of this money were to be directed toward expanding distributed solar and battery systems across Puerto Rico, energy costs could come down to less than 15 cents per kilowatt hour in 15 years (compared to about 25 cents per kWh now).

The Roadblocks Ahead

The Trump administration has already taken a series of actions overtly aimed at bolstering fossil fuel production and hindering renewables development. These have included scrapping fundamental environmental regulations, cancelling grants that had previously been awarded for community solar projects, and rolling out new permitting policies that unabashedly target solar and wind. While it is true the energy transition is underway, these roadblocks threaten to slow it down dramatically, to the detriment of Americans’ health and prosperity.

Just one example as it applies to Texas: The GOP’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law in July, will make it easier to lease new oil and gas projects and harder to roll out new renewables. One credible estimate projects that this reconciliation bill could result in the cancellation of 77 gigawatts of planned renewable generation capacity and 3 GW of battery storage capacity in Texas over the next 10 years. The result will be higher power prices as the grid is forced to rely more heavily on gas-fired generation. On top of that, domestic gas prices are being driven higher as a result of the boom in gas exports. Specifically, Texans are likely to end up paying $220 more per year for their electricity bills by 2030, and nearly $500 more by 2035.

In Puerto Rico, the Trump administration has diverted millions of dollars in federal recovery funds originally intended for solar deployment toward fossil fuel infrastructure. The territory’s new governor, Jenniffer González Colón, recently eliminated Puerto Rico’s goals of reaching 40 percent renewable energy by 2025 and 60 percent by 2040 and has been pushing for more gas-fired power plants. Meanwhile, the federally-appointed Fiscal and Oversight Management Board for Puerto Rico is threatening to dismantle net metering, the policy that compensates solar owners at the retail rate for electricity exported to the grid. These moves, along with proposals for a 400 MW gas plant and multiple gas conversion projects, stand as the greatest threats to renewable energy in Puerto Rico right now.

The benefits of clean energy are well documented and have become manifestly evident for many Americans, but it is no longer enough to simply promote renewables and hope policy catches on. The energy transition may well be inevitable on a global level. But here in the United States, the world’s largest economy, the oil and gas industry in partnership with the Trump administration is fighting tooth and nail to slow it down to a pace that will make it impossible to address the deadly health, economic, and environmental damages of climate change.

Those best placed to fend off these threats are the local organizations across the country whose power is rooted in deep knowledge of and connection with their communities. Supporting these advocates will strengthen their abilities to block handouts to the oil and gas industry in Texas that chip away at the cost advantage of renewables and to fight fossil fuel firms and their new polluting and taxpayer-subsidized infrastructure proposals in Puerto Rico and the Gulf Coast. For these and the countless other resistance efforts springing up in cities and states, ongoing support will be critical to success.",https://ssir.org/images/blog/us-renewable-energy-boom-737x737.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 08:59:59.785656

The settlement agreement stems from a challenge that Suncor filed to an updated water discharge permit issued by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment in 2024.
The department’s Water Quality Control Division agreed in the July 23 settlement to suspend several key permit requirements, including a provision sought by environmental and community groups to require public notification any time a water quality limit was exceeded.
High salinity levels can impact wildlife and agriculture but “there are no acute public health effects associated with these levels,” Beekman wrote.
“A closed-door deal that weakens permit protections is not just a bureaucratic failure, it is a betrayal of the Latino, immigrant, and working-class families who live, work, and play along these waterways.”","A coalition of Colorado environmental groups is crying foul over a settlement state officials quietly reached with Suncor Energy over the terms of a water quality permit for its Commerce City refinery earlier this year.

The settlement agreement stems from a challenge that Suncor filed to an updated water discharge permit issued by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment in 2024. The department’s Water Quality Control Division agreed in the July 23 settlement to suspend several key permit requirements, including a provision sought by environmental and community groups to require public notification any time a water quality limit was exceeded.

“The agreement walks that back significantly, and creates this complicated three-tiered structure on just how bad it has to be before there’s any public notification,” said Ian Coghill, an attorney with Earthjustice. “All that data is still going to be public, but it’s going to take a lot longer for people to be able to have access to it, or know that any exceedances or violations actually happened.”

The sprawling Suncor facility, one of Colorado’s largest sources of air pollution, has also drawn scrutiny in recent years for its repeated violations of water quality standards. Under the federal Clean Water Act, Suncor has a state-issued permit to discharge into Sand Creek, a 14-mile-long tributary that flows into the South Platte River just north of the refinery site.

Concerns from environmental groups center on pollutants like benzene and PFAS, a set of compounds known as “forever chemicals” that can lead to a variety of adverse health outcomes. Water regulators at CDPHE toughened restrictions on Suncor through a series of permit renewals beginning in 2021.

Critics, however, say the new restrictions didn’t go far enough. Represented by Earthjustice, a coalition that includes Denver Trout Unlimited, GreenLatinos, and the Colorado Sierra Club has filed its own appeal to Suncor’s March 2024 discharge permit, seeking lower PFAS limits, an accelerated compliance schedule, groundwater protections and more. That appeal, filed last year, is still pending.

The same groups had also intervened as parties in Suncor’s own appeal process. But despite their intervenor status, they say they weren’t notified of CDPHE’s July 23 settlement with the company “until several weeks after it had been signed.”

“It’s really the behind-the-scenes way that all this has operated that’s one of the most concerning elements of it,” Coghill said. “No one’s approved it, no one was involved in the negotiations. It was just kind of dumped.”

Some permit conditions take immediate effect

In a statement, Kaitlyn Beekman, a Water Quality Control Division spokesperson, said the groups were aware of settlement discussions, and the agreement “ensures faster public health protections without the uncertainty of litigation.”

“This agreement is a win for Colorado and for nearby communities because it allows the vast majority of the new, stronger permit conditions — especially those tied to public health protections — to take effect immediately,” Beekman said. “This means stronger limits for PFAS and other organic chemicals, tighter inspection and public notice requirements, and greater accountability without delay.”

The settlement agreement will also allow Suncor to avoid the 2024 permit’s limitations on salt effluent. High salinity levels can impact wildlife and agriculture but “there are no acute public health effects associated with these levels,” Beekman wrote.

Denver Trout Unlimited has advocated for strengthened water quality protections for Sand Creek since an angler’s discovery of an oil spill near the refinery in 2011 led to scrutiny of the waterway’s benzene levels. Meanwhile, Suncor’s location amid the predominantly low-income and Latino neighborhoods on Denver’s north side has long sparked environmental justice concerns.

“Communities living in the shadow of Suncor have borne the brunt of toxic pollution for decades, and once again their voices have been shut out,” Jessica Herrera, counsel with GreenLatinos, said in a statement. “A closed-door deal that weakens permit protections is not just a bureaucratic failure, it is a betrayal of the Latino, immigrant, and working-class families who live, work, and play along these waterways.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-80/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dsc_0279-1024x6831758189780.jpeg?h=199d8c1f&itok=ItcE4AjM,N,,2025-09-18 14:04:09.915242

“The initiative is…to help create a sense of urgency for the customers to have this opportunity to have resilient infrastructure,” Gerber said.
Or, alternatively, they can have the energy companies design, build, own, operate, finance, and maintain the energy system, and pay them a recurring fee, while the energy company makes money on the energy savings it is implementing.","Schneider Electric is at the helm of a new initiative aimed at speeding up the deployment of resilient, community-based energy systems across the country, the company announced today.

The Accelerating Resilient Infrastructure Initiative brings together over 20 developers, infrastructure providers, electrical distributors, and insurers, with the intention of connecting them with public and private projects in need of guidance, developers, and financing. Partners include energy-as-a-service provider AlphaStruxure, solar energy company Sunrock Distributed, global insurer Zurich, and Microsoft, among others.

Jana Gerber, North American president of microgrids at Schneider Electric, told Latitude Media that Schneider will act as a coordinator, and will also make its technologies, such as microgrids and electric vehicle charging solutions, available for deployment. Ideal customers for the initiative are communities that have “the desire to take control of their energy and have more resilience,” she said. “We help them pull together the team to rally around them to deliver that project.”

The announcement comes as communities and developers scramble to start construction on clean energy projects before key tax credits sunset. Under the GOP’s “One Big Beautiful Bill, passed in July, qualifying solar and wind projects need to start construction before the beginning of July 2026 to take advantage of clean electricity production and investment credits.

This urgency is key to the initiative’s framing: “Acting now allows organizations to take advantage of existing funding mechanisms before key deadlines shift — making timely planning essential,” Schneider notes in its announcement.

“The initiative is…to help create a sense of urgency for the customers to have this opportunity to have resilient infrastructure,” Gerber said. “That’s because of the tax credits, [but also] in general, for the conditions in the areas where they live. There’s multiple things that can be done to help them drive up energy efficiency or help them create on-site generation.”

For instance, partners in the initiative would help local communities deploy and finance solutions such as solar panels, battery energy storage, geothermal heat pumps, and electric vehicles charging infrastructure, as well as data innovation solutions, in the case of tech companies like Microsoft.

Partners like Unison Energy, Verdant Microgrid, and Sunrock have a collective $7.5 billion in deployable capital for energy resiliency projects; that sum is not exclusive to projects pursued through the initiative, but illustrates how much capital is available to back new construction.

Public entities pursuing energy resiliency projects can access that capital through performance contracting, which would entail having an energy-as-a-service company install clean energy upgrades, and paying for them over time using the savings those upgrades guarantee. Or, alternatively, they can have the energy companies design, build, own, operate, finance, and maintain the energy system, and pay them a recurring fee, while the energy company makes money on the energy savings it is implementing.

These potential projects are small in scale, and specific to the needs of the impacted community. For instance, Schneider has previously installed microgrids at two bus depots in Montgomery County, Maryland, and a 2.9-megawatt solar and microgrid system across eight municipal buildings in Piscataway, New Jersey; the latter is expected to deliver $19 million in savings over 20 years. In Texas, a 4.2 MW solar project across 10 school buildings is projected to save the Longview Independent School District district $450,000 annually in utility costs.",https://i0.wp.com/www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-09-17T235101.330.jpg?fit=1920%2C1280&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-18 09:00:20.163541

The caucus on Thursday morning released a framework for a deal that’s meant to speed up energy projects. A spokesperson confirmed that so far, no actual legislation has been drafted.

Speeding up the approval process for energy projects — which has come to be known as “permitting reform” — has been a hot topic in Washington for several years, as industries including energy have pushed for cutting back environmental reviews in favor of faster projects.

Members of both sides of the aisle have expressed support for speeding up projects they approve of, with Democrats pushing for faster approval of renewables and powerlines while Republicans have championed faster fossil fuel approvals. But they have yet to get an agreement across the finish line.

“By cutting through red tape, we can meet energy demand, lower costs, strengthen national security, and create high quality jobs, while being responsible stewards of the environment. The urgency is real, and the appetite for change is bipartisan,” said the framework provided by the caucus.

The Problem Solvers’ Caucus is made up of the most moderate members of both parties. While the agreement is a sign that there could be a path forward on the issue, it does not necessarily mean that the deal will get enough buy-in to cross the finish line.

The Senate in particular, where 60 votes are needed, could prove difficult, as key members have said they will not move a deal forward if the Trump administration continues to block new renewable energy development.

The new bipartisan proposal seeks to speed up approvals for energy projects in general by restricting who can sue to prevent them and setting a statute of limitations for suing over a project to as little as 150 days. While any energy project can prompt a lawsuit, fossil fuel projects are frequently challenged by environmental advocates.

It seeks to bolster the buildout of power lines, which could be crucial for getting more renewable energy onto the grid, by requiring the Energy Department to act on applications within 90 days, as well as by allowing some individual lines to be designated as being in the national interest.

It would also bolster nuclear energy by ending mandatory Nuclear Regulatory Commission hearings if “no stakeholders raise objections.”

It also seeks to limit state authority to block projects that run through their waters, which blue states have used in the past to block fossil fuel projects such as pipelines.

The money will fund 167 charging stations at 25 locations, including $787,500 going to electric automaker Rivian to add 12 stations at the massive Wally’s rest stop in Pontiac. Others include:

One of the largest disbursements will be a $910,287 grant for chargers at Eric’s Too Family Restaurant and Lounge near the interchange of Interstate 55 and Interstate 74 in Bloomington.

“This type of charging infrastructure will not only increase the number of charging stations, but it will enhance our energy sources for the Bloomington community as well,” Bloomington Mayor Dan Brady said in a statement.

Fighting for the money

The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law signed by former President Joe Biden contained $148 million for Illinois to build more EV charging stations. The state received $25.3 million to build charging stations at 37 locations in 2024 as part of the first round of grant funding.

But the Federal Highway Administration withheld the second round earlier this year after President Donald Trump signed an executive order requiring federal agencies to pause funding for clean energy projects appropriated in the Biden-era law.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and 16 other attorneys general sued the Trump administration in May seeking the release of the funds. The lawsuit argued it is illegal for the president to withhold funding that has already been approved by Congress. A judge ruled in June that the federal government must release the funds to Illinois and other states that joined the lawsuit.

“Illinois has been at the forefront of building a clean energy economy that creates jobs and helps lower costs for consumers, and building electric vehicle chargers across the states has been core to that mission,” Gov. JB Pritzker said in a statement. “I’m thankful for the quick action of our Attorney General in the fight to restore these funds that President Trump was unlawfully withholding.”

Pritzker’s office announced on Wednesday that Illinois will receive $18.4 million this year as part of the second round of grant funding for EV chargers. The money will fund the 167 charging stations at 25 locations.

To Lewis, coauthor of the Industrious Labs report, that’s a weak excuse, because hydrogen production by other companies would have ramped up to supply the facility.
Meanwhile, Cliffs’ Cleveland Works continues to spew emissions that drive climate change and harm human health.
Industrious Labs’ report notes the unit’s lining is nearing the end of its useful life.
Cleveland Works also leverages much of the waste heat from its industrial activities to make electricity.","Cleveland has big ambitions to reduce its planet-warming emissions. But a massive steelmaking facility run by Cleveland-Cliffs, one of Ohio’s major employers, could make it difficult for the city to see those plans through.

The plant emits roughly 4.2 million metric tons of greenhouse gases each year, complicating Cleveland’s effort to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, according to a report released by advocacy group Industrious Labs this summer. The plant is the city’s largest single source of planet-warming pollution.

Cleveland’s climate action plan is ​“bold and achievable,” said Hilary Lewis, steel director for Industrious Labs. But ​“if they want to achieve those goals, they have to take action on this Cleveland Works facility.”

As a major investment decision looms over an aging blast furnace at the facility, it’s unclear whether the company will move to cut its direct greenhouse gas emissions — or opt to reinvest in its existing coal-dependent processes.

Cliffs’ progress in reducing its nationwide emissions earned it recognition as a 2023 Goal Achiever in the Department of Energy’s Better Climate Challenge. As this year began, the company was set to slash emissions even further through projects supported by Biden-era legislation — the Inflation Reduction Act and the 2021 infrastructure law.

Then the Trump administration commenced its monthslong campaign of reneging on funding commitments for clean energy projects, including ones meant to ramp up the production of ​“green” hydrogen made with renewable energy. In June, Cliffs’ CEO Lourenco Goncalves backed away from a federally funded project to convert its Middletown Works in southwestern Ohio to produce green steel, saying there wouldn’t be a sufficient supply of hydrogen for the plant.

To Lewis, coauthor of the Industrious Labs report, that’s a weak excuse, because hydrogen production by other companies would have ramped up to supply the facility. “[Cliffs was] going to need so much hydrogen that they would be creating the demand,” she said.

Meanwhile, Cliffs’ Cleveland Works continues to spew emissions that drive climate change and harm human health. Industrious Labs’ modeling estimates that pollution from Cleveland Works is responsible for up to 39 early deaths per year, more than 1,700 lost work days, and more than 9,000 asthma cases. Cleveland ranks as the country’s fifth-worst city for people with asthma, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.

A road map for cutting carbon

Cleveland Works’ Blast Furnace #6 is a hulking vessel that removes impurities from iron ore by combining it with limestone and coke, a form of coal that burns at very high temperatures. Industrious Labs’ report notes the unit’s lining is nearing the end of its useful life.

To Industrious Labs, this presents an opportunity: The company could replace the old infrastructure with equipment that can process iron ore with natural gas or hydrogen instead of coal. Investing in this technology, called direct reduction, would cut the plant’s greenhouse gas emissions by more than 30% if natural gas is used. Using green hydrogen would slash emissions even more, the Industrious Labs team found.

The alternative is to just reline the furnace, which was the course Cliffs chose for the Cleveland facility’s Blast Furnace #5 in 2022.

Relining might provide small emissions cuts when measured per ton of steel, due to increased efficiencies, Lewis said. But ramped-up production from running more ore through the furnace could offset those reductions or even increase total emissions.

Cliffs did not respond to Canary Media’s repeated requests for comment for this story, and it has not yet publicly announced its plans for Blast Furnace #6.

To put itself on track with Cleveland’s emissions goals, however, the company would need to do more than just convert Blast Furnace #6 to the direct reduction process, Industrious Labs said.

The next step in the road map the group laid out would be for Cliffs to process refined iron ore into steel with an electric arc furnace — which can run on carbon-free power — instead of using the current basic oxygen equipment. Investing in green-hydrogen-based direct reduction and an electric arc furnace, instead of relining Blast Furnace #6, would increase emissions cuts to 47%, according to the Industrious Labs report.

Later steps would use direct reduction of iron and an electric arc furnace to refine and process the ore that is currently handled by Blast Furnace #5. Completing that work would cut Cleveland Works’ greenhouse gas emissions by 96%, according to the report.

What happens now?

The Industrious Labs analysis appears to lay out a credible decarbonization pathway, although not necessarily the only one, said Jenita McGowan, Cuyahoga County’s deputy chief of sustainability and climate. Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, also has a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and is in the process of finalizing the latest version of its climate action plan.

“My question about the paper is how feasible it truly is that Cleveland-Cliffs will deploy it in the near future,” McGowan said. Policy uncertainties at the federal level further complicate matters, she added.

For now, the city and county seem to be taking a pragmatic approach, focusing on achievements to date and encouraging future cuts wherever companies will make them.

But getting to net-zero for the industrial sector ​“will require more fundamental changes … [which] will take place over decades, rather than over a few years,” Cleveland’s climate action plan says. It also notes that low-carbon steel costs 40% more to produce compared to standard methods, ​“making it difficult for steelmakers to justify the investment in clean production.”

Cuyahoga County’s draft climate plan highlights Cliffs’ energy-efficiency improvements, including Cleveland Works’ use of some iron from the firm’s direct reduction plant in Toledo, Ohio. Cleveland Works also leverages much of the waste heat from its industrial activities to make electricity. The facility recently boosted that combined-heat-and-power generation by about 50 megawatts, the plan notes. That replaces electricity the plant would otherwise need from the grid, a majority of which still comes from fossil fuels.

Faster emissions reductions are certainly better, McGowan said. But the county also wants to make sure companies can stay in business as they decarbonize — especially Cliffs, one of the largest sources of commerce at the city’s port.

In Lewis’ view, decarbonizing Cleveland Works earlier rather than later would be a smart business move for Cliffs. ​“I think the biggest thing is staying competitive,” Lewis said.

One of Cliffs’ largest markets is supplying high-quality steel for automobiles, including electric vehicles, she added. In March, Hyundai announced plans to invest $6 billion in a new plant in Ascension Parish, Louisiana, that will produce low-carbon steel. As automakers face global pressure to source cleaner metal, Cliffs could find itself left behind, Lewis suggested.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Cleveland-Works.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=13828c7e6c4ea00a78f2116944b9d7bf,N,,2025-09-18 07:59:26.320654

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”",https://cc-production-uploads-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/12/shutterstock_2502153963MainWEB.png,N,,2025-09-18 06:58:07.371046

Homer City Redevelopment has said it wants to have the plant online in 2027.","State environmental regulators were peppered with questions from Indiana-area residents Wednesday concerned about the air pollution that will be emitted from a proposed 4.5-gigawatt, natural gas-fired power plant outside Homer City and the potential for impacting their health.

“We don’t feel they took any shortcuts on evaluating the (air pollution) controls,” said David Balog, permit chief for the Department of Environmental Protection’s Meadville office, on the air quality plan that plant owner Homer City Reevelopment LLC submitted. The hearing Wednesday evening at Indiana University of Pennsylvania attracted about 200 people.

The DEP has given its preliminary approval for the air quality plan submitted to the regulators for the plant. It’s to be located on the site of the former coal-fired Homer City power plant that was considered one the state’s largest air polluters.

DEP officials acknowledged that there would be particulate emitted into the air, and that there would be short-term and long-term risks.

“Both the short-term and long-term risk were below the risk levels that we are concerned about,” said Justin Haley, permit reviewer for DEP’s Meadville office.

Carolyn Tirmarchi of Indiana questioned what chemicals will be emitted into Indiana County’s air and in what amounts.

The risk levels are very low, with the combined cancer risk from breathing those emissions are 5 in 10 million, if exposed 24 hours a day for 70 years, Haley said.

The DEP will have a third party monitor and test the pollution that will be emitted from the smokestacks at the plant, although the state is required to be on the site only once every two years.

But Jocelyn Plowcha of Homer City repeatedly questioned DEP on what particulates that the state will be checking for when testing the smokestack emissions.

“What particulates are you looking for?” Plowcha asked, after not getting a specific response from the DEP representatives.

“If you don’t know what you are looking for, how can you test it?” Plowcha said.

Choloe Drew of Homer City voiced her concerns about the pollution in her town and its impact on their health. She questioned whether Homer City Redevelopment officials would want it near their home.

Corey Hessen, CEO of Homer City Redevelopment LLC, the plant owner, said he would not mind if the plant was near his home.

“Put it there, instead,” Drew said to a smattering of applause.

Hessen later said he lives in Indiana.

The audience contained a contingent of about 40 people wearing T-shirts identifying themselves as boilermakers, sheet metal workers and laborers. Building the massive power plant is expected to create 10,000 construction-related jobs.

State Sen. Joe Pittman, R-Indiana, told the officials from DEP and Homer City Redevelopment that the vast majority of his constituents are in favor of the proposed natural gas power plant.

Pittman, Senate majority leader whose district covers part of Westmoreland County, said this power plant will produce much fewer emissions than the former coal-fired power plant that closed in 2003. It slso will help to satisfy the demand for more electricity, Pittman said.

“We’re bringing (power) supply to the market that is needed. It sounds like a win-win,” Pittman said.

If DEP approves the air quality plan, the company will be permitted to begin construction and operate for a temporary period.

The testwork will also involve suitability testing of ultra-high purity Albany graphite samples for lithium-ion battery anode and cathode additive and nuclear applications.

NRCan CanmetENERGY will provide $200,000 of in-kind support including technical expertise, specialized equipment and custom testwork.

The project will entail the production of approximately 5-6 tonnes of 85% purity flotation concentrate from the 110-tonne bulk sample that was collected in 2019.

In January 2025, Zentek announced that AGC had achieved a preliminary, proof-of-concept purity of 99.9991% directly from a larger sample.

Albany Graphite supplied a 1 kg sample of the homogenized bulk flotation concentrate to a North American manufacturing company specializing in industrial graphite and carbon materials. The manufacturing company reported that the material was easily purified to an ultra-high purity level without the use of chlorine gas or any other halogen gases that are commonly used for graphite purification when 99.999% purity levels need to be achieved.

The process will lead to the subsequent production of larger volumes of high-purity graphite, which will be supplied to OEMs and end users for assessment and qualification.

“The CMIF grant will enable AGC to build on its recent purification successes and produce additional flotation concentrate that will be used for subsequent purification and anode development testwork, and produce marketing samples of ultra-high purity graphite samples for third-party evaluation in advanced material applications,” said Greg Fenton, CEO of Zentek and Albany Graphite. “We are pursuing the value-add processing component of the anode supply chain to create a vertically integrated anode solution.

The tax breaks were designed to be available for a decade, but the tax and domestic policy bill that passed in July now terminates them at the end of 2025. To use them, said Noah Goldmann, a policy manager at the energy-efficiency nonprofit Rewiring America, you must buy any new products and have them installed by Dec. 31.

Get it while you can, because the Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit and Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit, as these programs are known, can save homeowners thousands of dollars.

As with any tax deductions, applying the credits can be confusing. For most of the efficiency upgrades, there is a price cap on a potential deduction for each product. You can deduct up to 30 percent of the cost of the product or the price cap, whichever is lower. There is also a maximum deduction of $3,200.

For example, you could deduct up to $2,000 for a heat pump, a heat pump water heater, or a biomass stove or boiler, and then take an additional $1,200 for insulated doors, windows, skylights or weather stripping. Or, you could use the deduction on electrical components required to update the breaker box in your kitchen to allow for replacing a gas range with an induction model.

The caps and maximums do not apply to fuel cells, solar energy systems, geothermal heat pumps, battery storage, or small wind turbines. For these products, you can deduct up to 30 percent of the total cost, with no price cap or maximum deduction.

Some credits apply only to existing homes or to primary residences; some are only available in certain locations; and some are not available to renters.

Chief Executive Officer, L+M Development Partners

Our Catalyst Award winner for Market Transformation is Chief Executive Officer of L+M Development Partners, Lisa Gomez.

Nominated for helping to create markets for clean energy technologies across New York State and beyond, Lisa is a true change maker.

As Chief Executive Officer, Lisa Gomez has positioned L+M Development Partners as a nationally recognized affordable housing developer on a mission to build stronger communities. L+M and its affiliate companies are responsible for over $20 billion in development and investment, and have acquired, built, or preserved over 57,000 high-quality residential units in a variety of urban markets nationwide.

Curiosity and Innovation

A defining characteristic of Gomez and her team is the culture of curiosity and innovation that underscores everything they do—particularly in the areas of energy decarbonization and improved building performance.

While L+M worked with NYSERDA for decades, the recent partnerships focus on more evolved initiatives such as the Empire Building Challenge and Buildings of Excellence. Through these efforts, L&M has been actively working to advance innovative technologies like geothermal systems and Passive House design. “We see NYSERDA as a key partner for us in pushing the boundaries of sustainable building and energy performance,” said Gomez.

“We see NYSERDA as a key partner for us in pushing the boundaries of sustainable building and energy performance,” said Gomez.

A Key Motivator

What makes Gomez tick, and one of the hallmarks of L+M as a company, is curiosity and restlessness to improve. From projects to the products used, L+M is always trying to both build and operate buildings more efficiently. Gomez notes, “We’re always looking for new solutions to help mitigate some of the costs.”

Revolutionizing the Energy Landscape

The work L+M is doing in geothermal and Passive House technologies is part of a long-term, incremental effort to make these solutions more cost-effective and widely available. The company is also exploring the use of prefabricated components to streamline building processes, particularly for retrofits.

The real challenge, though, lies in older buildings, especially in New York City, where many of L+M’s properties are located. These buildings, with their higher ceilings and large windows, often come with outdated systems like oil-fired boilers, making energy efficiency upgrades more difficult.

Despite the hurdles, L+M is experimenting with innovations, including in New York City Housing Authority buildings and retrofits like a Yonkers Housing Authority project. These efforts aim to address the significant system failures that can occur in older buildings, highlighting the need for advanced technology to tackle the unique challenges of retrofitting and maintaining older structures in a sustainable way.

Increasing Awareness Through Education

L+M’s work prioritizes providing their residents with greater comfort and reliable building systems. “Predictability is key — residents don’t want to experience disruptions like a broken boiler or lack of hot water. But, while reliability is essential, part of L+M’s role is educating residents about the value of sustainable solutions. While residents may not be concerned with the specific technologies behind the improvements, they care deeply about the outcomes, such as consistent indoor climate comfort and air quality.

It is up to the industry to bridge the gap in building resident awareness, ensuring that residents understand and appreciate the benefits of these changes for both their immediate living experience and the environment,” said Gomez.

The Power of Collaboration

When it comes to pushing forward great change, Gomez believes in a unified approach. “We’re all working toward a common goal, and the nature of the work requires collaboration—on the private and public side and on the profit and not-for-profit side. It truly takes a village.”",https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/Assets/Common/Images/favicons/nyserda/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-18 11:01:30.917125

In a 47-page motion filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island, Attorneys General Peter Neronha of Rhode Island and William Tong of Connecticut asked a federal judge for a faster, temporary block on the Trump administration while their lawsuit plays out.

“Revolution Wind was chosen for a reason—it was the best way to reduce costs for ratepayers, comply with state mandates, and ensure a long-term stable energy source,” the AGs wrote. “The multi-year process that the States engaged in before selecting Revolution Wind cannot be recreated in a timely fashion.”

The pair of Democratic state attorneys general sued the administration on Sept. 4, two weeks after federal regulators ordered co-developer Ørsted to stop construction of the 65-turbine wind project. The project 15 nautical miles south of Rhode Island was already 80% complete, having secured its final federal approval in November 2023, and inked agreements to sell power to Rhode Island and Connecticut utility companies by 2027.

Now nearing one month, the delay has already thrown critical project benchmarks off-track, risking loss of specialty vessels needed to transport equipment and parts; union laborers, some of whom have now taken other jobs, and both states’ environmental and economic futures.

“While in some types of construction, delays of weeks could be mitigated or might be compensable, Ørsted has explained that a delay beyond September 22, 2025 imperils the entire project and threatens unsustainable losses for the company,” the AGs wrote, referencing the timeline suggested by Ørsted executives in prior affidavits.

The Danish renewable energy giant and its co-developer, a consortium led by Skyborn Renewables, filed suit against the Trump administration on the same day as the state attorneys general, although the companies took their legal challenge to federal court in Washington D.C. Ørsted and Skyborn, together known as Revolution Wind LLC, asked a federal judge for a preliminary injunction on Sept. 5, seeking a short-term intervention that would let them pick the $5 billion project back up.

A preliminary hearing has been scheduled for Sept. 22, according to the public court docket.

The same request is now being made by the attorneys general.

“We have no time to waste in getting Revolution Wind back online, which is why we’re asking the Court to put a stop to this in short order,” Neronha said in a statement. “In the few weeks since the stop work order was issued, without warning or reason, Rhode Islanders have been harmed, facing daily uncertainty. We have heard difficult stories from union workers who are out of a job, and from businesses who are now reluctant to pursue economic ventures due to the uncertainty created by this Administration’s decision. Further, Rhode Islanders continue to bear the brunt of the rising and increasingly unstable energy costs and environmental harms associated with fossil fuels. In this case, we need relief now for the benefit of Rhode Island, its workers, and its residents. And time is of the essence.”

Neronha’s office acknowledged, but did not immediately provide an answer Wednesday on why the state did not ask for a preliminary injunction sooner.

Speaking to the Connecticut Building Trades Council at its convention at Mohegan Sun casino Wednesday, Tong said the AGs delayed seeking an injunction at the request of Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont. The Connecticut Mirror reported that Lamont first wanted to try to negotiate with federal administrators, including Interior Secretary Burgum.

Gov. Dan McKee has also appealed to Burgum directly, exchanging text messages in the hopes that more information about the project’s progress might persuade the administration to rescind the stop work order. But McKee’s request for a face-to-face with Donald Trump has not yet been answered.

The new AGs motion features a stark warning from Christopher Kearns, Rhode Island’s acting energy commissioner, who wrote that delays in the project jeopardize the state decarbonization mandates, including offsetting 100% of the state’s electricity needs by 2033 — either through renewable sources or credits purchased by the state utility company. The 704-megawatt Revolution Wind project is projected to produce enough electricity to power 350,000 homes across Rhode Island and Connecticut, equal to 2.5% of the regional electric needs.

“There are no readily available alternatives to allow Rhode Island to meet its statutorily required levels of renewable energy with affordable long-term contracting for clean energy or Renewable Energy Credits without Revolution Wind, Kearns wrote in his 11-page affidavit.

And, the 9.8 cents per kilowatt hour Rhode Island Energy was already under contract to pay for the wind project’s electricity is 33% lower than the proposed winter electric rates in Rhode Island this year. Connecticut energy officials project regional utility costs to rise $500,000 a year starting in 2028 if the Revolution Wind project is not completed.

“Every day that Revolution Wind sits mothballed in the ocean is another day of unemployment, another day of unaffordable energy costs, and another day burning fossil fuels when clean, affordable, American-made energy is within our sights,” Tong said in a statement. “We’re asking the court to step in right now, to recognize the irreparable and immediate harm we are suffering, and to stop the Trump Administration’s impulsive and lawless overreach.”

An estimated 1,200 union laborers stand to lose work if the project does not resume, while new state apprenticeship programs meant to train future operations and maintenance technicians could fall flat.

“The Stop Work Order is also likely to undermine investor confidence and set a chilling precedent for future projects,” the AGs motion states. “This type of shock to the industry hurts the States’ investments to support this industry.”

Elizabeth Peace, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Interior, declined to comment in an email Wednesday, citing the pending litigation.

Final Takeaway So, why are heat pumps surging in popularity across America?","In just a few years, heat pumps have gone from a niche technology to one of the fastest-growing choices for American households.

Manufacturers are now shipping millions of units each year, and for the first time, heat pump sales have overtaken gas furnaces.

This shift reflects more than just a trend — it’s a fundamental change in how Americans heat and cool their homes.

One Device, Year-Round Comfort

The biggest reason behind this surge is simple: value. Heat pumps provide both heating in the winter and cooling in the summer.

Instead of generating heat, they move it, which makes them far more efficient than many traditional systems. For a homeowner replacing an old furnace or adding air conditioning, getting two systems in one makes heat pumps an attractive option.

Technology Has Caught Up

Not long ago, heat pumps were considered impractical in colder regions because they struggled in freezing weather.

That’s no longer true. Advances in compressor technology, refrigerants, and system design have created “cold-climate heat pumps” that can reliably warm homes even when outdoor temperatures plunge well below freezing.

Installers, too, are gaining more experience, which means better system design and fewer issues. Today’s heat pumps aren’t just an option for the South — they’re spreading to the Northeast and Midwest as well.

Incentives Make Them Affordable

Government support has been another game changer. Federal tax credits, state programs, and utility rebates are reducing the upfront cost of installing a heat pump.

For many homeowners, these financial incentives mean the difference between sticking with an old furnace and upgrading to a more efficient, modern system.

When you add in the fact that heat pumps can lower monthly energy bills — especially for households currently using oil or propane — the financial case becomes even stronger.

Regional Adoption Patterns

Heat pump adoption isn’t evenly spread across the country. In the South and Southeast, where winters are mild and air conditioning is essential, heat pumps are already a standard choice. In some states, more than a third of homes rely on them.

In colder regions, adoption has been slower, but momentum is building thanks to improved technology and generous state-level programs. Builders of new homes are also installing heat pumps at much higher rates than before, which means adoption will continue to grow.

More Than Just Comfort — Climate and Energy Goals

Beyond personal savings, heat pumps are helping meet bigger goals. As the U.S. grid brings in more renewable energy, electrifying home heating becomes an effective way to cut carbon emissions.

Heat pumps replace the need for on-site combustion of fossil fuels, improving indoor air quality and reducing environmental impact.

For many households, this added benefit is a powerful motivator. Choosing a heat pump isn’t just about saving money — it’s about future-proofing a home.

—–The U.S. Department of Energy has pointed to heat pumps as a central part of the nation’s transition toward a low-carbon energy system. With rising demand, better technology, and stronger policy support, heat pumps are on track to become a standard household choice by the 2030s.—

Barriers That Still Exist

Despite the momentum, there are still challenges. Upfront installation costs can be high, particularly if electrical panels or ductwork need upgrades.

In some states, high electricity rates make payback periods longer. And not every installer is trained to size and install heat pumps properly, which can affect performance.

There’s also an equity issue: renters and lower-income households often have fewer opportunities to switch, since decisions depend on landlords or financing options.

Why the Trend Will Continue

Even with these barriers, the direction is clear. Heat pumps are gaining ground because they solve real problems: they reduce energy bills, offer year-round comfort, and align with climate goals.

With technology improving and policies pushing toward electrification, their share of the market is expected to keep climbing.

Builders are increasingly installing them in new homes, homeowners are taking advantage of rebates, and more installers are recommending them. Each of these factors reinforces the momentum, making heat pumps less of a niche and more of a new normal.

Final Takeaway

So, why are heat pumps surging in popularity across America? Because they deliver on multiple fronts. They’re efficient, practical, increasingly affordable, and ready for climates where they once struggled.

At the same time, they help households save money and reduce their environmental impact.

For millions of Americans, that combination of comfort, cost savings, and sustainability makes the choice clear: the future of home heating and cooling is electric, and heat pumps are leading the way.

FAQs About Heat Pumps

1. Do heat pumps work in cold weather?

Yes. Modern cold-climate heat pumps can operate efficiently even below freezing, thanks to advanced compressors and refrigerants.

2. Are there tax credits for installing heat pumps?

Yes. The Inflation Reduction Act offers homeowners federal tax credits of up to $2,000, plus additional rebates depending on income and state programs.

3. How long does a heat pump last?

With proper maintenance, most heat pumps last 15–20 years, similar to traditional HVAC systems.

4. Are heat pumps expensive to run?

While upfront installation can cost more, their high efficiency often results in lower monthly bills, making them cost-effective in the long run.

5. Do heat pumps reduce carbon emissions?

Absolutely. By using electricity instead of fossil fuels, and with the grid increasingly powered by renewables, heat pumps are one of the most effective ways to lower household carbon footprints.

MADISON, Gov. – Tony Evers joined 17 other governors this week in calling on Congress to extend enhanced premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act, ACA, warning that failure to act could result in higher premiums and loss of coverage for millions of Americans, including more than 276,000 Wisconsinites.

In a joint letter sent to congressional leadership, the governors emphasized that the ACA’s enhanced credits, set to expire at the end of 2025, lowered marketplace premiums by an average of 44 percent in 2024, according to the Center for American Progress. Without renewal, families could face thousands in added costs and widespread coverage losses.

Gov. Evers said the stakes are especially high for working families already struggling with rising costs.

“Far too many are feeling the pressure of rising costs, and folks should never have to choose between life-saving healthcare and getting their prescriptions or putting food on the table and keeping a roof over their head,” said Evers. “Now more than ever, we should be working to make healthcare more affordable and more accessible, not making it more expensive and harder for folks to get the care they need.”

The letter was addressed to House Speaker Mike Johnson, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. It warns that if Congress fails to act swiftly, insurers will set 2026 rates without the enhanced credits, triggering a wave of sticker shock for consumers.

Gov. Evers also pointed to Wisconsin’s record-breaking ACA enrollment during the 2025 Open Enrollment Period, with more than 313,000 residents signing up for coverage on the individual marketplace, marking the highest enrollment in state history.

The governor credited the Biden, Harris Administration and Wisconsin’s congressional delegation, including Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Reps. Gwen Moore and Mark Pocan, for helping make coverage more affordable. In 2023, 88 percent of Wisconsin enrollees received premium subsidies, saving an average of $573.11 per month.

Evers also highlighted the success of the Wisconsin Healthcare Stability Plan, WIHSP, a bipartisan initiative signed into law in 2018 and extended through 2028. WIHSP has consistently lowered rates on the individual marketplace, reducing premiums by 14.5 percent in 2022 and 13.7 percent in 2023. Without WIHSP, rates on HealthCare.gov would have increased by 19.5 percent for the 2025 plan year, instead, they rose by just 8.2 percent.

Projected Premium Increases if Subsidies Expire

According to analysis by ACA Signups, if the enhanced subsidies expire at the end of 2025, Wisconsin residents could see average gross premiums increase by 19.9 percent in 2026. This estimate accounts for both the loss of enhanced subsidies and additional regulatory changes affecting affordability.

The Kaiser Family Foundation also estimates that nationally, premiums could rise by up to 75 percent for some enrollees, translating to an average increase of $700 per year. For Wisconsin’s 311,000 ACA enrollees, the financial impact could be substantial, especially for middle-income families who would again face the “subsidy cliff.”

Governor Points to Wisconsin Investments In Healthcare

Governor Evers also point to the final 2025-27 Biennial Budget, which was signed into law by Gov. Evers just a day before President Trump’s budget reconciliation bill was signed into law, secured an additional $1.1 billion to support healthcare access across Wisconsin, especially in rural communities, that would have been jeopardized had the President’s bill been enacted first.

“In addition to securing the additional $1.1 billion, the 2025-27 Biennial Budget signed into law by Gov. Evers made investments to support Wisconsin’s healthcare industry and ensure Wisconsinites have access to quality, affordable healthcare—especially in rural areas—with new efforts to bolster health systems across the state,” said Evers

Those investments included:

Continuing funding for BadgerCare;

Over $53 million to increase Medicaid reimbursement rates for personal care, obstetrics, private duty nursing, residential opioid treatment, and home health services, and more;

Fully funding the minimum fee schedule implemented by the Department of Health Services last biennium to help long-term care facilities avoid staffing cuts and closures;

$1.5 million in increased funding over the biennium for free and charitable clinics;

$7 million to support crisis intervention through the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline;

$2 million to support the WisCaregiver Career Program to help address the state’s shortage of certified nursing assistants and direct care professionals; and

$3.8 million to support Aging and Disability Resource Centers across the state, among many other critical provisions.

“I’ve always believed healthcare should not be a privilege afforded only to the healthy and the wealthy,” Evers said. “Wisconsinites should be able to get the healthcare they need when they need it.”

The full body of the governors’ joint letter is included below:

Speaker Johnson, Leader Jeffries, Leader Thune, and Leader Schumer,

We urge you to extend the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits. For millions of hard-working Americans, these subsidies are the only reason health insurance is still within reach in a country where the cost of living keeps going up.

If they expire, premiums will rise by thousands of dollars for many families, millions will lose coverage, and people will be forced to make impossible choices between paying for healthcare, rent, or groceries. Hard-working American families, older Americans not yet on Medicare, small business owners, and rural communities, where marketplace coverage is often the only option, will be hit the hardest.

The timing couldn’t be more urgent. Insurers are already setting 2026 rates. If Congress acts quickly, states can lock in lower premiums and spare families a wave of sticker shock this fall. If not, the damage will be felt for years.

This isn’t a partisan issue. It’s about protecting working people who are doing everything right but still struggling to get by. Extending these tax credits is one of the simplest, most effective steps Congress can take to keep healthcare affordable and provide real stability for millions of families.",https://vernonreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/aca-affrodable-care-act-adobestock_1088489180_editorial_use_only-by-tada-images.jpeg,N,,2025-09-18 08:00:02.623456

n-Type Modules

An early adopter of n-type TOPCon cell technology, the company showcased a bifacial glass-to-glass PV module from its ASTRO N5 series. The CHSM72N(DG)/F-BH model, on display, equipped with 144 M10 half-cut cells, boasts a power output of up to 605 W and an efficiency of up to 23.4%. It uses the company’s self-developed TOPCon cell technology. The latest iteration of this technology incorporates front-side laser-induced firing (LIF) and optimized metal paste composition, along with POML technology. In the LIF process, employing a laser to diffuse the optimized silver metallization paste into silicon forms an ohmic contact between the ribbon and wafer, decoupling the potential metal contact recombination and contact resistivity. This process achieves a balance between front-side contact resistivity and contact recombination. Meanwhile, the POML technology, which deposits a multi-layer n+ doped poly-Si layer on top of an ultra-thin tunneling oxide layer, improves rear-side passivation and reduces parasitic absorption. The company states that combining these features contributes to a jump in mass-scale cell efficiency. (see Crafting A Masterpiece: The Progress Of Astronergy’s TOPCon Products). However, Astronergy didn’t quantify the improvement in efficiency.

Also on display was the company’s dual-glass bifacial module CHSM66RN(DG)/F-BH from the ASTRO N7 series. It incorporates its in-house TOPCon cell, featuring technologies that introduce the migration to busbarless (ZBB) metallization layout from super multi busbar (SMBB) and half-cut cell edge passivation technology. The latter, which passivates along the cut edges of half-cut cells, mitigates potential losses due to defects that might act as a carrier recombination center and reduce cell efficiency. This module, featuring 132 M12R half-cut cells, delivers up to 630 W and a maximum efficiency of 23.3%.

Laminated with 2 mm front and rear glass, the former module has dimensions of 2,278 × 1,134 × 30 mm, while the latter is sized at 2,382 × 1,134 × 30 mm. However, they weigh about the same at 31 kg, and find application in utility, commercial & industrial, and distributed generation (DG).

EV Realty is far from the only business building megawatt-scale truck-charging sites in California.
If anything, EV Realty has been ​“a little bit more slow and purposeful than others” in building its charging hubs, Sullivan said.
With dedicated charging in hand, freight companies and their customers can start to realize the underlying competitive economics of electric trucks, Sullivan said.","Electric trucks can beat diesel-fueled ones on the cost of moving freight from California’s seaports to its inland distribution hubs — as long as the battery-powered vehicles can reliably recharge at both ends of their route. That fact is spurring a boom in the construction of truck-charging depots across the state.

On Thursday, EV Realty, a San Francisco-based charging site developer, broke ground on what will be one of California’s biggest fully grid-powered, fast-charging depots for electric trucks so far.

The company’s site in San Bernardino, located in a region known as the Inland Empire that’s crowded with distribution warehouses, will pull about 10 megawatts of power from the grid once it’s up and running in early 2026. It will be equipped with 76 direct-current fast-charging ports, including a number of ultra-high-capacity chargers capable of refilling a Tesla Semi truck in 30 minutes or less.

EV Realty has more large-scale depots in the works, including another in San Bernardino, one in Torrance near the Port of Long Beach, and a fourth in Livermore in Northern California. Thursday’s groundbreaking was accompanied by the announcement that the company had raised $75 million from private equity investor NGP, which also led a $28 million investment in 2022.

With that cash infusion, along with last year’s debut of a joint venture with GreenPoint Partners to develop $200 million in charging hubs, ​“we are fully capitalized against an underwritten, five-year business plan,” EV Realty CEO Patrick Sullivan told Canary Media.

That plan includes ​“five to seven more projects of the scale we have in San Bernardino, plus some smaller, more built-to-suit projects,” he said.

EV Realty does build and operate sites for passenger vehicles, such as the chargers it installed in a parking garage in Oakland, California, backed by power provider Ava Community Energy. But the company isn’t in the business of setting up open public charging sites that depend on drive-by traffic to earn money back, Sullivan said.

Instead, it’s signing deals with major freight carriers and fleet owners that want a dedicated spot to get their trucks charged and back on the road as quickly as possible.

That’s why EV Realty’s 76 chargers at its San Bernardino site are all dedicated to specific customers, he said. Of those, 72 are committed to those paying monthly rates on multiyear contracts. ​“Our customers will have stalls and amounts of power that are theirs 24/7, and we will have customers basing their operations out of that site,” he said.

The remaining four chargers, including those offering high-voltage megawatt charging systems, are ​“pull-through” slots where trucks towing trailers can get a quick recharge. ​“That pricing will be more of a pay-as-you-go, per kilowatt-hour — but all those trucks are registered at our site,” he said.

EV Realty is far from the only business building megawatt-scale truck-charging sites in California. Big EV truck depots are springing up around Southern California’s massive port complexes and along its major freight corridors, built by startups such as Terawatt Infrastructure, Forum Mobility, Voltera, and WattEV; freight haulers like NFI Industries and Schneider National; and logistics operators such as Prologis.

Most of these depots are providing dedicated service to customers under contracts, but a few are starting to offer charging on a first-come, first-served basis. Greenlane, a joint venture of Daimler Truck North America, utility NextEra Energy, and investment firm BlackRock Alternatives, opened a 10-megawatt truck-charging site in Colton, a city neighboring San Bernardino, that’s meant to provide a more traditional ​“truck stop” service to vehicles needing to charge.

If anything, EV Realty has been ​“a little bit more slow and purposeful than others” in building its charging hubs, Sullivan said. But he insists that the broader truck-electrification project remains economically viable, despite the challenges erected by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress.

There’s no doubt that electric trucking is experiencing a tough moment in California and across the country. The megalaw passed by Republicans in July cut short tax credits for commercial EVs and EV chargers that had been put in place by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. This has weakened support for purchasing battery-powered vehicles, which still cost two to three times more than their fossil-fueled counterparts, even if EVs’ lower fueling and maintenance costs can make them cheaper in the long run.

This summer, Republicans and the Trump administration also revoked Clean Air Act provisions that permitted California and 10 other states to set mandates forcing manufacturers to sell increasing numbers of zero-emissions trucks. Last month, major truck manufacturers sued California, seeking to extricate themselves from a clean-vehicle partnership agreement.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s trade policies have thrown ​“sand into the works” of the U.S. freight industry, Sullivan said. Imports are set to decline significantly under President Donald Trump’s tariffs on foreign-made goods, and the on-again, off-again nature of his taxes has scrambled long-term planning.

“Carriers, trucking, transportation companies are at the very front lines of a global trade war,” Sullivan said. ​“You have no predictability on how you can utilize your assets.”

In the face of that uncertainty, cementing charging for electric trucks along established routes becomes more important than ever, he said. Like many of its charging depot competitors, EV Realty is inking partnerships with other parties in the broader freight-hauling industry, such as its August agreement with Prologis to share and streamline access and software systems across both companies’ networks.

With dedicated charging in hand, freight companies and their customers can start to realize the underlying competitive economics of electric trucks, Sullivan said. ​“A carrier bidding on freight on a lane is bidding whatever their marginal operating cost is, above or below the cost of fuel,” he said. ​“If you can move short and regional haul, point to point, with an EV, you’re bidding on a marginal cost that’s lower than diesel.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/EV-Realty-San-Bernardino-Mill-charging-site-artist-rendering-diagonal-aerial-building-foreground.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=92bd21149e43440c5846dea0ddf787b8,N,,2025-09-18 03:58:04.418309

There are currently 43 proposed carbon capture and sequestration projects in Louisiana, one of the few states to be awarded primary enforcement authority (or primacy) for the regulation of Class VI injection wells by the federal EPA. This means that, unlike many other states, the LDENR is in charge of the permit application review and approval process, allowing for more local control over proposed projects. Although the Hackberry approval is the culmination of a nearly 1.5-year permitting process, subsequent permitting actions should benefit from the LDNR's early rigorous review process, reducing future permitting timelines to less than one year.

Carbon capture and sequestration projects have become increasingly prevalent, offering stakeholders innovative strategies for managing CO2emissions. In a time when investors, customers, and governmental authorities often pressure industry to decrease CO2emissions, these projects present opportunities for companies to participate in domestic and foreign carbon reduction incentives. When paired with power generation facilities, carbon capture and sequestration can compound multiple benefits, contributing to national energy independence, producing clean, carbon-neutral energy, and creating credits eligible for sale in carbon markets worldwide

Carbon capture and sequestration projects involve capturing CO2before it is emitted from industrial facilities, transporting it to a permitted injection well, and injecting it deep underground for storage so that it cannot escape into the atmosphere. In addition to receiving a Class VI permit, before the capture, transportation, and injection of CO2may be carried out, emitting companies, operators, and landowners will enter into various agreements creating the necessary rights and obligations to undertake these activities and allocating the risks related thereto. Before entering into any such agreement, there are many issues all parties will need to consider, including ones raised by state officials.

Understanding the political headwinds, the varying regulatory regimes, and securing the appropriate legal services will be crucial to effectively navigating the risks in this new and complex environment.

My advice to them would be to set goals, integrate climate risk into the enterprise risk management approach, and embed it into board oversight.","The climate crisis is not a distant threat. It is here, shaping our markets and disrupting our economies in real time. Across the United States, manufacturers are facing droughts one month, floods the next, and wildfires in between. In California, for example, farmlands are operating at only half capacity because of water shortages, a reality that affects farmers, food processors, truck drivers, and consumers alike. These are not abstract “environmental issues.” They represent billions of dollars in material financial losses, happening right now across the country.

I have spent the last three decades urging companies and investors to treat sustainability not as a side initiative, but as a core strategy. The business case today has never been clearer: climate risk is a financial risk. If you are a board member or C-suite leader, your fiduciary duty demands that you understand these risks and respond to them, regardless of the shifting political winds.

Despite the US, the world is moving forward

In much of the world, the integration of environmental and social risks into business and investment strategy is not up for debate anymore. I’ve just returned from Singapore, where I met with sovereign wealth funds, investors from Asia, Australia, and Europe. There, the assumption is ingrained: climate change is a material factor that will shape our markets and our future. It is as undeniable as gravity.

From Europe’s corporate sustainability reporting to China’s rapid production of electric vehicles, the momentum is strong. You see it in the growing companies backing science-based targets, developing climate transition action plans, and producing sustainability and climate disclosures. The shift from theory to practice, from “we should think about climate” to “we must integrate climate into core business,” is well underway. And then there is the United States.

With the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law by President Biden in August 2022, we had the most significant piece of climate and clean energy legislation in US history. In just two years, it spurred hundreds of billions of dollars in private-sector investments, created hundreds of thousands of new jobs, and catalyzed plans for clean energy manufacturing facilities across the country. The law’s tax credits and incentives accelerated the deployment of solar, wind, battery storage, and electric vehicles, while driving costs down and expanding domestic supply chains. Most of these provisions are under threat today and could be repealed or rolled back.

But well before the Trump administration took office, we’ve seen an orchestrated political campaign to undermine corporate climate action in the last two years. [Republican] state legislatures have introduced hundreds of bills targeting responsible investment and business practices. Attorneys general and treasurers from multiple states have sent threatening letters to companies, warning that working together on climate action could be deemed a violation of antitrust laws. Major asset managers have been thrown out of state pension systems for the offense of considering climate risk.

The economics remain unshaken

Let’s set politics aside for a moment. If you are an insurance company and you are not pricing climate risk in your underwriting, you are failing your shareholders. If you are a manufacturer who depends on a steady water supply, you must account for drought risk. If you are an automaker, the electric vehicle market is growing in Europe, in Asia, in China, at a pace faster than anyone expected, then you need to plan for that reality, regardless of regulatory uncertainty.

Climate change is not a future problem. The $100bn in storm-related damages in the US last year alone is a reminder that the implications are clearly present today. Supply chain interruptions, workforce disruptions, and commodity price spikes are all core operational risks. Treating them as anything less than material financial risks is, quite simply, a breach of fiduciary duty.

Regulation and disclosure frameworks are evolving. In Europe, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) remains rooted in the assumption that climate risk is a financial risk, even as details are being refined. California has passed strong climate disclosure laws, though we can expect these will face litigation. The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) offers global alignment that reduces the burden of fragmented rules.

But for now, US federal climate disclosure rules have been rolled back. The threat this poses is real. While companies are still acting on climate, they’ve gone quiet about it. They are not making bold public commitments the way they did after the US withdrew from the Paris Agreement for the first time in 2017. To be sure, the lack of transparency has some hidden costs: it can sap internal momentum and stakeholder support.

Some companies will choose to continue to act and do so without fanfare. That is acceptable, as long as the substance remains. But the greater danger would be if companies stopped acting altogether.

My advice to them would be to set goals, integrate climate risk into the enterprise risk management approach, and embed it into board oversight. You don’t have to hold a press conference or sign onto every public initiative. What matters is that you know your risks, your opportunities, and you can act on them.

Markets, consumers, and the irresistible economics of clean energy

Even without policy support, markets are shifting. Solar energy is now the cheapest form of electricity in history. The economics of wind, especially onshore, are strong. In China, electric vehicles are rolling off assembly lines by the thousands each hour, pushing down prices and transforming markets. This is not ideology – it’s market logic.

Removing the tax credits will slow adoption in the US, that is certain, but it won’t stop it. As a consumer, I know that a $7,500 EV tax credit can determine whether I buy a new car now or delay the purchase, but given global competition, prices will come down one way or another. As a business leader, you should recognize that consumer demand and investor expectations are already driving long-term change and will continue to, even in the absence of supportive federal policy. You should recognize that global markets are hurtling towards clean energy.

In this environment, here’s what I believe every board and CEO should prioritize:

Stay grounded in economics and science. Politics will shift. Physics and market forces will not.

Assess and disclose climate risks where they are material. Even if not mandated, it builds resilience and credibility.

Integrate climate into corporate governance. Boards must treat it like any other strategic risk.

Act globally. Multinationals cannot afford one climate policy for the US and another for the rest of the world.

Signal credibility to investors. Use quarterly earnings calls to discuss climate risk and opportunity.

Build operational resilience. Secure supply chains, diversify energy sources, and plan for climate disruptions.",https://www.imd.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Climate-risk-is-financial-risk-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 09:59:38.670678

Rep. Pfluger: Mr. Woods, thank you for joining us. Your testimony highlights how states can be unfairly penalized for air pollution that they can't control, whether it drifts across borders, international state borders, a number of things, whether it stems from wildfires, natural sources. The Foreign Emissions and Nonattainment Clarification for Economic Stability, or the FENCES Act, aims to correct that problem by making sure that states aren't labeled as nonattainment when the pollution is literally out of their hands. And your testimony points out that nonattainment designations can delay permits, hurt economic growth, and don't actually get after the problem that they're trying to solve. So I want to ask a couple of questions. How would clarifying Section 179B, as the FENCES Act proposes, reduce permitting delays or protect the environment better than what we're actually doing right now?

Mr. Woods: I think the bill goes a long way to clarify this provision that allows for state agencies like ours to capture the right thing. As EPA thinks about international background, other sources that are outside the control of a local agency as the primary regulator of air quality, there are several points in which the agency could consider it: when it sets the standards; when it does designations of an area, initially; when it looks at redesignating those areas into attainment or nonattainment; when it reclassifies. As my testimony lays out in great detail, as you get in nonattainment and then higher classifications from marginal to moderate to serious to severe to extreme, the penalties on permitting, on transportation funds and transportation conformity, and on fuel requirements become much more heavy handed and can just devastate and strangle economic growth, and are really at the core of the permitting issue. So we want the whole country to be in attainment, but the 179B provision is actually to avoid getting bumped up beyond marginal to those more significant penalties.

Rep Pfluger: I'll turn to Ms. Kunz and talk about infrastructure and the AI game that we know is here. And you know, just looking at the data centers of semiconductor facilities and other advanced manufacturing. We've heard from several witnesses that the current Clean Air Act permitting, especially the prevention of significant deterioration in the Title Five requirements, can add years to project timelines. And I'd like to hear your thoughts about Micron is building multiple large semiconductor fabrication facilities across the country. How can the Clean Air Act permitting timelines influence the schedule and the cost of these projects, while not necessarily achieving the desired goals?

Ashley Kunz: Thank you, Congressman. From this perspective, what we have seen is a lengthy environmental permitting and review process where we have duplicative reviews, in some cases. We have interagency coordination of up to tens of agencies, where at oftentimes we may receive conflicting guidance.

Read highlights of the exchange below:

Rep. Pfluger: Almost 80 million Americans voted for a new energy policy because the last administration failed there. So, Mr. Novak, thank you for being here. You're doing a good job, and we appreciate the fact that you're trying to provide affordable, reliable energy to every American, in direct opposition to what we saw the previous four years. Natural gas plays a huge role in this equation, and not just in homes, but also in managing costs for businesses. So I want to look at what EPCA has required DOE to do to ensure that any new standards are both technologically feasible as well as economically justified. So my first question, which I know you've touched on a little bit, but I'll give you some time to expand: How does DOE weigh the projected energy savings against the upfront costs that consumers will bear when these savings might be modest or indistinguishable?

Mr. Novak: I think that points out why the bill is before the committee, which is the idea to sharpen the assessment of that trade-off there between utility and the energy efficiency gained to the consumer. It's something that, at least in a lot of people's experience, seems to be a bit off. Part of it is that the calculus now includes some things that are quite broad. Social cost of carbon, for example, greenhouse gases, which is something a little bit broader and different than what is the energy consumption compared to the usage of this particular device, and what's the utility of the device.

Rep Pfluger: I'll move to federal facilities in Section 433 implementation of the Energy Independent Security Act, which requires phasing out fossil fuel use in newer or newly renovated federal buildings by 2030, so how is DOE approaching this requirement while ensuring that critical facilities, whether they be federal courthouses or VA facilities or military bases, that they can continue to operate reliably, number one, but also in a cost efficient manner?

Mr. Novak: It is a challenge, to be blunt, and it's a challenge just not in regard to the existing federal footprint, but the addition of any new federal facilities, where the requirement here is to basically be all electric. So this is one of the things, again, that points out what's motivating the bill here is to, again, get some flexibility here, so that the energy solution, both for the existing footprint as well as any new facilities, is something that takes into account local delivery options as well as design specs, delivery time frames, etc.

Rep. Pfluger: I'm worried about, again, military bases, VA hospitals, the facilities that are providing care and help to people, that you mandate a switch to electrification, which is not feasible. Would DOE support clarifying or updating Section 433 to provide flexibility for installations when natural gas remains the most reliable option?

(Reuters) – Panasonic aims to develop a new type of higher-capacity battery in about two years, potentially extending the driving range of electric vehicles in a groundbreaking advance for the Tesla supplier.

The Japanese company is working on eliminating the anode in batteries during the manufacturing stage to increase energy density through technology it says is likely to provide a “world-leading level” of capacity by the end of 2027.

If achieved, the improvement would lead to a 25% increase in battery capacity, thus boosting the driving range of Tesla’s most affordable sport-utility vehicle, the Model Y, by almost 90 miles (about 145 km), at current battery pack size, Panasonic said.

Alternatively, Panasonic could also use the technology to make lighter – and potentially cheaper – versions of batteries by keeping the current driving range and shrinking the battery pack size.

A company executive told reporters of the anode-free technology ahead of a presentation on Thursday by Shoichiro Watanabe, the technology chief at the group’s battery arm, Panasonic Energy.

This technology is also being pursued by multiple global battery producers.

Panasonic’s proposed design has no anode at the manufacturing stage. Instead, a lithium metal anode is formed in the battery after being charged for the first time. This would free up room for more active cathode materials — nickel, cobalt and aluminium — to boost capacity without changing the volume.

Panasonic said it also aims to reduce the proportion of nickel, which is relatively more expensive.

It was not clear whether the technology would help Tesla to lower prices and Panasonic declined to discuss specifics on manufacturing costs.

Reuters reported this month that Tesla’s U.S. market share dropped to its lowest in almost eight years in August as buyers chose electric vehicles from a growing stable of rivals over the ageing line-up offered by Elon Musk’s company.

The new policy and associated tariff revisions will require approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
“Large loads want answers now.
“Most data center projects you hear about in the news today are hundreds of megawatts or even gigawatts in scale.
I think we can comfortably consider those to be large loads,” Webber said.","Dive Brief:

The Southwest Power Pool board of directors has approved a policy guiding the integration and interconnection of high impact large loads, or HILLs, such as data centers and manufacturing facilities, the grid operator announced Tuesday.

SPP plans to establish a 90-day study-and-approval process for interconnecting large loads, and said its HILLs process “enables early detection of system constraints, improves coordination across entities and prepares operators for real-time impacts.”

Peak load in SPP is expected to increase from 56 GW to 105 GW in the next 10 years, according to minutes from the board’s Sept. 4 meeting, where the HILLs policy was adopted. The new policy and associated tariff revisions will require approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Dive Insight:

With U.S. electricity demand poised to grow significantly after decades of stagnation, grid operators are seeking ways to speed the interconnection of new resources and loads.

PJM Interconnection has launched a fast-track stakeholder process to develop rules for interconnecting data centers, and aims to file a proposal with FERC by the end of the year. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas is working to implement new rules regarding data center interconnection that would require loads of 75 MW or more to participate in demand response programs.

“We’re striving to stay ahead of the game,” SPP Vice President for Engineering Casey Cathey said in a statement. “Large loads want answers now. They are motivated to invest and are looking for opportunities to connect to the grid now.”

The HILLs process will apply to interconnecting large loads that will be paired with new generation that is “either on-site or nearby,” SPP said, or for interconnecting large loads with current or planned generation. Load interconnections will be accelerated through integrated design, study, registration and operations.

“For developers, market efficiency and transparency are key benefits,” the grid operator said. The new approach supports “faster market entry, enhances price signals and allows these loads and supporting generation to have more confidence in expected costs and timelines.”

The HILLs policy was approved by the SPP board as Revision Request 696.

“This framework will maintain grid reliability and operational efficiency while balancing cost-effectiveness with expedited market deployment timelines,” according to the submission form.

According to RR 696, a load may be considered a High Impact Large Load if the point of interconnection is less than or equal to 69 kV and the HILL peak demand is greater than or equal to 10 MW, or if the interconnection point is greater than 69 kV and the HILL peak demand is greater than or equal to 50 MW.

As various grid operators study new large loads and the availability of grid resources to serve them, data center developers may find opportunity in building out smaller operations, Digital Power Optimization CEO Andrew Webber said in an email. The company, founded by Webber, builds and manages data centers.

“Most data center projects you hear about in the news today are hundreds of megawatts or even gigawatts in scale. I think we can comfortably consider those to be large loads,” Webber said. But smaller projects “can slip below those thresholds and perhaps create a smoother, less costly interconnection process.”

If a data center developer approaches a utility asking for 500 MW of firm power, it could cost $100 million in system upgrades and take five years or more, Webber said.

“If you ask that same entity for 35 MW or 58 MW (or whatever amount they have readily available) it can be much faster and without such significant system upgrade costs,” he said. “We think this is a massive overlooked opportunity.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/_OhCkyLeK0etZL5KhDYDlutR9NLD4fnmRvMz3c7yQjE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjE5NDgwMDE5XzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-09-18 02:59:00.557150

As we now know, certain initiatives—including solar and wind energy technologies—took a large hit. This was due to the OBBBA significantly expediting phaseouts of clean energy tax credits established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

Fortunately, other technologies that support thermal energy storage will continue to offer both environmental benefits from the technology itself and the benefits of tax credits. These solutions include mineral fiber ceiling panel options that harness the capability of phase change materials (PCM) to regulate room temperature without electricity or other power sources.

Given the impact of OBBBA, energy saving ceiling solutions may have an expanded role to play in building design, operation, and management decisions. One reason for this is that, tax incentive or not, the motivation for facility builders, owners, and operators to advance sustainability and decarbonization goals remains unchanged. The drive of a company or organization to be environmentally responsible will not vanish along with certain energy tax incentives. Still, the availability of tax credits can be an important consideration when looking at the overall design—and related budget—of a new construction or renovation project. Once again, this is where energy saving ceiling solutions can help.

How Energy Saving Ceilings Work

The built environment’s drive to decarbonize, save energy, and employ thoughtful use of resources presents architects and designers with a new set of requirements for new construction or renovations. Adding to the challenges is facility owners prioritizing elevated indoor environmental quality (IEQ) for occupants. This can mean everything from maintaining comfortable temperatures to achieving proper acoustics. These mandatories have turned the attention of architects and designers to ceiling panels with PCM. In addition to thermal energy storage allowing passive heating and cooling to keep a space at a comfortable 72 degrees F., these panels offer strong acoustical performance.

Although the use of PCM technology in ceiling panels is a recent innovation, its roots go back centuries. Consider an old-fashioned “icebox.” The ice (PCM) absorbs heat to keep the box contents cool. During this process the ice changes to a liquid, which will again solidify at temperatures of 32 degrees F., releasing heat.

To understand energy saving ceiling panels, think of the “ice” as PCM (basically comprised of salt and water) encased in the ceiling panel. When temperatures rise in a space with energy saving ceilings installed, the crystalized PCM gradually dissolves. During this process, it absorbs and stores heat to passively cool the space. As that space cools stored heat is released, the PCM in the ceiling panels re-solidifies, and the space warms up. Heat transfer happens around 72 degrees F., making energy saving ceilings effective for cooling and heating—supporting thermal comfort without mechanics, energy expenditure, or fossil fuels.

According to research estimates measured in laboratory tests, ceiling panels with PCM technology can reduce energy costs and consumption by as much as 15% (results may vary). In addition, energy saving ceilings offer advantages including:

Reduced reliance on fossil-fuel powered HVAC systems

Less wear on HVAC systems, an alternative to more costly HVAC system upgrades or replacements

Improved thermal comfort

Ability to enhance IEQ with features like acoustical sound blocking and absorption

Easy installation, little-to-no maintenance

Energy saving ceiling products also fit into the thermal comfort portion of the WELL Building Standard and can contribute to many LEED credits, including Materials & Resources, IEQ, and Energy & Atmosphere credits. Moreover, energy saving ceilings align with two key impact areas established with the recently introduced LEED v5—decarbonization that targets reduction in operational and embodied carbon and other emissions, and quality of life improvements in health, well-being, resilience, and equity for building occupants and their communities.

Up to 50% in Tax Credits Available Under the Inflation Reduction Act

In addition to energy-saving, lower maintenance, and other cost benefits realized over the lifetime of their use, PCM ceiling panels qualify for certain tax credits. Projects utilizing energy-saving ceiling panels may qualify for Investment Tax Credit (ITC) 48E. Because of their thermal energy storage properties, most projects using PCM ceiling panels may qualify for:

Up to 40% federal tax credit

Additional 10% tax credit if the project is deployed in an “Energy Community.” (i.e., a Brownfields site or fossil-fuel-dependent community)

As part of the process, it’s advisable to consult your tax advisor to confirm qualification of your project. In addition, talking with the ceiling manufacturer might reveal additional opportunities to help maximize tax savings opportunities when investing in energy-saving ceilings for a project. For example, when installing a ceiling, in addition to the energy saving ceiling panels, it’s possible the associated grid, trim, and labor may also qualify for tax credits under ITC 48E. Because these panels are made in the USA of domestic and global content, they also meet a requirement for additional tax savings.* Qualifying energy saving ceiling projects include those of taxpayers and non-taxpaying entities and span multiple sectors, including public, private, education, and 501 (c)(3) charitable organization.

From Building Optimization to Bottom-Line Improvements

In June, energy saving ceiling products were introduced into a leading energy-modeling resource (the IES Virtual Environmental software), used by engineers and architects to optimize whole-building performance. To become part of the software, these ceilings underwent a rigorous validation process involving hundreds of modeling studies. The inclusion of the PCM ceiling panels in this software further demonstrates their potential to support decarbonization priorities and offers a strong indication of the longevity they will enjoy as an energy-saving solution.

From government, corporate headquarters and nonprofit offices to healthcare, schools and college facilities—the applications in which energy saving ceilings can impact a building’s environmental objectives, energy-reduction criteria, IEQ requirements, and the bottom line are expansive. Moreover, the ramping up of energy saving ceiling validation and adoption couldn’t be better timed, as their use could help fill some of the “budgetary gap” left by OBBBA’s phaseout of tax credits on other energy technologies.

“As a doctor, I’ve seen the human cost of air pollution,” Ruiz said.
Morrison called climate pollution a public health emergency and accused the administration of siding with corporate interests.
“Rolling back the endangerment finding would worsen air pollution, pollution we found evidence of in children’s brains that appear as early signs of Alzheimer’s disease,” she said.
“Rescinding the endangerment finding and denying the link between pollution and climate change is a giveaway to polluters.","WASHINGTON — Congressman Raul Ruiz joined fellow lawmakers and health professionals outside the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, Sept. 10, to oppose the Trump administration’s effort to repeal the Environmental Protection Agency’s endangerment finding, warning the move would threaten public health in communities across the country and especially in the Imperial Valley.

The endangerment finding, established by the EPA, determined that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare and gave the agency authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate them. Speakers said repealing it would erase decades of progress on air quality and leave Americans defenseless against worsening pollution and climate impacts.

Ruiz, who represents the Valley in California’s 25th District, said his medical background shows him the human toll of poor air quality.

“We are here because the health and safety of the American people are under attack by the Trump administration’s dangerous attempt to roll back the EPA’s endangerment finding,” Ruiz said.

He described how rising greenhouse gas levels drive heat waves, wildfires and smog that worsen asthma, heart disease and lung disease.

“As a doctor, I’ve seen the human cost of air pollution,” Ruiz said. “They intensify extreme weather, putting families at risk. And as the days get hotter, smog gets worse, triggering asthma, heart disease and lung disease. And I saw this up close during my years as an emergency physician in the Coachella Valley.”

Ruiz focused on the region he represents. “Children in the Imperial Valley, inside the Imperial County, have the highest rate of asthma hospitalization in the whole state of California. And on some days, residents are forced to breathe pollution levels two to three times above what’s considered safe,” Ruiz said.

He pointed to long-term health consequences. “Studies have shown that the people who live in high air polluted areas, like near congestion and traffic, die 10 years earlier than people who don’t live in high air polluted areas,” Ruiz said.

Ruiz warned that repealing the finding would strip the EPA of authority to regulate greenhouse gases, erasing protections for vulnerable groups.

“If the endangerment finding is rolled back, the EPA will lose its ability to regulate greenhouse gas pollution under the Clean Air Act. And that would erase decades of progress, worsen air quality and leave vulnerable people defenseless. Vulnerable people like seniors and children,” Ruiz said.

“As physicians, we are taught a simple rule. First, do no harm. And this rollback would do enormous harm. It would increase pollution, worsen health outcomes and cost lives. So instead of turning back the clock, we need to move forward,” he continued. “That means investing in clean energy, building resilient infrastructure, and protecting workers in their workplace and the communities on the front line of pollution and climate change. And we must base our policies on science, not ideology. The health of our children, our seniors, our workers and future generations depends on it.”

Congresswoman Kelly Morrison of Minnesota’s 3rd District echoed Ruiz’s warnings, saying the proposal would take away one of the nation’s greatest tools against climate pollution. “This administration is enacting policies that increase emissions at a time when we need to urgently decrease them. And right now, they’re working to take away one of our greatest tools to protect against air pollution and fight climate change by repealing the endangerment finding. This would be a disaster for our nation,” Morrison said.

She described recent smoke-filled summers in Minnesota as an example of how climate change is worsening air quality. “Just this summer in my home state of Minnesota, people couldn’t even be outside because the wildfire smoke was so bad. You couldn’t breathe the air. We experienced among the worst air quality in the entire world and broke records for the state’s longest ever air quality alert from wildfires,” Morrison said.

Morrison called climate pollution a public health emergency and accused the administration of siding with corporate interests.

“Taking away our right to breathe clean air, letting fossil fuel companies dump more toxic pollution into our air that accelerate climate disasters, fuel deadly heat waves, and worsen chronic disease, increasing climate pollution — which we know will lead to more asthma attacks, more ER visits, more heat strokes, more deaths,” she said.

Dr. Lisa Patel, pediatric hospitalist and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, said doctors are already treating the impacts of pollution and climate change on children.

“Over Labor Day weekend, I worked 48 hours in the hospital with a heat advisory in effect. Our labor ward filled up with mothers in preterm labor and other medical complications. Our NICU had to makeshift extra spots to accommodate more infants,” Patel said.

She cited projections showing that children face more frequent disasters than past generations. “A child born today can expect to experience twice as many wildfires, three times as many flooding events, and 36 times as many heat waves compared to someone born in 1960,” Patel said.

Patel linked the rollback to increased illness. “Rolling back the endangerment finding would worsen air pollution, pollution we found evidence of in children’s brains that appear as early signs of Alzheimer’s disease,” she said. “Our message is clear, protect our health, protect our children, protect the endangerment finding.”

Cara Cook, deputy director of the Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments, said nurses see the effects daily. “Nurses are on the front lines of protecting health. We care for those most impacted by pollution in ERs, in oncology departments, in cardiology clinics, in urgent cares, and at schools. Nurses see the human toll of climate change every day. More asthma attacks, more ER visits, more people struggling to breathe,” Cook said.

She said repealing the finding would benefit polluters at the expense of families.

“Rescinding the endangerment finding and denying the link between pollution and climate change is a giveaway to polluters. Paving the way for more fossil fuel emissions, more toxic pollution, and more human suffering from deadly heat waves, worsening chronic health conditions, and extreme weather disasters. The health of our communities is on the line and we cannot afford to move backwards,” Cook said.

Dr. Alice Chen, primary care physician and board chair of Health Care Without Harm, said frontline communities would be most affected.

“My patients are largely working class. They care for our children. They clean our offices, construct our homes, cook our meals. Many have elderly patients, young children, are pregnant, have diabetes or asthma, and they’re at higher risk of health problems from air pollution and climate change. They don’t have the resources of the ultra wealthy who are building climate change bunkers as if they don’t rely on other people and a healthy planet,” Chen said.

Chen said health systems are recognizing climate change as a direct threat.

“The number of executive leaders at Health Care Without Harm’s partner hospitals who recognize climate change as a risk to their operations has grown from 14 percent in 2020 to 46 percent in 2024. It is no wonder that hospitals around the country are setting goals to get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions, to build climate resilience, and to protect patients using science to guide them the same way they use science every day to save lives,” Chen said.

Ruiz closed the press conference by thanking those who stood in the rain to attend. “They’re so dedicated because this issue is real. It costs human lives, and we’re going to fight tooth and nail to make sure that we protect our environment so that we can protect people and their health,” he said.",https://calexicochronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ruiz-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-09-18 11:02:06.785330

Rupert Mayer, a co-founder of Bright Saver, a California-based nonprofit partner that helps states and individuals set up plug-in solar systems, indicated at Wednesday’s press conference that there are 4 million portable solar units.
The portable solar panels also enabled freedom and independence in one’s backyard without government interference, Mayer said.
He said Bright Saver was talking to lawmakers across blue and red states to advance portable solar and help consumers experience its benefits.
In August, Pennsylvania legislators also began considering such a bill to facilitate widespread deployment of balcony solar.","While Vermonters look for ways to lower their energy costs, access to plug-in and portable solar panels could lower bills and carbon emissions, according to a new campaign launched in Montpelier on Wednesday.

Balcony solar, or miniature panels that can be set up on a patio or lawn, have gained popularity across Europe, and now Vermont is angling to become the second state to duplicate such a program. Sen. Anne Watson, D/P-Washington, chair of the Senate Natural Resources and Energy Committee, plans to introduce a bill during the 2026 legislative session to make plug-in solar panels available to Vermonters who can’t install a traditional net metering system, she said at a press conference.

“My goal is to make it as easy as possible for people to purchase and plug in one of these devices and start saving money, while also getting the electric utilities the information that they need to meet their own requirements,” Watson said.

The bill would propose removing current requirements like interconnection agreements with utilities and registration, as is currently required with solar installations 10 times as large, Watson said. Residents would only need to notify their electric companies that they had such a system under her bill, Watson said.

“Seeing Utah pass a bill like this unanimously, and in a bipartisan way, that support underscored how doable I think this bill is going to be,” Watson said. “It’s time for us to get out of the way, cut that red tape, and make it easy for Vermonters to access affordable solar.”

Such a project could make renewable energy more available to all Vermonters, according to Ben Edgerly Walsh, a lobbyist for the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, a state-based environmental advocacy group. While 20,000 Vermont families have benefitted from household solar through the state’s net metering program, Walsh said, hundreds of thousands have been left out, including those who rent or live in condos or mobile homes.

“One part of the solar market hardest to open up is renters, and people who can’t afford to have solar on their property,” Walsh said Monday.

But these smaller units, capped at 1.2 kilowatts under the proposed legislation, can be plugged into a normal wall outlet where electrons can start flowing into the house, helping to power appliances and energize light switches. They can also be connected to a battery that can save the energy for when it’s needed. Walsh estimated it could power about a fifth of a typical household, or save about $20 on a $100 electric bill.

The small systems are also more affordable because they don’t require the same installation costs and the logistics of connecting to the grid. One unit could cost Vermonters $1,500 to $2,000, Walsh estimated, which could be paid back in about three years before adding free power to a household for the life of the system.

In Germany, these systems now help power at least 1 million households, but those estimates could be three times as high, according to reporting by The New York Times. Rupert Mayer, a co-founder of Bright Saver, a California-based nonprofit partner that helps states and individuals set up plug-in solar systems, indicated at Wednesday’s press conference that there are 4 million portable solar units.

The portable solar panels also enabled freedom and independence in one’s backyard without government interference, Mayer said. He said Bright Saver was talking to lawmakers across blue and red states to advance portable solar and help consumers experience its benefits.

“It should be fairly non-controversial,” Walsh said of the initiative. “It just requires cutting a little red tape in a few places to make it possible.”

While such a move isn’t as precedent-setting as Vermont’s Climate Superfund Act or its attempt at a Clean Heat Standard, the state could be among the first to support balcony solar.

In Utah, a bipartisan bill passed unanimously this year to reduce restrictions and expand access to this small-scale, affordable solar option. Utah Republican Gov. Spencer J. Cox signed the bill into law in March. In August, Pennsylvania legislators also began considering such a bill to facilitate widespread deployment of balcony solar.

But while Utah’s bill became a success story, Vermont could see pushback.

“The Trump administration, they’ve doubled down on fossil fuels and they’re really doing all they can to upend the clean energy job sector,” said Johanna Miller, the energy and climate program director at the Vermont Natural Resources Council. But Miller said the 2020 Global Warming Solutions Act says the state has an obligation and an opportunity to help Vermonters move away from the burning of fossil fuels, the largest contributor to climate change.

“The sad truth is that climate and energy policy is one of the most polarized areas in a very polarized political environment,” Walsh said. But he added there are no subsidies for this program — the legislation only asked to make it easier to install these systems without requiring net metering or grid connection.

“For all the climate policies you can imagine us working on, this one is certainly the best set up for bipartisan support,” Walsh said.

Vermont recently lost a major solar investment when the federal government slashed $62.5 million the state was promised by the Solar For All program, following President Donald Trump signing his One Big Beautiful Bill in July.

While such a small-scale program can’t replace the massive funding package, Walsh said it’s another good way for Vermonters who have had trouble accessing solar to get a piece of the clean energy transition for themselves.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/balcony-solar-5-crop.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 03:58:14.131117

The principles, developed alongside dozens of labor, public interest, and environmental organizations, marks the first time those groups have clearly defined what climate investments should, and should not, look like.

Read the Principles for Climate Solutions Investments: https://www.sierraclub.org/articles/2025/09/principles-financial-institutions-credible-investments-climate-solutions

The recommendations go beyond merely asking investors to support clean energy technologies, green manufacturing, and zero-emissions transportation, detailing how investors should also pursue opportunities that support community climate resilience, including investments in green, affordable housing, as part of any comprehensive climate strategy. In the process, these investments can help create green jobs in local communities.

“Climate change is the single greatest systemic risk facing our economy, and pension funds are on the front lines. Investing in the low-carbon transition is necessary to protect pensions from these risks. People’s retirement savings should not prop up polluting infrastructure that endangers the planet and pension benefits — it should fund investments that protect financial security, enable dignified retirements, and help people retire into safe, liveable, and economically resilient communities. Our guiding principles set a clear standard: credible climate investments must cut emissions, build resilient communities, and protect nature. Investors have a responsibility to put workers’ long-term security ahead of short-term profits,” said Jessye Waxman, Campaign Advisor in the Sierra Club’s Sustainable Finance campaign.

SETTING A NEW STANDARD

With these principles, climate and labor groups are setting a new standard for what constitutes credible investments in climate solutions. Some of the recommendations go beyond investor guidance coming out of places like Europe, where frameworks such as the EU Taxonomy allows some investments in gas infrastructure to qualify as “transitional” or “green” financing, even though such projects risk locking in future carbon emissions. The principles emphasize that investments in climate solutions must:

Prioritize real-world decarbonization by financing projects and companies driving measurable, real-world emissions reductions.

Facilitate the energy transition by building solar and wind capacity, as well as improvements in grid infrastructure, energy storage, and energy efficiency.

Protect nature and biodiversity, given that over half the world’s GDP depends on healthy ecosystems.

Support community climate resilience, including green housing, community adaptation, and pollution reduction, to protect workers and their communities.

Support economic resilience, including seeking out regional investments, creating green jobs, and supporting globally equitable climate finance.

Advance a just transition by supporting worker protections, investing in Indigenous stewardship, and prioritizing communities most harmed by climate change.

Provide credible transition finance by financing high-emitting companies only if they are implementing a credible transition plan.

The principles clarify that investments in carbon offsets, unbundled renewable energy credits, carbon capture and storage, gas infrastructure, data centers, and artificial intelligence, among other things, are not credible climate solutions investments.

QUOTES FROM ENDORSING ORGANIZATIONS

The principles are endorsed by 43 organizations, including the Labor Network for Sustainability, Action Center on Race and the Economy (ACRE), Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund, Public Citizen, and Third Act.

“Workers deserve benefits that benefit them. By making sustainable investments, pension funds can not only safeguard retirements, but safeguard our future against climate catastrophe by investing in clean energy, good jobs, and a just transition. Pensions are always about protecting workers' futures, and these principles ensure that investments go toward building a future that benefits all working people,” said Sydney Ghazarian, Strategic Campaigns Director, Labor Network for Sustainability.

“The principles lay out what public pensions need to do to meet the current moment and protect workers from systemic risks like climate change and economic inequality. In addition to clean energy and resilience, pensions should focus on systems-level solutions that include infrastructure, affordable housing, community development, credible transition finance, and much more,"" said Alex Martin, Climate Finance Policy Director at Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund.

One area of research has focused on the reservoirs of the Andean region, with five of Argentina’s hydroelectric power plants on the Limay River considered as a case study. These are the:

Alicurá (1000MW and capacity factor of 25%).

Piedra del Águila (1400MW and CF of 45%)

Pichi Picún Leufú (250MW and CF of 48%)

El Chocón (1200MW and CF of 29%)

Arroyito (120MW and CF of 68%)

Collectively generating 12,830GWh annually, these projects have an installed capacity of 3970MW, yielding an overall capacity factor of 37% (equivalent to less than 9 hours of operation per day).

As Dr Luis Juanico and Martin Ducos explain, in practice, “their effective generation capacity is significantly constrained by the availability of water resources, which are highly variable and generally scarce – a characteristic of all mountain rivers”.

Although designed to operate continuously, the average annual capacity factors of these plants reportedly range from 25% to 50% and typically operate to meet peak demand for 6 to 12 hours per day.

“This reflects a significant idle capacity – ranging from 50% to 75%, or 12 to 18 hours daily – in both the power transformation system and the National Interconnected System transmission line,” Juanico and Ducos add.

Furthermore, generation is influenced by seasonal and climatic variations such as a recent 35% reduction in generation at Piedra del Águila – driven by a sharp 55% decrease in the flow of the Collón Curá River, a tributary of the Limay.

Juanico and Ducos put forward two proposals in their research. The first doubles installed capacity by adding PV power equivalent to hydroelectric capacity, increasing energy production to 23,707GWh with an investment of US$1.925 billion. The second proposal aims for a higher capacity factor by doubling the PV capacity and adding a four-hour battery storage system. This results in a 92% capacity factor, increasing energy production to 31,899GWh, and requiring an investment of US$4.431 billion.

Although this is a significant increase in cost, the authors add that in comparison installing two nuclear reactors (1800MW each) to generate a similar amount of energy would require an investment and construction timeframe eleven times greater.

Efficient Cooling Source. The reservoirs offer an abundant supply of crystal-clear, low-mineral water with an annual average temperature of 11°C, significantly cooler than the 21°C average of the Paraná River near Buenos Aires.

Secure and Isolated Locations. The remoteness of the hydroelectric sites, combined with existing security measures, ensures high levels of protection.

Clean Air Environment. The absence of soot and pollution guarantees ideal operating conditions for sensitive AI equipment.

According to the authors, both proposals have clear benefits of abundant solar resources – the Andean Patagonia region boasts a high solar resource potential, especially during the summer months when water availability for hydroelectric generation is low; plus low-cost land – the land adjacent to the reservoirs is available at minimal expense due to its remote

desert location.

The authors also believe this synergy could help mitigate Argentina’s frequent summer electricity shortages. In addition, the high modularity and simplicity of solar PV farms allow for rapid deployment and potential operation in under a year because complex infrastructure, such as power stations and high-voltage lines, is already in place.

The proposal could also be replicated in other Andean basins in Argentina, such as the reservoirs in the provinces of Mendoza (Los Reyunos, El Tigre, Agua del Toro, Nihuil I, II, III, and Potrerillos), San Juan (Ullum, Caracoles, Punta Negra, and La Olla), Salta (Cabra Corral), among others. Furthermore, Juanico and Ducos say it could also encompass other Latin American countries, many of which have hydroelectric plants at the foothills of the Andes with significant

solar resources.

Ecuadorian experience

A similar study has been looking at the potential for co-locating FPVs with existing hydropower plants in Ecuador.

As a country that is heavily reliant on hydropower, and with approximately 80% of its electricity generated by hydroelectricity in 2023, Ecuador is facing energy challenges, particularly when the availability of hydro plants is reduced during the dry seasons. And although planned blackouts have been implemented in various provinces to conserve water supplies in reservoirs since October 2023, this hasn’t prevented unforeseen blackouts. A nationwide outage on 19 June 2024 lasted over three hours. Caused by a failure in the Milagro–Zhoray transmission line, it was compounded by a storm that affected two of Ecuador’s largest hydropower plants – Coca Codo Sinclair and Agoyán – during which sediment washed into the facilities, forcing the turbines to shut down.

As Rodriguez-Gallegos et al state in the journal Solar: “Ecuador’s heavy reliance on hydropower for electricity generation, combined with recent blackouts caused by prolonged dry seasons, underscores the importance of diversifying energy sources. The integration of FPVs with HPPs offers a promising opportunity to enhance energy security by reducing dependency on a single energy source.”

Their findings reveal that out of 70 HPPs in Ecuador, 11 present favourable conditions for large-scale FPV deployment. Among these were the 40MW Cumbayá project which exhibited the most suitable conditions, supporting a maximum FPV capacity of 17MWp. Marcel Laniado de Wind HPP (213 MW) and Mazar HPP (170 MW) were also identified as optimal candidates, each with potential FPV capacities equal to their installed hydropower capacities.

Furthermore, the authors add their results show that FPV systems can not only contribute additional electricity to the grid but also improve HPP performance by reducing water evaporation from reservoirs and maintaining generation capacity during dry seasons, when solar irradiation is

typically higher.

And although their study primarily aims to provide scientific evidence on the potential of FPV-HPP co-location, the authors hope it can also ‘serve as a springboard for future research’, helping to guide Ecuadorian government authorities and investors in adopting FPV technology to strengthen the country’s energy infrastructure.

Benefits of floating photovoltaics

Rodriguez-Gallegos et al give an insight into the benefits of floating photovoltaics when installed at existing hydropower plants.

Infrastructure efficiency

Since HPPs are already fully connected to the electrical grid, the same infrastructure can be used by FPV systems to feed electricity into transmission lines. This reduces FPV installation costs and optimises the use of existing grid capacity by increasing the total energy output. Additionally, other shared infrastructure, such as access roads, can be utilised for both HPP and FPV systems, simplifying installation and maintenance.

Water conservation

FPV systems partially block sunlight from reaching the water surface, reducing evaporation, helping to retain more water in reservoirs which can then be used to generate electricity during times of need.

Seasonal synergy

HPPs often face challenges during prolonged dry seasons due to reduced water availability in their reservoirs. FPV systems can help offset this by generating more electricity during dry periods, which are typically associated with high solar irradiance. Conversely, during the rainy season, while FPV energy production may decline, HPPs can generate ample electricity due to increased water availability. This seasonal complementarity enhances overall energy reliability.

Increased capacity

Expanding the energy production of HPPs often requires constructing additional dams, which can raise environmental concerns. While FPV systems also have environmental impacts that must be assessed, they may offer a more environmentally friendly alternative for boosting total energy production by leveraging existing water surfaces without the need for new infrastructure.

Environmental benefits

By shading parts of the water, FPV systems can reduce or prevent algae blooms, which can improve water quality and the overall ecological conditions of the reservoir.",https://www.waterpowermagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/09/shutterstock_2591400633.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 07:59:48.487184

(AP) — When Lena Astilli first bought her home outside of Denver, she had no interest in matching the wall-to-wall green lawns that dominated her block. She wanted native plants, the kind she remembered and loved as a child in New Mexico, that require far less water and have far more to offer insects and birds that are in decline.

“A monoculture of Kentucky bluegrass is not helping anybody,” Astilli said. After checking several nurseries before finding one that had what she wanted, she has slowly been reintroducing those native plants to her yard.

Though Astilli was replacing grass just last month, it remains ubiquitous in American yards. It’s a tradition that began more than two centuries ago with the landed gentry copying the landscaping of Europe’s wealthy, and grass now dominates as the familiar planting outside everything from single-family homes to apartment complexes to office parks and retail malls.

“In the absence of simple directions and guidance about what to do with their landscape, they default to lawn because it’s easy,” said Mark Richardson, executive director of the Ecological Landscape Alliance, a nonprofit that promotes sustainable landscaping.

Yet that grass is problematic in deserts and any place with limited water, such as the American West, where it won’t do well without irrigation. As climate change makes the world hotter and triggers more extreme weather, including drought, thirsty expanses of groomed emerald are taxing freshwater supplies that are already under stress.

Enter xeriscaping, landscaping aimed at vastly reducing the need for irrigation, including by using native or drought-tolerant plants. (Denver Water says it coined the term in 1981 by combining “landscape” with the Greek word “xeros,” which means dry, to encourage reduced water use.)

Reasons to think about ripping up that lawn

The average U.S. family uses 320 gallons (1,211 liters) of water every day, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Nearly a third of that is devoted to outdoor water use. It’s even more for people with thirsty plants in dry places.

“Potable water is going to become harder and harder to come by,” said Richardson. “Lawn reduction is a fantastic way to limit the use of water in the landscape.”

His group isn’t keen on grass even in areas like the Northeast or Midwest, where drought and water use aren’t as problematic as in the West. Less lawn means fewer pesticides and fertilizers washing into rivers. More native plants mean more rest stops and nesting grounds for pollinators like birds, butterflies and bees, which have faced serious population declines in recent decades.

“We can bring nature back into our urban and suburban areas,” said Haven Kiers, associate professor of landscape architecture at University of California-Davis. “Improving biodiversity, creating habitat is going to be a huge thing for the environment.”

It’s also better for the people using the yard, Kiers said.

“So many studies show that spending time in nature and gardening, all of this is really good for you,” Kiers said. “When they’re doing that, they’re not talking about mowing the lawn.”

Taking the first steps

Kiers says the only thing more intimidating than an expanse of lawn is an expanse of unplanted dirt. Her top recommendation: take it slowly. It also mitigates the cost, because she said paying someone to do it all at once can cost tens of thousands of dollars.

If you’ve got beds along the outside of the house, expand them. If you’ve got a path leading to the front door, put shrubs or flowers on either side of it. If you don’t have shade, plant a tree, and if you’ve got a tree already, create a bed around it. All of these steps reduce the lawn space.

There are also financial incentives and rebates in several states to make the transformation more affordable. Sometimes they’re offered by a city, county, state, water agency or local conservation organizations, so searching for the programs available with the municipalities and companies near you is a good place to start.

Looking for landscaping ideas? “If you want to see good examples of horticulture at its finest, visit a public garden,” Richardson said. Kiers recommended finding a master gardener or a community garden volunteer, because they’ll often provide expertise free of charge.

What’s in Lena’s yard?

Astilli, the Littleton homeowner, remade her backyard with native plants a few years ago, goldenrod, sunflowers, rudbeckia, purple poppy mallow, Rocky Mountain bee plant and more. Some green lawn remains for her dog and child to romp.

Late this summer, she was getting her hands dirty converting the front yard to xeriscaping. With the help of Restorative Landscape Design and its owner, Eryn Murphy, Astilli was replacing grass with plants like bee balm, evening primrose, scarlet gilia, prairie dropseed and tall thimbleweed.

In a break from the work, Murphy reeled off a few of the different possible looks for low-water landscaping: a gravel garden with perennials, lush prairie, a crevice or rock garden with tiny plants growing in the stone features, a cactus garden.

“Really the sky is the limit in terms of your creativity and your aesthetic,” she said. “It’s just about using plants that are supposed to be here.”

Murphy said an ever-drier West due to climate change will require people to “do something” as lawns become less and less viable.

The Cook Government said the plan is central to positioning Western Australia as a renewable energy powerhouse, while phasing out coal generation and supporting the growth of new industries.

It is designed to expand network capacity, power Strategic Industrial Areas (SIAs), and strengthen the State’s economic base.

Energy and Decarbonisation Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson said the plan will underpin WA’s future energy needs and create opportunities for local manufacturers.

“The SWIS Transmission Plan is our blueprint for infrastructure upgrades that will support our energy transition and ensure WA becomes a renewable energy powerhouse,” she said.

“The Cook Government is also backing our manufacturing sector. I will issue new Directions to Western Power, Synergy, and Horizon Power to ensure Western Australian businesses and workers benefit from the pipeline of work that will flow from the SWIS upgrade for years to come.”

The Directions, issued under the Government Trading Enterprises Act 2023, will require utilities to design tenders in ways that give local businesses genuine opportunities to compete and win, aiming to increase WA-based manufacturing.

The plan will be rolled out in three phases. The first phase will deliver upgrades at the Kwinana SIA and Western Trade Coast, the Coolangatta Industrial Estate, and Kemerton SIA, unlocking 1,500 megawatts to support industry expansion.

The Coolangatta project is seen as vital in backing the Collie Just Transition. Phase two will cover Chittering, Moora, Collie, and areas around metropolitan Perth, while phase three will expand the network to facilitate new green industries and economic diversification.

Minister Sanderson said the transmission upgrades would create lasting benefits. “We’ve taken our long-term vision for the SWIS and mapped the transmission needed to deliver it,” she said.

Utilities directed to do more to support local industry in procurement

Transmission expansion will unlock over two gigawatts of renewable energy generation prior to 2030

The Cook Government has released a comprehensive plan to upgrade the State's main power grid and boost local content to create quality jobs and business opportunities for Western Australians.

The South West Interconnected System (SWIS) Transmission Plan is the blueprint to build the power grid needed to support the State's clean energy transition to make Western Australia a renewable energy powerhouse.

The plan will expand network capacity, power Strategic Industrial Areas (SIAs), and drive economic growth, to benefit all Western Australians now, and well into the future.

The result is a backbone that will enable coal generation to be phased out, support the growth of new industries that will diversify and strengthen WA's economy, and enable the decarbonisation and electrification of existing industries.

Announced with the plan's release, Energy and Decarbonisation Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson will issue Directions to Western Power, Synergy, and Horizon Power under the Government Trading Enterprises Act 2023 that will drive local content procurement.

Designed to expand manufacturing in WA to make more things here, the Directions will require the utilities to design tenders in a way that gives local businesses a real chance to compete and win.

The plan takes a three-phased approach to upgrading and expanding the SWIS.

Phase one upgrades include the Kwinana SIA and Western Trade Coast, Coolangatta Industrial Estate, and Kemerton SIA, to make a combined 1,500 megawatts available to support future industry growth.

The Coolangatta Industrial Estate is a crucial component to support the Collie Just Transition.

Phase two projects include Chittering, Moora, Collie, and around metropolitan Perth.

Phase Three will expand Western Power's network to support economic diversification through the development of new green industries.

Some oil companies not only invest in energy efficiency for their buildings but use solar or wind to power their wells.","Editor’s note: This article, distributed by The Associated Press, was originally published on The Conversation website. The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.

Some major oil companies such as Shell and BP that once were touted as leading the way in clean energy investments are now pulling back from those projects to refocus on oil and gas production. Others, such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron, have concentrated on oil and gas but announced recent investments in carbon capture projects, as well as in lithium and graphite production for electric vehicle batteries.

National oil companies have also been investing in renewable energy. For example, Saudi Aramco has invested in clean energy while at the same time asserting that it’s unrealistic to phase out oil and gas entirely.

But the larger question is why oil companies would invest in clean energy at all, especially at a time when many federal clean energy incentives are being eliminated and climate science is being dismantled, at least in the United States.

Some answers depend on whom you ask. More traditional petroleum industry followers would urge the companies to keep focused on their core fossil fuel businesses to meet growing energy demand and corresponding near-term shareholder returns. Other shareholders and stakeholders concerned about sustainability and the climate — including an increasing number of companies with sustainability goals — would likely point out the business opportunities for clean energy to meet global needs.

Other answers depend on the particular company itself. Very small producers have different business plans than very large private and public companies. Geography and regional policies can also play a key role. And government-owned companies such as Saudi Aramco, Gazprom and the China National Petroleum Corp. control the majority of the world’s oil and gas resources with revenues that support their national economies.

Despite the relatively modest scale of investment in clean energy by oil and gas companies so far, there are several business reasons oil companies would increase their investments in clean energy over time.

The oil and gas industry has provided energy that has helped create much of modern society and technology, though those advances have also come with significant environmental and social costs. My own experience in the oil industry gave me insight into how at least some of these companies try to reconcile this tension and to make strategic portfolio decisions regarding what “green” technologies to invest in. Now the managing director and a professor of the practice at the Ray C. Anderson Center for Sustainable Business at Georgia Tech, I seek ways to eliminate the boundaries and identify mutually reinforcing innovations among business interests and environmental concerns.

Diversification and financial drivers

Just like financial advisers tell you to diversify your 401(k) investments, companies do so to weather different kinds of volatility, from commodity prices to political instability. Oil and gas markets are notoriously cyclical, so investments in clean energy can hedge against these shifts for companies and investors alike.

Clean energy can also provide opportunities for new revenue. Many customers want to buy clean energy, and oil companies want to be positioned to cash in as this transition occurs. By developing employees’ expertise and investing in emerging technologies, they can be ready for commercial opportunities in biofuels, renewable natural gas, hydrogen and other pathways that may overlap with their existing, core business competencies.

Fossil fuel companies have also found what other companies have: Clean energy can reduce costs. Some oil companies not only invest in energy efficiency for their buildings but use solar or wind to power their wells. And adding renewable energy to their activities can also lower the cost of investing in these companies.

Public pressure

All companies, including those in oil and gas, are under growing pressure to address climate change, from the public, from other companies with whom they do business and from government regulators — at least outside the U.S. For example, campaigns seeking to reduce investment in fossil fuels are increasing along with climate-related lawsuits. Government policies focused on both mitigating carbon emissions and enhancing energy independence are also making headway in some locations.

In response, many oil companies are reducing their own operational emissions and setting targets to offset or eliminate emissions from products that they sell — though many observers question the viability of these commitments. Other companies are investing in emerging technologies such as hydrogen and methods to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere

Some companies, such as BP and Equinor, have previously even gone so far as rebranding themselves and acquiring clean energy businesses. But those efforts have also been criticized as “greenwashing,” taking actions for public relations value rather than real results.

How far can this go?

It is even possible for a fossil fuel company to reinvent itself as a clean energy operation. Denmark’s Orsted — formerly known as Danish Oil and Natural Gas — transitioned from fossil fuels to become a global leader in offshore wind. The company, whose majority owner is the Danish government, made the shift, however, with the help of significant public and political support.

But most large oil companies aren’t likely to completely reinvent themselves anytime soon. Making that change requires leadership, investor pressure, customer demand and shifts in government policy, such as putting a price or tax on carbon emissions.

To show students in my sustainability classes how companies’ choices affect both the environment and the industry as a whole, I use the MIT Fishbanks simulation. Students run fictional fishing companies competing for profit. Even when they know the fish population is finite, they overfish, leading to the collapse of the fishery and its businesses. Short-term profits cause long-term disaster for the fishery and the businesses that depend on it.

The metaphor for oil and gas is clear: As fossil fuels continue to be extracted and burned, they release planet-warming emissions, harming the planet as a whole. They also pose substantial business risks to the oil and gas industry itself.

Yet students in a recent class showed me that a more collective way of thinking may be possible. Teams voluntarily reduced their fishing levels to preserve long-term business and environmental sustainability, and they even cooperated with their competitors. They did so without in-game regulatory threats, shareholder or customer complaints, or lawsuits.

Their shared understanding that the future of their own fishing companies was at stake makes me hopeful that this type of leadership may take hold in real companies and the energy system as a whole. But the question remains about how fast that change can happen, amid the accelerating global demand for more energy along with the increasing urgency and severity of climate change and its effects.

But in the Inland Empire, many of the region’s largest employers have already secured major solar systems in recent years, underscoring both the benefits and the stakes.

From Loma Linda University Health’s new two-megawatt microgrid to Esri’s campus-wide rooftop arrays and Kaiser Permanente’s solar-plus-storage hospital system in Ontario, institutions are betting on clean energy for predictable costs, resilience and sustainability.

Why it matters: Their investments highlight what’s at risk for smaller adopters as federal and state incentives shrink. With new federal legislation reshaping incentives, projects like these highlight the value of local, reliable power that can cut costs and keep running during emergencies.

Case study: Loma Linda University Health

Loma Linda University Health has unveiled a renewable microgrid system that will power its Faculty Medical Clinics with clean, reliable energy while reducing costs and supporting long-term sustainability.

After three years of planning and 18 months of construction, the system became fully operational on Aug. 22. It includes 3,622 solar panels capable of generating up to two megawatts of power and a one-megawatt Tesla battery that can store excess energy and provide up to six hours of emergency backup power.

Installed atop the P4 parking garage and above physician parking, the panels also provide shade and support 10 electric vehicle charging stations.

With the microgrid, the clinics can generate 87 percent of their daily electricity needs, saving an estimated $500,000 to $1.5 million annually depending on utility rates. The locked-in energy contract will provide consistent pricing at 15 cents per kilowatt hour for the next 30 years, compared to current Southern California Edison rates of 17 to 24 cents.

“Our solar panel infrastructure strengthens our ability to care for the community, even during emergencies,” said Ricardo Peverini, president of the Loma Linda University Faculty Medical Group. “It reduces our environmental footprint, makes our operations more resilient and saves resources that we can reinvest into patient care. It’s a healthier future for our patients, our staff and our region.”

Who else went solar locally?

Loma Linda’s system is one of several major projects completed in the region over the past five years:

Esri (Redlands): Installed 1.8 megawatts of rooftop panels across its headquarters campus.

University of Redlands: Announced a two-phase campus-wide solar build in 2024.

Kaiser Permanente Ontario Medical Center: Completed a 2-MW solar canopy system with 9 MWh of battery storage in 2025.

Amazon Air Hub at San Bernardino International Airport: Opened in 2021 with rooftop solar as part of its design.

Altus Power / San Manuel Landing (San Bernardino): Launched a 1.6-MW rooftop system in 2024.

In 2022, the city of Redlands passed new rules for distribution warehouse developers requiring rooftop solar as part of the conditions of approval.

As organizations have been adopting solar power, individuals have also been able to take advantage of tax rebates on renewable energy installations through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

Zoom out to national policy

While projects like Loma Linda’s showcase the potential of renewable energy, the national policy landscape is moving in the opposite direction. The “One Big Beautiful Bill,” signed into law in July 2025, stripped away many of the clean-energy incentives that previously fueled solar adoption across the country.

Key changes include the elimination of the residential solar tax credit after Dec. 31, 2025. This credit meant that homeowners could get up to 30% off the cost of solar and energy-efficient equipment or installation. Not only do these technologies help reduce climate pollution, they can also make energy bills more affordable.

The law also reduced corporate incentives, scaling back the 30 percent investment tax credit that had helped businesses offset the cost of large solar and storage projects.

A separate incentive for heat pumps and insulation is also ending on Dec. 31, 2025. The incentive is called the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit and provides up to $2,000 off heat pumps, water heaters, biomass stoves or boilers on your tax bill. Up to $1,200 was also offered for home upgrades including insulation, doors and windows.

California’s net metering program was recently reduced under NEM 3.0, meaning homeowners exporting energy back to the grid get paid much less than in the past.

The legislation also pulled funding from programs such as Solar For All, which provided millions to help low-income communities adopt clean energy solutions.

What they’re saying: Supporters of eliminating the incentives argue that the tax credit was inflating the price of solar. A report by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) examined the issue of solar financing. In April 2024, it found that some lenders include “substantial markups and fees” that can increase the loan principal by 30 percent or more above the cash price.

“Lenders frequently bake these fees (commonly referred to within the industry as ‘dealer fees’) into the loan principal but often do not indicate that these fees are a markup from the total cash price that consumers pay for the system installation.”

Those opposed to cutting the credit argue that it has been vital in supporting wider adoption of solar panels. A survey by EnergySage warned that eliminating the incentive will result in major market disruption, including job losses and shuttered small businesses.

“An overwhelming 92.3 percent of solar installers reported that cutting the tax credit would harm or dramatically harm their businesses, with nearly two-thirds expecting ‘dramatic harm.’ When asked what their first change would be if the tax credit were eliminated, almost 6 percent said they would exit the industry.”

What’s still available: Despite the cuts, Californians still have options. The federal 30% Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit remains in place for systems installed and commissioned through the end of 2025. Commercial projects can still claim a 30% credit if they begin construction by July 2026.

At the state level, the California Public Utilities Commission’s Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) has $280 million in funding for residential solar and storage in disadvantaged communities. The Disadvantaged Communities – Single-Family Solar Homes (DAC-SASH) program is another resource that continues to help qualifying low-income households.

California also maintains its property tax exclusion for solar, ensuring rooftop systems do not increase homeowners’ tax bills.

Even with policy headwinds, large-scale projects across Redlands, Loma Linda and San Bernardino show how institutions have used solar to cut costs, build resilience and reduce emissions. For households and smaller businesses, the question now is how many opportunities remain before the incentives disappear.",https://www.communityforwardredlands.com/content/images/2025/09/Rooftop-Solar-Install_zstockphotos.png,N,,2025-09-18 05:58:09.156992

The Colorado Energy Office reported in July that in the first quarter of 2025, EV sales remained strong at 26% of total automobile sales.
The 2023 Colorado EV Plan from the Energy Office, Department of Transportation, and Public Health and Environment, wants to see a near-100% light-duty EV market share by 2050.
But we do believe that, unlike other states, there will continue to be an electric vehicle market here.” He added, “At one point last year we were one-out-of-every three cars with electric.
We are estimating this year that the new vehicle market is going to be about 220,000 vehicles, and that is on the trajectory we were on prior to COVID.”","With a ticking clock on Gov. Jared Polis’ 2019 aspirations to put 940,000 electric vehicles on Colorado highways by 2030, his plan hit a major pothole when President Donald Trump ordered cancellation of the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act Clean Vehicle Tax Credits.

On Sept. 30, the federal tax credits worth up to $7,500 per purchase will vanish. The cutoff, passed by Congress in July, threatens to stall the state’s EV goals just as sales data show a pre-deadline buying frenzy that is masking deeper uncertainties in the market, according to industry experts.

The subsidy has been providing up to $7,500 for qualifying new battery electric vehicles or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles with a manufacturer’s suggested retail price up to $80,000 and up to $4,000 for used EVs priced under $25,000.

In 2024, Colorado surged ahead of California to claim the nation’s top spot for EV sales, with battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids capturing 25.3% of new vehicle purchases — 9,446 units in that period alone, according to the Colorado Energy Office.

“Newly released data … shows that in the 3rd quarter of 2024, Colorado passed California to become the top state in the country for EV sales,” the office said in a December 2024 news release.

But today, EV registrations have plunged 32.5%.

Polis kicked off his “ambitious plan” with an executive order upon taking office in January 2019.

He framed EVs as the backbone of Colorado’s net-zero emissions goal for transportation by 2050.

“Colorado’s national leading progress in electric vehicle adoption is a key part of our ambitious efforts to achieve net-zero emissions in transportation by 2050,” Polis stated in the December 2024 release.

The end of the Biden subsidies hits at a precarious moment for EV buyers.

Colorado’s state EV incentives have decreased from $5,000 to $3,500, effective Jan. 1, 2025. Meanwhile, the Vehicle Exchange Colorado program offers rebates of up to $6,000 to income-qualified buyers who trade in old gas-guzzlers — but only 45 such deals have closed in the third quarter of 2025 so far.

Utility subsidy programs for low-income buyers, such as Xcel Energy’s $5,500 for new EV buyers, persist but pale in comparison to the federal lifeline.

A Sept. 3 rush saw buyers flood dealerships to lock in credits via pre-deadline payments, even for post-October deliveries. Still, Matthew Groves, president of the Colorado Automobile Dealers Association, warned: “Fewer discounts will inevitably slow Colorado’s red-hot EV market.”

“So, who’s really going to suffer here is middle and lower-income Americans, because a lot of people who were buying the more expensive EVs were never using that credit in the first place,” Groves told The Denver Gazette.

Groves also said the upper-end market is largely unaffected due to income and sale price restrictions.

While Groves believes there will be a slump in EV purchases after the federal credits expire, he’s confident that the EV market in Colorado isn’t headed for disaster, rather it’s headed for an adjustment that Colorado automotive dealers have been preparing for since the change of administration at the White House.

From 2019, when EV new Colorado registrations totaled just 8,015 amid 229,000 overall sales (a 3.5% share), the market jumped to 44,378 in 2024 (20.0%). Year-over-year EV growth averaged over 50% through 2024, outpacing total automotive market expansion of 6%-8% annually.

The Colorado Energy Office reported in July that in the first quarter of 2025, EV sales remained strong at 26% of total automobile sales.

But industry professionals say that’s all likely to change come Oct. 1.

From about 25,000 EVs on roads at 2019’s end (0.46% of 5.41 million total vehicles), the fleet swelled to 183,000 by mid-2025 (3.24% of an estimated 5.65 million).

The 2023 Colorado EV Plan from the Energy Office, Department of Transportation, and Public Health and Environment, wants to see a near-100% light-duty EV market share by 2050.

A May 21, 2025 analysis by Conservation Colorado, via the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, claims “Colorado drivers could lose as much as $5.5 billion in consumer savings over the next five years if Congress repeals the federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credits.”

That’s on top of a 2019 Energy Office study projecting $43 billion in lifetime fuel and maintenance savings through 2050 from widespread adoption.

Environment America hailed the 2024 peak in a Dec. 5 statement: “In the third quarter of 2024, 25.3% of all new vehicle sales in Colorado were EVs, propelling Colorado’s market share ahead of California’s for the first time. This is a huge win for our climate and clean air.”

However, this doesn’t accurately reflect the on-the-ground reality, where EVs make up only 3.25% of the state’s vehicle fleet — 96.75% of all vehicles on the road run on internal combustion, according to the state’s electric vehicle dashboard.

Nor, according to Gallup, is EV ownership subsantially benefiting lower-income persons making less than $40,000. The Gallup data indicates that 61% of that category would not buy an EV, and 29% might consider it. In the top income echelon of $100,000 and up, 14% own an EV, 34% might consider it in the future, and 41% would not buy one.

But Polis remains bullish.

“Colorado is a national leader in electric vehicle adoption, and I’m confident market demand for these vehicles will continue because they are fast, quiet, fun, and help protect our air quality and save Coloradans money through lower maintenance costs,” said Polis in a statement to The Denver Gazette. “Colorado consumers have shown that they want EVs. The best deal you’re going to get in a long time is the deal you’ll get before the end of September.”

Groves agrees, though he’s not as optimistic as Polis about the state mandate that EVs must eventually comprise 82% of all vehicle sales.

“No, I don’t think it’s a catastrophe. Fortunately, they gave us about three months to prepare for it, so we are getting ready for the thing to wind down,” Groves said. “We’ve been speculating about the expiration of this credit going back to the election in November. So, it will take a little bit of inventory management on dealer’s behalf. But we do believe that, unlike other states, there will continue to be an electric vehicle market here.”

He added, “At one point last year we were one-out-of-every three cars with electric. Now that might drop to one in 10, one in 15, but there will still be a percentage of people who want that vehicle, and we will still have some of them here to meet their needs. It just won’t be 82% of all cars sold.”

Groves also notes that sales of internal combustion engine vehicles have been “incredibly resilient.”

“There are a lot of things that should have torn away at the market,” Groves said. “Tariffs, interest rates, inventory shortages — and people are still buying cars at a rate that they were pre-COVID. We are estimating this year that the new vehicle market is going to be about 220,000 vehicles, and that is on the trajectory we were on prior to COVID.”",https://www.denvergazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/253c4508c05d4aae9867ccec024a8709.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 21:59:28.213263

POWELLS POINT, NC, UNITED STATES, September 17, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- S.D. Paterson Development Co. has unveiled details of the Electric Vehicle Automatic Charging Station (EVACS), a weather resistant, automated charging system intended for use in private garages, fleet facilities, and outdoor spaces. The system is designed to connect to an electric vehicle without manual cable handling, allowing drivers to park and walk away while charging begins automatically.

EVACS can be installed as a self standing or wall mounted unit and incorporates a multi voltage charger with an adjustable track to fit a range of wheelbases and tire widths. The charging head is wired for direct connect fast charging and operates independently of the vehicle’s factory installed plug receptacle, enabling manual charging when away from the station.

The charging dock is positioned between tire guides and protected by spring loaded, weather resistant covers that open and close automatically as a vehicle drives on or off. The height of the receptacle can be adjusted to suit different vehicle designs and ground clearances. The system is compatible with self parking technology and can be integrated into newly manufactured electric vehicles or retrofitted to existing models.

A companion software application provides real time updates on charging status and estimated time to full charge. Charging stops automatically when the battery reaches capacity, and the user is notified.

“Our goal with EVACS is to simplify the charging process for a wide range of electric vehicles, from passenger cars to commercial fleets,” said a spokesperson for S.D. Paterson Development Co. “By removing the need to manually connect cables, we’re aiming to make charging more seamless and adaptable to different environments.”

The EVACS design can be adapted for electric automobiles, commercial trucks, recreational vehicles, utility terrain vehicles (UTVs), and golf carts. Specifications such as size, construction, and design may change as the system progresses through development and manufacturing.

Trump reversed policies supporting electric vehicles affecting the road to clean electricity, too

JEREMY J. MICHALEK

Carnegie Mellon University

Published: September 18, 2025

(THE CONVERSATION) When Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, it was the largest climate bill in U.S. history, with major incentives for electric vehicle production and adoption. In its wake, investment in the U.S. electric vehicle industry accelerated. But in 2025, President Donald Trump's so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated most of the incentives, and U.S. investment collapsed.

Hitting the brakes on electric vehicles will clearly mean less progress in reducing transportation emissions and less strategic U.S. leadership in a key technology of the future. But in a new study, my colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University and I find that fewer electric vehicles will also mean less investment to clean up the electricity sector.

How we got here

U.S. electric vehicle adoption lags behind the rest of the world – especially China, which has invested heavily and strategically to dominate electric vehicle markets and supply chains and to leapfrog the historical dominance of American, European and Japanese manufacturers of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.

Electric vehicles are much simpler to engineer, and this opened a window for China to bet big on EVs with investment, incentives and experimentation. As battery prices dropped dramatically, electric cars became real competition for gasoline cars – especially for the massive Chinese market, where buyers don't have strong prior preferences for gasoline. China now dominates the supply chain for battery materials, such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese, as well as the rare earth minerals used in electric motors.

In 2022, the U.S. took action to change this trend when Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act. The law encouraged EV adoption by lowering costs to manufacturers and consumers. But it also encouraged automakers to find ways to build EVs without Chinese materials by making the largest incentives conditional on avoiding China entirely.

After the law passed, investment soared across hundreds of new battery manufacturing and material processing facilities in the U.S.

But in 2025, Congress passed and Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which eliminated most of the incentives. U.S. investment in EV-related production has collapsed.

Electric vehicles are cleaner

As a scholar of electric vehicle technology, economics, environment and policy, I have conducted numerous peer-reviewed scientific studies characterizing benefits and costs of electric vehicles over their life cycle, from production through use and end of life. When charged with clean electricity, electric vehicles are one of the few technologies in existence that can provide transportation with near-zero emissions.

With today's electricity grid, EV emissions can vary, depending on the mix of electricity generators used in the region where they are charged, driving conditions such as weather or traffic, the specific vehicles being compared, and even the timing of charging. But EVs are generally better for the climate over their life cycle today than most gasoline vehicles, even if the most efficient gas-electric hybrids are still cleaner in some locations. EVs become cleaner as the electricity grid becomes cleaner, and, importantly, it turns out that EVs can even help make the electricity grid cleaner.

This matters because transportation and electricity together make up the majority of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and the passenger cars and light trucks that we all drive produce the majority of our transportation emissions.

In its efforts to prevent the government from regulating greenhouse gas emissions, the Trump administration is now claiming that emissions from cars and trucks are ""not meaningful"" contributors to climate change. But in reality, a technology that cleans up both transportation and electricity at the same time is a big deal.

An opportunity for cleaner electricity

Our research has found that turning away from electric vehicles does more than miss a chance to curb transportation emissions – it also misses an opportunity to make the nation's electricity supply cleaner.

In our paper, my co-authors Lily Hanig, Corey Harper and Destenie Nock and I looked at potential scenarios for electric vehicle adoption across the U.S. from now until 2050. We considered situations ranging from cases with no government policies supporting electric vehicles to cases with enough electric vehicle adoption to be on track with road maps targeting overall net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

In each of these scenarios, we calculated how the nation's power grid and electricity generators would respond to electric vehicle charging load.

We found that when there are more electric vehicles charging, more power plants would need to be built – and because of cost competitiveness, most of those new power plants would be solar, wind, battery storage and natural gas plants, depending on the region.

Once wind and solar plants are built, they are cheaper to operate than fossil fuel plants, because utilities don't need to buy more fuel to burn to make more electricity. That cost advantage means wind and solar energy gets used first, so it can displace fossil-fuel generation even when EVs aren't charging.

A virtuous – or vicious – cycle

Our analysis reveals that what's good for climate in the transportation sector – eliminating emissions from vehicle tailpipes – is also good for climate in the power sector, supporting more investment in clean power and displacing more fossil fuel-powered generation.

As a result, encouraging electric vehicle adoption is even better for the climate than many people expected because EV charging can actually cause lower-emitting power plants to be built.

Gasoline vehicles can't last forever. The cheap oil will eventually run out. And EV batteries have gotten so cheap, with ranges now comparable to gas cars, that the global transition is already well underway. Even in the U.S., consumers are adopting more EVs as the technology improves and offers consumers more for less. The U.S. government can't single-handedly stop this transition – it can only decide how much to lead, lag or resist. Rolling back electric vehicle incentives now means higher emissions, less clean energy investment and weaker U.S. competitiveness in a crucial industry of the future.

Our findings show that slowing electric vehicle adoption doesn't just affect emissions from transportation. It also misses opportunities to help build a cleaner power sector, potentially locking the U.S. into higher emissions from its top two highest-emitting sectors – power generation and transportation – while the window to avoid the worst effects of climate change is closing.

Honda has only one EV in the market—the Prologue—yet it surged 47.9% to capture 6.4% market share.
GMC had the highest days’ supply at 139, while Toyota had the lowest at just 14 days.
On the used side of the market, the used EV days’ supply fell to 36 days (also the lowest level recorded in 2025).
The used EV days’ supply remained below ICE+ (traditional internal combustion vehicle) levels for the sixth time this year.","Cox Automotive is reporting that August saw record electric vehicle (EV) sales and rising market share in both new and used markets as buyers rushed to secure tax credits before the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credit expiration. The company’s analysts noted strong demand, tightening inventory, and significant incentives, signaling a market shift as federal subsidies are set to come to an end in September.

According to Cox, new EV sales climbed to a record 146,332 units, which is up 14.1% month over month and 17.7% year over year, lifting market share to an all-time high of 9.9%. Thirteen brands posted their best EV sales of the year. Tesla (55,500 units) led the pack, followed by Chevrolet (12,191), Ford (10,414), Hyundai (10,186), and Honda (9,347). Of note, while Tesla grew modestly (3.1%), it lost four points of market share—declining to 37.9%. Honda has only one EV in the market—the Prologue—yet it surged 47.9% to capture 6.4% market share. When it comes to luxury brands, Audi had the strongest growth, up 65.1% to 7,326 units (capturing 5% market share).

Used EVs also posted strong sales. It appears that consumers are beginning to understand long-term EV ownership—modern electric vehicles are smart buys as they have fewer moving parts (about 20 compared to over 2,000 in combustion engines), thus requiring significantly less maintenance, which leads to overall greater reliability at higher mileages. On that note, Cox reports that used EV sales reached a record 40,960 units in August, which is up 22% month over month and 59% year over year (market share was pushed to a new high of 2.4%). Five manufacturers showed double-digit month-over-month growth, led by Tesla (17,164 units, 17.6%), Chevrolet (3,801 units, 17.3%), and Ford (2,456 units, 39.6%). BMW (2,031 units, 38%) and Nissan (1,888 units, 21.6%) rounded out the top five.

“Days supply” is a key metric in the automotive industry. It is used to estimate the number of days it will take to sell the current inventory at the current sales pace. Low days supply means vehicles are selling quickly and demand is strong, while a high days supply indicates sales are slow or dealers are carrying too much inventory—consumers may be wary.

Cox is reporting that new EV days’ supply fell sharply to 62 days, down 32.1% month over month and 42.8% year over year (the lowest level recorded in 2025). Supply dropped 71 days from the June peak of 133 days, and most brands saw notable declines. GMC had the highest days’ supply at 139, while Toyota had the lowest at just 14 days. Audi posted the most significant drop, falling 104 days to end the month at 67 days.

On the used side of the market, the used EV days’ supply fell to 36 days (also the lowest level recorded in 2025). The used EV days’ supply remained below ICE+ (traditional internal combustion vehicle) levels for the sixth time this year. Cox analysts noted that supply levels vary significantly by make and model. Tesla had the lowest days’ supply at 26 days, with Chevrolet (32 days) and Nissan (32 days) also showing low levels. In contrast, Rivian (65 days), Ford (62 days), and GMC (58 days) had the highest levels, each hovering around a two-month supply. (Note: Tesla and Rivian’s supply measures reflect only vehicles available through traditional dealerships, not models offered directly by the company.)

“As we approach the sunset of the IRA tax credit, we expect September to mirror August’s elevated sales activity, driven by time-sensitive purchase and lease offers,” said the experts at Cox. “This final stretch of policy-driven urgency will likely sustain momentum across both the new and used EV segments. The market’s ability to respond to real-time demand and pricing dynamics will be crucial as incentives taper and inventory remains tight, shaping performance through the remainder of the year.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68885f7f3a1fd1e919f75109/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-17 20:00:08.189949

Addressing the administration’s assertion that U.S. wildfires aren’t more common recently than they were in the 1980s, the NAS provided evidence that climate change has worsened them.
Earlier springs; longer, dry summers; and cumulative drought have lengthened the fire window and raised the probability of large, fast-spreading fires, especially in the West, the NAS report said.
They said the report was intended to focus on topics that have been “underreported or overlooked in media and political discussions.” The National Academy of Sciences said in its report released Wednesday that harm to Americans from climate change is real.
And it said the science of climate change reveals the potential for a frightening future.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Evidence that climate change harms public health is “beyond scientific dispute,” the independent National Academy of Sciences said Wednesday in response to the Trump administration’s efforts to revoke a landmark U.S. government finding to that effect that underpins key environmental regulations.

The NAS, a non-governmental nonprofit set up to advise the government on science, said human activity is releasing greenhouse gases that are warming the planet, increasing extreme temperatures and changing the oceans, all dangerous developments for the health and welfare of the United States public. Evidence to that effect has only grown stronger since 2009, the group said.

In July, the Trump administration proposed revoking what’s known as the 2009 “endangerment” finding, the concept that climate change is a threat. Overturning it could pave the way for cutting a range of rules that limit pollution from cars, power plants and other sources.

“EPA’s 2009 finding that the human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases threaten human health and welfare was accurate, has stood the test of time, and is now reinforced by even stronger evidence,” the NAS said. Science that was uncertain or tentative in 2009 has now been resolved, it said, and new risks have been found, too.

The NAS was established in 1863 under President Abraham Lincoln and has played a significant public role in scientific policy for more than a century, including consulting on the Clean Air Act.

“The importance of getting the science right weighed heavily on the committee’s deliberations, given the potential significant implications of a changing climate and of the actions proposed to address it,” NAS committee chair and former Princeton University President Shirley Tilghman wrote in the preface to Wednesday’s report.

“Unlike earthquakes and volcanoes, over which we have no control, responding to the potential harm to human health and welfare from changes in the climate is actionable now,” Tilghman wrote.

The Trump administration looks to undo more than a decade of regulations

Under President Donald Trump, the Department of Energy has suggested that climate models used by scientists to predict warming have overreached, that long-term trends for disasters generally don’t show much change and that climate has little impact on the economy. The DOE also said there are advantages to a world with more carbon, like increased plant growth.

On Wednesday, the National Academy had a series of scientists explain their findings in a webcast.

Addressing the administration’s assertion that U.S. wildfires aren’t more common recently than they were in the 1980s, the NAS provided evidence that climate change has worsened them. Earlier springs; longer, dry summers; and cumulative drought have lengthened the fire window and raised the probability of large, fast-spreading fires, especially in the West, the NAS report said.

And while Trump’s Department of Energy attributes rising sea levels in part to sinking land and other factors, it relied on only a few tidal stations to inform its analysis, said NAS co-author Charles Driscoll, a Syracuse engineering professor.

Data from all the stations, plus from satellites, shows “very, very strong” evidence that the rise in sea levels is accelerating, Driscoll said.

In a statement, EPA said the endangerment finding was used by the Obama and Biden administrations to justify “trillions of dollars of greenhouse gas regulations” and that many of the “extremely pessimistic predictions and assumptions EPA relied upon have not materialized as expected.”

The Trump administration’s work has already been met by strong pushback from the scientific community, including dozens of experts who responded to a survey from The Associated Press. The vast majority of respondents were highly critical of science the administration put forward as it argued to revoke the endangerment finding. Many described it as filled with errors, bias and distortion.

Paul Higgins, an associate executive director of the American Meteorological Society, said the NAS’s work is trustworthy in part because of the rigorous scientific process it uses.

“The National Academy of Sciences is the premier scientific organization in the United States,” said Paulina Jaramillo, a Carnegie Mellon University professor of engineering and public policy. “In contrast, the DOE report was authored by five scientists known to be climate skeptics.”

A battle with mainstream science

Other mainstream groups have also criticized the administration’s work. A group of 85 climate experts found it “full of errors, and not fit to inform policy making.” Environmental groups are already challenging the administration’s documents in court.

A White House spokesperson previously told The Associated Press that the Trump administration “is producing Gold Standard Science research driven by verifiable data” and that the endangerment finding had long been misused to justify expensive regulations “that have jeopardized our economic and national security.”

The Trump administration maintains that while climate change is real, its future effects are unclear and likely weaker than projected by many mainstream scientists. The administration also contends that U.S. cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, which largely come from burning fuels like oil and coal, would mean little globally.

The authors of the Department of Energy report said in August that any errors found in the work would be corrected and that the report is not meant to be a comprehensive review of climate science. They said the report was intended to focus on topics that have been “underreported or overlooked in media and political discussions.”

The National Academy of Sciences said in its report released Wednesday that harm to Americans from climate change is real. People are exposed to more extreme heat, air pollution and extreme weather events, just to name a sampling of the threats, NAS said. And it said the science of climate change reveals the potential for a frightening future.

“The United States faces a future in which climate-induced harm continues to worsen and today’s extremes become tomorrow’s norms,” the NAS said.

In July, the EPA proposed rescinding its 2009 Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding, which grants it the authority to regulate emissions from motor vehicles and engines.
The letter, which calls the move a “shocking new low point” for the EPA, says that curtailing emissions standards would imperil environmental and public health.
The letter from Democrats says that repealing emissions standards will have economic costs as well.
And every American should be able to drive an affordable next-generation clean vehicle made here in America,” the letter concludes.","More than 100 Democrats on Wednesday signed on to a letter sent to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin, calling on the agency to withdraw its proposed elimination of federal emissions standards for vehicles.

In July, the EPA proposed rescinding its 2009 Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding, which grants it the authority to regulate emissions from motor vehicles and engines. The changes would eliminate future emissions requirements for models, with the EPA noting it will keep in place, “regulations necessary for criteria pollutant and air toxic measurement and standards, Corporate Average Fuel Economy testing, and associated fuel economy labeling requirements.

“This is a clear abdication of EPA’s core mission to protect human health and the environment and a flagrant rejection of Congressional intent,” wrote the lawmakers, led by Rep. Doris Matsui (D-Ca.). Matsui is a co-chair of the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition alongside Reps. Mike Quigley (D-Il.) and Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.), who also signed the letter.

The letter, which calls the move a “shocking new low point” for the EPA, says that curtailing emissions standards would imperil environmental and public health. On Wednesday, the independent National Academy of Sciences said it is “beyond scientific dispute” that climate change harms public health, according to the Associated Press.

“EPA must fulfill its mission to protect communities and regulate the greenhouse gas pollution that causes these deaths,” the Democrats’ letter said.

Under Zeldin, who President Trump appointed as administrator, the EPA has prioritized removing regulations it deems harmful for businesses. In March, Zeldin announced the agency would roll back 31 environmental rules, including the 2009 endangerment finding.

“Alongside President Trump, we are living up to our promises to unleash American energy, lower costs for Americans, revitalize the American auto industry, and work hand-in-hand with our state partners to advance our shared mission,” Zeldin said at the time.

The public comment period for the proposed rescission of the endangerment finding ends on Sept. 22. Last Friday, the EPA also proposed repealing requirements for companies to report emissions, a policy implemented under the 2009 Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.

The letter from Democrats says that repealing emissions standards will have economic costs as well. Noting recent job growth in the clean energy sector, the letter says that overturning emissions standards threatens American workers manufacturing clean energy vehicles while “the world is racing towards a zero-emission future.”

The EPA’s changes will also increase the cost of living for consumers and boost the U.S.’s reliance on foreign oil, the letter states.

“Every American deserves to breathe clean air. Every American deserves the opportunity of a prosperous future free from climate change. And every American should be able to drive an affordable next-generation clean vehicle made here in America,” the letter concludes.

When reached for comment, the EPA said it will review the letter and “respond through the appropriate channels.”

“The agency looks forward to responding to a diverse array of perspectives on this issue,” the EPA added.

(NASDAQ:GPRE), a $637.3 million market cap renewable fuels producer, has entered into an agreement with an affiliate of Freepoint Commodities LLC to sell Clean Fuel Production Credits generated in 2025 under the Inflation Reduction Act, according to a press release statement. According to InvestingPro data, the company operates with significant debt levels but maintains strong liquidity with a current ratio of 1.47.

The initial credits will come from low-carbon intensity ethanol production at Green Plains’ three Nebraska facilities. The company has also signed a term sheet with Freepoint to monetize tax credits from three additional facilities expected to qualify under the 45Z tax credit program during 2025. With current gross profit margins at 5.5%, these credits could provide important additional revenue streams for the company.

The agreement covers the anticipated 2025 production year credits for the Nebraska facilities, with the possibility of extension to purchase credits for 2026-2029 on mutually agreeable terms. The credits will be transferred through a direct transfer mechanism supported by third-party emissions verification and tax insurance.

""Our focus on operational excellence has improved utilization and yields across our platform, while also lowering carbon intensity—enabling several plants to qualify for 45Z credits during the current year,"" said Chris Osowski, Chief Executive Officer of Green Plains, in the statement.

According to the company, a portion of these credits are being generated prior to the expected launch of carbon capture later this year, which the company says demonstrates the competitive carbon intensity profile of its current operations.

Based on current expectations, the combined agreement and term sheet are projected to generate between $40 and $50 million in 2025 45Z EBITDA net of discounts and after applicable operating expenses, with the first credits being recorded in the third quarter. This projection is significant considering the company’s current EBITDA of $23.47M. InvestingPro’s Fair Value analysis suggests the stock is currently undervalued, with additional insights available in the comprehensive Pro Research Report covering this and 1,400+ other US equities.

The final proceeds will depend on actual production and the timing of startup for the carbon capture systems at Green Plains’ Nebraska facilities. Despite recent challenges, the stock has shown remarkable momentum with an 84.29% return over the past six months.

""Georgia is very active — they're having great success with their rebate program,"" David Terry, president of the National Association of State Energy Officials, told Utility Dive.
These rebates can be allocated for a number of uses, but few are as exciting as an induction stove.
Sadly, the $8,000 available through HOMES doesn't mean you can get an $8,000 stove for free.
However, it would allow an induction stove to be part of a larger home upgrade that could qualify for the rebate.","Although some federal tax credits for environmentally friendly home upgrades will expire at the end of this year, there is still money available for those homeowners who want to make energy-efficient improvements.

As Utility Dive reported, a dozen states have already launched rebate programs with funds originally allocated through the Inflation Reduction Act, and all states except South Dakota have applied for funding.

Despite the budget bill that was signed into law this summer, the $4.3 billion made available for the Home Efficiency Rebates program, or HOMES, is expected to remain until Sept. 30, 2031, or until the money runs out. This program allows homeowners to get up to $8,000 off projects that ""significantly reduce"" energy usage.

""Georgia is very active — they're having great success with their rebate program,"" David Terry, president of the National Association of State Energy Officials, told Utility Dive. ""Indiana had their program negotiated and approved just before the new administration took office, and launched [in May], and that seems to be going well. And certainly the other states, they're going through the funds pretty quickly.""

Many other states, Terry added, are just waiting on final approval from the Department of Energy.

These rebates can be allocated for a number of uses, but few are as exciting as an induction stove.

By using a magnetic current to generate heat, instead of burning dirty fuels like natural gas, induction stoves manage to boil water faster than gas, without producing any of the toxic fumes. They also stay cool to the touch, making them safer and easier to clean, and are more energy-efficient, so they cost less to operate.

Sadly, the $8,000 available through HOMES doesn't mean you can get an $8,000 stove for free. However, it would allow an induction stove to be part of a larger home upgrade that could qualify for the rebate. Otherwise, another similar program, the Home Electrification and Appliance Rebate, allows for up to $840 off such a cooktop.

If purchasing a new stove isn't in the cards right now, you can still take advantage of induction technology.

The ceremonial event, held on September 16, 2025, near Social Circle, marks a pivotal step for the company as it pushes forward with plans to scale production of its next-generation vehicles. Attended by Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, and other local leaders, the groundbreaking underscores the state’s growing role as a hub for EV manufacturing, bolstered by substantial incentives and federal support.

The factory, slated to become Rivian’s “global manufacturing hub,” will eventually produce up to 400,000 vehicles annually, focusing initially on the midsize R2 SUV and the compact R3 crossover. According to details shared in a report from TechCrunch, while the event was largely symbolic, it paves the way for actual construction to commence in early 2026, with vehicle production targeted for 2028. This timeline reflects adjustments from Rivian’s original 2021 announcement, which envisioned operations starting as early as 2024 but was derailed by supply-chain disruptions, rising costs, and a broader slowdown in EV demand.

Navigating Economic Uncertainties and Federal Backing in EV Expansion

Rivian’s path to this milestone has not been without challenges. The project paused in March 2024 amid financial strains, only to resume following a strategic pivot that included a $5 billion investment from Volkswagen AG and the finalization of a $6.6 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy. As noted in coverage by WebProNews, this DOE funding, secured just before shifts in federal administration, provides critical capital for infrastructure development, including deep utilities installation set for August 2025 and vertical construction in the following year. Industry analysts view this as a bet on long-term growth, despite current market softness where EV sales have plateaued amid high interest rates and competition from hybrids.

Beyond production capacity, the Georgia plant promises significant economic ripple effects. Rivian has committed to creating 7,500 jobs by 2030, a boon for the region east of Atlanta. A piece in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution highlighted the community’s anticipation, with hundreds attending a pre-groundbreaking event to learn about the facility’s environmental features, such as sustainable building practices and integration with local ecosystems. Georgia’s $1.5 billion incentive package, including tax breaks and infrastructure grants, has been instrumental in reviving the project, positioning the state competitively against EV hotspots like Michigan and Tennessee.

Strategic Implications for Rivian’s Market Position and Broader Industry Trends

For Rivian, the Georgia factory represents a cornerstone of its strategy to achieve profitability and compete with giants like Tesla Inc. and Ford Motor Co. The R2 and R3 models, priced starting around $45,000, aim to broaden Rivian’s appeal beyond its premium R1T truck and R1S SUV, targeting a mass-market segment. Insights from Electrek emphasize how this expansion could help Rivian navigate policy uncertainties, including potential rollbacks of federal EV tax credits under evolving administrations. The company’s stock rose 6% following the announcement, as reported by Investing.com, reflecting investor optimism about scaled operations reducing per-unit costs.

Yet, challenges loom. The EV industry faces headwinds from slowing global demand and supply-chain vulnerabilities, with Rivian reporting losses in recent quarters. As detailed in Yahoo Finance, the project’s success hinges on Rivian’s ability to ramp up efficiently while managing capital expenditures. Insiders note that partnerships, like the one with Volkswagen for software and zonal architecture, could accelerate innovation at the new site.

Looking Ahead: Job Creation, Sustainability, and Competitive Edge in American Manufacturing

Looking forward, Rivian’s Georgia endeavor could reshape U.S. auto manufacturing by emphasizing domestic production and reducing reliance on overseas suppliers. The facility’s design incorporates advanced automation and renewable energy sources, aligning with broader sustainability goals. Coverage in MarketScreener describes it as accelerating American manufacturing growth, with potential to generate ancillary jobs in logistics and technology.

Ultimately, this groundbreaking is more than a photo op—it’s a declaration of Rivian’s resilience in a volatile market. As the company transitions from startup to scaled producer, the Georgia plant will test its vision against real-world economics, potentially setting a blueprint for other EV makers eyeing U.S. expansion. With construction on the horizon, stakeholders will watch closely for milestones that could solidify Rivian’s place in the electric future.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-0df1a975-f387-409e-a258-2c785d43e44e.jpeg,N,,2025-09-17 19:59:43.370137

“This wasn’t just a win for Fort Johnson,” Spang said.","REDSTONE ARSENAL, Ala. — In an era of tight budgets and rising costs, the U.S. Army is finding smart ways to stretch every dollar.

Thanks to the collaboration between two programs at the U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center in Huntsville, Fort Johnson, Louisiana, just scored a massive win—recouping nearly $974,000 in utility overpayments and unlocking projected savings of more than $2.3 million annually.

Home to the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC)—where warfighters prepare for global missions—Fort Johnson had for years been billed under a utility rate plan meant for small businesses. This unfortunate situation resulted in significantly higher electricity costs. But now, that’s all changing.

Huntsville Center’s Commercial Utility Program (CUP) teamed up with Fort Johnson to perform a utility bill audit to identify electric cost savings. Years earlier, a prior audit identified the problematic electric rate, but a better rate was not available, and the Army could not pursue the issue until the power provider filed a rate case requesting an increase in rates – something not done since 2013.

However, days after the utility bill audit contract was awarded, Christina Spang, CUP project manager, discovered local power provider Entergy Louisiana had filed a rate case before the Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC) requesting permission to increase electric rates for the first time in 10 years.

This was the moment the Army had been waiting for.

CUP immediately notified Army Legal Services Agency’s Environmental Law Division (USALSA-ELD) and an Army Regulatory attorney immediately filed a rate intervention before the LPSC on behalf of Fort Johnson, just in time to meet the tight filing deadline.

What was subsequently found by the Army Legal team was eye-opening: Fort Johnson had been overcharged millions of dollars over the course of 10 years due to being misclassified under a “Small General Service Rate Schedule” by Entergy Louisiana.

To navigate the complex world of utility regulations and Time-of-Use rate modeling, CUP brought in Ph.D.-level expert witnesses to support Army Legal during the rate intervention. But even the most qualified experts needed help gathering key data.

That’s where Jeffrey Rodgers, Fort Johnson’s Energy Manager, and Scott Pogue, a Resource Efficiency Manager (REM) contracted through Huntsville Center’s REM program, came in.

Pogue served as a vital link between the Fort Johnson team and CUP, supplying the detailed technical data needed to justify the rate change. His on-site expertise in energy planning and efficiency made him a driving force in the success of the initiative.

“REM’s like Pogue are our boots-on-the-ground experts,” said John Trudell, Huntsville Center REM program manager.

“They bring immediate, practical insight to energy infrastructure and help installations unlock real savings.”

Thanks to this collaboration, Fort Johnson not only received a $973,948.72 rebate for three months of overbilling—but is also expected to save an estimated $1.9 million per year going forward, primarily due to switching to a Large General Service Rate Schedule.

That’s not all. Over the next 35 years, Fort Johnson is estimated to save an additional $420,000 annually through reductions in the Additional Facilities Charges tied to its utility privatization contract – a total of $9.2 million in net present value savings.

In total, Fort Johnson will save an estimated $11.5 million from the success of this rate case.

“These savings are permanent,” Spang said. “By switching from a rate schedule designed for small businesses to one suitable for a large Army installation, Fort Johnson is now being billed equitably—and that means millions of dollars back into the Army’s budget.”

This case marks one of CUP’s most successful utility rate interventions to date. It also highlights the power of cross-functional teamwork—bringing together legal experts, utility rate expert witnesses, energy managers, and on-site REMs to drive results.

“This wasn’t just a win for Fort Johnson,” Spang said.

“It’s a win for the American taxpayer, and a demonstration of how cross-functional Army teams from different Commands and Programs can work together seamlessly on behalf of Army installations to accomplish major cost savings.”",https://api.army.mil/e2/c/images/2025/05/19/cdc6e360/max1200.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 19:01:05.095329

This determination – which has stood for over 15 years – provides the legal basis for regulating greenhouse gas emissions. In their letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the lawmakers called on the agency to preserve the endangerment finding in order to protect Marylanders from the increasing risks, costs, and chaos caused by climate change, pointing to the many related threats currently facing Maryland communities.

“We are deeply concerned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to eliminate the 2009 Endangerment Finding and what that will mean for Maryland and our constituents’ health and safety. The Endangerment Finding requires the EPA to protect people from the pollution that causes climate change. Denying the danger cannot change the facts: greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels are heating our planet and endangering us all,” the lawmakers began.

“The Endangerment Finding is based on settled science: decades of peer-reviewed scientific research have proven that rising global temperatures fuel stronger hurricanes, sea level rise, increased flooding, record-breaking heat waves, and other forms of extreme weather. The threats have never been more dire to communities across the country, including our constituents in Maryland,” they wrote.

The lawmakers went on to highlight threats to Maryland communities, pointing out, “Coastal communities in the Chesapeake Bay region are especially vulnerable to rising sea levels; in this region, seas have already risen one foot over the past century, twice as fast as the worldwide average, and are projected to rise nearly 3 more feet by 2100. More than 100 Maryland communities are at risk of ‘nuisance flooding’ from sea level rise. Almost a third of those communities are socioeconomically disadvantaged and do not have the resources to adapt to or mitigate the local impacts. Annapolis and Baltimore are experiencing some of the most frequent nuisance flooding events in the country, which have increased more than 920 percent since 1960. Further, Maryland farmers are expected to lose between $39 million and $107 million annually in crop yields due to saltwater intrusion.”

“Dangerous flooding also threatens Maryland communities further inland as heavy precipitation and severe storms have become more common. As of August 1st, Maryland has already recorded the most flash flood warnings in 2025 since 2020. Two years after Ellicott City was hit by a 1-in-1000 year catastrophic flash flood in 2016, which took the lives of two Marylanders, damaged over 100 businesses and 107 homes costing over $22 million in repairs, and reduced economic activity by $67.2 million, another flash flood once again destroyed the city’s Main Street and led to the death of one person. Recent flooding in the Mid-Atlantic led to the death of a child swept away by flood waters and over 200 children and students being evacuated from an elementary school in motorized boats in Western Maryland. The flood damaged drinking water systems and roads, highlighting the dangers facing all Marylanders as extreme weather wreaks havoc on the state’s infrastructure and local economies,” they continued.

“We urge you to put the welfare of people over that of polluters and maintain the Endangerment Finding. Marylanders and communities across the country should not be left to foot the bill for the climate chaos caused by polluters,” they concluded.

A copy of the letter is available here(link is external) and below.

Dear Administrator Zeldin:

We are deeply concerned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to eliminate the 2009 Endangerment Finding and what that will mean for Maryland and our constituents’ health and safety.

The Endangerment Finding requires the EPA to protect people from the pollution that causes climate change. Denying the danger cannot change the facts: greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels are heating our planet and endangering us all.

The Endangerment Finding is based on settled science: decades of peer-reviewed scientific research have proven that rising global temperatures fuel stronger hurricanes, sea level rise, increased flooding, record-breaking heat waves, and other forms of extreme weather. The threats have never been more dire to communities across the country, including our constituents in Maryland.

Coastal communities in the Chesapeake Bay region are especially vulnerable to rising sea levels; in this region, seas have already risen one foot over the past century, twice as fast as the worldwide average, and are projected to rise nearly 3 more feet by 2100. More than 100 Maryland communities are at risk of ‘nuisance flooding’ from sea level rise. Almost a third of those communities are socioeconomically disadvantaged and do not have the resources to adapt to or mitigate the local impacts. Annapolis and Baltimore are experiencing some of the most frequent nuisance flooding events in the country, which have increased more than 920 percent since 1960. Further, Maryland farmers are expected to lose between $39 million and $107 million annually in crop yields due to saltwater intrusion.

Dangerous flooding also threatens Maryland communities further inland as heavy precipitation and severe storms have become more common. As of August 1st, Maryland has already recorded the most flash flood warnings in 2025 since 2020. Two years after Ellicott City was hit by a 1-in-1000 year catastrophic flash flood in 2016, which took the lives of two Marylanders, damaged over 100 businesses and 107 homes costing over $22 million in repairs, and reduced economic activity by $67.2 million, another flash flood once again destroyed the city’s Main Street and led to the death of one person. Recent flooding in the Mid-Atlantic led to the death of a child swept away by flood waters and over 200 children and students being evacuated from an elementary school in motorized boats in Western Maryland. The flood damaged drinking water systems and roads, highlighting the dangers facing all Marylanders as extreme weather wreaks havoc on the state’s infrastructure and local economies.

As temperatures continue to rise, Marylanders, along with much of the rest of the nation, are threatened by heat waves of ever greater length and magnitude. Since 1900, average temperatures in Maryland have risen by roughly 2.5 ℉. During the 2024 heat season, there were 1,255 heat-related medical visits in Maryland – a 53% increase from the previous year – and 26 heat-related deaths. During the ongoing 2025 heat season, one heat wave alone in late June caused 472 people to go to urgent care or the emergency room, and resulted in 7 tragic deaths. In 2025, Maryland has already had more heat deaths than in the past 13 years, having reached 29 lives lost in mid-August. A failure to seriously curtail greenhouse gas emissions will lead to hotter average temperatures and more frequent days in which the heat index crosses 105 ℉, threatening to increase heat-related illness and death even further.

The EPA is tasked with protecting the public from air pollution that endangers health and welfare, and this politically motivated attempt to eliminate the Endangerment Finding flies in the face of that core mission. As you know, eliminating the Endangerment Finding will undermine other protections against climate pollution: clean car and truck standards, power plant rules, oil and gas rules, landfill rules, and more. This amounts to giving polluters a free pass to pollute at the expense of families in Maryland and across the country. It means our constituents will face more climate chaos and more pollution, more health harms, and higher costs – just so the corporations responsible for the climate crisis can continue to rake in record-breaking profit.

We urge you to put the welfare of people over that of polluters and maintain the Endangerment Finding. Marylanders and communities across the country should not be left to foot the bill for the climate chaos caused by polluters.

Morgan's Chief Climate Advisor Is Telling Energy Startups - Heatmap News,Robinson Meyer,,,,,https://heatmap.news/politics/shift-key-s3-e3-jp-morgan,"But the company, if it’s a shareholder-owned company, has one main obligation, which is to maximize the value of their shares.
And so Trump is fast-tracking mines, he’s sending huge amounts of public money to financially underwrite these mining companies.
With lithium, it’s even clearer.
So in a weird way, they like lithium mining, they like batteries for storage, they just don’t like electric vehicles.
Between 2005 and 2023, per capita emissions from primary energy consumption decreased in every U.S. state, with an average drop of 30%, even as the American population grew by 14%, according to a new analysis by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.","Riofrancos, a professor at Providence College, has spent much of her academic career studying mining and oil production in Latin America. In Extraction, she traces the lithium boom of the past five or so years, as the aims of the Global North and Global South began to resemble an inverted mirror. Countries in the latter group that have long been sites of mineral extraction — with little economic benefit — are now seeking to manufacture the more lucrative high tech products further down the supply chain. Meanwhile, after decades of offshoring, Europe and the U.S. suddenly want to bring mining back home in pursuit of “green dominance,” she writes. All of this is happening against the backdrop of China’s geopolitical rise, the war in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, and worsening effects of climate change.

The book also spends time with the indigenous communities and environmental defenders fighting the lithium industry in Chile, Spain, and the American West. Riofrancos doesn’t shy away from difficult questions, such as whether there is such a thing as a “right place” for a lithium mine. But she’s optimistic that there’s a better path than the one we’re on now. “The energy transition has presented a fork in the road for the entire economic and social order,” she writes. Down one road, we entrench existing power structures. Down the other, we capitalize on the energy transition to create a more just society.

Green capitalism, Riofrancos argues, is an oxymoron. While we can’t avoid extraction, we can reduce the need for it, for example through better public transit, smaller EV batteries, and minerals recycling, she concludes.

This interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity.

Are there notable differences between lithium and the extraction of other natural resources?

Yes and no. Whether it’s copper or lithium or gold or cobalt — and even I would include hydrocarbons in this, to a degree — whether we look at the economics, the way that they have boom and bust cycles, the fact that governments, even neoliberal governments, tend to take a pretty concerted interest in extractive sectors within their jurisdiction, environmental concerns and direct forms of violence that are meted out at environmental defenders — no, it’s not different. Which should raise alarm bells because a lot of those dynamics are not positive.

What’s different, though, is that precisely because mining companies and host governments claim that the extraction of lithium is urgent and essential for the energy transition, what ends up happening is that these big claims are made — like, “We are now a sustainable mining company because we’re extracting lithium,” or, “This is part of our green industrial policy.” This toxic and dirty extractive sector is now greenified because of its role in the energy transition. On the one hand, that’s greenwashing. On the other, it’s an opening. When companies make those claims, it’s something to hold them accountable to.

I was somewhat surprised by the issues you describe with the way lithium mining is regulated in Chile — the companies do their own environmental monitoring, there’s a lack of transparent data, the brine they mine in the Atacama is not considered water under Chilean law, etc. It seems like the state could change a lot of this. Why hasn’t it?

States in the Global South, although not exclusively there, lack geological and hydrological data about their own territory. In ways that we can trace to colonialism and neocolonialism in terms of who controls the territory and who has knowledge about it, the actors that have the basic data about deposits, how they interact with water sources, all of that, are the companies. And so to even regulate these companies better, you first need to set up independent and objective sources of data collection — and that’s something that any state might struggle with, but especially in the Global South, given the kind of legacy under which these companies operated, with little oversight of the state.

The [U.S. Geological Survey] doesn’t exist everywhere in the world. Not every state has a surveying agency with that level of expertise. And even in the U.S., the USGS actually has quite partial knowledge of what’s here. And there are many examples of companies in the U.S. hiding proprietary knowledge from the government.

What about after Gabriel Boric became president in Chile, in 2022, and created this new public-private partnership between the mining giant SQM and the government. Wouldn’t that have given the Chilean government more visibility and more control?

I think in some ways he’s made strides. He has set aside many salt flats for conservation. A right wing government wouldn’t have done that. He also is inserting the state, via the state-owned copper company Codelco, entering into public-private partnerships with companies, including SQM. If all goes according to plan, that will help the state learn more about lithium extraction, or maybe even set up their own lithium company, which was the initial goal of this government.

I’ll just point out two things to show how this is difficult. According to indigenous communities and environmental activists that have been organizing around this, they were excluded from the initial moment where that memorandum of understanding between SQM and Codelco was signed, and so they felt like it was a reenactment of historic injuries by a government that they had cautiously supported or thought would be different. Now they’re back at the negotiating table and indigenous communities are being consulted again. But there was a critical moment where the MOU was signed and indigenous communities were not present, and actually learned about it from the media. These historic patterns are really hard to change because companies hold a lot of power.

Even a progressive government is balancing indigenous rights and ecological protection with a desire to not lose market share. Argentina is starting to catch up with Chile — is Chile still going to remain the number two producer globally? Does it need to change its regulations to attract more companies? This is the kind of double bind that Global South societies find themselves in.

You write about this tension between expanding extraction and minimizing environmental and community impacts. Do you believe there are actually ways to minimize these impacts?

Absolutely. You can do anything better. I believe in human ingenuity and science and figuring out how to improve processes. There are ways to extract using less water, using a smaller land footprint, using fewer polluting energy sources. One of the reasons emissions from mining are not insignificant is a lot of it happens off-grid, and for now, that means diesel generators or gasoline-powered mining vehicles, let alone the cargo ships that are shipping the stuff around the world. So we could think about localizing or regionalizing supply chains.

The question is, how do we get companies to change their practices? They might do it if a regulator tells them they have to, if civil society puts so much pressure on them that it just becomes reputational harm if they don’t do it, if perhaps activist shareholders ask or tell the company to change its practices.

But the company, if it’s a shareholder-owned company, has one main obligation, which is to maximize the value of their shares. Changing your technological setup and your physical plant arrangement is costly, and it may not immediately produce more profits. And so you have to think about, what are the crude economic dynamics that keep companies on a particular technological path in terms of how they do their physical operations? And then think, using the power of policy, of economics, of consumer pressure, whatever it is, how to get them to make a decision that may not be in their immediate shareholder interest.

One theme in the book is that countries in the West are making a case for domestic mining by arguing that it will be greener than mining in the Global South. Is there any evidence for that? What’s the logic?

This was honestly one of the most surprising things in my research as someone that primarily has worked in Latin America. I heard some rumblings — and this was in 2019, before the pandemic — of EU officials wanting to onshore. It confused me because mining is toxic, it’s low value-added. And what I learned is that it had come to a point where Western policymakers saw the whole supply chain as a domain of geostrategic power.

And then, probably some people really feel this way, and other people are using it as nice rhetoric, but Western policymakers also started to come to the idea that it would be more “responsible” to mine in the West. This is in no small part due to the fact that the mining industry has deservedly gotten a lot of negative coverage for, in some cases, outright killing people. In other cases, you have an avalanche that destroys a village. You have water contamination. There are issues around forced labor, how the Uyghurs are treated in China. So there was a lot of bad press on the industry. I think they thought, We can solve a few problems at once. We can increase our geopolitical power by having domestic supply chains for the most important 21st century technologies, and we can also make the claim to consumers, regulators, and the media that this is better if you care about responsible, ethical, green mining.

The reality is, of course, more complex than that. Our mining law in the U.S. that governs hard rock mining on public lands is from 1872, which tells you everything you need to know. It’s extremely out of date with the modern mining industry and the scale of harm that mining poses, and it also literally was implemented during the westward expansion and dispossession of indigenous peoples to serve that end.

In fact, countries in Latin America tend to have better — on paper — governance of mining than the U.S., though they may not have the state capacity to always implement it. In Europe, there’s even more dependence on imports. A lot of the European countries have almost no regulations on the books for basic things like, how do you deal with mining waste? And so in the Global North, what we have to fight for is a mining governance regime and a set of legal codes and regulations that is up to date.

This book is pretty critical of the way communities have been treated in the lithium boom so far. What are some of the ways community engagement can be done better?

We see better outcomes when communities are organized, when they actually identify as a community, have some meetings, maybe set up a group to coordinate themselves. Like, who’s going to go to the public hearing? Who’s going to contact a lawyer? Who’s going to contact the water expert? Because communities need a lot of outside help. The companies have lawyers, they have experts, they probably have friends in government. A lot of lawyers and experts that companies hire used to work for the government, and they know these processes inside out, and so the community needs to be as or more organized. They’re already on the losing end of a power imbalance.

In a way, none of this is about what companies can do, because I presume that companies are responsive to pressure. Multinationals, insofar as they’re shareholder-owned, their main goal is to maximize value, and that’s it. It’s that simple. And so in order to get them to behave differently towards communities, outside forces need to take a role. The first outside force is the community itself. A second is, how involved is the government? And how objective and public-serving is the government? Where governments take a more objective role and help protect the baseline rights of communities, make sure that those rights are not being violated by companies, help distribute more culturally sensitive and appropriate information about the mine, we could get better outcomes that way.

You had activists tell you, “I support lithium mining, but this is the wrong place for it.” Do you think there is such a thing as a right or wrong place, or even a better or worse place for a lithium mine?

This was honestly the most vexing question that I had to contemplate in my own research. I often think about how these communities are called NIMBYs, and there’s two reasons that’s a really inappropriate term. First of all, the “my backyard” — not every person has private property, or that’s not their stake in the matter. It’s not about, this is going to decrease the value of my property, or this is going to disrupt my ocean view. It’s about the land that they have a deep relationship with.

The second thing is, I don’t think most of the people that call these communities NIMBYs would really want to live next to a large-scale mine, either. They are just enormous scars on the landscape. I understand that they are necessary, to some degree, to provide for the technologies that we enjoy, including life-saving and planet-saving technology. Even in my perfect world, where everyone is riding an electric bus or bike or walking around, some lithium is still needed in the near term. In the future, we could conceivably enter into a circular economy, but we don’t have the level of feedstock for that yet.

So the question remains, where are we going to mine? I don’t have an easy answer to that, but I will say that in the entire process of land use planning, the corporation is the protagonist. In the U.S., a place that I think most political scientists would say has more state capacity than a country in Africa or Latin America, we do not use that capacity to proactively plan land use. I think it would make sense to really rearrange the process such that governments plan with substantial community input, and then corporations, if we want to have private corporations doing this, get the ability to compete for contracts. I know that would be a big lift to change that policy dynamic, but I think we need to have the conversation.

You write a lot about this difficult dance between supply and demand in mining. What are you seeing right now in how the lithium industry is reacting to Trump’s dismantling of EV policy?

With Trump, it’s particularly interesting and bizarre because on the list of fast-tracked mines, you have several lithium mines and some lithium processing along with other “critical minerals.” He really wants to expand mining, to the point that the Pentagon is now the No. 1 investor in our only rare earth mine in the U.S. They bought 15% of MP Materials’ shares, the company that manages the Mountain Pass mine. And so Trump is fast-tracking mines, he’s sending huge amounts of public money to financially underwrite these mining companies. But yet, he’s destroying demand for rare earths. He loves to talk about AI and military tech — that’s a small slice of demand. It’s really about wind turbines and electric vehicle motors. That’s really where the demand is. With lithium, it’s even clearer.

That all seems like a recipe for prices to crash.

The thing is, they already had crashed because of a supply glut. But at the same time, the market will likely pick back up because we’re seeing so much action elsewhere in the world. It’s very easy to focus on the U.S., especially because the U.S. government is such a basket case right now. But if we zoom out, there’s been a bunch of recent reporting, including in Heatmap, on how rapidly the energy transition is going in other parts of the world, with China playing an enormous role not only on the trade side, but also in foreign direct investment, in setting up solar and EV manufacturing hubs in the Global South.

And so I think that Trump can dismantle EVs as much as he wants in the U.S., and that’s a shame given that transportation is our most polluting sector. I mean, that pains me as a climate activist. But the world is bigger than the U.S.

The last thing I’ll say — and this is another interesting contradiction — in the Big, Beautiful Bill, it’s not across the board against all green technologies. There’s this distinction that conservatives increasingly like to make called “clean, firm power.” So they put nuclear, geothermal, and battery storage in that. Now, battery storage, what is that made of? Lithium. So in a weird way, they like lithium mining, they like batteries for storage, they just don’t like electric vehicles. We’re still going to have lithium demand in the U.S., and lots of individual people will still buy electric cars, and blue states will still procure them for their public fleets. He’s not going to kill the market. He’s just going to slow its growth, primarily by making it less affordable for working and middle class people.

THE TOP FIVE

1. Orsted sells new shares at a steep discount

Orsted is offering investors a nearly 70% discount on the new shares issued to raise money to save its American offshore wind projects amid the Trump administration’s aggressive crackdown on the industry. The Danish energy giant won nearly unanimous approval from its shareholders earlier this month for a rights issue aimed at raising $9.4 billion. Shares in the company, which is half owned by the government in Copenhagen, closed around $32 each on Friday. But the offering of 901 million new shares came at a subscription rate of about $10.50 each. Orsted’s projects in the northeastern U.S. already “struggled” with what The Wall Street Journal listed as “supply-chain bottlenecks, higher interest rates, and trouble getting tax credits,” which culminated in the restructuring last year that saw the company “pull out of two high-profile wind projects off the coast of New Jersey.”

The offshore wind industry, as I noted in yesterday’s newsletter, is just starting to fight back. The owners of the Rhode Island offshore project Revolution Wind, which Trump halted unilaterally, filed a lawsuit claiming the administration illegally withdrew its already-finalized permits. After the administration filed a lawsuit to revoke the permits of US Wind’s big project off Maryland’s coast, the company said it intends “to vigorously defend those permits in federal court, and we are confident that the court will uphold their validity and prevent any adverse action against them.” But the multi-agency assault on offshore turbine projects has only escalated in recent months, as the timeline Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo produced shows. And Orsted is facing other headwinds. The company just warned investors of lower profits this year after weaker-than-forecast wind speeds reduced the output of its turbines.

2. Toyota halts U.S. EV sales amid recall of nearly 600,000 vehicles

Toyota issued a voluntary recall for some 591,000 Toyota and Lexus cars over a slight glitch in the display screen. The 12.3-inch screen could fail to turn on after the car started, or go black while driving. Toyota said it will begin notifying owners if affected vehicles by mid-November. The move came just days after the Japanese auto giant — which owns both its eponymous passenger car brand and the associated luxury line, Lexus — recalled 62,000 electric vehicles, including the Toyota bZ4X SUV and the Lexus RZ300e sedan and its luxury SUV, the RZ450. Subaru, in which Toyota owns a minority stake, is also recalling its electric SUV, the Solterra. With all four EVs, the issue revolved around a faulty windshield defroster that “may not remove frost, ice and/or fog from the windshield glass due to a software issue in the electrical control unit,” the company said in a press release..

3. Americans’ per-capita energy emissions fell in every state

States such as Mississippi and Idaho had the lowest drop in energy-related per-capita emissions.EIA

Americans who complain that the U.S. should bear less responsibility for mitigating climate change like to point out that China produces far more planet-heating emissions per year, and that India is not far behind. The cumulative nature of carbon in the atmosphere makes for an easy rebuke, since the U.S. and Western Europe are overwhelmingly responsible for the emissions of the past two centuries. But a less historically abstract response could be that Americans still have by far the highest per capita emissions of any large country. That doesn’t mean the U.S. isn’t making progress on a per capita level, though. Between 2005 and 2023, per capita emissions from primary energy consumption decreased in every U.S. state, with an average drop of 30%, even as the American population grew by 14%, according to a new analysis by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The dip is largely thanks to the electric power sector burning less coal. Increased electricity generation from natural gas, which releases about half as much carbon per unit of energy when burned as coal, and the growth of renewables such as wind and solar have reduced the need for the dirtier fuel. But the EIA forecasts that overall U.S. emissions are set to climb by 1% as electricity demand increases.

For those keen to shrink their individual carbon output at a much faster pace than American society at large, Heatmap’s award-winning Decarbonize Your Life series walks through the benefits and drawbacks to driving less, eating less steak, installing solar panels, and renovating homes to be more energy efficient.

4. Sierra Club names new leader

Following rebellions from various state chapters, the Sierra Club terminated its executive director, Ben Jealous, last month, as I reported here in this newsletter at the time. Now the group has named its new leader: Loren Blackford. The Sierra Club veteran, who served in various senior roles before taking on the interim executive director job last month, won unanimous support from the group’s board of directors on Saturday.

Jealous had previously served as a chief executive of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the 2018 Democratic nominee for Maryland governor before becoming the first non-white leader of the 133-year-old Sierra Club. His appointment marked a symbolic turning of the page from the group’s early chapters under its founder, John Muir, who made numerous derogatory remarks about Black and Native Americans. Jealous was accused of sexual harassment earlier this year.

5. Thermal battery startup Fourth Power raises $20 million

Thermal battery company Fourth Power just announced $20 million in follow-on funding, building on its $19 million Series A round from 2023. While other thermal storage companies such as Rondo and Antora are targeting the decarbonization of high-temperature industrial processes such as smelting or chemical manufacturing, Fourth Power aims to manufacture long-duration energy storage systems for utilities and power producers.

“In our view, electricity is the biggest problem that needs to be solved,” Fourth Power’s CEO Arvin Ganesan told Heatmap’s Katie Brigham. “There is certainly a future application for heat, but we don’t think that’s where to start.” The company’s tech works by taking in excess renewable electricity from the grid, which is used to heat up liquid tin to 2,400 degrees Celsius, nearly half the temperature of the sun’s surface. That heat is then stored in carbon blocks and later converted back into electricity using thermophotovoltaic cells. This latest funding will accelerate the deployment of the startup’s first one megawatt hour demonstration plant.

THE KICKER

The tropical storm that later became Hurricane María formed exactly eight years ago today and went on to lay waste to Puerto Rico’s aging electrical system. The grid remains fragile and expensive, with frequent outages and some of the highest rates in the U.S. on the hours when the power is accessible. That has spurred a boom in rooftop solar panels. Now more than 10% of the island’s electricity consumption comes from rooftop solar power. Data released by the grid operator LUMA Energy showed approximately 1.2 gigawatts of residential and commercial rooftop solar had been installed under Puerto Rico’s net-metering regulations as of June 2025. New analysis by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis found that is equal to about 10.3% of Puerto Rico’s total power consumption — and that’s not counting any off-grid systems.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTYwNDYyNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2OTMxMjQ2Nn0.nZsWx0gf9y3K4bUjVC-60tPw7nscthtwKijwKBDeqN8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-09-17 19:59:53.096157

OMAHA, Neb., September 17, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Green Plains Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRE) today announced that it has entered into an agreement with an affiliate of Freepoint Commodities LLC (Freepoint) to sell Clean Fuel Production Credits, also known as 45Z tax credits, generated in 2025 under the Inflation Reduction Act.

The initial credits will be generated from low-carbon intensity ethanol production at Green Plains’ three Nebraska facilities. A portion of these credits are being generated prior to the expected launch of carbon capture later this year, highlighting the competitive carbon intensity (CI) profile of the company’s current strategy and operations. Green Plains has also signed a term sheet with Freepoint to monetize tax credits from three additional facilities expected to qualify under 45Z during 2025.

""Executing this agreement and term sheet aligns with our long-term strategy to monetize the value we’re creating through low-CI production,"" said Chris Osowski, Chief Executive Officer. ""Our focus on operational excellence has improved utilization and yields across our platform, while also lowering carbon intensity – enabling several plants to qualify for 45Z credits during the current year. While we continue to advance carbon capture through the Trailblazer CCS project, this agreement demonstrates our ability to create near-term value from clean fuel production and expands our visibility into the monetization of carbon credits going forward.""

""This transaction marks a milestone in the rapidly evolving transferable tax credit market, enabling the transfer and monetization of 45Z Credits at an impactful scale. We're proud to collaborate with Green Plains on this innovative structure and establish the foundation for a multiyear relationship that delivers meaningful value to all stakeholders,"" said Connor Nix, Managing Director, Biofuels and Renewable Products at Freepoint.

The agreement covers the anticipated 2025 production year credits for the three Nebraska facilities, with full-year credits included where operations allow. The parties may agree on mutually satisfactory terms to extend the agreement to purchase 45Z credits for 2026-2029. The credits will be transferred through a direct transfer mechanism and are supported by third-party emissions verification and tax insurance.

Based on current expectations for production volumes and eligible gallons, the agreement and term sheet combined are expected to generate between $40 and $50 million in 2025 45Z EBITDA net of discounts and after applicable operating expenses, with the first credits being recorded in the third quarter. The final proceeds are dependent on actual production and the timing of startup for the carbon capture systems at Green Plains’ Nebraska facilities.

What Are Enhanced Premium Tax Credits?

What the New Bill Proposes The newly introduced House Republican bill would: Extend the enhanced tax credits for one year (through plan year 2026).","The Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) enhanced Premium Tax Credits have been a cornerstone of record marketplace enrollment. Extended in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, they are set to expire at the end of 2025. However, a group of House Republicans are introducing new legislation

that would extend these subsidies for one additional year, through 2026.

This move highlights both the political sensitivity and the financial importance of these credits — but for employers, it also raises questions about what happens next and how to prepare for either outcome.

What Are Enhanced Premium Tax Credits?

Enhanced Premium Tax Credits were enacted during COVID-19 relief efforts and later extended. They:

Lowered average premium costs by $705 per year.

Expanded eligibility beyond 400% of the federal poverty level.

Fueled historic ACA Marketplace growth, particularly in states with high uninsured rates.

Without an extension, a projected 3.8 million people would lose coverage each year between 2026-2034 and premiums could rise 18 percent on average for 2026, according to analysis from the research firm KFF of insurance filings across the country.

What the New Bill Proposes

The newly introduced House Republican bill would:

Extend the enhanced tax credits for one year (through plan year 2026).

Delay but not eliminate the cliff of expiring subsidies.

Provide temporary relief for families facing steep premium increases.

While the bill signals recognition of the subsidies’ popularity, its passage remains uncertain due to cost concerns, partisan divisions, and competing legislative priorities.

Why It Matters for Employers

The prospect of PTCs going away after 2025 would increase healthcare costs but would remove a notable compliance hurdle for employers.

While expanded PTC eligibility benefits employees and their families, it also raises compliance risks for employers. PTCs serve as triggers for the IRS to identify potential ACA non-compliance.

When an employee receives a PTC from a state or federal health exchange, the IRS cross-references the request with the employer’s ACA filings to identify organizations that may not be compliant with the ACA’s Employer Mandate.

However, there are other downstream effects that could surface if PTCs are not extended.

When Marketplace subsidies shrink, more individuals may seek coverage through employer-sponsored plans. This could lead to:

Increased enrollment activity outside of open enrollment periods.

Increased enrollment costs as more employees turn to employer sponsored coverage

How to Prepare Now

Regardless of whether the one-year extension passes, maintaining ACA compliance is essential for large employers. Proactive steps include:

Conducting a Penalty Risk Assessment to identify potential exposure before filings.

Reviewing Safe Harbor Strategies to ensure contribution amounts meet the 2026 affordability threshold.

Maintaining Audit-Ready Records for ACA filings, including affordability calculations and coverage offers.

Leveraging Seamless Integrations with payroll and benefits systems to ensure accurate data reporting.

How Trusaic Can Help

Trusaic’s ACA Compliance Solution is built to help employers navigate shifting ACA requirements:

Real-Time Eligibility Tracking: Manage coverage obligations in dynamic workforces.

Safe Harbor Optimization: Calculate contributions with confidence under evolving affordability rules.

Penalty Risk Assessment: Spot compliance gaps before they lead to IRS fines.

Audit-Ready Reporting: Ensure filings stand up to scrutiny, even in an uncertain regulatory environment.

Final Thoughts

The proposed one-year extension of PTCs underscores the political and economic stakes of ACA policy. But whether subsidies are extended temporarily or eventually expire, employers must remain vigilant.

By adopting a proactive compliance strategy now, organizations can safeguard against volatility, mitigate IRS penalty risks, and remain compliant in the face of shifting ACA regulations.",https://trusaic.com/wp-content/uploads/Sept.-17-Premium-Tax-Credits-Extended.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 20:00:19.740839
,Congress,2025-09-17 20:37:12+00:00,the Guardian,Trump DoJ seeks to kill Vermont law that makes big oil pay for climate harm - The Guardian,"Dharna Noor, www.theguardian.com, dharna-noor",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/17/trump-vermont-oil-climate-superfund-act,"Donald Trump’s justice department has asked a judge to shut down a Vermont law which holds major polluters financially responsible for climate damages.
“This law is about holding big oil accountable for a portion of the damage it has already brought to Vermont’s farms, businesses, homeowners and communities,” said Paul Burns, executive director of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, one of the organizations that helped to pass Vermont’s Climate Superfund law.
Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice-president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, said her organization would “continue to defend the state’s climate superfund law meant to protect the wallets of Vermont’s families and businesses.
In an April executive order, Trump instructed the justice department to “stop the enforcement” of climate superfund policies.
Legislators in at least a dozen states are looking to introduce or reintroduce climate superfund bills in 2026, he said.","Donald Trump’s justice department has asked a judge to shut down a Vermont law which holds major polluters financially responsible for climate damages.

In a brief filed on Monday in a federal court in Burlington, the administration said the policy was “unlawful on its face” and pushed the court to “end Vermont’s lawless experiment”.

“The Court should deny the motions to dismiss, grant the United States’ motion for summary judgment, declare the Superfund Act unconstitutional and unenforceable, and permanently enjoin Defendants from taking any actions to implement or enforce it,” Riley Walters, counsel to an acting assistant attorney general, wrote in the motion.

Passed in 2024, the Vermont policy – known as the Climate Superfund Act – requires major polluters to pay for their carbon emissions, which have warmed the planet and increased the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, such as the floods which wreaked $1bn in damage on the state last year. New York passed a similar measure in December.

“This law is about holding big oil accountable for a portion of the damage it has already brought to Vermont’s farms, businesses, homeowners and communities,” said Paul Burns, executive director of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, one of the organizations that helped to pass Vermont’s Climate Superfund law. “Vermont is well within its rights to protect its people in this way.”

The filing comes four months after the Department of Justice and Environmental Protection Agency sued Vermont and New York over the laws. In August, the state and two non-profits who were granted intervenor status, the Conservation Law Foundation and the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont, asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuit.

Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice-president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, said her organization would “continue to defend the state’s climate superfund law meant to protect the wallets of Vermont’s families and businesses.

“Let’s be clear: this law is not a sweeping effort to regulate global greenhouse gas emissions, punish fossil fuel companies, or set federal policy on climate change,” she said. “This is Vermont using its legal right to raise revenue and protect the health, safety, and wellbeing of its residents from the ruinous, inescapable consequences of climate change.”

The motion is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to quash climate accountability efforts and environmental regulations. In an April executive order, Trump instructed the justice department to “stop the enforcement” of climate superfund policies.

In July, the administration proposed undoing the 2009 “endangerment finding”, which says planet-warming emissions endanger public health and should therefore be regulated under the Clean Air Act – the most audacious of more than 150 environmental rollbacks launched since Trump retook office in January.

Jamie Henn, director of the anti-fossil fuel non-profit Fossil Free Media, which backs the superfund laws, said Trump’s assault would not deter efforts to bring about financial accountability for global warming. Legislators in at least a dozen states are looking to introduce or reintroduce climate superfund bills in 2026, he said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fba9b08642a0a838556897ad56689df9981880d6/443_0_4410_3530/master/4410.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=51edb59cbf06373ad3406edf2cad5242",N,,2025-09-17 18:06:14.880366

The report, “2025 North America virtual power plant market report,” finds that the VPP market broadened more than it deepened, with the number of company deployments, unique offtakers and market and utility programs monetized each growing more than 33%, while total capacity grew a more modest 13.7%.

“Utility program caps, capacity accreditation reforms and market barriers have prevented capacity from growing as fast as market activity,” said Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid edge for Wood Mackenzie.

Market maturation continues

The share of VPP wholesale market capacity from residential customers increased to 10.2%, from 8.8% in 2024, still reflecting market barriers to small customers. Third-party data access for enrollment and market settlement are the primary blockers.

Penetration of battery storage and EV in VPP deployments continues, with 61% as many deployments including these technologies as those including smart thermostats, the incumbent technology.

Leading markets

California, Texas, New York and Massachusetts are the leading states, representing 37% of VPP deployments. Meanwhile, PJM and ERCOT, the regions with the greatest utility commitments to data center capacity, also have the greatest disclosed VPP offtake capacity.

“While data centers are the source of new load, there’s an enormous opportunity to tap VPPs as the new source of grid flexibility,” said Hertz-Shargel.

Offtake growth

The top 25 VPP offtakers procured over 100 MW each this year, while over half of all offtakers increased the number of deployments under them by at least 30% compared to last year, showing the breadth of the market. An “independent distributed power producer” business model has emerged, whose thesis is that energy arbitrage and grid service revenue can finance an electricity retailer’s third-party-owned storage offering.

Regulatory pushback

A majority of VPP aggregators and software providers do not support utilities rate basing DERs, a key plank of the Distributed Capacity Procurement model for utilities.

“This model is seen as limiting access of private capital and aggregators from the DER market, rather than leveraging customer and third-party-owned resources,” said Hertz-Shargel. “Meanwhile, there is broad consensus among experienced wholesale market participants that FERC Order 2222 was a missed opportunity and will not have a significant impact on market access.”

That’s one of the takeaways from EY’s latest Mobility Lens Forecaster, which predicts a slower trajectory on mass EV adoption in the US because of federal policy changes, affordability issues, and gaps in charging infrastructure.
The report underscores the risks of the US EV sector falling behind competitors in China and Europe.
“The EV transition is advancing—but unevenly,” Constantin Gall, EY global aerospace, defense, and mobility leader, said in a statement.

That’s one of the takeaways from EY’s latest Mobility Lens Forecaster, which predicts a slower trajectory on mass EV adoption in the US because of federal policy changes, affordability issues, and gaps in charging infrastructure.

The report underscores the risks of the US EV sector falling behind competitors in China and Europe. It also emphasizes that, though the road to full electrification may be bumpy, the world will one day get there.

“Electrification is the future…I think there’s a lot of questions out there as to whether or not people will fully adapt,” George Lenyo, EY Americas automotive leader, told Tech Brew. “The Mobility Lens Forecast really says, ‘Yes, they will,’ it’s just going to take longer than maybe people would have anticipated.”

Here’s what EY predicts is in store for the US market:

The timeline for battery-electric vehicles reaching 50% of new-vehicle sales has shifted from 2034 to 2039.

Alternative scenarios show BEVs reaching 50% of the market as early as 2036 or as late as 2042.

A sales “surge” is expected this year as buyers get ahead of the expiration of EV tax credits under President Donald Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill, followed by a decrease in 2026–2027.

Hybrid vehicle sales could peak at 34% of new-vehicle sales in 2034.

And by 2050, the forecast calls for BEVs to make up more than 95% of the market.

In China, meanwhile, EY forecasts that BEVs will make up more than half of new light-vehicle sales by 2033, “driven by lower costs and supportive policies” such as new vehicle emission standards—underscoring that the country “is pulling ahead in the global shift to EVs.” BEV adoption is expected to slow in Europe through 2027, but then to exceed 50% market share by 2032.

“The EV transition is advancing—but unevenly,” Constantin Gall, EY global aerospace, defense, and mobility leader, said in a statement. “The US faces policy uncertainty, high costs, and infrastructure gaps.”

Speed bumps: Lenyo pointed to tariffs and other policy changes, including the sunsetting this month of the EV tax incentives, as factors that explain the expected slowdown in US EV sales growth. The report also suggests that, starting in 2026, the price gap between BEVs and internal combustion engine vehicles could widen.

“The risk for the US is, how far do we fall behind because of these constraints that have been put upon them recently to deal with. I think that the OEMs are very resilient,” Lenyo said.

“They have to keep one foot in today and constantly be looking at [the] future of full electrification,” he added, “and balancing that investment accordingly.”

For adoption rates in the US to catch up with Europe and China, Lenyo said that affordability and infrastructure will need to improve, as will consumer education. The US EV charging sector is making progress on building more public fast chargers with the amenities that consumers are looking for, but there’s more work to be done.

“The big takeaway: Electrification is the future,” Lenyo said. “We see all major sections of the world, whether it’s the US, Europe, or China, getting there, roughly, by 2050. But the pace of that, specifically in the US, has slowed.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/1f862a4beb7dc8b49a20c1864db5c627c189415b-1500x1000.jpg?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-09-17 17:00:37.956350

Green Plains Inc.","Agreement enables sale of 2025 Clean Fuel Production Credits from Nebraska facilities; term sheet signed to expand program to additional sites

Green Plains Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRE) today announced that it has entered into an agreement with an affiliate of Freepoint Commodities LLC (Freepoint) to sell Clean Fuel Production Credits, also known as 45Z tax credits, generated in 2025 under the Inflation Reduction Act.

The initial credits will be generated from low-carbon intensity ethanol production at Green Plains’ three Nebraska facilities. A portion of these credits are being generated prior to the expected launch of carbon capture later this year, highlighting the competitive carbon intensity (CI) profile of the company’s current strategy and operations. Green Plains has also signed a term sheet with Freepoint to monetize tax credits from three additional facilities expected to qualify under 45Z during 2025.

“Executing this agreement and term sheet aligns with our long-term strategy to monetize the value we’re creating through low-CI production,” said Chris Osowski, Chief Executive Officer. “Our focus on operational excellence has improved utilization and yields across our platform, while also lowering carbon intensity – enabling several plants to qualify for 45Z credits during the current year. While we continue to advance carbon capture through the Trailblazer CCS project, this agreement demonstrates our ability to create near-term value from clean fuel production and expands our visibility into the monetization of carbon credits going forward.”

“This transaction marks a milestone in the rapidly evolving transferable tax credit market, enabling the transfer and monetization of 45Z Credits at an impactful scale. We're proud to collaborate with Green Plains on this innovative structure and establish the foundation for a multiyear relationship that delivers meaningful value to all stakeholders,” said Connor Nix, Managing Director, Biofuels and Renewable Products at Freepoint.

The agreement covers the anticipated 2025 production year credits for the three Nebraska facilities, with full-year credits included where operations allow. The parties may agree on mutually satisfactory terms to extend the agreement to purchase 45Z credits for 2026-2029. The credits will be transferred through a direct transfer mechanism and are supported by third-party emissions verification and tax insurance.

Based on current expectations for production volumes and eligible gallons, the agreement and term sheet combined are expected to generate between $40 and $50 million in 2025 45Z EBITDA net of discounts and after applicable operating expenses, with the first credits being recorded in the third quarter. The final proceeds are dependent on actual production and the timing of startup for the carbon capture systems at Green Plains’ Nebraska facilities.

“And they get into a lot of trouble when they don’t, so they’re supposed to appropriately invest in a resilient infrastructure.” And in a crisis situation like the one that nearly occurred in 2022, distributed generation could be a literal lifesaver.","Hackers nearly taking over US energy plants. Federal cybersecurity groups thwarting the attacks. These alarming events aren’t plot points in a geopolitical thriller—this actually happened in 2022 when operators connected to Russia hacked into the US energy supply. Such an attack would have left everyday Americans without power and potentially no way to get it.

That is, unless they had distributed generation systems on or near their homes and businesses. Distributed generation is power at or near the location where it’s being consumed, like residential solar or heat pumps. It can also be solar panels on the roofs of commercial buildings that help power their business operations.

At a time when the US grid is under a lot of strain from excess demand and fluctuating supply, distributed generation stands to be an impactful solution, according to Richard Dovere, CEO of Dispatch Energy, which designs behind-the-meter renewable energy systems.

According to Dovere, one of the “best applications of distributed generation” is helping utilities avoid pricey infrastructure updates, by incentivizing consumers to invest in distributed generation resources like rooftop solar that increase resiliency when the grid is experiencing outages.

“Utilities are regulated monopolies, but they have an obligation to serve their customers reliably,” Dovere told Tech Brew. “And they get into a lot of trouble when they don’t, so they’re supposed to appropriately invest in a resilient infrastructure.”

And in a crisis situation like the one that nearly occurred in 2022, distributed generation could be a literal lifesaver.

“Our grid stability is a major vulnerability,” Dovere said. “If your power goes out and your grandmother’s on an oxygen machine, I don’t think you care about the [internal rate of return] of the [power] system.”

Dovere added that the Trump administration is using renewable energy resources as a “punching bag” by phasing out tax credits for solar energy. The administration has favored geothermal and nuclear energy, and many Republicans in Congress have pushed for an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy.

Dovere told Tech Brew that regardless of price, distributed solar is the best way “to service the largest amount of people to provide them at least some modicum of power.”

“Getting rid of solar renewable tax credits makes it more expensive,” Dovere said, but “people need the power.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/c105982c55dbe7c202c9920759330fff2da851d6-5464x3640.jpg?rect=0,385,5464,2869&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-09-17 17:00:55.316540

He expects it’s going to be much harder to convince property owners to invest in solar once the federal tax incentive goes away.
This isn’t the first time Vermont’s solar industry has faced headwinds in recent years, yet it has still managed to prosper.
When the residential solar tax credit goes away, McCarthy expects it will hit Vermont harder than places such as New York, where state support for solar is stronger.
Renewable Energy Vermont, a trade group, is likely to push for state regulatory changes to better support the industry.","After the election of President Donald Trump last November, Chandler Evans began to worry that federal policies supporting renewable energy might be in jeopardy. The home Evans and his wife purchased in North Pomfret in 2022 already had a solar array on the barn, but he knew they’d need more juice for the heat pumps they hoped to add.

So, Evans got in touch with Catamount Solar, one of Vermont’s largest installers, and started strategizing how to add panels to his home before the tax credits for such systems dried up.

He’s glad he did. The federal spending bill that Trump signed into law on July 4 eliminates the long-standing 30 percent federal income tax credit for residential solar systems at the end of 2025. In Vermont, the change could jeopardize hundreds of good-paying jobs in the solar industry and slow down efforts to reduce fossil fuel emissions.

“I’m sad the incentives are going away,” Evans said. “It seems like a step backward instead of a step forward.”

The cuts threaten a sector that has grown into a pillar of the state’s economy. Despite Vermont’s long, dark winters, about 16 percent of the electricity generated in the state comes from solar. Overall, more than 18,000 people in Vermont — 6 percent of the workforce — hold clean energy jobs, according to a 2024 report from the Department of Public Service. About 1,800 of those workers sell or install solar systems, with most others engaged in energy-efficiency work such as insulating homes and installing heat pumps.

For the moment, the solar business is booming, thanks to people such as Evans who are racing to take advantage of the tax credits while they last. The incentive is a significant one: Homeowners who install a typical $35,000 array can deduct $10,500 from their federal income tax bill. So many people want to install solar that crews can’t keep up. Catamount, which placed 20 new panels atop Evans’ home earlier this month, is booked solid through the end of the year, general manager Jarred Cobb said.

SunCommon, the state’s largest residential solar installer, will likely reach that point later this month, president Mike McCarthy said last week.

“Our phones are ringing off the hook right now,” he said.

The Waterbury-based company is scrambling to get systems designed, permitted, financed and installed before the deadline. It’s a heady time, but it’s one that McCarthy knows will be short-lived. He expects it’s going to be much harder to convince property owners to invest in solar once the federal tax incentive goes away.

“It’s really unfortunate,” McCarthy said. “What [the federal budget bill] did to the residential solar tax credit is an assault on this industry.”

“I am very much feeling like we are battening down the hatches and shoring ourselves up for a storm,” he added.

SunCommon could look very different in the future as the solar landscape adapts to the federal changes, McCarthy said. (The Vermont company was purchased last year by the Houston-based investment firm Siltstone Capital after its own parent, iSun, went bankrupt.) It’s possible, for example, that SunCommon could focus on commercial installations, which still qualify for tax incentives but will face stricter rules and tighter timelines.

Nearly half of SunCommon’s revenue already comes from commercial customers. The firm recently scored the contract to install a $500,000 array atop the new Burlington High School, McCarthy noted, and has been shifting some commercial work to next year so it can focus on time-sensitive residential jobs.

The company is also considering a new business model in which it would lease solar arrays to homeowners rather than selling them. Since the homeowner doesn’t own the system, the arrangement is considered a commercial installation and may still generate tax credits.

Navigating these and other shifts — including ever-changing tariffs and complex new requirements on where solar components are made — has been nerve-racking, McCarthy said.

“No business wants to operate in an environment of uncertainty about what your entire industry is going to look like in six months to a year,” he said.

And there’s more: Vermont had been anticipating $62.5 million in grants from a $7 billion federal program called Solar for All. Established under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the program was designed to help low-income Vermonters afford solar.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lee Zeldin killed the program in August, claiming it was “grift” and a “boondoggle.” U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a strong supporter of Solar for All, called its elimination illegal and vowed to fight the move. The state Department of Public Service, which had already set up a program to distribute the money in Vermont, also pledged to get the funding restored, including through litigation if needed.

Attorney General Charity Clark, no stranger to suing the Trump administration, said her team is “building the best path forward” to recoup the funds by analyzing a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision affecting how states can fight grant cancellations.

“What the Trump Administration is doing is unconstitutional, and I want to reassure Vermonters that I will continue to fight,” she said in a statement.

This isn’t the first time Vermont’s solar industry has faced headwinds in recent years, yet it has still managed to prosper. Utility regulators have been steadily reducing the amount that homeowners are reimbursed for the solar power they sell to the grid. Permitting costs are high, and there can be intense local opposition to large projects, especially if they are highly visible or covering farmland.

For these and other reasons, SunCommon and larger companies have opened offices in states where installation costs are lower. When the residential solar tax credit goes away, McCarthy expects it will hit Vermont harder than places such as New York, where state support for solar is stronger.

Renewable Energy Vermont, a trade group, is likely to push for state regulatory changes to better support the industry.

“Writ large, the impact on Vermont and New England of the actions of the Trump administration and the Congress will be significant,” said Peter Sterling, the group’s executive director. “It increases our reliance on natural gas, which is very expensive.” How changing federal policies will affect the transition to 100 percent renewable energy is a focus of the group’s annual conference in South Burlington on October 15.

The state could help the industry in several ways, Sterling said. Permitting reforms could speed up approval of larger solar projects; regulators or lawmakers could increase what solar system owners are paid for the power they feed into the grid.

The Public Utility Commission will reset that rate next year, but it’s too soon to say whether the Department of Public Service will advocate for an increase, said TJ Poor, its director of efficiency and energy resources.

Some in the industry acknowledge the challenges ahead but say solar’s future remains bright. Vermonters are so unhappy that the country is shifting back toward fossil fuels under Trump that they may continue to embrace solar in spite of his effort to kill it, said Cobb, the manager at Catamount.

“I hope,” he said, “that there’s an ethos in Vermont of: Fuck whatever’s happening in Washington — we’re going to keep doing things the way we’re doing things.”

Solar installations will still make economic as well as environmental sense in the future as photovoltaic technology improves and component costs continue to decline, according to Megan Beattie, director of sales and marketing for South Burlington-based Green Mountain Solar. And as electric bills rise, home solar offers people a way to lock in electricity costs now, sidestepping future rate increases, she noted.

“The value proposition for solar is definitively still there,” Beattie said. “Obviously the tax credit ending is abrupt and it creates a bit of a shift, but we don’t see it killing the solar industry by any means.”

With central generation challenged by supply chains, permitting, interconnection queues and - particularly for natural gas generation - construction costs, utilities have increasingly been looking to distributed resources to fill the gap. These resources are aggregated into virtual power plants (VPPs) which are monetized through utility, energy retailer, and wholesale market programs.

A market that is broadening faster than it is deepening

There was enormous market activity over the last year. Company deployments, unique offtakers, and programs monetized each grew over 33% year-over-year. This reflects pull from new flexibility buyers as well as push from new VPP players, many who are filling new roles in the value chain.

At the same time, overall VPP capacity grew 13.7%. This more modest growth indicates a market that is broadening faster than it is deepening. Enrollment caps on utility programs, capacity accreditation reforms in power markets (the migration to effective load carrying capability), and market barriers to small customers have limited capacity growth in existing programs.

VPP offtakes are largest where utility data center commitments are largest

A particularly interesting finding is that while California, Texas, New York, and Massachusetts are the leading states, representing 37% of all VPP deployments, PJM and ERCOT, the regions with the greatest utility commitments to data center capacity, also have the greatest disclosed VPP offtake capacity. This drives home the opportunity for utilities and even hyperscalers themselves to procure new VPP capacity to offset data center coincident peak demand, enabling faster grid connection. In this way homeowners and business owners might actually earn revenue from the connection of new data centers, offsetting potential bill increases.

A fault line over utility ownership over DER

A related finding regards utility ownership of DER, a foundational element of the Distributed Capacity Procurement model. A survey of key players revealed that while hardwire providers are understandably enthusiastic about utilities as a new sales channel, the majority of other VPP companies do not support utilities rate basing DER. This approach could limit private capital and aggregator access to the DER market, unlike the third-party VPP procurement model above. There is far more enthusiasm for utilities integrating DER into system planning and operations, specifying where such resources are needed, but letting the market supply them, via customer programs and competitive solicitations. In this way the market can find the lowest-cost solution and drive innovation across the whole value chain, from program marketing to cross-technology optimization.

The facility integrates advanced automation, R&D capabilities, and sustainable design features to support international supply chains, Elcogen said, adding that it is powered by a 9 MW energy supply from the nearby Iru Power Plant and incorporates sustainability measures such as process heat reuse and thermal oxidisers to reduce emissions.

With approximately €50 million in capital investment, the facility was reportedly delivered on time and on budget by construction partner Maru Ehitus AS and equipment suppliers. Funding for the project was provided by Elcogen stakeholders, including U.S.-based energy technology company Baker Hughes and South Korea’s conglomerate HD Hyundai. As informed, the project also received support from the European Innovation Fund, which has committed an additional €25 million to expand capacity under Elcogen’s ELCO I initiative.

Enn Õunpuu, CEO of Elcogen, stated: “This new facility is built for scale, speed, and global impact. As demand for reliable Solid Oxide-based clean energy solutions accelerates worldwide, Elcogen is now uniquely positioned to deliver the high-performance technology the market needs, at commercial volumes.”

“As the name implies, ELCO I serves as a flagship model designed to guide future development initiatives globally. It reflects our broader vision for international expansion and leadership in clean energy solutions. We plan to eventually license our technology and manufacturing blueprint to trusted partners. This ensures consistent IP control while enabling local manufacturing – a particularly attractive proposition for markets focused on domestic production and resilient supply chains.”

Chris Nash, Chair of Elcogen’s Board of Directors, remarked: “This new facility sends a strong message that Elcogen is ready for large scale delivery. We are committed to partnering with global system integrators, strategic partners and governments to build resilient, low-carbon energy systems of the future.”

Founded in 2001, Elcogen supplies fuel cell and electrolyzer components to various clean energy projects. The company’s components – cells, stacks, and modules – are reportedly integrated into third-party systems for a wide range of applications, including distributed energy, off-grid and stationary power, industrial backup, green hydrogen production, and Power-to-X solutions.

Elcogen’s workforce is said to include nearly 150 employees from over 20 nationalities. The new facility is expected to eventually support the creation of circa 300 local jobs as the company transitions to mass production and increases global delivery capabilities.

Õunpuu noted: “Yes, we are expanding capacity, but this is also about increasing the performance of our products and reducing costs for our partners across the energy value chain. This is a facility designed to deliver on the promise of clean energy, now.”

Commenting on the opening of the facility, Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, CEO of Hydrogen Europe, said: “With Elcogen’s new facility, Europe gains a powerful boost in electrolysis and fuel cell capacity – technologies that are inseparable from the hydrogen economy. The roots of excellence now bear fruit on an industrial scale. This makes us proud as Europeans: hydrogen is the people’s molecule, and Estonia shows how to turn vision into reality.”

In other 2025 news, Elcogen secured a €5 million investment from SmartCap, a venture capital fund supporting Estonian greentech companies. Furthermore, the manufacturer entered into a non-exclusive memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Swiss industrial equipment supplier Casale to collaborate on green ammonia and other Power-to-X projects.

Credits phase out sooner for wind, solar, and certain manufacturing components, so consider accelerated construction and financing schedules.","I. Background

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) into law, marking a significant turn in US clean energy policy. The new law dismantles or narrows many of the clean energy tax credits introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). For developers, manufacturers, and investors, the message is clear: access to federal tax credits is shrinking, and the rules for eligibility are tightening.

Days after signing the OBBBA, on July 7, President Trump reinforced this policy shift with an executive order (EO 14315) directing federal agencies to end support for wind, solar, and other “green” technologies. Treasury was tasked with enforcing accelerated deadlines and stricter rules to prevent projects from using safe harbors to lock in credits for wind and solar. Together, the OBBBA and EO 14315 set the stage for a new framework that scales back incentives and imposes tougher compliance hurdles, particularly around foreign ownership and supply chain sourcing.

II. New IRS Guidance: “Beginning of Construction” Rules

The IRS acted quickly, following EO 14315 with Notice 2025-42, which provides new rules addressing when wind and solar projects are considered to have “begun construction” for purposes of qualifying for the production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) under Sections 45Y and 48E, respectively.[1] This notice significantly narrows the pathways available to developers.

The familiar “5% safe harbor” introduced under Notice 2013-29 and further clarified under various IRS notices, such as Notice 2018-59 and Notice 2022-61 (Prior Notices), is eliminated for most wind and solar projects. Instead, taxpayers must now satisfy the “physical work test,” which requires that physical work of a significant nature begins before July 5, 2026. That said, the 5% safe harbor is preserved for small-scale solar projects (1.5 MW or less), recognizing the unique challenges for distributed generation.

Qualifying work under the physical work test can include on-site activities such as excavation for wind turbine foundations or installation of racking for solar panels, as well as certain off-site manufacturing activities performed pursuant to binding written contracts. Preliminary steps like permitting or site clearing are not counted toward the physical work test.

Once construction begins, projects must maintain a continuous program of construction (i.e., the “continuity requirement”). That said, the “continuity safe harbor” from the Prior Notices still exists. If a project is placed in service within four years of the end of the year in which construction began, the project is treated as having satisfied the continuity requirement. If the construction period extends beyond the four-year safe harbor, a solar developer can no longer rely on merely showing “continuous efforts” but must be able to demonstrate a continuous program of construction that involves continuing physical work of a significant nature.

Fortunately, Notice 2025-42 preserves a list of excusable disruptions, such as weather, interconnection delays, and permitting delays, for purposes of satisfying the continuity requirement.

Finally, it is worth noting that Notice 2025-42 specially provides that the “beginning of construction” rules set forth in the notice are not intended to address the “beginning of construction” rules for purposes of determining whether a project is subject to the new restrictions on foreign involvement discussed below. Such guidance is currently being prepared by Treasury.

For developers, the takeaway is clear: simply incurring costs or securing contracts will no longer be sufficient. Projects must demonstrate physical progress of a significant nature on or before the July 4, 2026 deadline to remain eligible for PTCs or ITCs without being subject to the accelerated December 31, 2027 placed-in-service deadline.

III. Change Under the OBBBA

New Restrictions on Foreign Involvement

A central feature of the OBBBA is the creation of the Prohibited Foreign Entity (PFE) regime. The goal is to limit foreign influence in the US clean energy sector, especially from countries deemed adversarial to the United States, such as China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran.

The rules operate on two levels:

Specified Foreign Entities (SFEs): entities directly tied to adversarial governments or named in laws like the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.

Foreign-Influenced Entities (FIEs): entities where an SFE has significant influence, such as owning at least 25%, holding certain debt interests, or having contractual control.

Even if a developer isn’t itself an SFE or FIE, projects can still lose eligibility if (1) they begin construction after December 31, 2025, and (2) they rely too heavily on goods or services sourced from PFEs. Treasury will measure this through a “material assistance” test, which compares overall project costs with the portion tied to PFEs. The thresholds will tighten overtime — wind and solar projects must show 40% non-PFE content in 2026, rising to 60% by 2030. Similar rules will apply across technologies, from batteries to inverters to critical minerals.

While official safe harbor tables won’t arrive until late 2026, transitional relief allows developers to rely on IRS Notice 2025-08 and supplier certifications in the meantime. Developers will need to closely track supply chains now, as eligibility will become progressively harder to maintain. As noted above, the “beginning of construction” rules under Notice 2025-42 for purposes of determining whether a project is eligible for PTCs or ITCs are not intended to address the “beginning of construction” rules for purposes of determining whether a project is subject to the “material assistance” restrictions. Until Treasury issues specific guidance, the historic “beginning of construction” rules remain applicable for this purpose.

Key Changes by Credit

Investment Tax Credit (Section 48E): Wind and solar face early termination deadlines — in order to be eligible for this credit, construction must begin on or before July 4, 2026, or, for projects beginning construction after July 4, 2026, such projects must be placed in service by the end of 2027. As discussed earlier, Notice 2025-42 introduced new rules on when wind and solar projects are considered to have begun construction, which further narrows eligibility. That said, other technologies like geothermal, nuclear, and hydrogen retain longer timelines, with a gradual phaseout starting in 2034.

Production Tax Credits (Section 45Y): Similarly, wind and solar projects must meet the July 4, 2026 “beginning of construction” date or the December 31, 2027 placed-in-service deadline. Other technologies, such as geothermal, hydrogen, and nuclear projects, are subject to the same phaseout schedule as the Section 48E ITCs.

Advanced Manufacturing Production Credits (Section 45X): Wind components produced and sold after December 31, 2027 are ineligible for the Section 45X credit. With respect to critical minerals, the OBBBA (1) included metallurgical coal as an applicable critical mineral, and (2) provided for a critical mineral phaseout beginning in 2031 (except for metallurgical coal, which phases out beginning in 2030). In addition, the OBBBA tightened the definition of “battery modules” eligible for the Section 45X credit by clarifying that a battery module is comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality. The PFE rules also apply here, forcing manufacturers to reevaluate sourcing strategies.

Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q): Credit amounts are equalized at $17 per ton (base) for carbon captured from industrial and power facilities (increased to $85 per ton if the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are satisfied) and $36 per ton (base) for direct air capture (increased to $180 per ton if the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are satisfied), regardless of end use. But PFE restrictions will now limit who can claim or transfer the Section 45Q credits.

Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit (Section 45U): The Section 45U credit for electricity production at existing nuclear power plants that were operational at the time of enactment of the IRA (i.e., placed in service prior to August 16, 2022) remains intact through 2032, but with new restrictions on sourcing nuclear fuel from covered nations. Specifically, after December 31, 2027, taxpayers must certify that any nuclear fuel was not sourced from covered nations or “covered entities” (unless pursuant to a binding contract in force prior to January 1, 2023). In addition, SFEs are not eligible to claim the Section 45U credit after the date of enactment of the OBBBA, and FIEs cannot claim the Section 45U credit for tax year beginning after the second anniversary of the date of enactment.

Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (Section 45V): Eligibility for the per kilogram credit for qualified clean hydrogen production now requires construction to begin before 2028, significantly shortening the runway for new projects. Projects beginning construction after December 31, 2027, will no longer be eligible.

Clean Production Fuel Credit (Section 45Z): The Section 45Z credit for the production of certain transportation fuel and sustainable aviation fuel has been extended and is available through 2029, but with narrowed eligibility and stricter sourcing rules. PFE restrictions also apply. For example, for fuel produced after December 31, 2025, the enhanced rate for sustainable aviation fuel is no longer available and the credit value for fuels derived from foreign feedstocks would be reduced by 20%.

Direct Pay and Transferability (Sections 6417 and 6418): Both remain available, but credits cannot be transferred to PFEs (immediately for SFEs and two years later for FIEs).

IV. Looking Ahead

The OBBBA fundamentally reshapes clean energy incentives by accelerating phaseouts, shortening deadlines, and layering in complex new foreign entity restrictions. While certain technologies like nuclear and hydrogen retain more favorable treatment, the overarching trend is a sharp contraction in federal support for wind, solar, and PFE-linked projects.

Below is a list of action items for developers to do now:

Move quickly on project starts. Wind and solar developers must begin construction on or before July 4, 2026 to preserve credit eligibility while retaining the four-year “continuity safe harbor” to place the project in service; otherwise, such projects that begin construction after the first anniversary of the enactment of the OBBBA have to be placed in service by the end of 2027.

Focus on the Physical Work Test. For wind and solar projects, developers can no longer “begin construction” by satisfying a 5% safe harbor (other than certain small-scale solar projects of 1.5 MW or less). Paying or incurring costs for the manufacturing of project components is no longer enough — developers must plan for tangible, qualifying construction steps that constitute physical work of a significant nature, both for purposes of showing that construction began and for purposes of maintaining a continuous program of construction.

Track supply chains. The introduction of the PFE regime intended to limit foreign influence in the US clean energy sector means that developers and manufacturers must strengthen the supplier due diligence process and carefully document sourcing of key inputs to ensure no impermissible material assistance and build strategies to reduce foreign exposure.

Plan for shorter timelines. Credits phase out sooner for wind, solar, and certain manufacturing components, so consider accelerated construction and financing schedules.

Monitor Treasury guidance. Future notices (including notices regarding the PFE regime and the beginning of construction rules for the PFE regime) will shape enforcement and safe harbor rules; staying up to date will be critical to avoid disqualification.

In this new era, careful planning and compliance will be essential to securing clean energy tax incentives, and maintaining strong documentation will be key to supporting credit eligibility and ensuring investors and tax credit purchasers that the underlying credits are secure.

To build a successful next wave of climate policies, we need a blueprint by and for regular folks.","The Trump Administration’s “break stuff” governance model has unleashed a deluge of widely reported climate setbacks. In July, congressional Republicans gutted the landmark clean energy investments in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to help pay for the President’s tax breaks for the wealthy. Meanwhile, the Administration continues to test legal boundaries in its attempts to freeze clean energy funding, roll back greenhouse gas regulations, and “stop the enforcement” of states’ climate laws.

A less reported casualty of this onslaught is the resulting dysphoria for the U.S. climate movement. The network of organizers and wonks that recently birthed the largest climate investment in U.S. history now finds itself without a clear offensive strategy.

Many climate advocates are rightly focused on defense—working indefatigably to extinguish the flames that Trump’s Cabinet has ignited in our climate policy edifice. But we also need architects to start sketching what we’ll build in the ashes. It was during the first Trump Administration that we crafted the vision and policy framework that led to the IRA. And it is now that we must start laying the foundation for the next federal governing moment.

The blueprints for what comes next may seem hazy. But one thing is clear: We need to build a climate agenda written not about impacted workers and communities, but by them.

Everything Bagels Make Tasty Policy

A starting point for crafting the next wave of climate policies is to take stock of our successes and missteps in building the last one. What lessons can we glean from our collective work during the first Trump Administration to create the policy, organizing, and narrative architecture that helped pave the way for President Biden’s signature climate law?

From 2018 to 2020, a motley mix of policymakers, unions, climate organizations, and racial, economic, and environmental justice groups forged the strategy that would come to define the IRA: uniting climate, jobs, and justice goals. The underlying theory was clear and compelling. Tackling the climate crisis would require trillions of dollars in clean energy investments, which, properly guided, could flow into good union jobs and communities that have endured decades of disinvestment.

Though Congress whittled down the bold initial proposals from the Build Back Better agenda, many of the surviving policies in the final IRA legislation upheld the climate-jobs-justice trifecta. To convert clean energy growth into good jobs, the law’s climate investments included strong incentives for clean energy companies to partner with unions, pay decent wages, provide equitable training pathways, and sign agreements with community coalitions for locally defined benefits. To ensure that such benefits helped redress longstanding inequities, the IRA incentivized clean energy investments in low-income neighborhoods, communities fighting for environmental justice, coal-producing areas, and other communities sidelined by years of trickle-down economics.

Three premises formed the foundation for this strategy. Only two of them have held up. The third, as-yet-unfulfilled premise points the way forward.

Premise number one was that we can indeed deliver on climate, jobs, and justice objectives at the same time. This “everything bagel” strategy took flack for trying to do too much. Some suggested we might need to sacrifice labor and equity provisions to achieve meaningful clean energy expansion.

But everything bagels taste good for a reason: They combine ingredients that go well together. For policies, as for bagels, the goal is to use congruent ingredients.

Recent data indicate that clean energy growth, union jobs, and equitable investments can pair just as well as garlic, onion, and poppy seeds. Despite congressional Republicans’ recent rollback of many IRA investments, the law’s first few years yielded significant progress on all three fronts: a record 49-gigawatt boom in clean energy installations last year, a historic high in clean energy union density, and a notable 75 percent of clean investments going to communities where the median income is below the national median. This win-win-win is not an accidental outcome. It is the intentional result of a deliberate everything bagel strategy.

Premise number two was that this combination of ingredients was also smart politics—that it would unite unions, climate advocates, clean energy companies, and other constituencies to build the advocacy muscle needed to pass legislation over the opposition of well-heeled interests. This theory held water in the push to pass the IRA. It is unlikely the bill would have survived the congressional gauntlet without strong backing from such a broad spectrum of influential stakeholders. And this cross-sector push would not have materialized if the bill had singularly focused on gigawatts of clean energy while sidelining opportunities for workers and communities to reap the economic, health, and environmental rewards of the clean-energy transition.

No one likes a plain bagel. And legislatures don’t tend to prioritize things people don’t like.

This Doesn’t Feel Like Winning

What has not fared well is premise number three of the IRA strategy—that by linking climate investments with economic benefits, we would spur a broad, popular clamor to defend those investments and expand on them in future legislation. We would create a virtuous cycle, the theory went, in which the economic benefits of each round of climate investments would garner votes for the next.

It’s safe to say that has not happened. Congressional Republicans’ plan to dismantle the IRA did not spark sufficient outcry from voters to protect the bulk of the law’s clean energy investments. And a demand for more climate investments is hardly on the tips of working folks’ tongues from southeast Michigan to suburban Atlanta. Why not? What was the flaw in the logic? As it turns out, there were several.

First, messaging and policy gaps have hobbled us. Many observers have noted that repeatedly citing remarkable jobs statistics to promote the IRA came off as tone-deaf amid low unemployment and the very real economic anxiety caused by high inflation. Our climate messages have been heavy on creating jobs but light on cutting costs. That messaging gap stems from a policy gap. While the initial Build Back Better agenda included climate policies that took aim at families’ biggest costs, such as robust investments in affordable, energy-efficient housing and public transit, Congress cut those investments in the sausage-making that produced the IRA. Much work remains, both in policy and narrative, to develop an affordability-focused climate agenda that offers serious answers to help reduce the cost of living.

A less discussed messaging problem is the missed opportunity to cultivate a much broader base of local, trusted messengers as spokespeople for the federal investments flowing into their communities. When it came time for a ribbon cutting at a new, IRA-funded facility, could we have done more to equip the local reverend or imam, Main Street business owner, or city council member to go in front of the cameras and speak on the importance of long-sought investments in their community? Few national figures can match the authenticity or authority of such local leaders.

Much work remains to develop a climate agenda that offers serious answers to help reduce the cost of living.

Beyond messaging, the lackluster demand for protecting or enacting climate investments also owes to a more vexing challenge: the long lag time between passing a law, deploying investments, building something, and seeing the economic benefits materialize. That lag, for example, is likely to be at least six years for some of the clean manufacturing investments in the IRA. Tragically, a six-year wait is two years longer than a presidential administration. If we can’t deliver results within the span of an electoral cycle, the political economy of our everything bagel strategy has a sizable hole in it (pun definitely intended).

Proponents of the ascendant “abundance” worldview have rightly spotlighted this stumbling block. There is no question that we need to reduce the time it takes to build clean energy projects. The emissions math and political calculus both demand it. But to build faster, we need to name the sources of delay precisely. Imprecision risks remedies that are not only ineffective, but harmful. Elon Musk, for example, attempted to co-opt the “abundance” narrative to justify DOGE’s slash-and-burn deregulation. To expedite clean energy growth without needlessly sacrificing key protections, let’s look at the data on what actually causes delays.

In the name of clean energy “abundance,” some suggest we should jettison incentives for clean energy companies to create good jobs or invest in hard-hit communities, such as those included in the IRA “everything bagel.” But this prescription misdiagnoses the problem. The lag in building clean energy projects doesn’t stem from pro-worker or pro-equity incentives. In a 2023 survey of clean energy developers, such policies did not make the cut for the six biggest sources of project delays. And the inclusion of labor and equity incentives didn’t deter clean energy companies from enthusiastically pursuing IRA funding opportunities, some of which received applications for more than ten times the available funding.

In fact, such policies can actually facilitate clean energy buildout. For example, wage standards and apprenticeship programs for construction workers provide cost-effective ways for clean energy companies to overcome the widely reported difficulty of recruiting a skilled and stable workforce in a tight labor market. Community benefits agreements, meanwhile, offer developers a tool to garner explicit community support for clean energy projects in exchange for economic benefits, instead of risking local opposition—a leading cause of project delays. Incentives for clean energy companies to invest in low-income communities are also on the pro-building side of the ledger, as they help spur clean energy deployment in neighborhoods the market has deemed unprofitable.

Instead of sidelining labor and equity standards, an abundance agenda should target the real sources of delay in building clean energy. Key culprits include: backlogged queues for connecting clean energy to the electrical grid due to a lack of systemic planning, a growing list of local, NIMBY-esque siting restrictions for clean energy projects in both red and blue states, too-little-too-late forms of community engagement that risk community opposition to new projects, and supply chain shortages that mean waiting more than two and a half years to obtain a power transformer.

A clear focus on real snags like these—many of which require more policy, not less—can help to speed up clean energy projects while maintaining the economic benefits for working families that help expand support for further buildout.

Climate Policy: A Project of the Professional Class?

But there’s another fundamental reason for the tepid demand to advance the clean energy agenda: the lack of broad involvement in designing that agenda. People are unlikely to call for more climate investments if they do not see themselves in those investments. And they are unlikely to see themselves in investments they did not help to build. But to date, building climate policy has largely been a project of the professional class.

The path to success is not for D.C. professionals (myself included) to bust out of our offices in a few years and proclaim, “We’ve written an IRA 2.0. And trust us, working America, it’ll be great for your families and communities.” That approach would likely fall flat.

The workers and communities who most stand to benefit from a new wave of climate investments need to be at the forefront of crafting those investments. That is essential both for getting the policies right and for building the power to get them passed.

For too long, building power and building policy have been treated as two separate crafts. (This bifurcation is not unique to the climate movement.) Policy is often entrusted to the wonk class, while the grassroots is asked to provide reliable votes and calls to Congress. That is, the vast majority of the country is typically treated as public policy’s passive recipient, not its agent. This approach has several pitfalls.

First, ignoring the on-the-ground expertise of millions is not particularly democratic. The notion that those impacted by a policy should have a say in its design is a fundamental tenet of democracy. Today’s rift between policy design and policy impact undercuts that principle.

Second, inside-baseball policymaking can also yield misguided policy. Many of us who spend our time in policy schools and the halls of power bring useful technical know-how but lack in-depth experience with how policies play out on the ground. That means we’re missing vital information for aligning policy impact with intent—information that local organizers can readily offer, if they are included in the policymaking process.

Third, a professionals-only approach also misses opportunities to build power, which risks anemic policy pushes. If the next big thing in climate action were to be crafted exclusively in the D.C. bubble, we would be left with the unenviable task of explaining to the rest of the country why they should vocally support a policy they didn’t ask for. Without strong backing in key states and congressional districts, elite policycraft would produce not a new law, but yet another white paper.

To build a successful next wave of climate policies, we need a blueprint by and for regular folks.

Building a Broadly Backed Climate Agenda

Thankfully, over the next couple of years, several blue states have a real shot at passing progressive policies that could feed a new federal policy agenda. These are openings to build policy and power at the same time by merging the technical expertise of wonks with the grounded expertise of workers and communities. Could we equip community groups and unions in those states to be involved in the first steps of crafting state climate legislation, rather than treating their support as a last-step checkbox?

To do so, we have existing bottom-up models to learn from. In Illinois, for example, a broad coalition of community, climate, environmental justice, and other groups came together in school gyms and church sanctuaries during the first Trump term to hash out shared priorities for a new state climate bill. They then worked with legislators and experts to translate those priorities into the technical prose of legislation, jointly crafting one of the nation’s most ambitious and equitable state-level climate policies: the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. The broad-based involvement in designing the policy led to an equally big-tent advocacy push for the bill, which overwhelmed corporate-backed opposition and won passage of the law in 2021.

And yet, such broad participation in policy design tends to be the exception. To build a widely backed climate agenda, it needs to become the rule.

Several blue states have a real shot at passing progressive policies that could feed a new federal policy agenda.

Of course, this agenda can hardly be built in blue states alone. In red and purple states, the coming years may not produce many new climate policies, but they will yield new clean energy, transportation, and manufacturing projects. Despite congressional Republicans’ curtailing of IRA investments and the ensuing cancellation of some projects, other projects are going forward. Thanks to the steady decline in the price of batteries and wind and solar power, many clean energy projects will continue to make good business sense.

Unions and community groups are already taking advantage of this influx of investments to negotiate with clean energy companies for material wins. These efforts build on pre-IRA successes like an agreement that the nonprofits Greater Birmingham Ministries and Jobs to Move America negotiated to secure equitable hiring and training opportunities at an electric bus factory in Alabama. On the heels of that agreement, the industrial division of the Communications Workers of America ran a successful union organizing drive at the factory and secured a contract last year to give workers a sizable increase in wages. Now underrepresented workers can access training pathways to get good union jobs making electric buses in the heart of Alabama, a right-to-work state.

If local groups are resourced to multiply such victories and negotiate tangible gains from the clean investments entering their communities, the base of active support for clean energy may just expand outwards—even in the ruby red South. Even in the purple Midwest. Even in the shadow of the Trump Administration.

What Does Bottom-Up Policy Design Look Like?

But how exactly does participatory design of such policies or agreements work? Certainly, it can’t be as simple as inviting a bunch of unionists, community organizers, faith leaders, and environmentalists into a room and asking them to produce a bill or a legally binding agreement.

Indeed, it is not. But it also need not be a lengthy or cumbersome process. An extensive survey of existing participatory policy design initiatives in the United States and around the world found that the entire design process typically takes six to seven months—on par with the time often required to develop bills the conventional way.

A growing array of proven participatory models show that stakeholders can efficiently craft policy solutions if they have a foundation of trust, a precise agenda, and skillful facilitation. If a room full of union workers, clergy, student activists, and community organizers who have never worked together is simply asked, “What policies do you want?” the answer is likely to be either cacophony or awkward silence. But if organizers start by separately asking each constituency to identify potential solutions for a well-defined problem, a Venn diagram may emerge, revealing options at the center for co-designing mutually beneficial policy.

Take housing, for example. How could a range of groups in a given state find common cause on state-level housing policies that address immediate economic priorities while also cutting climate pollution?

To start, community organizers in one of the state’s largest cities might invite residents of a low-income neighborhood to a spaghetti dinner in a church auditorium to discuss possible solutions to soaring rent, utility bills, and homeowner’s insurance. Several towns away, a few dozen electricians, carpenters, and other members of construction unions are sitting in a union hall and rank-ordering the biggest problems they face in local building projects, from wage theft to safety hazards. An hour’s drive north, a mix of youth and retirees gather in the public library for the monthly meeting of a local environmental group. At a facilitator’s prompt, they write options on Post-it notes for how to reduce the 15 percent slice of U.S. climate pollution that comes from homes.

After hearing the takeaways from these housing-focused convenings, urban planning professors at a state university invite leaders from each of the groups to join a facilitated discussion and compare notes on what they heard. A common thread emerges: The buildout of new affordable housing could help tamp down rising rents, and with proper siting, it could boost proximity to public transit while decreasing proximity to air pollution hazards. With the right labor standards, it could help construction unions negotiate for better wages, benefits, and safety protections. And with the right design specifications, the new houses could come with energy-efficient heating and cooling systems, rooftop solar panels, and increased resilience to storm and flooding damage.

A labor leader in attendance sums up the prevailing view of the room, saying, “There’s potential for a win-win here, but the devil is in the details.” The facilitator suggests they reconvene to discuss those details by examining concrete options for state housing policies.

How the Bagel Gets Made

In the next convening, the stakeholder groups meet with housing experts from the university, who present a menu of potential new policies for the groups to size up. Options include state incentives for inclusionary zoning, retooled housing trust funds, use of public land to build green social housing, and so on. After the discussion reveals several areas of potential alignment, group leaders decide to formalize their partnership as a public-facing coalition.

The new coalition’s leaders then take a trip to the state capitol to meet with their state representatives, seeking out a few who might be interested in partnering to craft housing legislation. The leaders’ pitch to legislators is simple and compelling: We’re offering you an opportunity to lead a bill that is likely to have wide and vocal backing. After a few meetings, three legislators commit to working with the coalition to champion a bill that reflects their priorities.

Commitments in hand, the coalition groups send their organizers back to the church auditoriums, union halls, and public libraries to talk with their members. This time, they come with pointed questions and surveys to suss out their members’ preferences on key policy design questions: What would they see as a meaningful reduction in monthly energy costs? How would they balance new construction and retrofits of existing homes? And so on.

With a sharp understanding of their members’ specific priorities, the coalition leaders meet to hash out their various—at times, competing—policy design objectives. The state legislative champions send their staff to join the meetings alongside the state university’s housing policy experts, who pose questions to the coalition leaders to identify their preferences on design tradeoffs. Issues of contention are met with creative policy options, negotiation, and, in some cases, voting to reach group decisions. After a few spirited Zoom calls and late-night discussions, the deliberative process results in a draft legislative text.

The coalition leaders once again go back to their members and use slide decks and small group discussions to spotlight the contents of the draft bill and invite final feedback. After further massaging the language with the legislative champions to incorporate members’ suggestions, the coalition leaders vote to back the legislation.

With the final text in hand, the legislative champions introduce the bill and shepherd it toward a vote. Meanwhile, the coalition members stage press conferences, call-your-lawmaker events, and public rallies in target legislative districts, inviting their members—the very workers and community members who helped shape the bill—to show up. Seeing this fight as their own, many people do just that, and the ample turnout catches the eye of swing legislators.

Meanwhile, advocates from the coalition’s labor, faith, community, and environmental organizations traipse across the state capitol, lobbying undecided legislators who have sympathies with their particular constituency. Representatives unconvinced by climate arguments are swayed by housing affordability pitches, and vice versa.

A Policy by and for Working People

After a cross-movement advocacy, organizing, and media blitz, a majority of “aye” votes in the state capitol lands the new housing policy—built by and for impacted workers and communities—in the history books. A year later, union workers are starting to build multifamily housing projects that offer low-cost, energy-efficient units, helping families across the state find affordable and healthy homes.

But affordable green housing is not the only thing that has grown. More working families in the state now see themselves in the clean energy transition. Thousands of members of unions and community organizations have just spent months gathering in school gyms, union halls, and church basements to shape legislation that marries climate and economic solutions. Many have hoisted placards at rallies and placed calls to state legislators to urge passage of the resulting bill. And with its passage, many of them—and their co-workers and neighbors—stand to benefit from lower costs or higher wages.

Participatory policy design still requires policy wonks. We wonks just need to do things a bit differently.

True, that doesn’t mean most participating union and community group members are likely to become card-carrying climate activists. But might they vocally support the next bill that advances pro-affordability, pro-worker climate solutions, or a candidate who does? The odds are good. And so the tentpoles of the nation’s climate constituency expand outwards.

As this hypothetical process indicates, participatory policy design still requires policy wonks. We wonks just need to do things a bit differently. First and foremost, a bottom-up approach calls for us to listen: to believe people as they describe the biggest problems they face, to ask the probing questions required to move from problems to policies, to hear how policy ideas might play out on the ground, and to trust those takes. This will require that we hold lightly our preconceived notions of what works.

Bottom-up policy design will also require meeting people where they are. In the many places where immediate economic and health concerns outrank climate angst, the conversation will not start with “What climate policies do you want?” Instead, the question might be, “What are your biggest household costs?” “What worries you most about the health of your children?” “What kinds of jobs would you like to see more of in your community?” Such entry points can lead to policy solutions that would cut costs, improve health, and boost wages while also expediting the transition to a clean energy economy.

At this point, you might be thinking, “This seems like a lot of work.” Yes, though past practice shows that a participatory process can be just as expedient as traditional policy development, as mentioned. In addition, not all policy decisions need to go through the full participatory process outlined above. Some decisions may call for policymakers to simply engage with a representative set of stakeholders and/or to use digital tools to solicit input from a swath of their constituents.

But for truly game-changing policy plays—where the potential climate, economic, or health impacts are large—a process built on deep and wide participation can help to ensure that: 1) the policy details effectively respond to people’s biggest needs, 2) the policy has sufficient stakeholder support to get enacted, and 3) the policy builds broad buy-in for a larger agenda (e.g., climate action). That helps explain why, despite the labor involved, a growing number of states now have union-community-environmental coalitions dedicated to co-designing climate solutions.

Choosing the Right Ingredients

But such a bottom-up process also raises a question that brings us back to our everything bagel. If we invite a broad array of workers and communities to help design a next wave of clean energy investments, do we think that they are likely to come up with a policy that focuses singularly on gigawatts of clean energy buildout? No, probably not. They may care about how that buildout translates into reduced energy, housing, or transportation costs for their families. Or into wider availability of high-paying jobs. Or a reduction in air pollution. In short, they may add a few ingredients to the bagel.

Additional ingredients, as mentioned, tend to be a pet peeve of some “abundance” proponents, who fear they will get in the way of building things. Some, in fact, caution against broad stakeholder involvement in policy design to avoid this very outcome. But that counsel—essentially an endorsement of closed-door policymaking—presumes that stakeholders, and the policymakers who work with them, will choose contradictory and counterproductive ingredients. Why assume that stakeholders are incapable of choosing congruent ingredients?

To be clear, some ingredients must indeed be discarded as incompatible with policy goals. To address the housing affordability crisis, for example, “abundance” proponents are right that we need to eliminate regressive policies, like exclusionary zoning, that hamper new housing while also undermining equity. But that doesn’t mean we must also eschew housing provisions that support climate, jobs, or equity goals, so long as they’re crafted in a way that does not meaningfully deter construction. We can target the bathwater while protecting the baby.

A well-structured participatory policy design process can do just that. That process starts with intentionally building coalitions around aligned interests. For example, the coalition described above—composed of affordable housing advocates, construction unions, climate groups, and environmental justice organizations—would likely see eye to eye on rejecting exclusionary zoning, which undermines affordability, jobs, climate, and equity goals alike. By contrast, a haphazard approach to coalition building that invites participation from groups with diametrically opposing goals—say, local NIMBY groups and affordable housing campaigners—would likely end in fundamental disagreements instead of policy coherence.

Thanks to its more deliberate formation, our hypothetical coalition may find common ground in not only opposing exclusionary zoning but also welcoming certain other ingredients for housing policy design. For example, they might recommend the creation of a state-level program that offers affordable housing grants to cities, contingent on adoption of inclusionary zoning, high-road labor standards for construction workers, and energy-efficient, climate-resilient building codes that reduce utility bills, home insurance rates, and indoor air pollution for tenants.

The diversity of these policy objectives does not preclude them from meshing well. For example, the preference for climate-smart design would not detract from the goal of rapidly building affordable housing. A recent study found that it costs less to build an all-electric, low-emissions home than a conventional home in nine out of nine U.S. cities analyzed. Other studies agree. The data show that we need not pick between building affordable or low-emissions housing—we can do both.

In fact, the residents of such electrified homes can expect to save money on their upfront costs and utility bills, with savings over 15 years ranging from about $2,000 in Boston to more than $10,000 in New York. Those residents will also breathe cleaner air while their homes emit between 20 and 50 percent less climate pollution. Such win-win potential is the target of participatory design.

Navigating Tradeoffs

But win-win solutions are not always so easy to come by. A participatory design model—like nearly any policy design initiative—will still need to grapple with policy tradeoffs. The question is: Can stakeholders negotiate those tradeoffs to arrive at shared solutions?

Consider the case of labor standards for affordable housing policies. Unions have good reason to push for such standards. Construction workers are paid lower than average wages, resulting in higher than average reliance on welfare. Many face illegal wage theft and denial of basic benefits. In Minnesota, for example, companies use under-the-table payments or worker misclassification to evade basic labor protections for roughly one out of every four construction workers, resulting in a 36 percent average reduction in those workers’ earnings. A number of the state’s affordable housing projects have relied on contractors with a track record of such tactics. To help remedy the situation, last year Minnesota enacted a new, union-backed policy establishing a wage floor for construction workers on publicly funded affordable housing projects.

However, such an outcome is precisely what some “abundance” proponents worry about. Concerned about the potential for labor costs to undercut affordable housing goals, some have suggested that workers should not have a seat at the table in designing affordable housing policies. But this stance ignores one of the key benefits of participatory policy design: the opportunity for on-the-ground experts to bring together contrasting but reconcilable perspectives so as to make informed decisions about policy tradeoffs.

Take, for example, the policy tensions that unions and affordable housing groups grappled with in jointly designing Los Angeles’s mansion tax, which taxes high-value properties to fund affordable housing. The policy design was truly bottom-up, with a broad coalition of local housing and labor advocates meeting on Zoom calls to negotiate the details.

Construction unions and affordable housing developers in California had historically been at odds over labor standards for low-income housing projects. But seeing an opportunity to win a policy that could deliver on both sides’ goals, union and affordable housing leaders worked to arrive at a compromise regarding project labor agreements, yielding a mansion tax framework that melded jobs and affordability objectives. The central role of local unions and affordable housing groups in the policy design process allowed for direct negotiation between impacted constituencies, whose on-the-ground expertise helped surface creative options for navigating policy tradeoffs.

Thanks to the participatory process, the resulting policy enjoyed broad buy-in from unions and affordable housing groups, which then powered a robust citywide campaign to push for passage via a ballot measure. The push overcame corporate opposition to garner majority support from voters in 2022. While not free of tradeoffs, today the mansion tax is Los Angeles’s largest revenue source for affordable housing, and the first tranche of affordable housing projects funded by the tax is expected to create 10,000 union jobs.

Yes, bottom-up processes are likely to initially produce many ingredients for our bagel, some of which may clash. But if we are aiming for the optimal policy—the one that can yield the greatest good and enjoy enough support to pass—the answer is not for a few remote policy professionals to trash ingredients in favor of a single-minded, plain-tasting alternative. The answer is to equip workers and communities to weigh the tradeoffs alongside policymakers so as to write a coherent recipe.

The Architects of Our New Climate Agenda

If we’re open to well-crafted everything bagels, today’s brewing state policy campaigns and clean energy project pipelines present a near-term opportunity for workers and communities to become the architects of the climate movement’s next big thing. Seizing this opportunity will require strong organizing and smart participatory design processes. But the potential prize is large: a suite of new clean energy policies and projects by and for impacted communities, and expanded ownership of climate solutions. These are the building blocks for a national climate agenda that responds to on-the-ground priorities and enjoys broad backing—an agenda we can win.

By building policy and power at the same time, we can lay the groundwork for the next federal governing moment so that we’re ready when the carnage of this Administration ends. A bottom-up offense won’t be easy. It will be messy. It will require overcoming steep odds.

It’s a fact that fossil fuel-based energy continues to fuel the warming of the planet. With that warming comes an increased frequency of extreme weather events. The solutions to achieve carbon neutrality and energy security depend on the deployment of more renewable energy, continued energy efficiencies, and resilience measures. But actions by the current federal administration are holding back progress, while putting people and their communities at higher risk.

That’s where the organization Elected Officials to Protect America comes in. It is a network of current and former bipartisan elected officials who care deeply about protecting our planet and democracy with education on energy security solutions.

The Extreme Weather That Many Lawmakers Refuse To Acknowledge

Destructive wildfires, droughts, heat waves, extreme storms, flash floods, and infectious diseases cause economic and emotional distress.

At the Tempe Public Library complex, where solar arrays provide more than 70% of the complex’s power needs, the Elected Officials organization is meeting this week with the Climate Action Campaign (CAC). The Tempe Public Library project includes roof solar panels, carport canopies that provide 262 shaded parking spaces, and a large solar canopy that is used as a community gathering space for festivals, events, and farmers markets. It also offers solar protection panels for wheelchair access. Tempe’s library complex solar panels produce 1.3 million kWh of energy, which is equivalent to reducing carbon emissions by more than 900 metric tons and taking 190 vehicles off the road each year.

The library is an appropriate location for the press conference, as it demonstrates how solar is a natural fit for Arizona. But not so fast — a major $156,120,000 Solar-For-All grant was rescinded for Arizona, alongside other federally funded clean energy projects.

Thank the Trump Administration.

Tempe city leaders had established a 100% clean energy goal by 2035 and worked with the federal government to secure needed grant funding for some clean energy projects. “Sadly, that dynamic has changed,” said Christian Brock, Elected Officials to Protect America senior advisor and Air Force veteran.

As a clean and renewable power source fueling the library, solar has another plus: it costs less than a traditional power source. “Thousands have enjoyed the solar panel shaded outdoor gathering place for neighborhood events,” said Corey Woods, Tempe Mayor. “Every summer we are experiencing far too many dangerously hot days. We know with the added risk of extreme heat, utility bills skyrocket. Federal funding from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program and the Weatherization Assistance Program have been critical to help Arizona residents who live on fixed incomes.”

“Every community across the state needs federal funding for clean energy initiatives, energy efficiencies, and climate protection,” the mayor added.

Is Solar For All A Pipe Dream?

The concern now is that Arizona will not be able to meet its clean energy goals, which will hurt families and businesses; marginalized communities may suffer the most. The Elected Officials group is advocating for the release of clean energy grant funding for more renewable energy projects in Arizona, like Solar for All.

The Tempe Solar for All award was part of the historic $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, developed under the Inflation Reduction Act to lower US families’ energy costs, create good-quality jobs in communities — including historically disadvantaged communities, advance environmental justice, and tackle the climate crisis. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provided over $369 billion in tax breaks, incentives, grants, and loan guarantees that were designed to mitigate the climate crisis, which impacts communities daily with weather extremes and poor air quality.

Just last month, the three largest utilities in Arizona saw record peak demands as residents cranked up the air conditioning during extreme heat. The Solar for All program’s planned 61 megawatts of solar would have helped meet the state’s growing demand and prevent outages while creating quality jobs. Without the Solar for All program, eligible Arizonans will lose out on an average of 20% in annual energy bill savings per participating household, $11 million to support workforce development programs, and new solar deployment.

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) is navigating several other federal policy actions. On July 15, the Department of the Interior issued a memo stating that Interior Secretary Doug Burgum will need to personally sign off on numerous types of federal permitting approvals for a solar project to move forward. Additionally, the US Treasury issued new guidance on August 15 that made changes to the formal definition of “beginning of construction” for solar projects to earn federal tax credits.

Nonetheless, the US solar industry installed nearly 18 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity in the first half of 2025. Even as the Trump administration rolled out a series of anti-clean energy policies, solar and storage still accounted for 82% of all new power added to the grid in its first six months.

Loss Of Important Federal Agencies Hurts Renewable Uptick & Everyday Citizens

Elected officials and CAC say that challenges Arizonans face require a fully funded, fully staffed, and politically independent federal response. However, Trump 2.0 has vowed to end the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), and the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP). His administration has stripped the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of its core mission.

Attacks on these agencies jeopardize clean air, safe water, and climate pollution limits that protect public health. The Elected Officials organization challenges the Trump administration, insisting that they failed to recognize the climate crisis as a threat multiplier in their 2025 threat assessment — despite previously acknowledging the danger during Trump’s first term.

Assistant Minority Leader, State Rep. Nancy Gutierrez, explained that, “it’s Arizona families who pay the price. The stress, polluted air, higher utility bills, and fewer outside local jobs are the result. On the other hand, clean energy investments save families money, bring cleaner air and can help mitigate weather extremes. We must do everything in our power to protect people from climate crisis dangers. Every dollar stripped away from clean-energy programs,” she continued, “is a dollar stolen from the prosperity, health, and security of families.”

Final Thoughts

The Elected Officials group — which represents 1313 officials in 50 states — argues that the need for energy security solutions has never been greater. Elected officials at all levels of government are joining together to educate their peers and communities on clean energy solutions that will protect people and the planet. The group helps facilitate those connections with educational opportunities, training, and gatherings at home and abroad. The Elected Officials organization educates lawmakers through value-based storytelling; it is the only national organization that mobilizes veterans who are lawmakers to work together on energy security solutions.

T.R. Ludwig, CEO of Brooklyn SolarWorks, didn’t see the second of a one-two punch coming. As the industry was losing federal support, the government of New York announced it would reallocate funds after overachieving its distributed-generation goal.

“A lot of us were rather focused on the federal stuff, because we knew that that was going to start to heat up and get adversarial,” said Ludwig, a board member of New York Solar Energy Industries Association. “So, nobody was terribly focused on what was happening at the state level.”

State policy is integral to solar. Its incentives can determine whether solar prospers or falters in the state. But more importantly, its power can make or break whether solar developments are even allowed in the state to begin with.

Every two years, every state’s bill session aligns during the spring, and this year, energy bills dominated many lawmakers’ discussions. The outcome was a mixed bag, with bills bringing solar sunrises and sunsets across the country.

State policy has always been a front line for energy in the United States. With the loss of federal incentives this has never been truer, according to Jeff Cramer, president and CEO of the Coalition for Community Solar Access.

Community solar

Roughly half of the United States does not have policies to enable community solar. Several states introduced bills this year to implement community solar, but every bill in a state without year-long sessions failed.

In Montana, Republican-backed community solar legislation made it as far as the governor’s desk – having previously failed to make it to a first vote in either chamber – but was ultimately vetoed.

Meanwhile, Minnesota nearly lost its newly revamped community solar program after three senators – two Democrats and one Republican – introduced legislation to repeal it. David Moberg, policy and regulatory affairs associate, Minnesota Solar Energy Industries Association, described it as “probably the most frustrating” bill of the session.

Supporters were concerned that an early sunset for the community solar program could signal problems in other states, too. Minnesota’s challenges mirror those seen elsewhere: bipartisan and broad public support for solar, but with opposition from utilities. However, Minnesota is so far the only state in 2025 whose lawmakers or governor did not side with utilities over community solar. The state’s successes and challenges can serve as a template for campaigners in other states seeking to overcome opposition from utilities.

Why not every state has community solar

There are 19 states with deregulated energy markets and 15 (79%) have succeeded in adopting community solar legislation – lawmakers are inching close in the remaining four. In contrast, less than 20% of states with regulated energy markets have passed community solar legislation.

Investor-owned utilities are usually the sole opponents to testify against community solar bills. Ohio lawmakers spent nearly a year holding hearings for a community solar bill, with more than 70 testimonies from residents and stakeholders representing an array of industries in support of the bill, while the utilities were among the few to testify in opposition.

In deregulated energy markets where utilities are forbidden from owning generation, objections from utilities become quieter, if they raise any at all.

“For every megawatt that a third-party community solar developer develops, that’s a megawatt of regulated rate of return that they cannot develop,” said Jeff Cramer, president and CEO of the Coalition for Community Solar Access. “They like to spin everybody up into knots and tell narratives of cost shift and how it’s going to be unreliable for the grid and this and that. They scare everybody, but ultimately, it’s about their own self-interest.”

The utility business model is to make more regulated rate of returns on more dollars, Cramer argued. “I don’t blame them for that, but it is a big problem in the sense of trying to bring new, innovative, competitive products into these vertically integrated states,” he said.

Microgrids

Virginia has the largest data-center market in the world, according to the state’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission. The state does not produce enough energy to meet demand, importing 61% of its electricity between 2018 and 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Virginia’s House of Representatives and Senate passed legislation in April 2025 to triple the state’s energy storage capacity. However, Governor Glenn Youngkin vetoed the new law, along with most other clean energy bills, such as a bill to increase rooftop solar and other forms of distributed power.

West Virginia has since passed legislation designed to lure data centers across the border. It has eased restrictions on microgrid development and created a certified microgrid program. The new law makes it easier for companies, especially data centers, to build independent microgrids. It creates special “microgrid districts” that are exempt from many local zoning regulations and allows generated power to be used on-site or sold wholesale.

Oregon has also passed microgrid legislation that enables entities beyond utilities to own and operate microgrids.

Net metering

In California and Maine, net metering programs have been under fire, with two high-profile bills proving controversial. California’s net metering was set to affect homeowners with rooftop solar installations, while Maine’s targeted ratepayers who have installations or who subscribe to community solar projects.

California’s bill would have switched the existing net-metering agreements into the state’s new net-metering structure, which pays about 80% less for the electricity sent to the grid. After lawmakers changed the legislation to only mandate the switch when a home is sold, the bill was eventually amended to remove the net-metering changes entirely.

In Maine, lawmakers have made community solar and other front-of-the-meter projects ineligible for the current net-metering structure. State law tasks the Governor’s Energy Office with developing a successor program and also imposes a monthly fee that community solar project owners must pay to utilities.

Automated permitting

New York, Illinois, Minnesota, Hawaii, New Jersey, Colorado, Florida, and Texas all worked to pass bills to speed up permitting decisions for residential solar installations. Although the bills shared the same objective – to push sluggish municipalities into a streamlined process – every bill that required the adoption of automated permitting software failed. New Jersey’s passage of a smart permitting bill was the only exception.

Texas and Florida succeeded by taking a different approach that works within their state’s existing framework. It allows contractors to conduct inspections, including the use of automated permitting software, if a city or municipality fails to make a decision on a permitting application after a prescribed number of days.

Solar defense Solar and energy storage are big in Texas, but a trio of bills threatened progress. Texas Senate Bill 819 would have placed additional fees, permitting restrictions, setback requirements, and regulatory mandates exclusively on utility-scale solar and wind projects.

Another bill required at least half of all new generation to come from “dispatchable generation other than energy storage.” The third bill aimed to retroactively mandate existing renewable energy installations to install a backup energy source. All three bills died after stalling in the legislature.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/TexasStateCapitol-2010-02-1200x857.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 18:06:23.452404

The state on Wednesday announced plans to release $18 million it received after successfully suing the Trump administration for withholding the funds that Congress had already allocated.

The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law signed by former President Joe Biden contained $148 million for Illinois to build more EV charging stations. The state received $25.3 million to build charging stations at 37 locations in 2024 as part of the first round of grant funding.

But the Federal Highway Administration withheld the second round earlier this year after President Donald Trump signed an executive order requiring federal agencies to pause funding for clean energy projects appropriated in the Biden-era law.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and 16 other attorneys general sued the Trump administration in May seeking the release of the funds. The lawsuit argued it is illegal for the president to withhold funding that has already been approved by Congress. A judge ruled in June that the federal government must release the funds to Illinois and other states that joined the lawsuit.

“Illinois has been at the forefront of building a clean energy economy that creates jobs and helps lower costs for consumers, and building electric vehicle chargers across the states has been core to that mission,” Gov. JB Pritzker said in a statement. “I’m thankful for the quick action of our Attorney General in the fight to restore these funds that President Trump was unlawfully withholding.”

Pritzker’s office announced on Wednesday that Illinois will receive $18.4 million this year as part of the second round of grant funding for EV chargers. The money will fund 167 charging stations at 25 locations. With the release and allocation of the federal funding, Illinois will have received $43.8 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to build 349 charging ports in 62 locations.

1 million electric vehicles

State officials said expanding charging locations will help the state achieve its goal of having one million electric vehicles registered in Illinois by 2030.

Locations along interstates throughout Illinois have been selected for the second round of grant funding, including at Wally’s gas station in Pontiac along Interstate 55 and at a Target in Gurnee off Interstate 94.

One of the largest disbursements will be a $910,287 grant for chargers at Eric’s Too Family Restaurant and Lounge near the interchange of Interstate 55 and Interstate 74 in Bloomington.

The funding is made possible through the second round of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, which is helping to invest in communities and generate economic development while advancing our goal to have a million EVs registered in Illinois by 2030. ​

“Illinois has been at the forefront of building a clean energy economy that creates jobs and helps lower costs for consumers, and building electric vehicle chargers across the states has been core to that mission,” said Governor JB Pritzker. “I’m thankful for the quick action of our Attorney General in the fight to restore these funds that President Trump was unlawfully withholding. With these resources rightfully coming back to Illinois, I look forward to taking another step forward in our continued efforts to expand EV infrastructure and boosting local economies across Illinois.”

As part of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed by Congress and signed into law in 2021, Illinois is set to receive a total of $148 million through NEVI to build out an EV charging network, first along interstate corridors, followed by more local locations. Gov. Pritzker announced the initial round of $25.3 million in NEVI awards last year to build 37 charging stations. ​

In May, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul joined 16 other attorneys general in suing the Federal Highway Administration for withholding the remainder of the appropriated funds. A judge in June ordered the administration to release funding appropriated to Illinois and 13 other states. ​ ​ ​

“In May, I joined 16 state attorneys general in suing the Trump administration for unlawfully holding critical National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program funding – which is appropriated by Congress – hostage,” said Attorney General Kwame Raoul. “Our coalition obtained a court order requiring the administration to release NEVI funds that states including Illinois are counting on to construct EV charging stations and improve safety for drivers traveling long distances. I am pleased that our coalition’s work has resulted in this money finally reaching Illinois, which ultimately boosts our state’s economy.”

The NEVI program is part of a series of comprehensive initiatives to achieve our goal of becoming a leader in manufacturing and deploying EVs. In addition to making travel by EVs more reliable and accessible, the funding advances Pritzker Administration’s commitment to make the state an EV industry leader, fight climate change and create jobs. ​

“When Senate Democrats passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act back in 2021, we voted to send the resources and funding to our home states to build new, better infrastructure. ​ Because of the IIJA, more than $18 million is coming to Illinois to support electric vehicle charging stations,” said U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL). ​ “After months of battling the Trump Administration’s unconscionable freeze of this critical funding, Illinois is finally seeing its fair share of support from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. This funding is a continuation of Illinois state leaders shared goal to help reduce carbon emissions, ease the transition to clean power sources, and combat the climate crisis.”

“When we passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law we brought vital investment home to Illinois,” said U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL). “While the Trump Administration is focused on trying to illegally claw back already-appropriated federal funding, I’m committed to working alongside Governor Pritzker, Senator Durbin and our state and local leaders to hold the Administration accountable and ensure our communities receive the federal resources promised. This funding will help expand access to reliable charging stations for electric vehicles, critical in helping invest in Illinois’s clean energy future and making EV use more accessible for all Illinoisans.”

“We will not stop our efforts to build an accessible and reliable electric vehicle charging network across our state,” said Illinois Transportation Secretary Gia Biagi. ​ “These charging stations not only provide transportation options, but also economic opportunity for cities and towns throughout Illinois.”

“This is an important step forward in building Illinois’ clean energy economy,” said Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity Director Kristin Richards. “These investments not only expand our electric vehicle charging network, but they also drive our continued growth in the EV manufacturing sector, from automakers and suppliers to the skilled workers powering the transition.”

“The NEVI-funded chargers along Illinois’ interstate corridors are critical to building a reliable statewide backbone of fast-charging infrastructure to continue the critical growth of electric vehicle deployment in Illinois. These stations directly complement the Illinois EPA’s efforts, which have supported more than 450 charging locations across the state,” said Illinois EPA Director James Jennings. “Together, state agencies are working to offer EV drivers multiple charging options at numerous locations, ensuring accessible and convenient travel throughout Illinois.""

The 25 projects throughout the state were chosen via a competitive call for projects held last fall. The awards will facilitate the construction of 167 new charging ports. Selected locations will have at least four DC fast charging ports, each of which can fully charge a typical EV from empty in less than 30 minutes. ​ Among the charging stations to be built:

“This type of charging infrastructure will not only increase the number of charging stations, but it will enhance our energy sources for the Bloomington community as well,” said Bloomington Mayor Dan Brady.

“We’re very pleased to get a Level 3 charger for the Springfield area for EV drivers along the I-55 corridor,” said Springfield Mayor Misty Buscher. “Projects like this complement what we are doing inside our community for smart city infrastructure to meet the needs of our citizens and visitors.”

A total of $148 million has been allocated to IDOT to deliver the NEVI program in Illinois. ​ To date, IDOT has awarded $43.8 million in NEVI grants for 62 projects throughout the state, which will facilitate the construction of 349 new charging ports. The entire list can be viewed at Drive Electric Illinois or by visiting idot.click/drive-electric. All of the awards are contingent on the selected recipients entering into a grant agreement with IDOT. ​

The next application period for funding is anticipated in late 2025. For more information on NEVI in Illinois, visit Drive Electric Illinois or email dot.driveelectric@illinois.gov.

The site will serve a number of purposes, including building the future workforce for the advanced nuclear industry. The Wyoming Natrium project is a crucial part of the Trump administration’s plans to increase energy independence and shift the United States away from reliance on energy from the outside world. The administration has been on a tear in recent months since signing several executive orders aimed directly at the energy sector.

TerraPower views the Natrium project as a crucial milestone in nuclear production

The site will host operation training activities and support all operator-accredited programs, as well as several operational activities. The nuclear energy sector has received a massive boost thanks to the Trump administration’s executive orders and policies that aim to revitalize the energy sector in the United States by bypassing the traditional environmental regulations that the sector has been hindered by.

Some of the planned operations that the site will host are:

Housing the Natrium Training Simulator

Laboratories for Electrical and Instrumentation & Control (I&C)

Mechanical and scientific laboratories

Training classrooms

“The future of energy will only come to fruition if we have a skilled, dedicated and robust workforce. The Kemmerer Training Center will serve as the central hub for future Natrium operators who will deliver the reliable and flexible power communities need. We are proud to be building this facility on the site of our first Natrium plant. The proximity between the plant and the training center, along with the ongoing support of the Kemmerer community, are invaluable as we continue to advance America’s next nuclear power plant.” – Chris Levesque, TerraPower President and CEO

Wyoming could become the center of the nuclear sector in the United States

Wyoming is not the biggest state in the union, and as such, it has faced several challenges in the energy production sector, along with the rest of America. The company broke ground on the site in 2024 and immediately started construction. The project is the only advanced nuclear developer to begin construction on a commercial-scale project in the U.S.

It features some innovative storage capacity that enables the site to deliver 500 MW of power when needed and is being developed through the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP), a public-private partnership. Wyoming’s state government has welcomed the plans to construct the nuclear site. The project is a prime example of the new safety and efficiency improvements in the nuclear sector in recent years.

“Wyoming is leading the way in establishing the next generation nuclear sector,. With today’s announcement at the Natrium site on the beginning of construction on the training center, Southwest Wyoming has much to celebrate — from workforce opportunities to state-of-the-art energy production.” – Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon

There are currently 43 proposed carbon capture and sequestration projects in Louisiana, one of the few states to be awarded primary enforcement authority (or primacy) for the regulation of Class VI injection wells by the federal EPA. This means that, unlike many other states, the LDENR is in charge of the permit application review and approval process, allowing for more local control over proposed projects. Although the Hackberry approval is the culmination of a nearly 1.5-year permitting process, subsequent permitting actions should benefit from the LDNR’s early rigorous review process, reducing future permitting timelines to less than one year.

Carbon capture and sequestration projects have become increasingly prevalent, offering stakeholders innovative strategies for managing CO2emissions. In a time when investors, customers, and governmental authorities often pressure industry to decrease CO2emissions, these projects present opportunities for companies to participate in domestic and foreign carbon reduction incentives. When paired with power generation facilities, carbon capture and sequestration can compound multiple benefits, contributing to national energy independence, producing clean, carbon-neutral energy, and creating credits eligible for sale in carbon markets worldwide

Carbon capture and sequestration projects involve capturing CO2before it is emitted from industrial facilities, transporting it to a permitted injection well, and injecting it deep underground for storage so that it cannot escape into the atmosphere. In addition to receiving a Class VI permit, before the capture, transportation, and injection of CO2may be carried out, emitting companies, operators, and landowners will enter into various agreements creating the necessary rights and obligations to undertake these activities and allocating the risks related thereto. Before entering into any such agreement, there are many issues all parties will need to consider, including ones raised by state officials.

How the credits work The federal tax credits are complicated and have changed several times in recent years.
Used vehicles that are at least two years old and sold for less than $25,000 could qualify for a $4,000 credit.
“The government says they want to move forward with green clean energy and move forward with electric cars, yet they’re taking away the incentive to buy the electric cars in the first place,” McMullen said.
“If there’s no incentive financially to get one through a tax credit, we have to look at other options as a business.” There is another EV-related credit that is set to expire.","HILLSBOROUGH CO., Fla. — It’s almost the end of the road for drivers to get federal electric vehicle tax credits worth up to $7,500.

President Donald Trump passed the One Big Beautiful Act earlier this year, which ends the EV tax credits on Sept. 30. Before that, the credits were set to expire in 2032.

As the new deadline draws closer, Tampa area dealerships are seeing an uptick in sales.

“We advertise it like crazy, it’s all over our website, get it while it lasts,” said Rob Verhey, the New Car Director at Volvo Cars Tampa.

Verhey said in the months since the new expiration date was announced, they’ve seen a 30% increase in electric and plug-in hybrid car sales.

“The way car prices are, that $7,500 tax credit is very enticing for a lot of people who want to make that segway into the electric car market,” Verhey added.

Eligibility for the credit varies, but Verhey said at Volvo, they’re being offered on leases for EVs and plug-in hybrids. He said on top of the credit, the dealer is offering more savings, and for some cars, it’s making a big difference.

“The EX90, it qualifies for almost $15,000 in rebates right now,” Verhey said, talking about Volvo’s largest electric SUV.

How the credits work

The federal tax credits are complicated and have changed several times in recent years.

New car buyers and leases can be eligible for a rebate at the dealer, as opposed to having to file for the credit on their taxes.

For buying a new vehicle, the MSRP must be under $80,000 for an SUV and $55,000 for a sedan, wagon, or hatchback.

Used vehicles that are at least two years old and sold for less than $25,000 could qualify for a $4,000 credit.

There are restrictions on manufacturing for cars made in North America and containing batteries with a percentage of components that come from the U.S. and certain allied countries

To qualify for a federal tax credit, the buyer’s income after taxes can’t be above $300,000 for those who file as married or above $150,000 for anyone filing as single or separately.

For people who choose to lease, the $7,500 credit can be used toward any EV without restrictions on the sticker price, manufacturing, or buyer income.

Drivers see a roadblock

Some drivers are disappointed to see the tax credits expire.

Matthew McMullen’s family runs the driving school, Driving Made Easy, which recently added an EV to their fleet.

“The car is relatively inexpensive, and then the tax incentive made it really nice to buy,” McMullen said. “You get a big chunk of the car back right away, so your overhead goes down right away.”

McMullen said that without the tax credits, any plans they had to add more EVs to their driving school are being curbed.

“The government says they want to move forward with green clean energy and move forward with electric cars, yet they’re taking away the incentive to buy the electric cars in the first place,” McMullen said. “If there’s no incentive financially to get one through a tax credit, we have to look at other options as a business.”

There is another EV-related credit that is set to expire. Drivers can have a home charger installed for a $1,000 rebate or up to 30 percent of the cost of the project, whichever is less. That credit ends on June 30, 2026.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f124f6d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+24/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3f%2F6e%2F1a2335ec43da9d88f892682f7d86%2Fposter-image-13.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 18:05:41.778755

And while much of the new demand for energy is being met by renewables, the reliability requirements of especially data centers has prompted a surge of demand for gas.
And these are prices that will largely trickle down to utility customers in the form of higher bills.
The delays and higher prices are not just a function of the OEMs exercising their pricing power, however.
Nearly all components of a fossil gas power plant — from transformers to switchgears to iron and steel piping — have gotten pricier in the last decade.","Demand for gas turbines is soaring — and the price of a combined-cycle gas turbine is too, new research finds. Projects slated for completion in 2030 or 2031 are now “routinely reporting costs of $2,000 per kilowatt or more,” a jump of as much as 75% over near-term prices.

(As a point of comparison, projects that are slated to come online in the coming years reported costs of between $1,116 per kW and $1,427 per kW.)

These findings are the result of a collaboration of GridLab, Energy Futures Group, Component Reliability Consultants, and Halcyon. In their recent report, the authors attempt to put numbers to the anecdotes of rising prices for gas infrastructure, which is a surprisingly difficult task given that costs are also kept confidential in integrated resource plans and other public documents.

By pulling together what little data is available, though, the researchers provide a fuller picture of a market staggering under an unexpected boom in demand, one that is “a stark departure from historical cost assumptions and public cost projections.”

A combination of electrification, onshoring, and data centers has caused the U.S. to enter a period of major load growth. And while much of the new demand for energy is being met by renewables, the reliability requirements of especially data centers has prompted a surge of demand for gas.

“These elevated costs are likely to persist rather than decline, at least in the short-midterm,” the authors wrote; they add that this conclusion is supported by the financial reports of major gas turbine OEMs like GE Vernova, Siemens Energy, and Mitsubishi Power, who “are reporting strong demand and robust order backlogs.”

These three OEMs, they found, now require a reservation fee to secure a manufacturing slot; two Kentucky utilities, for instance, paid GE Vernova a $25 million reservation fee to reserve a turbine to be delivered in time for a facility to reach commercial operation in 2030.

And these are prices that will largely trickle down to utility customers in the form of higher bills. Utilities this year have already sought record rate increases, and electricity prices are increasingly a political sticking point.

Predictably, timelines for installing these high-price turbines are also getting longer. New combined-cycle resources often are looking at coming online in 2030 or 2031, a delay that is already complicating the tech industry’s race to build artificial intelligence infrastructure; increasingly, the AI race is a race to secure enough power.

The delays and higher prices are not just a function of the OEMs exercising their pricing power, however. Bottlenecks in engineering, procurement, and construction services (or EPC) are plaguing the energy industry more broadly, and contributing to delays.

And it’s not just the turbines themselves that are becoming more expensive. Nearly all components of a fossil gas power plant — from transformers to switchgears to iron and steel piping — have gotten pricier in the last decade. (The coronavirus pandemic took a particular toll on these supply chains.) Labor costs are also jumping due to inflation and a shortage of skilled workers.

The report warns that relying on outdated price assumptions for gas turbines “can lead to flawed resource planning and underestimation of project budgets.” They recommend that regulators and planners update their cost assumptions accordingly — and prioritize the transparency of any non-proprietary pricing data going forward, including via collaborative forums for stakeholders.

The stakes are high, and not just for individual projects. “The extended timelines for turbine delivery create a significant challenge for meeting future electricity demand, particularly as coal and other older fossil fuel plants are retired,” the authors write. “The need for substantial reservation fees also affects project financing and risk.”

They also recommend that loads like data centers evaluate flexible alternatives to gas, including utility-scale solar, wind, and battery storage.

This echoes the conclusions of certain major utilities that have concluded that renewables are the faster way of meeting the pressures of load growth. NextEra CEO John Ketchum has been particularly vocal about the fact that renewables are still the best option for getting new megawatts onto the grid, and fast — even as the company invests in new gas generation to meet longer-term needs.

“Renewables are here today,” said Ketchum on the company’s January earnings call. “You can build a wind project in 12 months, a storage facility in 15, and, you know, a solar project in 18 months.”",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-09-17T134257.993.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 15:01:02.867605

Fusion Power Expands Other U.S. fusion energy firms also are moving forward to scale up development.
According to sector trade group Fusion Industry Association, global private investment in fusion energy development around the world now totals more than $9.7 billion in about 50 projects, with $2.6 billion raised just last year.
Commonwealth Fusion will collaborate with Oak Ridge National Laboratory through one DOE program, said the company spokeswoman.","As it nears completion of an estimated $500-million nuclear fusion demonstration complex near Boston, developer Commonwealth Fusion Systems has gained $863 million from global tech investors in its latest funding round to also advance work on a planned 400-MW power plant in Virginia to produce fusion energy at commercial scale.

The firm uses high-temperature superconducting magnets developed in partnership with MIT to build what it says are smaller, lower-cost tokamak fusion systems and is on track to produce more output power than input power as early as 2027 at its SPARC pilot site in Devens, Mass. The pilot facility, set to produce from 50- to 100 MW of power, is about 65% complete with ongoing testing and assembly of components, said Bob Mumgaard, Commonwealth Fusion developer CEO and co-founder in a statement.

“This round of capital isn’t just about fusion generally as a concept, it’s about how do we make fusion into a commercial industrial endeavor,"" he told media.

Since installing the 24-ft dia, 75 ton disc-shaped stainless steel cryostat base in March at the SPARC site, the company team is beginning to build “the heart of our fusion energy system,” said Samer Hamade, vice president of projects.

Commonwealth Fusion announced last month that the $863 million raised in a just completed Series B2 fundraising round now has boosted its private investment total to nearly $3 billion since its founding in 2018, which it claims is one-third of all total capital investment in private fusion development projects. The round was ""oversubscribed,"" the company said.

New investors include tech giant Nvidia, Morgan Stanley and a consortium of 12 Japanese energy and financial firms led by Mitsui & Co. Ltd. and Mitsubishi Corp. Existing investors such as Google and Billl Gates-founded Breakthrough Energy Ventures increased their stakes.

Work on ARC, Commonwealth Fusion's larger successor to SPARC and the first commercial grid-scale power plant planned for a site near Richmond, is “in the early stages of approvals and site design,” with plans to be online in the early 2030s, according to a company spokesperson. The new financing will allow Commonwealth Fusion to start plant construction in the 2027-2028 time frame, she estimated.

For the ARC plant, the team is focusing on two materials that can handle the tokamak’s heat, radiation and mechanical stress, according to the Commonwealth Fusion website. These include “a vanadium alloy for the vacuum vessel structure that must withstand the powerful forces within the machine while operating at high temperatures for many years.""

So far, project development has been led by engineering consultant HDR, construction manager Bond Civil and structural engineers Thornton Tomasetti and VHB.

Google also signed on June 30 its first commercial commitment to fusion power, in an agreement with Commonwealth Fusion to purchase 200 MW of power from the ARC plant, comprising half of its planned output, and to have an option for power buys from future plants.

Fusion Power Expands

Other U.S. fusion energy firms also are moving forward to scale up development. Startup Helion Energy, which has $1 billion in private funding, announced in July the start of construction of its first planned power production reactor in Washington state—the 50-MW Orion reactor along the Columbia River set to deliver power into the Pacific Northwest grid.

The company also said it is on track to generate electricity later this year from its Polaris test reactor that was completed in 2024. ""Early testing has been encouraging, and they expect to demonstrate electricity this year,"" a spokesperson told S&P Global. Helion aims to use superheated fuel to produce fast-pulsed reactions that rhythmically change the surrounding magnetic field, directly generating electricity.

Helion has not disclosed the full cost of the project and said it still needs to obtain state permits. The firm touts a signed power supply contract with Microsoft and a $375-million investment from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

According to sector trade group Fusion Industry Association, global private investment in fusion energy development around the world now totals more than $9.7 billion in about 50 projects, with $2.6 billion raised just last year.

The U.S. Energy Dept. Energy under former President Joe Biden chose eight fusion developers to receive multiyear grants based on successful completion of a series of technology milestones in commercialization. On Sept. 10, the agency awarded $134 million in new grants under two programs to bolster U.S. leadership in fusion technologies. Commonwealth Fusion will collaborate with Oak Ridge National Laboratory through one DOE program, said the company spokeswoman.

While Energy Secretary Chris Wright has voiced support for fusion, sector proponents seek more funding commitment from the Trump administration and Congressional Republicans. The fusion trade group has asked for $10 billion over five years for milestrone-based programs and test facilities.",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/09/17/CFS.SPARC..jpg?height=635&t=1758111456&width=1200,N,,2025-09-17 14:02:17.094571

At a recent conference on the energy transition, Tani Cantil-Sakauye, PPIC president and CEO, moderated a discussion on the economic opportunities and challenges created by California’s energy policies.
“Infrastructure jobs traditionally have been very good jobs.
Cantil-Sakauye questioned how leaders can ensure that the energy transition does not leave any region behind.

At a recent conference on the energy transition, Tani Cantil-Sakauye, PPIC president and CEO, moderated a discussion on the economic opportunities and challenges created by California’s energy policies.

Today, California is “the number one manufacturing state in the country,” said Lance Hastings, president and CEO of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association, and continued growth in the sector revolves around the availability of energy. While industry leaders support ambitious changes for clean energy, Hastings cautioned against current strategies and timelines to meet climate goals, requesting greater collaboration: “We’ll happily sit at the table to find the best way to reduce emissions, in a way that doesn’t disrupt the economy.”

Sustaining jobs amid the energy transition has forced the state to take a hard look at its energy reality, according to Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher, president of the California Federation of Labor Unions (AFL-CIO). Despite legislation to phase out refineries, the state continues using oil, especially for cars; furthermore, the refineries have provided middle class jobs.

“When we use California oil … it is the cleanest. It is utilizing the best labor standards in the world,” Gonzalez Fletcher said. While California still relies on oil, the state needs to retain refinery workers as well as create “a workforce within renewable energy [with] good middle class jobs, ensuring the same standards [from] the fossil fuel industry are available to the next generation of workers.”

Meanwhile, the switch to renewable energy may fuel growth in the building sector because “the amount of building we have to do is massive,” said Ana Matosantos, managing director at Boston Consulting Group. “Infrastructure jobs traditionally have been very good jobs. The good news is we have enough land and enough water … to power the grid [we will] need. What we do not have is the pace of building” to do that, which requires clarity, foresight, and flexibility with plans—from training to purchasing.

Cantil-Sakauye questioned how leaders can ensure that the energy transition does not leave any region behind.

With projects like large-scale solar, lithium, and offshore wind, “there is a lot of opportunity for places that we don’t normally think of as job centers,” Gonzalez Fletcher said. “We have to make sure jobs are subject to the same standards as those that existed before—with collective bargaining, good wages, and health care.”

Hastings touted the good pay and career mobility available in the manufacturing sector, saying, “You can have a good job anywhere in the state if it’s the right job. The right job is one that contributes to the community and the economy—those are manufacturing jobs.”

“Sometimes we think about climate and economic opportunity as being at odds,” Matosantos said. “To invest in what we need to fuel our system and our energy, it’s a huge opportunity to … expand opportunities across the state. We need land and we need space … it can be a way to help lift up more regions.”

“This is an inflection point for California, we’re hearing it in the legislative oversight hearings … in the governor’s plan,” Cantil-Sakauye said. Ultimately, “[the energy transition] will take a pallet of resources,” including fossil fuels. “We still have momentum; we want to be smart about that momentum” to achieve California’s energy and economic goals.

“This new facility is built for scale, speed, and global impact,” said Enn Õunpuu, CEO of Elcogen.
“It reflects our broader vision for international expansion and leadership in clean energy solutions,” adding, “We plan to eventually license our technology and manufacturing blueprint to trusted partners.
With Elcogen’s new facility, Europe gains a powerful boost in electrolysis and fuel cell capacity – technologies that are inseparable from the hydrogen economy.
“We are committed to partnering with global system integrators, strategic partners and governments to build resilient, low-carbon energy systems of the future.”","We are very pleased to announce that we have now officially opened ELCO I, a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility on the outskirts of Tallinn, Estonia. The launch marks a pivotal step in scaling up the company’s role in the global energy transition.

The 14,000 m² facility significantly increases Elcogen’s available production capacity from 10 MW to 360 MW, positioning the company as one of Europe’s largest manufacturers of high-efficiency Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and Electrolysis (SOEC) technology. Elcogen’s components – cells, stacks and modules – are integrated into third-party systems for a wide range of applications including distributed energy, off-grid and stationary power, industrial backup, green hydrogen production, and Power-to-X solutions.

“This new facility is built for scale, speed, and global impact,” said Enn Õunpuu, CEO of Elcogen. “As demand for reliable Solid Oxide-based clean energy solutions accelerates worldwide, Elcogen is now uniquely positioned to deliver the high-performance technology the market needs, at commercial volumes.”

As efforts to cut industrial emissions, develop green hydrogen, and improve energy resilience gather pace, this new facility is seen as a boost to clean technology production at a time when energy security, supply chain stability, and net-zero commitments are increasingly shaping government policy and private investment.

Built for a Global Scale

The facility integrates advanced automation, R&D capabilities, and sustainable design features to support international supply chains. It is powered by a 9 MW energy supply from the nearby Iru Power Plant and incorporates sustainability measures such as process heat reuse and thermal oxidisers to reduce emissions.

With approximately EUR 50 million in capital investment, the facility was delivered on time and on budget by construction partner Maru Ehitus AS and equipment suppliers. Funding for the project was provided by Elcogen stakeholders, including Baker Hughes, a leading global energy technology company serving the energy industry and various industrial segments, and South Korea’s HD Hyundai, one of the world’s largest industrial conglomerates, renowned for its leadership in shipbuilding, heavy machinery, and energy innovation. The project also received support from the European Innovation Fund, which has committed an additional EUR 25 million to expand capacity under Elcogen’s “ELCO I” initiative.

“As the name implies, ELCO I serves as a flagship model designed to guide future development initiatives globally,” said Õunpuu. “It reflects our broader vision for international expansion and leadership in clean energy solutions,” adding, “We plan to eventually license our technology and manufacturing blueprint to trusted partners. This ensures consistent IP control while enabling local manufacturing – a particularly attractive proposition for markets focused on domestic production and resilient supply chains.”

Driving Forward the Energy Transition

Founded in 2001, Elcogen has grown into a strategic technology partner for global system integrators, supplying the fuel cell and electrolyser components behind many of the world’s most advanced clean energy systems.

Elcogen’s workforce now includes nearly 150 employees from over 20 nationalities, bringing together more than 500 years of combined experience in Solid Oxide technology. The new facility will eventually support the creation of circa. 300 local jobs as Elcogen transitions to mass production and increases global delivery capabilities.

“Yes, we are expanding capacity, but this is also about increasing the performance of our products and reducing costs for our partners across the energy value chain,” said Enn Õunpuu. “This is a facility designed to deliver on the promise of clean energy, now.”

A Global Gathering for a Global Mission

Elcogen’s launch event held on Tuesday September 16th brought together more than 300 guests, including investors, technology partners, and collaborators from across Europe, Asia, and North America. Key attendees included representatives from Baker Hughes, HD Hyundai, the venture capital fund SmartCap, LHV Bank and leading research institutions such as Tartu University and Tallinn University of Technology.

Although unable to attend in person, Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, CEO of Hydrogen Europe, shared a video message with guests at the event, offering his strong support for the launch:

“Estonia has once again proven its extraordinary creativity and productivity in clean-tech innovation. With Elcogen’s new facility, Europe gains a powerful boost in electrolysis and fuel cell capacity – technologies that are inseparable from the hydrogen economy. The roots of excellence now bear fruit on an industrial scale. This makes us proud as Europeans: hydrogen is the people’s molecule, and Estonia shows how to turn vision into reality.”

Last month, CCLers mobilized en masse to contact their members of Congress ahead of the appropriations process. Together, we sent 12,859 emails to lawmakers encouraging them to fund key climate and clean energy programs.

Every year, Congress decides which programs and agencies to fund, and what level to fund them at. This is referred to as the appropriations process.

CCL hasn’t weighed in on this process before, but we felt this is an important avenue to urge Congress to reassert their authority. This action helped preserve our pathway to success, which we’ve identified is through work with Congress. Additionally, the Trump administration’s fiscal year 2026 (FY26) budget is seeking dramatic cuts to climate and clean energy programs, and we felt our voices could make a valuable impact.

The process is ongoing, but early signs from Congress are promising. On September 4, the House passed an energy and water appropriations bill. There’s no good way to sugarcoat it: This bill definitely included some harmful cuts to climate and clean energy programs, but the cuts are much less significant than those outlined in the President’s version of the budget.

During the debate on the bill, Republican members of Congress, including the chairman of the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Subcommittee, Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-TN), pushed back on completely gutting those programs. Publicly, he stated these programs are bipartisan and have his support.

Springing into Action

Congress passes appropriations bills each year to fund government operations, usually by the September 30 deadline (the start of the federal fiscal year).

We told Congress to support robust funding for programs at NOAA, NASA, and the Department of Energy that will help preserve critical science and research, strengthen clean energy infrastructure, and ensure that America’s grid can meet rising demand.

We asked our representatives to reject proposed cuts to these agencies:

National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)

NASA’s Earth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists collect many different types of information about our planet and its climate. But the White House requested to slash NASA’s science funding by 47%.

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)

NOAA plays a critical role in weather forecasting, extreme weather warnings, and climate science. The agency’s research is also the gold standard for tracking the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and oceans, publishing that data publicly for America and the international community, and modeling/forecasting changes as a result. Yet the Trump administration’s proposed 2026 budget sought $2.2 billion cuts in NOAA research endeavors, grant programs and other initiatives, including dissolving the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research.

Department of Energy (DOE)

The Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) and Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA-E) are essential for energy innovation and reliability. EERE funds early-stage research and development activities to develop efficient energy and different types of energy sources, which is critical for America’s global energy leadership. Yet the White House had proposed cutting this office’s budget by 74%.

ARPA-E develops cutting edge energy technologies that keep us ahead of global competitors while driving down costs. It’s extremely bipartisan and well-supported in Congress; yet the White House’s budget proposes a 57% cut to this agency.

We Lobbied on This, Too!

If this all sounds familiar to you, it’s because we lobbied on this issue in July, too! During our 402 meetings on Capitol Hill, we asked Congress to support the clean energy transition for affordable and reliable power as well as a safer climate.

As a tactic to achieve this ask, we requested Congress support targeted programs that enable clean energy to compete, scale, and deliver dependable and affordable power to Americans. Specifically, we mentioned the DOE programs EERE and ARPA-A as two key programs to lower energy costs through innovation and clean energy investment.

Our mobilization built on this ask by generating 12,859 messages to Congress between August 13 and September 6.

The Results So Far

The appropriations process is a long one, but it’s a key focus for Congress right now. Appropriations are mostly negotiated behind the scenes, but we’re starting to see some results. The House passed its energy and water appropriations bill early in September, which significantly reduced cuts to Department of Energy programs we lobbied and mobilized around protecting. During the debate, Republican members of the committee, including the committee chair, Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-TN) pushed back on additional major cuts to the DOE programs.

While this specific bill will not necessarily be what’s ultimately signed into law (the Senate and House still have to negotiate and agree), we’ve already made a difference. Thanks to everyone who sent one of our 12,859 contacts to Congress. Remember, it’s timely actions like these that create a major impact in our country’s climate policies.",https://citizensclimatelobby.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/August-action.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 14:01:57.416468

This investment, part of a $1.2 billion conditional loan, supports the construction of a lithium-ion battery separator manufacturing facility in Terre Haute, IndianaDOE Approves Loan Disbursement to ENTEK Supporting American Manufacturing and Securing Energy Supply Chains[ 1 ]. By focusing on a critical yet often overlooked component of battery technology, the project aligns with the Biden-Harris Administration's broader goals of onshoring clean energy manufacturing, reducing reliance on foreign supply chains, and accelerating the transition to electric vehicles (EVs).

Critical Minerals and the EV Supply Chain: A Strategic Bottleneck

Lithium-ion battery separators—thin, porous membranes that prevent short circuits while enabling ion flow—are a linchpin in battery performance and safety. Despite their importance, the U.S. has historically relied on foreign suppliers, particularly China, for separator production. Entek's project addresses this vulnerability by establishing the first U.S.-owned “wet-process” separator manufacturing facilityDOE Approves Loan Disbursement to ENTEK Supporting American Manufacturing and Securing Energy Supply Chains[ 1 ]. This technology, which involves coating a polymer base with ceramic materials to enhance thermal stability, is critical for high-performance EV batteries.

According to a report by the DOE's Loan Programs Office (LPO), the facility will produce 1.72 billion square meters of separator material annually, sufficient to support 1.9 million mid-size EVs or 1.3 million eSUVsLPO Announces Conditional Commitment to ENTEK Lithium Separators to Build Indiana EV Battery Separator Manufacturing Plant[ 2 ]. This capacity directly addresses the projected surge in EV demand, which the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates will require a tenfold increase in battery production by 2030LPO Announces Conditional Commitment to ENTEK Lithium Separators to Build Indiana EV Battery Separator Manufacturing Plant[ 2 ]. By securing domestic separator production, the U.S. reduces its exposure to geopolitical risks and supply chain disruptions, particularly in light of China's dominance in global separator manufacturing (over 80% of capacity as of 2023)LPO Announces Conditional Commitment to ENTEK Lithium Separators to Build Indiana EV Battery Separator Manufacturing Plant[ 2 ].

Energy Security and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Synergy

The investment also aligns with the IRA's incentives for clean vehicle production, including the 30D Clean Vehicle Credit and 45X production tax creditsLPO Announces Conditional Commitment to ENTEK Lithium Separators to Build Indiana EV Battery Separator Manufacturing Plant[ 2 ]. Entek's separators will enable battery manufacturers to meet IRA content requirements, which mandate increasing U.S. sourcing of critical minerals and components over time. For instance, the 45X credit offers up to $40 per kilowatt-hour for batteries containing a growing percentage of domestically sourced materialsLPO Announces Conditional Commitment to ENTEK Lithium Separators to Build Indiana EV Battery Separator Manufacturing Plant[ 2 ]. By producing separators locally, Entek helps battery makers qualify for these credits, creating a virtuous cycle of domestic value creation.

Furthermore, the project supports the administration's “whole-of-government” approach to energy security. As stated by the LPO, the loan reinforces efforts to “build a clean energy future” while creating 763 construction jobs and 635 operational jobsLPO Announces Conditional Commitment to ENTEK Lithium Separators to Build Indiana EV Battery Separator Manufacturing Plant[ 2 ]. Notably, Entek's hiring strategy prioritizes partnerships with local institutions like Ivy Tech Community College and Indiana State University, ensuring workforce development aligns with regional economic needsDOE Approves Loan Disbursement to ENTEK Supporting American Manufacturing and Securing Energy Supply Chains[ 1 ].

Broader Implications for U.S. Competitiveness

The strategic value of this investment extends beyond EVs. Lithium-ion batteries are also essential for grid-scale energy storage, a sector projected to grow 15-fold by 2040LPO Announces Conditional Commitment to ENTEK Lithium Separators to Build Indiana EV Battery Separator Manufacturing Plant[ 2 ]. By securing a domestic supply of high-quality separators, the U.S. positions itself to lead in both transportation and energy storage markets. This is particularly critical as global competitors, including China and the European Union, aggressively subsidize their battery industries.

Conclusion: A Model for Resilient Supply Chains

The DOE's investment in Entek underscores a paradigm shift in U.S. energy policy—one that prioritizes strategic self-reliance over cost efficiency. By targeting a bottleneck in the EV supply chain and leveraging public-private partnerships, the project exemplifies how targeted interventions can catalyze broader industry transformation. As the global race for clean energy intensifies, such initiatives will be critical to ensuring the U.S. remains a leader in the technologies of the future.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd23363a0bc001.png,N,,2025-09-17 13:03:22.672410

A decade ago, someone in the market for a new car with less than $25,000 to spend, had 43 different models to choose from. Today, there are five, according to Cox Automotive. None is electric.

But stalwarts like Ford Motor Co. and startups like Slate Auto are looking to change that, and they’re focusing on Americans’ favorite vehicle: the pickup.

With President Donald Trump’s tax bill killing EV incentives at the end of the month, the push for a sub-$30,000 vehicle that runs on electrons may help buttress the projected dip in sales.

Options Creep

The average price of a new car in the U.S. now hovers at $49,100, nearly a third higher than it was in the summer of 2019. The average EV price is higher still, clocking in at $8,000 above that of the industry at-large, according to Cox Automotive.

Much of the recent auto inflation can be tied directly to options and add-ons. During the peak of the pandemic-related supply chain crunch, auto executives had trouble getting enough parts, so they put what little they could find into more expensive, lavish vehicles. In many ways, they never looked back.

Last year, the average car sold for one-third more than the average starting price. Most buyers either didn’t want bare-bones base models, or couldn’t find them.

But some EV makers see a change ahead. At Slate’s launch event, CEO Chris Barman delivered what has since become a bit of a stump speech for cheap EVs. “The definition of what’s affordable is broken,” she said.

A Blank Slate

Every year, AutoPacific, an industry consultancy, asks car shoppers what features they need. For those looking to spend under $35,000, the list is short. Generally, budget-conscious drivers are willing to splurge for safety features and apathetic when it comes to leather seats, head-up displays and advanced driver-assistance systems.

Slate plans to deliver its truck late next year. (Slate Auto/dpa/TNS)

None of this is lost on Slate. The company’s truck, which it plans to deliver late next year, is to a Ford F-150 what an Ikea futon is to a Pottery Barn sectional. The base version — the company calls it “the blank Slate” — is best described by what it isn’t. It lacks a touchscreen, ambient lighting, cooled seats, air conditioning, all-wheel drive, a stereo and virtually any kind of driver-assistance.

“You could say we took out everything that wasn’t a car,” Barman said at the launch event.

What Slate promises in return is a sticker price in the mid-$20,000s, before any incentives. By Slate’s reckoning, the market is sizable. In America, we love our trucks, but only about one-third of U.S. truck owners tow regularly. We love our road trips, but on average only drive about 30 miles a day.

While roughly 163,000 Americans buy small pickups in a typical year, the potential market for Slate’s EV expands when considering the 4.3 million people who buy a small SUV or the 1.2 million or so who drive off in a compact or subcompact car.

Would-be buyers can also purchase add-ons a la carte including speakers, a spare tire, or a kit that converts the truck to an SUV. Buyers can also add accessories in the years after their initial purchase, creating what the company hopes will be a long-tail revenue source.

Detroit Reacts

Still, AutoPacific Chief Analyst Ed Kim sees Slate challenged on two fronts. Those considering the startup’s entry-level configuration may instead spring for a used truck that will offer far more features and niceties for the same price. And those considering a higher-end Slate may instead spend their money on a new machine from an established carmaker — say, the Ford Maverick, a pickup that starts around $27,000.

In fact, Ford, which dominates the market for full-size pickups, announced plans in August to make a midsize electric truck that will sell for about $30,000, as well as a battery-powered SUV that will start below $40,000.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said the company was making a “tremendous pivot” to more affordable EVs. “This is a Model T moment for the company,” he told analysts, invoking a car whose price point put Ford on the map and made automobiles ubiquitous in America.

Toyota's Tacoma has long outsold every midsize pickup on the market. (Toyota)

Toyota Motor Corp., whose Tacoma has long outsold every midsize pickup on the market, is eyeing the tiny-truck market as well. The current Tacoma starts just shy of $32,000; if the company rolls out a smaller rig for less money, it will add yet another option for budget-conscious buyers.

Most Americans say they’re EV inclined. While battery-powered cars comprise only about one in 10 new cars sales, almost 60% of shoppers say they are “very” or “somewhat” likely to buy an electric vehicle, according to JD Power.

Price is one of the obstacles, a speed bump the Trump administration made bigger when the president signed a tax law that will eliminate federal incentives for battery-powered cars and trucks. Without up to $7,500 purchase tax credits, EVs are expected to be just 27% of the market in 2030, down from nearly half had the incentives stayed in place, according to BloombergNEF’s projections.

Still, BNEF expects electric cars to be as cheap or cheaper than gas versions by around 2028. Even if they won’t help bridge the expected EV sales gap, cheaper models from Slate and Ford could help spur adoption after federal incentives disappear.

Derek Dufon, 48, an architect in Iowa, put down a $50 deposit on a Slate hours after its reveal. Dufon doesn’t need much in the way of luxuries, just space to haul drawings and building materials to job sites and programmable air conditioning for Henry, his boxer-hound mutt.

“It would be great for work,” Dufon says of the truck. “And I’ve got an old house, so there’s always a project going on with that.”",https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_1200x630/public/2025-09/Ford-EV-bb-1200.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 13:01:56.443435

Using standardized data center designs and prefabricated components could further accelerate construction timelines and get data centers up and running years faster than previous generations of data centers built in traditional hubs like Northern Virginia or Silicon Valley.
Data center developers already recognize the advantages of this coordinated approach.
This is a challenge even for the largest AI developers.
As a result, Stargate has quietly scaled back its 2025 ambitions to building a single data center -- in Ohio.","Artificial intelligence is booming -- and America's power grid is struggling to keep up.

At the World Economic Forum, President Trump recently warned that ""We need double the energy we currently have in the United States for AI to be as big as we want to have it."" Elon Musk has echoed similar concerns, predicting that AI data centers could overwhelm the electricity supply next year. The Department of Energy predicts that AI-driven electricity demand could increase sixfold by 2030.

They're right about the scale of AI's electricity needs. But they're wrong about the diagnosis.

America doesn't suffer from a lack of energy resources. We have vast oil and gas reserves, plus growing solar and wind energy capacity. The real problem is getting the electricity that's already, or soon could be, generated from these energy sources to the data centers where it's needed.

Solving this coordination challenge will require a new approach to energy infrastructure -- one with an eye toward future needs.

This distinction between coordination and total capacity matters. If the problem were simply about generating more electricity overall, the solution would be straightforward: build more power plants and transmission lines to bring power to all the new data centers. But that would -- and will -- take years, if not decades. New transmission lines alone often take years to complete.

Instead, we need to build new data centers next to existing energy deposits -- such as natural gas fields in places like West Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota, and elsewhere -- so that power-hungry data centers can build on-site generating plants and obtain the electricity they need, without having to connect to the broader grid. Using standardized data center designs and prefabricated components could further accelerate construction timelines and get data centers up and running years faster than previous generations of data centers built in traditional hubs like Northern Virginia or Silicon Valley.

Data center developers already recognize the advantages of this coordinated approach. A recent KPMG survey revealed that 77% of data center stakeholders consider it key to build alongside energy generation.

But in practice, data center developers often struggle to understand and vet energy producers. And in turn, those producers often misunderstand the needs of data center operators.

This is a challenge even for the largest AI developers. The Stargate project, a $500 billion AI data center investment backed by OpenAI and SoftBank, chose Abilene, Texas, as its flagship site after fielding interest from sixteen different states -- largely for Abilene's energy availability, alongside other land and regulatory advantages. Despite the initial fanfare, practical challenges quickly tempered aspirations, and the initiative has mostly stalled. As a result, Stargate has quietly scaled back its 2025 ambitions to building a single data center -- in Ohio.

To lead in the AI age, America will need more than chips and capital. It needs clearer rules, faster transactions between energy producers and AI developers, and a system that rewards coordination just as much as production.

If we solve this coordination challenge, America can lead the AI revolution and improve everything from health care to education to national security. But if we fail, we'll be left with plenty of power -- just not where it matters.",https://assets.realclear.com/images/69/697262_6_.jpeg,N,,2025-09-17 14:02:20.396840

The U.S. population increased by 14% during that period, so per capita, emissions fell by 30%, according to EIA.
“Increased electricity generation from natural gas, which releases about half as many CO2 emissions per unit of energy when combusted as coal, and from non-CO2-emitting wind and solar generation offset the decrease in coal generation,” EIA said.
Emissions fell the least in Idaho, where they dropped by 3%, and Mississippi, where they dropped by 1%.
“In 2023, Maryland had the lowest per capita CO2 emissions of any state, at 7.8 metric tons of CO2 (mtCO2), which is the second lowest in recorded data beginning in 1960,” EIA said.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

Per capita carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption fell in every state from 2005 to 2023, primarily due to less coal being burned, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a Monday report.

In total, CO2 emissions fell by 20% in those years. The U.S. population increased by 14% during that period, so per capita, emissions fell by 30%, according to EIA.

“Increased electricity generation from natural gas, which releases about half as many CO2 emissions per unit of energy when combusted as coal, and from non-CO2-emitting wind and solar generation offset the decrease in coal generation,” EIA said.

Emissions decreased in every state, falling the most in Maryland and the District of Columbia, which saw per capita drops of 49% and 48%, respectively. Emissions fell the least in Idaho, where they dropped by 3%, and Mississippi, where they dropped by 1%.

“In 2023, Maryland had the lowest per capita CO2 emissions of any state, at 7.8 metric tons of CO2 (mtCO2), which is the second lowest in recorded data beginning in 1960,” EIA said. “The District of Columbia has lower per capita CO2 emissions than any state and tied its record low of 3.6 mtCO2 in 2023.”

EIA forecasts a 1% increase in total U.S. emissions from energy consumption this year, “in part because of more recent increased fossil fuel consumption for crude oil production and electricity generation growth.”

In 2023, the transportation sector was responsible for the largest share of emissions from energy consumption across 28 states, EIA said.

EPA said the move “provides flexibility to begin certain building activities that are not related to air emissions, such as installing cement pads, before obtaining a Clean Air Act construction permit.” “For years, Clean Air Act permitting has been an obstacle to innovation and growth,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.
EPA must go through the regulatory process to change the definition of “begin actual construction” in permitting new or updated sources of air pollution.

Trump administration officials say this will help speed up development needed to power artificial intelligence efforts and to reshore manufacturing.

But environmental advocates say it would undermine clean air protections and deny public involvement in communities where polluting facilities are built.

EPA said the move “provides flexibility to begin certain building activities that are not related to air emissions, such as installing cement pads, before obtaining a Clean Air Act construction permit.”

“For years, Clean Air Act permitting has been an obstacle to innovation and growth,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. “We are continuing to fix this broken system. Today’s guidance is another step to allow the build out of essential power generation, data centers, and manufacturing projects that will bring about America’s Golden Age.”

The Clean Air Act was first enacted in 1955 and got major updates in the 1970s. It aims to protect human health and the environment from emissions that pollute the air.

EPA must go through the regulatory process to change the definition of “begin actual construction” in permitting new or updated sources of air pollution. Officials hope to finalize a rule in 2026.

Zeldin joined President Donald Trump at the Energy and Innovation Summit at Carnegie Mellon University in July. The event, organized by Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.), sought to position Pennsylvania as a leader in AI and the energy needed to power it, with an emphasis on natural gas.

Following the event, Zeldin wrote in an op-ed that permit reform “is a core pillar of my Powering the Great American Comeback initiative.”

While the details of the proposal are not yet released, the move signals an attempted rollback of Clean Air Act protections, said Angela Kilbert, senior attorney with PennFuture.

“Allowing for a broader amount of pre-construction before air permitting exists, runs the risk of a source becoming a foregone conclusion,” Kilbert said. “It will undermine the ability of the agency to actually review what the source intends to be and do, and it also undermines what the public is able to comment on.”

Alex Bomstein, executive director of Clean Air Council, said companies can exert more pressure on regulators if they can start building, and investing, before getting all their permits.

“A lot of permitting is political. It shouldn't be, but it is,” Bomstein said.

He said the Clean Air Act is estimated to have created trillions of dollars in benefits for Americans’ health and welfare.

“This is yet another attempt to chip away at it, to make it less effective, to make sure we don't get those savings, to make sure that we are sicker and die younger; and all in the service of the fossil fuel industry and AI dominance,” Bomstein said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6abce4a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1518x797+0+2/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fsites%2Fwesa%2Ffiles%2F202009%2Findustrial_facilities_like_the_clairton_coke_works_in_allegheny_county_are_sources_of_fine_particulate_pollution..jpg,N,,2025-09-17 12:05:26.977019

Electric vehicle demand is still rising in the United States, but growth has slowed amidst stalling EV charger expansion, per the conclusions of theHERE–SBD EV Indexpublished Sept. 4 by global mapping company Here Technologies and automotive research firm SBD Automotive.

According to the report, the U.S. added 37,000 EV charging points to its overall network between June 2024 and June 2025 — a 19% increase that translates to a 52% increase in total charge power. However, the expansion between 2023 and 2024 was much bigger, with a 32% increase in charging points and 82% boost in total charge power.

The index authors combined market data, including Here Technologies’ EV charge point information, with the results of an SBD survey of drivers, including 1,000 in the U.S. to analyze EV transition progress and obstacles.

Per the survey, 53% of U.S. respondents pointed to a “perception” of the lack of charging access as the top barrier to EV adoption. In addition, 57% of U.S. respondents said they were likely to buy a traditional gasoline-powered car for their next vehicle.

The findings “make clear that current efforts are not sufficient to meet most regional electrification ambitions, underscoring the need for stronger policies and more proactive product strategies,” Robert Fisher, electrification and sustainability principal at SBD Automotive, said in a statement.

Policy changes have created obstacles in the U.S. EV transition, including the Trump administration’s six-month freeze of the federal EV charging expansion program (since reversed), the uneven deployment of the federal program at the state level and the impending expiration of EV tax credits, the report noted.

Still, EV owners are satisfied with their vehicles, the survey found, with only 5% of current EV drivers in the U.S. saying they would switch away from electric. Plus, many states are steadily improving their EV charger landscapes, as evidenced by the index’s state EV infrastructure and uptake ratings. States were ranked based on the number of public chargers per road length (how far one must drive for a charger), the average capacity of public chargers (how fast one can charge), the ratio of public chargers to EVs (the likelihood of finding an open charger) and the share of EVs on the road.

Delaware was ranked the top state for the second year in a row even though it saw declines in its ratio of public chargers to EVs and the average charging power of public stations.

Washington, D.C., New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts rounded out the top five, while Nebraska, Minnesota, Arkansas, Idaho and Alaska ranked in the bottom five.

30%: EV Registrations In July Show Big Gains For Some, But Not All

The sales numbers reported by the car companies are one data point we use to track who's up and who's down. But arguably a more useful metric is actual registration data from each state, and that can take a while to tally up.

S&P Global Mobility has the EV registration numbers for July, and understandably, people are rushing to get a good deal while they can. As Automotive News reports, here are some of the winners and losers from that month:

Tesla missed out on the July surge, with its five models losing ground compared with a year earlier for a 13 percent overall decline, the data showed. Newcomers Rivian and VinFast also saw registrations slip while Lucid posted a small gain.

The Model Y’s nearest direct competitor in July was the Chevrolet Equinox EV with 8,447 registrations, a nearly four-times gain versus a year earlier, S&P Global Mobility said. As a brand, Chevrolet’s registrations doubled to 11,655.

Volkswagen’s ID. 4 compact crossover also surged in July, with registrations of 3,974 vehicles, a 93 percent gain compared with the year-earlier month, the data showed. Across the brand, EV registrations jumped 127 percent to 4,669 vehicles.

In the luxury segment, Cadillac’s EV registrations rose 76 percent in July to 4,687 vehicles and Audi’s more than tripled to 4,406, the data showed. BMW slid 37 percent to 3,432 and Mercedes-Benz fell 29 percent to 1,955 vehicles.

Evidently, brand baggage at Tesla—if we want to give it a charitable name—is dragging things down, and even the updated Model Y can't save things. The other issue may be Tesla's increasing lack of options in various segments, like cheaper small crossovers or large, three-row SUVs.

For now, the biggest winners seem to be General Motors' family of brands, Hyundai, Ford and Honda. But there's one other notable tidbit here about that last automaker:

Honda’s only fully electric model, the Prologue crossover, carried average incentives of $12,946 per vehicle in July, according to Motor Intelligence. A year earlier, the incentives averaged $7,036 per vehicle.

I have two takeaways here: one, if you're looking for a great EV deal before Sept. 30, you can probably get a Honda Prologue for a steal. And two, considering how much money Honda must be losing with all those incentives, don't expect Prologue deals to last forever.

In fact, probably don't expect most of these deals to last forever. Here's our list of September EV deals. Godspeed and good luck if you're car-hunting this week and next.

60%: Tesla Settles Two Autopilot-Related Fatal Crash Lawsuits

Tesla Model Y Juniper Autopilot Screen

""We will never surrender/settle an unjust case against us, even if we will probably lose,"" Tesla CEO Elon Musk boasted in 2022. (There's always a tweet.) As tough as that sounds, Tesla is hanging its entire future on autonomous driving technology and robotics, and a recent $243 million civil judgment over an Autopilot-related fatal crash in Florida isn't the kind of headache it needs right now.

That may be why, as Reuters reported today, Tesla is settling two separate California crashes in 2019 involving Autopilot:

The electric-vehicle maker, which has settled several other cases involving its vehicles and self-driving technology, had rejected a $60 million settlement proposal for the Florida lawsuit, a filing showed last month.

The Florida verdict and the two settlements in California are significant as much of Tesla's $1.4 trillion valuation hangs on CEO Elon Musk's promise to rapidly expand its robotaxis and the full self-driving (FSD) software that underpins them. FSD is an advanced version of Autopilot.

One lawsuit, the settlement notice for which was filed on Tuesday, relates to the death of a 15-year-old boy who was traveling in Alameda County, California, with his father in a vehicle when it was rear-ended by a Tesla Model 3, which had Autopilot engaged, causing the victim's vehicle to roll over and crash into the center barrier. The boy succumbed to his injuries from the collision.

The other case relates to the death in December 2019 of two people who were traveling through an intersection in Gardena, California, in a Honda Civic when a Tesla Model S, equipped with Autopilot, failed to stop at a red light at high speed and crashed into the victims' vehicle.

Neither party disclosed the terms of those settlements, but after the Florida verdict, one can assume they were cheaper than dragging this into a trial.

Tesla is eager to roll out more Full Self-Driving-equipped Robotaxis in various cities. But critics say it has a long way to go to prove the camera-based technology's viability, and that the string of Autopilot- and FSD-related crashes and deaths should raise questions about its overall safety.

90%: Rivian Bucks An 'EV Slowdown' As Georgia Factory Breaks Ground

Rivian R2

Rivian started life in a former Mitsubishi plant in Normal, Ill. But that plant isn't terribly suited to its long-term needs, particularly ramping up the $45,000 Rivian R2 and the other EVs that will use its platform. Hence, a new factory east of Atlanta to make those cars and hopefully cement the automaker's future.

The Rivian Georgia plant broke ground on Tuesday and the Wall Street Journal has the story on why both the automaker and state officials are optimistic about its prospects long-term, even without any EV tax credits to help with sales:

[CEO RJ Scaringe] said that there has been an overemphasis on the recent policy changes.

“I didn’t start this company and plan to scale the business because of that credit,” Scaringe said. “So that goes away, we’re still deeply convicted on the products, deeply convicted on the technology we’re building.”

The plant represents the latest addition to the growing automotive-manufacturing presence in Georgia.

Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, also attended the ceremony on Tuesday, saying the project will be an economic boon to the local area.

“This project stretches back many years, and leaders have worked to secure a transformational project like this that will literally have generational benefits,” he told attendees.

Georgia, of course, has had some painful moments with its big EV industrial push. The Hyundai Metaplant outside Savannah was the site of a massive immigration raid that's complicating relations with South Korea and delaying production at its associated battery plant. That plant, too, could soon produce EVs that are less enticing without the tax credit, and the same may end up being true of the R2.

100%: How Do Automakers Sell EVs In The Post-Tax Credit Era?

2024 Honda Prologue Elite

I don't have a crystal ball that tells me exactly what will happen to America's EV market without the tax credits or, perhaps more crucially, any emissions rules that were driving a more electric market. But I am confident that the participation-trophy era of EVs is over, and these cars will have to succeed on their own merits and not be afterthoughts that were only created because they had to be.

That's also going to mean changes to how automakers market these cars and work with dealers to sell them. ""I got a great deal"" won't cut it anymore. And for an industry that really only knows how to sell gas cars, this is going to be a challenge.

In unleashing his war on solar and wind, Trump is directly opposing the will of the American people.","Trump’s policy attacks on solar and wind is stupid and dangerous — to our wallets, American industry, our health, or our climate.

On Inauguration Day 2025, Trump declared a “national energy emergency.” What he really declared was a war on renewable energy. And this war is already doing incredible harm to our health, our environment, and our wallets.

Renewable energy technologies like solar, wind, and the battery storage that supports them have been in Trump’s crosshairs since his first stint in the White House. Now, he’s wielding even more reckless and destructive policy tools to attack clean energy.

This comes as no surprise, given the campaign promises he’s made to the industry and the outpouring of cash it lavished on his re-election bid. Trump’s attacks on renewables work hand-in-hand with his pro-fossil policies — like opening up federal land to drilling and fast-tracking fossil fuel projects — for the benefit of his Big Oil buddies.

This couldn’t come at a worse time. While climate-fueled disasters ravage our country, Trump is striking down the renewables we need. Nothing less than a 100% transition to renewable energy will cut it if we are to avert climate catastrophe and save millions of lives.

Trump’s nonsensical attacks on clean, affordable renewables are dangerous. His actions are putting energy access and affordability, jobs, local economies, and our very lives at risk. Here’s what he’s doing, what’s at stake, and how we fight back.

Trump’s Battle Plans Against Wind and Solar

Since literally Day One, Trump has gone after wind and solar with far-reaching (and even illegal) action. That includes:

All but guaranteeing an end to federal support for renewable energy. Trump’s Big Ugly Bill clawed back tax credits for renewables and related manufacturing, threatening billions of dollars’ worth of renewable energy projects. The Trump administration then passed new rules to make it even harder for solar and wind projects to claim federal tax credits, hamstringing our energy transition. These new rules put unattainable requirements on clean energy projects, which will lead many to shutter. Meanwhile, the big Ugly Bill preserved and in some cases expanded benefits for fossil fuels.

Stopping wind projects. Trump has declared that the U.S. will see “no new windmills” on his watch and that his administration will stop approvals of solar and wind. He’s halted major offshore wind projects and frozen permitting and leasing for wind projects on federal lands and waters. In late August, he canceled $679 million in funding for offshore wind.

Freezing and rolling back funds already signed into law by Congress. This includes funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which set aside $27 billion for clean energy and climate resilience projects.

Taking away cost-saving solar projects from low-income families. Trump has moved to eliminate $7 billion in grants for the Solar for All Program, which would have helped more than 900,000 households gain access to solar energy by funding rooftop or community solar. The program was estimated to save these families more than $350 million a year on power bills.

Curtailing support for farmers to build solar. Trump’s U.S. Department of Agriculture announced new changes to stop farmers from accessing the Rural Energy for America Program. This program has helped thousands of farmers install solar panels to lower energy bills and earn additional income.

Trump’s War Will Raise Energy Costs

Transitioning to renewables isn’t just good for our climate and our futures, though that’s pretty compelling on its own. It’s also good for our wallets.

Solar and wind are the fastest, cheapest way to add new power to the grid. They’re now some of the cheapest forms of energy, period, even without subsidies.

Cutting support for renewables will result in companies turning to slower, dirtier, more expensive fossil fuels. Utilities will pass these costs onto customers in the form of higher bills.

While campaigning for his second term, Trump proclaimed that, “As President, I will set a national goal of ensuring that America has the No. 1 lowest cost of energy of any industrial country anywhere on Earth.” If he’s set that goal, he’s certainly failing.

Right now, electricity prices are surging at twice the rate of inflation. Trump has baselessly blamed that on renewables. But in fact, the states with the most renewables have seen lower price hikes or declines, according to Heatmap News.

Meanwhile, Trump’s policies will have a direct hand in making power more expensive. By one analysis, Trump’s Big Ugly Bill alone will have families paying $280 more a year on energy costs by 2035. On top of that, we’ll face greater healthcare costs from staying on polluting fossil fuels and the economic toll of climate change.

People in the U.S. are footing the bill for everything from hospital visits to storm recovery because we’re still stuck on fossil fuels. Rather than support renewables, Trump is stomping them down for the sake of his friends in the fossil fuel industry.

Trump’s War on Renewables is Senseless and Cruel

The Inflation Reduction Act spurred a manufacturing renaissance through its incentives for clean energy. The vast majority of resulting investments and benefits — including thousands of jobs — have gone to red states. Yet every Republican lawmaker voted to gut Inflation Reduction Act incentives through Trump’s Big Ugly Bill.

The impacts will be devastating for local industry and economies. The clean energy industry already began pulling back on new projects before the bill passed, in anticipation of big cuts. Since Trump took office, almost $28 billion-worth of clean energy projects have been cancelled or delayed.

By one analysis, during Trump’s first six months in office, companies have paused, cancelled, or shuttered solar, wind, EV, and battery projects totalling 19,000 jobs chopped.

Renewables aren’t just a no-brainer for our health and climate. They’re a no-brainer for the economy. They’ll bring more jobs, investment at the state and local level, and cheaper power for families. But rather than usher them in with incentives that level the playing field against ludicrously subsidized fossil fuels, Trump is pulling us backward.

To be clear, the solution isn’t so-called “permitting reform” to hasten energy projects, as some Democrats are discussing with Republicans. As Trump’s attacks on wind and solar show, this will only benefit the fossil fuel industry.

Such attacks are unimaginable at this critical juncture of the climate crisis, when we’re already seeing horrific climate-fueled disasters from coast to coast.

The people of this country know that renewables are the future. The vast majority support more solar power. Sixty percent say that expanding wind and solar is more important than expanding fossil fuels. In unleashing his war on solar and wind, Trump is directly opposing the will of the American people.

Fighting Back Against Trump’s War at the State Level

It’s clear that Trump is hell-bent on destroying federal investment in our livable future. While we continue to fight the worst of Trump’s policies from the streets to the Courts, we also know that’s not the only way to defend our planet.

State action is more important than ever. States have a huge opportunity — and obligation to current and future generations — to pick up the slack and pass bold climate action.

They can pass incentives for real renewables and remove boondoggles from incentive programs. That’s what we’re fighting for in California, to ensure the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard stops incentivizing polluting factory farms.

They can stop subsidies for dirty energy, one of which we already defeated in New York. After a long campaign with allies, we pushed the state assembly to stop forcing energy customers to subsidize new gas hookups.

And they can replace fossil fuels with renewables. In the Sunshine State, many Florida utilities are nevertheless clinging to fracked gas and planning to build out fracked gas infrastructure. There, we’re fighting utilities’ greedy price hikes and demanding a fossil-free future for Floridians.

The science is clear: a complete transition to renewables is essential for our climate, our health, and our wallets. While Trump wages his senseless attacks, we’ll continue to fight at the local, state, and national level for the 100% renewable future we need. We can’t afford anything less.",https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/evergreen_header_climate_pollution_9b.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 12:04:49.978667

Rivian has begun construction on its $5 billion Georgia plant even though the Trump administration ended the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers.

The Georgia facility, with a planned annual capacity of 200,000 vehicles, is key to Rivian achieving the scale necessary to profitably produce lower-priced R2 and future R3 models.

Rivian faces slowing U.S. EV sales, rising competition from established automakers, tariffs, and local opposition, making successful execution at the Georgia plant crucial to the company’s survival and growth.

Rivian has broken ground on its long-delayed $5 billion electric vehicle plant east of Atlanta, Georgia, even as President Donald Trump’s rollback of EV tax credits takes effect later this month.

According to the EV maker’s CEO, Rj Scaringe, the R2 SUV will succeed on its own merits, describing it as “an incredible five-passenger off-road machine” that just happens to be electric.

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is central to Rivian’s strategy to achieve profitability. The facility is expected to produce 200,000 units. Currently, Rivian manufactures R1T pickup trucks, R1S SUVs, and delivery vans for Amazon at its Normal, Illinois, plant.

The Illinois facility will begin producing the smaller R2 model next year, with prices starting at $45,000. The expansion will enable the assembly of 215,000 vehicles per year. This comes as Rivian expects to deliver 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles this year, down from 52,000 in 2024, in part to prepare for 2026 model launches.

Although EV sales growth is slow, increasing by just 1.5% in the first half of 2025, according to Cox Automotive, Tesla remains in the lead with almost 45% of U.S. EV sales. Rivian, with a 3% share, is the most successful startup automaker, but it’s facing increasing competition from Ford’s F-150 Lightning, Chevrolet Silverado EV, and other established automakers.

Additionally, Georgia is providing $1.5 billion in incentives for 7,500 jobs averaging $56,000 annually, with most incentives contingent on employment targets. The state has already invested $175 million in land preparation and infrastructure. Governor Brian Kemp has prioritized making Georgia a hub for electric mobility.

However, the company faces additional challenges, including $2,000 tariffs per vehicle, lost revenue from the end of EV tax credits, long-term competition from low-cost Chinese EVs, and local opposition citing environmental concerns. Delays in construction during 2024, along with cash constraints, also hindered progress.

Moreover, Rivian had previously received a $6.6 billion federal loan and a $5.8 billion investment from Volkswagen to support the development of its Georgia plant and technology. The company has worked closely with the U.S. Department of Energy and remains focused on scaling production and expanding its EV lineup.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/09172025-Rivian-GA-plant-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 12:04:07.779546

It's Wednesday, September 17, 2025, and this is The Morning Shift, your daily roundup of the top automotive headlines from around the world, in one place. This is where you'll find the most important stories that are shaping the way Americans drive and get around.

In this morning's edition, EV registrations take a big jump ahead of the death of the $7,500 vehicle tax credit, Rivian finally breaks ground on its Georgia plant, Nissan is shuttering design studios in the U.S. and Brazil, among other cost-cutting efforts, and GM is idling its midsize truck plant for three weeks because of a parts shortage.

EV buyers are doing everything they can to take advantage of the $7,500 tax credit before it expires on September 30, thanks to President Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress. That means new EV registrations at legacy automakers were up 27% in July, according to S&P Global Mobility.

In a not-entirely shocking development, Tesla missed out on July's surge. Of course, it still led the way when it came to overall sales, but its five models lost ground compared to a year earlier. The Austin, Texas-based company's registrations were down 13% overall. Rivian and VinFast also saw slips, while Lucid saw a small gain.

The top five were as follows: Tesla (49,774), Chevy (11,655), Hyundai (7,898), Ford (7,572) and Honda (6,089). From Automotive News:

EV registrations from all brands grew 6 percent in July to 124,961, S&P Global Mobility said. EV share of the light-vehicle market rose to 8.9 percent from 8.5 percent in July 2024.

From January to July, EV registrations grew 6.8 percent to 745,616 vehicles. Their share of the light-vehicle market rose 0.1 percentage point to 7.7 percent, the data showed.

Cox Automotive said third-quarter sales of new electric vehicles should hit an all-time record. It estimated August EV deliveries at 146,332 for a nearly 10 percent market share.

Aside from a race against the clock to buy an EV before the tax credit expires, incentives are driving EV sales, according to Auto News. Many of the most popular EVs on sale right now, like the Tesla Model Y and Honda Prologue, carry massive amounts of cash on the hood to help them get off showroom floors. It's tough to say how long those will last — especially after September 30 and especially as automakers continue to refocus on hybrids.

If you want my advice, I think that if you really want an EV in your driveway, you'd better get going, because this might be your last chance to get any sort of deal for a good long while.

It has been a long time coming, but Rivian has finally broken ground on its Georgia factory near Atlanta that is supposed to build the R2, R3 and other future lower-cost vehicles using a new platform. The EV maker had done prep work at the nearly 2,000-acre site before pausing in 2024 as it shifted production plans for its next vehicles, the R2, to its factory in Illinois. From Automotive News:

Rivian revived the Georgia project after approval of a $6.6 billion loan agreement with the Department of Energy in the waning days of the Biden administration in mid-January.

The automaker has said the Stanton Springs, Ga., project is critical to transforming into a mass-market brand and gaining the scale needed for future profitability.

[...]

The automaker has said the Stanton Springs, Ga., project is critical to transforming into a mass-market brand and gaining the scale needed for future profitability.

The automaker needs to scale up as quickly as possible using the federal loan package and state incentives for its Georgia plant before they expire, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions.

[...]

Rivian first announced the Georgia factory in December 2021 with production planned for 2024. When Rivian unveiled the R2 and R3 in 2024, it said it would first expand its Normal, Ill. factory for the R2 and pause Georgia to a future date.

The automaker now plans the first phase of construction to begin in 2026, followed by the start of production in 2028. Rivian will also make the R2 in Georgia, followed by the R3.

It's expected that the R2 will start around the $45,000 mark and the smaller R3 will be even less than that. Both undercut the larger R1T pickup and R1S crossover, which start well above $70,000. There are even some early rumblings of plans to make even lower-cost vehicles like an R4 and R5, but details on those cars are hazy at best.

Regardless, Rivian needs to lock in quickly. It's burning through cash like nobody's business, and while it does make a good product, that sort of thing cannot last forever.

More cuts are coming to Nissan. The Japanese automaker says it is closing design centers in California and Sao Paulo, Brazil. It is also scaling back its operations in London and Japan as part of a larger realignment of its global design organization. These changes are expected to be done by the end of the 2025 fiscal year. From Reuters:

The changes, part of its broader ""Re:Nissan"" plan, will consolidate its design organization into five hubs: Los Angeles, London, Shanghai, Tokyo and Japan's Atsugi.

Nissan said its Los Angeles ""Studio Six"" will become its primary U.S. design hub, while London will continue to support the automaker's Africa, Middle East, India, Europe and Oceania regions in collaboration with partner Renault.

The company did not disclose how many jobs would be affected.

Nissan CEO Ivan Espinosa, who took over in April, in May unveiled the ""Re:Nissan"" turnaround plan to restore profitability. It included measures such as cutting global production capacity to 2.5 million vehicles from 3.5 million and manufacturing sites to 10 from 17 by fiscal 2027.

Nissan is doing everything it can to right its sinking ship, so it makes sense that it would be making cuts like these. Let's just hope not too many jobs are impacted, though I'm sure that's going to be the case.

General Motors is idling its Wentzville Assembly mid-size truck plant in Missouri and temporarily laying off workers for three weeks because of a parts shortage. The pause is set to begin on September 29, and it'll last until October 20, impacting about 3,800 employees who build the Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon midsize pickup trucks as well as the Chevy Express and GMC Savana vans. From the Detroit Free Press:

""We have temporarily adjusted production schedules at Wentzville Assembly to address supply chain issues and align with overall business needs,"" GM spokesman Kevin Kelly said in a statement provided on Sept. 16. ""The plant is expected to resume normal operations on Oct. 20.

Plant executive Eric Shelhorn and UAW Local 2250 chairman Jon Daughterty notified employees in a letter posted to the union's website on Sept. 12.

""Although this temporary layoff will affect the majority of our team on all three shifts, skilled trades, stamping, body shop, final process and those groups that support these departments may have work available during this time,"" the letter read.

GM wouldn't provide specifics on what part or parts were causing the shortage, and I desperately want to know what parts are shared between the relatively new Canyon/Colorado and the Express, which has been relatively unchanged for nearly 30 years.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/ev-registrations-jump-before-trump-kills-tax-credit-at-the-end-of-the-month/l-intro-1758117488.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 13:02:56.788148

As reported by the Office of the Arizona Governor, Hobbs’ order mandates a brisk, 30-day turnaround for a report from State Land detailing how to fast-track energy projects.

Echoing the governor, this initiative is about handcrafting a more cost-effective energy future for Arizona. ""We have incredible potential to deliver affordable energy to every business and family who needs it. We just need to unleash it,"" Governor Hobbs stated. The Order aims to circumvent bureaucracy, cut down red tape, and prioritize common sense over outmoded protocols. In the process, Hobbs hopes to craft the scaffolding for the much-needed energy infrastructure.

Fleshing out the operational side, the Executive Order births the Arizona Energy Promise Taskforce. This assembly will map plans to bolster sizable growth, rein in energy expenditure for locals, and smooth out the regulatory bumps that slow down infrastructure projects. Taskforce duties also include scrutinizing how to match electric vehicle adoption with fuel affordability and touching base with energy-specific businesses affected by federal policy adjustments.

Notably, the Executive Order comes at a time when energy security hangs in a delicate balance. The repeal of green energy tax incentives and hindrances miring solar and wind project rollouts have thrown a spanner in the works of energy development and job creation. ""This Executive Order focuses on giving Arizona families the affordable and innovative energy future they want and deserve,"" mentioned Maren Mahoney, Director of the Governor’s Office of Resiliency. Meanwhile, projections indicate a possible 40% swell in peak demand across the next decade and a half.

Supporters of the move, such as NextEra Energy Resources and the Arizona Building and Construction Trades Council, laud the governor for her foresight. According to Jim Shandalov, Vice President of NextEra Energy Resources, Arizona’s initiative has made it a standard-bearer in affordable American-made energy.

At a grassroots level, organizations like Wildfire advocate for Hobbs' attention to energy affordability. ""Too many Arizonans are forced to choose between paying their energy bills and covering other essentials like food and medicine,"" said Kelly McGowan, executive director of Wildfire. Reducing energy bills is seen as critical to helping Arizonans live without having to compromise on essentials for a bill's sake.",https://img.hoodline.com/2025/9/governor-katie-hobbs-launches-bold-executive-order-to-revamp-arizona-s-energy-infrastructure-and-affordability.webp,N,,2025-09-17 12:05:39.672352

“Cutting the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution.
The United States missed an April deadline to submit emissions data to the United Nations, a requirement under the Paris accord.","The Environmental Protection Agency announced Friday a sweeping proposal to eliminate the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, a federal data collection system that has tracked emissions from thousands of the nation’s largest polluters since 2010. Administrator Lee Zeldin, citing President Donald Trump’s anti-climate executive actions, described the program as unnecessary bureaucracy, a characterization that has drawn widespread condemnation from environmental advocates, former agency officials, and even some industry voices.

Zeldin said in a statement that “the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality.” He added that “Alongside President Trump, E.P.A. continues to live up to the promise of unleashing energy dominance that powers the American dream.” The agency estimated that ending the program could save businesses up to $2.4 billion in compliance costs over the next decade.

Critics say the move would gut one of the government’s most basic climate tools. Since 2010, the program has collected data from about 8,000 facilities, including coal-burning power plants, oil refineries, steel mills, and landfills. That information has helped guide federal climate policy, shaped local health decisions, and been shared with the United Nations, which requires developed countries to submit domestic emissions tallies under the Paris climate agreement.

“President Trump promised Americans would have the cleanest air on Earth, but once again, Trump’s EPA is taking actions that move us further from that goal,” said Joseph Goffman, who led the EPA Office of Air and Radiation during the Biden administration and is now with the Environmental Protection Network. “Cutting the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses, and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.”

Goffman added, “By hiding this information from the public, Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality, and public health. It’s a further addition to the deliberate blockade against future action on climate change—and yet another example of the administration putting polluters before people’s health.”

The administration argues that the program’s elimination is about reducing costs, but environmental groups called it an attack on transparency and accountability. Patrick Drupp, the Sierra Club’s director of climate policy and advocacy, warned, “EPA cannot avoid the climate crisis by simply burying its head in the sand as it baselessly cuts off its main source of greenhouse gas emissions data.” He said, “The agency has provided no defensible reason to cancel the program; this is nothing more than EPA’s latest action to deny the reality of climate change and do everything it can to put the fossil fuel industry and corporate polluters before people. The Sierra Club will oppose this proposal every step of the way.”

Margie Alt, director of the Climate Action Campaign, described the rollback as “the Trump administration’s latest pro-polluter move to eliminate the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program” and “just another brazen step in their Polluters First agenda.” She added, “under the guise of saving Americans money, this is an attempt on the part of Trump, Lee Zeldin, and their polluter buddies to hide the ball and avoid responsibility for the deadly, dangerous, and expensive pollution they produce.”

Alt continued, “If they succeed, the nation’s biggest polluters will spew climate-wrecking pollution without accountability. The idea that tracking pollution does ‘nothing to improve air quality’ is absurd. If you don’t measure it, you can’t manage it. Hiding information and allowing fossil fuel companies to avoid accountability are the true goals of this rule.”

The BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor and environmental groups, echoed these concerns. Executive director Jason Walsh said, “the Trump administration continues to prove it does not care about the American people and their basic right to breathe clean air. This flies in the face of the EPA’s core mission—to protect the environment and public health.” He noted that “The proposal is wildly unpopular with even industry groups speaking against it because they know the value of having this emissions data available.”

“Everybody in this country deserves to know the air quality in their community and how their lives can be affected when they live near high-emitting facilities,” Walsh said. “Knowledge is power and—in this case—health. The administration shouldn’t be keeping people in the dark about the air they and their neighbors are breathing.”

The announcement also reverberates internationally. The United States missed an April deadline to submit emissions data to the United Nations, a requirement under the Paris accord. Trump began the yearlong withdrawal process from the pact on his first day back in office. The proposal to end the program further erodes U.S. commitments to international climate reporting, even as Europe launches new satellites dedicated to tracking carbon pollution.

Environmental law experts underscored the practical consequences of cutting off verified data. Carrie Jenks, executive director of the environmental and energy law program at Harvard Law School, explained that methane is “roughly 80 times more effective than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere in the short term.” She said, “Not having the government verify this data is hard, but there could still be some voluntary efforts to collect it.”

Some industry groups also voiced concern. The American Petroleum Institute said the oil and gas industry already reports greenhouse gas emissions “to a variety of stakeholders.” Dustin Meyer, senior vice president for policy, economics, and regulatory affairs at the API, said, “the oil and gas industry has a long track record of reporting greenhouse gas emissions to a variety of stakeholders, and we remain committed to doing so in a transparent and accurate way.”

The proposal follows other Trump administration rollbacks, including a decision just one day earlier to reverse rules on unsafe levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, in drinking water. Earthjustice attorney Katherine O’Brien said the PFAS decision “prioritizes chemical industry profits and utility companies’ bottom line over the health of children and families across the country.”

The EPA will publish the emissions proposal in the Federal Register and open a 47-day public comment period before finalizing the rule, likely within the next year. Environmental organizations have already signaled they will challenge the rollback.

As Goffman put it, “With this move, they’re taking away the practical and material capacity of the federal government to do the basic elements of climate policy making.”",https://i0.wp.com/s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.nationofchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/26124152/EPA-New-Power-Plant-Rule.png?fit=1200%2C628&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-17 12:05:36.004438

The PJM proposal would impact large new data center operations that are not using energy they have developed or acquired. Under emergency situations, PJM operators would cut off power to these data centers first, before ordering rolling blackouts at utilities or other responses.

The same issue confronts grid operators across the United States. PJM’s response stands out because its 13-state region, with 67 million customers, is the nation’s largest, and it hosts “data center alley” in northern Virginia, by far the largest U.S. concentration of the data farm installations.

The North American Electric Reliability Corp., the interstate grid’s security monitor, has a top-level planning committee developing policy proposals for managing data center challenges.

“There is already evidence that large loads impact bulk [wholesale power] system reliability,” NERC said in a committee report in July, citing grid disruptions in Virginia and Texas. NERC’s follow-up report with action proposals is scheduled for release later this year.

PJM’s policy welcomes the data center boom, joining President Donald Trump and the leadership of the power sector. PJM says it aims to enable “new large loads to connect as rapidly as possible and at the same time determine a plan for how reliability is maintained.”

The proposal would keep PJM from having to increase the system’s capacity to meet the peak demand from new data centers. But data centers that didn’t, or couldn’t, acquire enough generation to run their operations would face a risk of unpredictable power cutoffs when the PJM grid is stressed.

The proposal does not speak directly to a second critical issue stemming from the AI data center shock wave — how the plan will deal with the rapid increase in utility bills triggered by the data center’s power demands, said Tom Rutigliano, senior advocate for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“Forecasts for data center growth far exceed the rate PJM can add power plants,” NRDC said in a statement Monday. The increased power demand is expected to continue inflating electricity prices now, with faster acceleration beginning in mid-July 2028, NRDC said.

NRDC stated, “PJM’s plan aims to prevent blackouts, but fails to protect consumers from ever-increasing bills. Electricity costs in the region are up $12 billion this year alone.

“Based on calculations by NRDC using PJM data, under PJM’s plan the public will pay over $20 billion every year from 2028 through at least 2032 as forecast data centers continue to drive up prices,” according to NRDC. “This adds up to a $100 billion or higher bill over this period paid by PJM residents. Virtually all of this will be windfall payments to existing power plants rather than investment in new ones.”

Rutigliano said NRDC cost figures derive from existing formulas that PJM uses to establish “capacity” payments in annual auctions. These payments to power plant operators are to incentivize enough generation to keep operating to cover expected power demands in future years. They are ultimately paid by utility customers.

NRDC’s calculation assumes that increasing data center power demand will keep capacity prices at established ceiling prices, he added.

PJM’s proposal will be open for discussion by PJM’s membership, with a final plan expected to be submitted by this December to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for approval. PJM aims to have it in effect for the capacity auction to secure power supply for the mid-2028 to mid-2029.

“To PJM credit, they’re grappling with the problem,” Rutigliano said.

“PJM’s proposal is very much a work in progress, and is expected to change,” said PJM senior communications manager Jeffrey Shields. “PJM received significant feedback from stakeholders and is willing to evolve its proposal, drop elements altogether and incorporate entirely new frameworks into its proposal that are proposed by other stakeholders.”

“If we do nothing, there is definitely a higher risk of reliability issues including power outages,” Shields added.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/93/d0/18e2ac1f4238b96c16712d122af9/the-cloud-96920.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 12:05:13.581900

That power is then returned to the grid in the early evening when demand is still high and solar production is waning.
These records underscore solar, wind and batteries’ critical role in meeting ERCOT’s growing power demand, which has jumped 5.5% through August compared to the same period in 2024.
Through August, solar generation is up 13.8 million megawatt-hours (MWh) compared to 2024 and has supplied 13.8% of total demand year to date.
In a first, solar out-generated both coal and wind in August, making it the second-largest resource on the ERCOT grid, trailing only gas.","Solar set a new ERCOT record (last Tuesday) on Sept. 9, generating almost half of total demand in the fast-growing Texas electricity market while providing more than 40% of the state’s electricity for seven straight hours, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.

The latest record is the 17th of 2025, an astounding 7,785 megawatts (MW) higher than the first record of 22,092 MW set Jan. 24. New data from ERCOT—the Electric Reliability Council of Texas—also highlights solar’s reliability over the summer: For the period from June 1 through Aug. 31, solar met 15.2% of all demand in the ERCOT system, more than coal’s 12.5% market share.

It also covered 26.9% of peak-hour demand. The peak hour output, which averaged 20,817 MW over the course of the summer, was a 5,408MW increase from just one year ago.

The results clearly show that if you build it, solar will perform.

The same holds true for ERCOT’s dispatchable battery storage resources. There is now 15,008 MW of installed battery storage capacity across the system, which regularly charges off the grid during the early morning when solar output is high and demand low. That power is then returned to the grid in the early evening when demand is still high and solar production is waning.

Battery storage has already set four discharge records in September. The latest occurred last Thursday, Sept. 11, sending 7,741 MW, or 10.6% of total power demand back into the grid in the early evening—and preventing the need for a comparable amount of fossil fuel generation.

These records underscore solar, wind and batteries’ critical role in meeting ERCOT’s growing power demand, which has jumped 5.5% through August compared to the same period in 2024. The system’s just-released generation data through the end of August show that wind and solar supplied 90% of the increased demand, with nuclear power accounting for the remainder. In contrast, generation from the system’s coal and gas-fired resources has fallen so far this year.

Solar has been the driving force in renewables’ recent rise in ERCOT. Through August, solar generation is up 13.8 million megawatt-hours (MWh) compared to 2024 and has supplied 13.8% of total demand year to date. In a first, solar out-generated both coal and wind in August, making it the second-largest resource on the ERCOT grid, trailing only gas. Wind and nuclear generation are also up, although by smaller amounts. On the other hand, coal and gas-fired generation is down 556,838 MWh.

As a percentage of the market, wind and solar have generated 37.7% of ERCOT’s electricity needs through the first eight months of 2025, up almost 3 percentage points from a year ago. A decade ago, when solar first began growing, renewables’ market share was just 15%. Since 2016, demand in ERCOT has jumped 39.2%; renewables have provided the power for 95.7% of that growth.

The 2025 data shows that the transition away from fossil fuels in ERCOT is well under way.",https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2025-09/2025-09-15%20IEEFA%20ERCOT%20solar%20wind%20battery%20generation%20records%202023-2025%20v3%20452x236.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 11:00:32.196407

The Timbermill Wind project was a milestone in Norfolk Southern’s partnership with Vestas.","Transporting freight for the energy industry that weighs as much as a house and stretches longer than a city block leaves no room for error. Energy freight shipments, which are often referred to as specialized or dimensional freight, are usually oversized, overweight, and frequently irreplaceable loads that are essential to powering industries and communities.

For the energy sector, dimensional freight is one of the lifelines that moves critical components from factories to job sites. From massive transformers and hydroelectric gates to wind turbines and nuclear reactor parts, these shipments keep infrastructure projects on schedule and make renewable energy expansion possible. According to the Association of American Railroads, moving these critical pieces by rail is a smart choice for economical and sustainable reasons. That’s because moving freight by rail instead of truck reduces emissions by 75%, meaning the clean-energy benefits are multiplied.

Last year, Norfolk Southern partnered with global wind energy leader Vestas to deliver one of the most complex dimensional projects in its history: transporting 158 wind turbine components to the Timbermill Wind farm in Chowan County, North Carolina. This 1,933-acre clean energy site is now operational, featuring 45 turbines generating up to 189 MW.

The project created more than 200 construction jobs and relied heavily on local contractors, with more than $25 million spent with North Carolina businesses during construction. It is projected to generate up to $33 million in tax revenue over its lifetime and is expected to be the county’s largest taxpayer during its first year of operations.

While the shipment itself was a success story, key lessons lie in how the power industry can prepare for the future of complex freight logistics (Figure 1).

Collaboration Is Non-Negotiable

Dimensional freight success begins well before the first shipment moves. For the Timbermill Wind project, Norfolk Southern’s planning started with light detection and ranging (LIDAR) technology-based clearance scans across 10 states, identifying potential obstacles over the 2,000-mile route from Denver to the Port of Morehead City, North Carolina. This proactive engineering approach is essential for:

Avoiding costly last-minute re-routes.

Meeting strict construction schedules.

Maintaining safety compliance in multiple jurisdictions.

Energy developers can reduce risk significantly by bringing transportation providers into the conversation early—ideally during project design—rather than waiting until procurement. Early coordination means the transport plan is built into the project timeline, not added as an afterthought.

Infrastructure Matters—and Is Changing

In 2024, Norfolk Southern invested $1 billion in infrastructure upgrades, including bridge enhancements and terminal improvements, to strengthen its ability to move freight safely and efficiently. For Timbermill Wind, that investment paid off. It allowed Norfolk Southern to move freight loads as large as entire railcars across varied terrain—something that simply isn’t possible without a robust, well-maintained network. Key infrastructure enablers included:

Specialized railcars built to accommodate the dimensions and weight of wind turbine components.

A unique delivery route guided by a coordinated traffic and signage removal plan into the Port of Morehead City, where train cars carrying turbine components traveled directly down tracks that split a four-lane highway in two.

Partnerships across Norfolk Southern’s network and coordination with Carolina Coastal Railway for last-mile delivery.

Selecting a transportation partner with a strong capital investment strategy ensures that today’s infrastructure can support tomorrow’s freight demands—especially as components for renewable projects grow in size and complexity (Figure 2).

Cross-Functional Teams Ensure Precision

A project of this size calls on nearly every part of an organization. At Norfolk Southern, Timbermill Wind mobilized:

Clearance and Engineering for route design and hazard mitigation.

Commercial, Customer Service, Logistics, and Network Operations Center for real-time tracking and seamless coordination.

Short Line for collaboration with other railroads.

Every step was deliberate, from selecting train crews with high-wide, sensitive freight experience to timing train spacing so that these oversized shipments moved without interfering with other network operations. When timelines are tight and cargo is irreplaceable, a coordinated, cross-functional approach is essential.

Local Benefits for North Carolina Communities

Beyond its logistical complexity, the Timbermill Wind project represents a significant step forward for communities in northeastern North Carolina. The renewable energy site is expected to generate enough electricity to power tens of thousands of homes, providing cleaner, more reliable energy for residents and contribute to the state’s ambitious renewable energy goals.

The project also delivers immediate and long-term economic benefits. During construction, local contractors, trucking companies, and port operations all supported the movement and installation of turbine components, bringing jobs and new revenue to the region. Over the life of the wind farm, ongoing operations and maintenance will provide additional employment while generating tax revenue to support schools, infrastructure, and community services.

Environmental benefits are equally important. Timbermill Wind helps cut emissions, creating healthier communities. Rail played a key role in these outcomes: by moving the majority of components by train instead of trucks alone, the project reduced highway congestion and further lowered the carbon footprint of the supply chain.

A Blueprint for the Future

Moving wind turbines, transformers, and other oversized components isn’t just a logistical challenge—it’s a strategic enabler of the clean energy future. Rail’s ability to carry multiple large loads in one trip reduces highway congestion, lowers emissions, and provides a level of reliability that trucking alone cannot match. On average, rail is three to four times more fuel efficient than highway alternatives, making it both an operational and environmental advantage for clean energy developers.

The Timbermill Wind project was a milestone in Norfolk Southern’s partnership with Vestas. Timbermill Wind is expected to help meet North Carolina’s growing demand for renewable power, and demonstrate how Norfolk Southern’s experience and network strength makes it a trusted partner for future renewable energy projects. At Norfolk Southern, these moves are not seen as just freight shipments, but as milestones in powering America’s future.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fig1-vestas-locomotive-norfolk-southern-railroad.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 11:00:45.485169

And then-President Joe Biden's administration in November agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.","ATLANTA (AP) -- It seems like a terrible time to build an electric vehicle plant in the United States, but Rivian Automotive leaders say they're confident as the company starts long-delayed work on a $5-billion facility in Georgia.

The money-losing California-based company breaks ground Tuesday east of Atlanta despite President Donald Trump's successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits. Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.

Rivian Chief Policy Officer Alan Hoffman said the company believes it can sell electric vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because they're superior.

""We did not build this company based upon federal tax incentives,"" Hoffman said. ""And we're going to prove that we're going to be successful in the future.""

Georgia plant is key to a mass market and profitability

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian's key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S sport utility vehicle in Normal, Illinois, as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.

The Illinois plant will begin making smaller R2 SUVs next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly. But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity. The company has said the Georgia operation will be able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028. It plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles.

The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000-46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it's limiting production now in part to launch 2026 models.

""For Rivian, it's do-or-die time,"" said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. ""We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can't scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.""

Challenges in the electric vehicle market

Sales growth is slowing for electric vehicles in the United States, rising only 1.5 percent in 2025's first half, according to Cox Automotive.

Tesla accounted for almost 45 percent of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors' slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13 percent. By comparison, Rivian had a 3 percent share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.

But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful of the startup automakers.

The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But the competition now includes Ford's F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.

After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80 percent, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025's first half.

At the same time, some automakers' ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis last week canceled Ram's electric truck program. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles at a suburban Detroit plant.

""With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian's favor,"" said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. ""However, there still is an EV market out there.""

$1.5 billion in incentives for 7,500 jobs

Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can't benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.

Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who has said he wants to make Georgia ""the electric mobility capital of America,"" acknowledges Rivian faces bumps, but says he remains confident the company can fulfill its promises.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt. Georgia's Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.

Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre site near Social Circle, about 45 miles east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology. And then-President Joe Biden's administration in November agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.

Despite the Trump administration's hostility toward EVs, Hoffman said Rivian hopes the U.S. Department of Energy will distribute the loan money, arguing it will boost domestic manufacturing.

Some neighbors still oppose the plant

Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbor to farms and will pollute the groundwater.

""I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?"" asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away. He says his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.

There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Hoffman says Rivian is ""in this for the long haul.""

""We think that we can compete with anyone out there and that once given the opportunity, we're going to excel,"" he said.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2025/09/17/211069066_211069066-0203093a599d443784a6fa93268472aa_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-09-17 13:03:01.048361

Three years ago, gas cost more than $4 per gallon, and prices continued to rise. It felt like price gouging, and my family had no choice but to keep paying for more expensive gasoline. Could an EV (electric vehicle) provide a way out of the fossil fuel money pit?

Like most vehicle purchasers, my husband was hesitant about the cost of a new car and skeptical of EVs. We had never bought new before, and there weren’t really viable used options for EVs at the time. Three things changed his mind. First, we rented an EV on vacation and discovered that charging wasn’t difficult at all. With the car’s built-in trip planner, range anxiety disappeared. A test drive in Tucson sealed the deal — nothing matched the acceleration, quiet power, and thrilling driving experience of an EV.

Second, we realized the full potential of an EV when paired with solar panels. Even without solar, EVs cut transportation costs dramatically. With solar, much of our driving becomes free, and the savings extend to household electricity bills — especially in Arizona summers, when air-conditioning costs skyrocket. With the 30% federal tax credit — and the skyrocketing cost of electricity — the panels are paying paid for themselves quickly.

Third, my husband faced a cancer scare. Suddenly, the “someday” purchases on our bucket list felt urgent. Surviving cancer during middle age reminds you that life isn’t endless. That pushed us over the line to buy the EV.

Today, most of our driving is powered by sunshine. We still own a beater gas car for the teenagers and a minivan for family trips, but my long-term goal is to retire gas engines entirely. Solid-state batteries are on the horizon, promising faster charging and longer range.

Unfortunately, Congress just made purchasing an EV more difficult. As part of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” they repealed clean energy credits for EVs.They’ll disappear on Sept. 30. Credits for solar disappear in December. Each of our Republican representatives in Arizona voted for this: Andy Biggs, Eli Crane, David Schweikert, Juan Ciscomani, Abraham Hamadeh, and Paul Gosar.

This move not only harms the environment, but it also hurts working families. Wealthier households may still buy solar panels or EVs on their own, but lower- and middle-income families will be locked out. Without credits, many will remain stuck paying hundreds every month for gas or high electric bills instead of investing in cleaner, cheaper alternatives.

Even though renewable energy is less expensive in the long run than fossil fuels, solar and wind require upfront investment. But once installed, the energy is free and inexhaustible. Fossil fuels, on the other hand, demand constant spending on extraction, refining, and transportation. The solar and EV tax credits were designed to bridge that upfront gap, helping families save money and cut pollution. Eliminating the credits takes away opportunity and locks people into outdated, more expensive systems.

There’s still a narrow window. A new EV must be purchased or under binding contract by Sept. 30 to claim a $7,500 credit for a new EV or $4,000 for a used one. That makes a real difference.

My family’s EV purchase gave us a way out. Energy policy should help all families break free from these burdensome expenses, not trap them in. Unfortunately, Congress just pushed us in the wrong direction. The credits create a win-win for everyone — cheaper AND cleaner energy, less smog in our communities. My family and I are seriously considering replacing our minivan before the deadline, especially since I’ve seen three-year-old, seven-seat EVs priced lower than their hybrid competitors once the credit is applied. I want to crawl out of this fossil fuel money pit by acting before the door closes. Why don’t you join us?

And while you’re at it, would you drop a line to your members of Congress, mentioning how important these credits are to you?

“Opening this facility is a major step, not just for Nopetro’s growing natural gas production and distribution network, but for Indian River County,” said Jorge Herrera, chief executive of Nopetro Energy.

“We believe in building facilities that support and give back to the cities where they stand. This Vero Beach RNG facility is a catalyst for continued growth, resilience and energy independence, creating opportunities for families and businesses across the Treasure Coast.”

In its first weeks of operation, the site has purified biogas to more than 95 per cent methane – exceeding the 90 per cent standard for household, vehicle and commercial fuel use.

Construction and operations have also generated jobs and contracts for local firms, providing wider economic benefits.

Indian River County Commission chairman Joseph Flescher welcomed the scheme: “This partnership highlights the value of working with the private sector to bring innovation and investment to Indian River County. It’s a responsible use of resources that supports local families, strengthens our economy, and ensures access to dependable energy.”

The project was delivered in partnership with engineering, procurement and construction specialists Mead & Hunt, who have a proven track record in the sector.

Beyond its production arm, Nopetro runs 13 renewable gas fuelling facilities across Florida and is expanding nationally.

RNG produced is compressed into CNG and used in public transport and fleet operations – including fuelling the entire Central Florida Transit Authority bus network.

Utilities ​“were kicking and screaming on that,” Becker said.
​“SB 254 leaves open a range of possible outcomes on this front,” he added.
(Today, both gas utilities and electric utilities issue climate credits to their customers.)
That provision was strongly opposed by Sempra, the holding company of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co., the state’s biggest gas-only utility.","California’s Legislature has approved a slate of policies aimed at curbing high and rising electricity costs, involving everything from short-term relief for high summertime utility bills to public financing of transmission grids — a big accomplishment in the waning days of the session.

The affordability measures emerged as part of a sprawling energy and climate package negotiated by legislative leaders and Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office last week and passed by lawmakers Saturday. Newsom, a Democrat, now has until Oct. 12 to sign the bills into law.

“It’s just a massive end of session,” said state Sen. Josh Becker, a Democrat whose bill, SB 254, was included in the package. ​“We had all these planes in the air. Are they all going to crash, or are they going to land?”

Becker hopes the provisions in SB 254 will contain rapidly rising costs for the state’s three biggest utilities — Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric — which are in turn driving up rates for their customers. Those residents now pay roughly twice the U.S. average for their power, and nearly one in five are behind on paying their energy bills.

“Energy affordability was understood to be one of the top issues the Legislature needed to act on, due to massive rate increases and widespread customer outrage,” said Matthew Freedman, staff attorney at The Utility Reform Network, a consumer advocacy group that supported SB 254.

Among other things, that legislation aims to rein in how much utilities spend hardening their grids to reduce the risk of sparking wildfires, a major factor in cost increases. To that end, the bill would prohibit utilities from earning profits on some of the investments they make in wildfire-related upgrades.

It would also create a new ​“transmission accelerator” that enables utilities to use public financing to expand the state’s high-voltage grid rather than recoup those expenditures by charging customers. Those savings will take longer to kick in but could add up to billions of dollars a year, said Sam Uden, managing director of Net-Zero California, an advocacy group that cowrote a report last year examining how much utilities could save by relying on public financing.

“There’s a strategic role for public-sector investment to drive the clean energy transition,” he said. ​“We see this transmission financing as an embodiment of that viewpoint.”

Cutting the cost of California’s power grid

SB 254 ended up as a 136-page document with a multitude of energy and climate provisions, Becker told Canary Media last week. But he highlighted one set of key cost-containment measures that the utilities had particularly resisted.

Utilities typically earn a profit by receiving a return on the investments they make in grid upkeep. Now, though, California’s big three utilities will have to finance a portion of what they spend hardening their grids via bonds — a process known as securitization.

Utilities ​“were kicking and screaming on that,” Becker said.

The amount to be financed through bonds was initially set to be $15 billion for all three utilities. But Freedman suggested that the utilities might have used their political clout last week to negotiate the final securitization requirement down to $6 billion, which is ​“a pretty big reduction,” he said.

Regardless, securitizing a portion of the growing grid-hardening costs will reduce pressure on utilities to increase rates in the future, said Merrian Borgeson, California policy director for climate and energy for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which supported the legislation. ​“I don’t know what the rates are going to be next year, but they’ll be lower,” she said.

Enabling public financing of transmission projects could deliver even more savings over time, Borgeson said. The ​“transmission accelerator” created by SB 254 for that purpose would be based out of the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz). That entity would be authorized to pool state funds drawn from California’s cap-and-trade program and from a climate bond passed last year to lower the cost of capital for transmission projects.

The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state’s grid, estimates that California must invest between $46 billion and $63 billion into transmission over the next 20 years to meet its goal of achieving a carbon-free grid by 2045. Using public money to offset a portion of utilities’ capital spending on those projects could cut the costs of the currently planned long-range transmission buildout by more than half, saving customers as much as $3 billion a year, according to an October report from Net-Zero California and the Clean Air Task Force.

Just how much money could be saved will depend on how the accelerator structures its public-private financing, Freedman said. ​“SB 254 leaves open a range of possible outcomes on this front,” he added. ​“It depends on the ambitiousness of the implementation by this and future governors.”

Cap-and-trade climate credit offers fast bill relief

The final days of this year’s session also saw lawmakers reauthorize the state’s decade-old cap-and-trade program, an initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that was set to expire in 2030. AB 1207 and SB 840 would extend the program through 2045 and make a number of changes with significant implications for polluting industries, though regulators and lawmakers still need to work out the exact structures for executing the new rules, Borgeson said.

The bills also take an initial stab at reallocating funds raised by the cap-and-trade system to the myriad state programs and industry sectors jockeying for the money.

For example, one key affordability measure in AB 1207 institutes important changes to the ​“climate credit” now paid to utility customers out of funds collected from the cap-and-trade program.

Today, those credits are delivered to customers in twice-a-year lump-sum rebates. Under the new structure created by AB 1207, those rebates can be redirected to specifically help lower utility bills during summer months, when air conditioning drives up power consumption.

“Just think about the Central Valley,” Becker said during a virtual town-hall event in June, referring to a region of California that’s both hotter and poorer than the rest of the state. During summer heat waves, ​“it’s 100 degrees all day — and sometimes all night — in those areas. It’s literally a matter of life and death to keep the air conditioning on.”

AB 1207 will also redirect climate credits issued to gas utilities to support lowering summer electrical bills exclusively, through a process to be worked out by California utility regulators, Borgeson said. (Today, both gas utilities and electric utilities issue climate credits to their customers.)

That provision was strongly opposed by Sempra, the holding company of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co., the state’s biggest gas-only utility. In an opposition letter, Sempra said the shift would create a ​“statewide subsidy requiring gas customers to fund bill relief for electric customers, worsening the high cost of living in California for millions of families.”

But climate advocates say the legislation aligns with California’s goal of shifting customers from using gas to using electricity. ​“This is a good idea, because it doesn’t need any more money,” Juliet Christian-Smith, Western states program director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told Canary Media in July. Instead, ​“it’s redirecting money already in a pot to reduce electricity rates and enable the clean energy transition in a more affordable way.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2231044175.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=ae66f173fc0ca483ff5420a762d567ab,N,,2025-09-17 14:02:01.694363

EPA is currently reviewing the comments submitted on the “Set 2” proposed rule and working on a final regulation.","WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) that revises the proposed Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) “Set 2” renewable volume requirements (RVOs) for 2026 and 2027 to account for the small refinery exemption (SRE) decisions issued on August 22, 2025. This proposal is an important step in the EPA’s tireless work to repair the damage done after four years of the Biden-Harris Administration neglecting key components of the RFS program, including threats to transform the RFS program into a subsidy for electric vehicle charging stations as part of a larger strategy to electrify the transportation sector. The Trump Administration reaffirms its renewed commitment to honor the program’s purpose to support biofuels as an essential part of a thriving liquid fuels market.

The SNPRM seeks to balance the goals of the RFS program in supporting the production and use of renewable fuels while taking into account economic impacts, following the law, and ensuring opportunity for public comment. Under President Trump, EPA continues to restore the RFS program to align with Congressional directives and give American businesses and rural economies the certainty they need to thrive, all while using homegrown American biofuels.

Specifically, the SNPRM considers how SREs for compliance years 2023 – 2025 will be accounted for when establishing the RVOs in the “Set 2” final rule. EPA is co-proposing two approaches:

1. Additional volumes accounting for 100 percent of the 2023 – 2025 exempted RVOs.

2. Additional volumes accounting for 50 percent of the 2023 – 2025 exempted RVOs.

EPA is also taking comments on SRE reallocation volumes equal to other amounts.

The SRE decisions issued on August 22, 2025, exempted significant volumes of gasoline and diesel for the 2023 and 2024 compliance years, resulting in an increased number of RINs available for obligated parties to use for compliance. EPA also expects additional exemptions to be granted for the 2025 compliance year. The ability for obligated parties to use these RINs to comply with the 2026 and 2027 RVOs is expected to impact demand for renewable fuel if not carefully considered.

Upon publication in the Federal Register, EPA will hold a public hearing followed by a 30-day public comment period. More information about the comment period and public hearing can be found here: https://www.epa.gov/renewable-fuel-standard/proposed-renewable-fuel-standards-2026-and-2027-supplemental-notice. EPA recognizes the importance of issuing one final Set 2 rule that establishes the RVOs for 2026 and 2027 and addresses the reallocation of SREs from 2023 – 2025 in these years.

Background

In June, EPA announced a major step forward to strengthen American energy security and support American farmers by proposing RFS volume requirements for 2026 and 2027. The comment period for the proposed rule closed on August 8, 2025. EPA is currently reviewing the comments submitted on the “Set 2” proposed rule and working on a final regulation.

oneworld BEV Fund aims to identify, enable and scale lower carbon jet fuel of the future to support consumer demand, economic development, jobs and technology innovation

FORT WORTH, Texas — oneworld Alliance and member airlines, in partnership with Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV), today announced the launch of a new investment fund designed to address the limited availability and high cost of today’s Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF). The fund, led by cornerstone investors American Airlines and Alaska Airlines, seeks to accelerate the global development of long-term aviation fuel solutions that are cost effective, scalable and have lower emissions than conventional fuels.

The oneworld® BEV Fund will:

Invest in novel, next-generation Sustainable Aviation Fuel technologies.

Support the growth of alternative fuel markets to meet the long-term needs of the global aviation industry.

Create economic value for investors and regions around the world.

Drive technology innovation.

Develop a diverse and resilient SAF supply chain to meet future demand.

“By investing in the SAF technologies of the future, American and our oneworld partners are making a business decision to accelerate the development of novel technologies with the potential to reach larger scale at lower prices than current technologies can achieve,” said Robert Isom, American Airlines CEO and chairman of oneworld. “We believe reducing the emissions from our operation meets the demands of our customers, will make our business more competitive, and will enable us to continue to deliver the enormous economic benefits of commercial aviation for generations to come.”

“Alaska Airlines is excited to work alongside oneworld carriers to invest in innovative and cost-competitive SAF technology to drive the long-term energy transformation for our industry,” said Ben Minicucci, chief executive officer of Alaska Air Group. “In Breakthrough Energy Ventures, we have a partner with the scientific, technical and commercial expertise to make effective investment decisions that will create the market for next-generation fuels and power our industry in the years ahead.”

“Investing in SAF with Breakthrough Energy Ventures is part of oneworld’s strategy to create a future of aviation that solves problems at scale and serves the needs of the greater aviation community,” said Nat Pieper, chief executive officer of oneworld. ""At oneworld, our member airlines are united in their long-term mission to address carbon emissions and invest in technologies that can improve speed to market of innovative fuels across the globe. By working together, we’ll be better positioned to create long-term solutions for the energy transformation of an industry that is vital to global economic growth.”

BEV, Breakthrough Energy Venture’s capital fund founded by Bill Gates, will serve as the fund’s investment manager, bringing deep technical expertise, a rigorous diligence model, and extensive experience supporting the growth of early-stage climate technology companies. By leveraging its resources to support the energy transformation of one of the most challenging sectors for climate mitigation, BEV aims to advance fuel technologies that offer the greatest potential for tackling the sector’s emissions and securing long-term commercial success.

“Sustainable Aviation Fuel is essential to addressing the sector’s environmental impact and represents a major commercial opportunity,” said Eric Toone, chief technology officer at Breakthrough Energy and managing partner at Breakthrough Energy Ventures. “The oneworld BEV Fund is built to identify and scale breakthrough SAF technologies that can deliver real emissions reductions for jet fuel, compete with fossil-based fuels on cost, and integrate seamlessly with today’s aviation infrastructure. These are complex systems-level challenges that will take time to solve, and the fund is built with the long-term vision and staying power to help bring solutions to market.”

The fund is also supported by oneworld Alliance member airlines International Airlines Group (IAG), Cathay Pacific, and Japan Airlines. Recognizing the power of collective action, oneworld and Breakthrough Energy Ventures made an early decision to welcome non-alliance investors, including Singapore Airlines, which shares the alliance’s commitment to accelerating industry-wide progress in SAF.

“Sustainable Aviation Fuel is the most viable pathway for the aviation industry to progress to reach net zero. With our oneworld partners we have actively supported collective efforts on sustainability and today’s announcement further highlights the potential of collaboration, demonstrating how leading airlines can come together with the goal to accelerate action. To unlock SAF’s full potential, we are calling for supportive policy frameworks that help attract investment and enable the infrastructure needed to kickstart production.”

— Mr. Luis Gallego, chief executive officer, IAG

“As an airline with significant long-haul operations, scaling innovation to make SAF more accessible and cost-competitive is critical to Cathay Pacific’s future. This investment reflects our belief that only through collective action — across geographies and industries — can we build a resilient and scalable SAF ecosystem that delivers meaningful environmental progress and supports the future of our industry. And with Asia continuing to play a pivotal role in the global SAF ecosystem, we’re proud to help lead this momentum from the region.”

— Mr. Ronald Lam, chief executive officer, Cathay Group

“Relationships and connections with countries and regions around the world through air transportation are necessary for an island nation like Japan, thus we believe we have a mission to tackle the environmental impact of air transportation. Working toward this common mission for oneworld, we look forward to promoting technology and the use of SAF together with the member airlines, anticipating expansion into the Asian region in the future.”

— Ms. Tottori Mitsuko, president and representative director, Group CEO, Japan Airlines

“Our investment in this fund demonstrates Singapore Airlines' strong support for developing and commercialising next generation Sustainable Aviation Fuels. Reducing the carbon emissions of jet fuel demands collective action across the entire aviation ecosystem, and such initiatives will drive innovation towards meaningful progress in this crucial energy transformation.”

— Ms. Lee Wen Fen, chief sustainability officer, Singapore Airlines

The global aviation industry, which generates some $4.1 trillion in economic activity and supports 86.5 million jobs, currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global carbon dioxide emissions, in addition to other environmental impacts. Airlines and manufacturers continue to invest in modern aircraft, engines and operational efficiencies. Demand for air travel is expected to rise in the coming decades, and SAF, which today can reduce lifecycle emissions of jet fuel by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, is a crucial tool for mitigating the industry's environmental impact. While SAF can significantly decrease the carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft engines, the first-generation SAF in production today has come with challenges. The SAF industry has not yet attracted the investment required to scale production at competitive prices in line with market needs, and lifecycle environmental impact is a concern. oneworld and its partners are focused on supporting new technologies that can scale the availability of cost-competitive SAF, while minimizing other environmental impacts.

ENTEK is also a vertically integrated designer and manufacturer of extruders and material handling equipment for the production of battery separators and many other non-ENTEK applications.","MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--I Squared Capital (“I Squared”), a leading global infrastructure investment manager, today announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire a majority equity interest in ENTEK Technology Holdings LLC (“ENTEK”), a leading global manufacturer of battery separators.

I Squared’s $800 million investment complements a loan from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) program of up to $1.3 billion. With initial funding already provided, these combined investments underscore the importance of strong public-private collaboration in securing U.S. domestic manufacturing of strategic technologies.

The investment will fund construction of a gigafactory in Terre Haute, Indiana – the first and only facility of its kind in the U.S. producing wet-process lithium-ion battery separators, critical components for batteries powering electric vehicles, energy storage systems, defense equipment, and digital infrastructure. The facility is expected to create approximately 763 construction jobs and 635 operations jobs in Terre Haute once operational.

Larry Keith, Chief Executive Officer, ENTEK, said: “For more than 40 years, ENTEK has built a reputation for innovation, quality, and long-term partnerships with the world’s leading energy storage and technology companies. With I Squared’s capital, strategic expertise, and global network, we will expand the U.S.’s manufacturing footprint, create high-quality jobs, and meet surging demand for batteries across critical applications, from EVs and energy storage to military defense equipment and data centers.”

Commenting on the investment, Gautam Bhandari, Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer, I Squared Capital, said: “ENTEK exemplifies the type of critical, high-growth infrastructure platform that I Squared seeks to scale. ENTEK’s revenues are underpinned by long-term agreements with blue-chip clients, and its products are essential to U.S. re-industrialization and energy security. With DOE support and rising demand in EVs, energy storage, and defense, ENTEK is uniquely positioned to deliver sustainable growth for our investors and the U.S. economy.”

Over the last four decades, ENTEK has developed and built a resilient, vertically integrated business model based on core capabilities in energy storage, advanced materials, and equipment manufacturing. Supported by Endeavour Capital and Joshua Green Corporation’s investment in 2019, ENTEK has grown its operations across eight countries and is the only company to have expanded the application of advanced materials to include all battery separator types, including lead acid, lithium, and other emerging energy storage technologies.

The company’s patent-protected wet process method for lithium-ion battery separators is designed to protect workers, communities, and the environment, while providing strong regulatory and performance advantages. With a substantial majority of its revenue underpinned by long-term contracts, ENTEK is strategically positioned to scale and capture the significant market opportunity for batteries in the U.S., particularly against an uncertain global battery supply chain and a policy environment that prioritizes the onshoring of strategic manufacturing capabilities.

Mike Braun, 52nd Governor of Indiana, said: “This first-of-a-kind gigafactory, built right here in Indiana, will increase energy production and bring down prices, all while boosting our local economy and creating well-paying jobs for hard-working Hoosiers.”

U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) said: “ENTEK’s new facility highlights Indiana’s continued leadership in advancing U.S. manufacturing, strengthening America’s competitiveness, and creating quality Hoosier jobs.""

U.S. Senator Jim Banks (R-Ind.) said: “Indiana continues to be a highly attractive place for businesses to invest, and ENTEK’s new factory is a strong testament to the power of investing in America’s security and competitiveness right here at home.”

The Terre Haute, Indiana project, which will be executed in partnership with Clayco as the EPC contractor and Brueckner Group, the world leader in biaxial stretching equipment, will produce 1.4 billion square meters of wet-process lithium-ion battery separators annually in its first two phases and is designed to expand to 2.1 billion square meters. The investment will position ENTEK as the only scaled, U.S.-based supplier able to meet the sourcing requirements for battery manufacturers to receive 45X production tax credits and comply with the content requirements under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), as amended by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which reduce the allowance for Chinese materials – including separators. ENTEK’s product will provide a significant advantage to battery manufacturing customers seeking credits under the OBBBA.

In addition to the DOE’s up to $1.3 billion ATVM loan, the project has secured more than $200 million in 48C advanced manufacturing tax credits for Phase One of the project and will be eligible for ongoing 45X production tax credits in Phase Two.

The transaction is expected to close following regulatory approvals.

“It's not just that government legislated EV sales targets—by doing so, they effectively compelled both industry and government to take action to meet them.
“It would be one thing if, each time the Carney government jettisoned a key climate policy, they were replacing it with something else.
Kyriazis notes that the EV sales mandate “often gets debated as if it’s about the auto industry, but really, it’s consumer-focused.
In 2017, EV sales in Ontario surged to 7,477 units, a 120 percent increase from the previous year.","Toronto resident Rick Smith has been eyeing an electric vehicle for months, but “regulatory uncertainty at the federal level” has kept him and his family from making the switch. The hesitation only deepened after Prime Minister Mark Carney announced a pause on Canada’s EV mandate.

On September 5, Carney said the government would suspend the mandate for 2026, and initiated a 60-day review period to determine the future of the keystone climate policy.

First introduced in 2021 under former prime minister Justin Trudeau, the policy required automakers selling passenger cars, SUVs and pickup trucks in Canada to meet rising zero-emission vehicle sales targets: 20 percent by 2026 and 100 percent by 2035.

Once hailed as a cornerstone of Canada’s net-zero strategy, the EV mandate is now on shaky ground, alongside the unfunded federal rebate, rising tariffs on Chinese models and a growing patchwork of inconsistent provincial policies.

While Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Carney placate the auto industry and the oil giants that drive it, experts warn the real cost of delay may be borne by Canadian drivers left with fewer affordable options, and a country falling behind as the world goes electric.

The pause announced by Carney is part of a broader package of measures to support industries most affected by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, with the EV mandate also set to be waived for 2026 models.

“The direction the federal government takes on the EV availability standard is going to be a real litmus test of how committed the Carney government is to defending existing climate policies, let alone introducing new ones. With the removal of the consumer carbon price, which helped Canadians make cleaner choices, the EV standard now carries extra weight in reducing emissions from transportation,” Clean Energy Canada’s director of policy and strategy, Joanna Kyriazis, told The Pointer.

“If the government caves to opposition and abandons this policy entirely, unfortunately, it would open the floodgates and allow opposition parties, other premiers, industry to just start picking off all of the other climate policies on the books one by one, and use the same playbook of political polarization.”

In an email to Brampton North—Caledon Liberal MP Ruby Sahota, Brampton Environmental Alliance president David Laing expressed deep disappointment over Carney’s announcement.

Laing wrote that he voted for the Liberal Party this past spring because he believed Carney was the only leader who truly understood the science of climate change, the urgency of national action and the political skill needed to balance environmental sustainability with economic growth.

Instead, he said, the Prime Minister has capitulated—scrapping the consumer carbon tax, weakening environmental protections, greenlighting further oil and gas infrastructure, including pipelines through northern British Columbia and now walking back EV targets under pressure from the auto industry.

“Please help me understand why your leader has chosen to take this position, knowing that his actions will only contribute to greater global warming, leading to further environmental destruction, property loss and human suffering. Where is the other side of the equation? Why is he not demanding from industry and provincial leaders that he can help them grow their businesses and economies only if they take swift and aggressive action to reduce emissions? That’s the leader I thought I was voting for. So disappointed,” Laing wrote in the email, shared with The Pointer.

The EV sales mandate was the sole major policy from the 2022 climate plan that has moved forward. With its suspension, the Liberal government’s climate efforts in Canada now seem to have stagnated, as Carney has clearly pivoted more to the right of centre on issues that Conservatives have long championed.

Critics wonder if the new PM’s moves are more political calculation than sound economic policy, as the minority Liberals plot a path to govern while trying to make all sides happy. Some warn it could backfire, alienating the progressive Liberal base, while failing to woo right-of-centre voters, the vast majority of whom stuck with the Conservatives, despite the Trump bump Carney benefitted from. The Liberals won the election largely due to the slumping NDP, whose frustrated supporters might not give Carney a second chance if he continues to walk back past environmental commitments under Justin Trudeau, while contradicting much of his claimed advocacy before entering politics.

Climate Emergency Unit’s director of Strategy Seth Klein fears the pause on the 2026 ZEV sales mandate may just be the beginning of a wider rollback of key policies previous Liberal governments implemented strategically.

“It's not just that government legislated EV sales targets—by doing so, they effectively compelled both industry and government to take action to meet them. The mandates didn’t stand alone. They were supported by a carbon price that made gas-powered vehicles more expensive to operate, investments in charging infrastructure and consumer rebates to lower the upfront cost of EVs. Now, one by one, those supporting measures are being stripped away,” Klein said.

“I think they're [now] caving to industry, to the manufacturers who never wanted the mandates.”

In July, when Carney met with automotive sector leaders to discuss U.S. trade negotiations as concerns were mounting that tariffs and counter-tariffs could drive up the price of new cars, including EVs, one of the main demands from the industry was for him to scrap the ZEV sales mandate.

In May, an Electric Mobility Canada (EMC) study found that most EV models available in Canada are not subject to the country’s 21.25 percent automotive counter-tariffs, as the majority of EVs sold here are imported from outside the U.S. It urged the federal government to uphold the EV Availability Standard, arguing that it is essential to ensuring continued access to a growing variety of electric vehicles, including more affordable models for Canadian consumers.

A May 2025 study by Electric Mobility Canada found that out of 89 battery electric and plug-in hybrid models offered by 33 automakers in Canada, only six are impacted by the federal automotive counter-tariffs, representing less than seven percent of available models and under five percent of total EV sales in 2024.

Klein, too, wishes the government weren’t pausing the policy and finds its direction unclear, especially after its first act, scrapping the consumer carbon price in April, was not followed by an equivalent or stronger replacement.

“It would be one thing if, each time the Carney government jettisoned a key climate policy, they were replacing it with something else. But they aren't,” Klein told The Pointer.

Smith, who is president of the Canadian Climate Institute, echoed the concern, pointing to the broader uncertainty now facing the country. “Canadians and the market and investors are plunged into an open-ended two-month review. So it's a general lack of clarity on climate change policy that we think needs to end.”

A 2021 report by the Canadian Climate Institute, a policy think-tank partly funded by Environment and Climate Change Canada, modelled 60 different pathways to net-zero and found that the transition to zero-emission vehicles was a cornerstone of every scenario, and one of the safest bets for the country.

(Canadian Climate Institute)

The EV sales mandate was a key part of Canada’s strategy to decarbonize the transportation sector, one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2021, transportation was responsible for 187.7 megatonnes of GHGs, accounting for 28 percent of the national total. The vast majority of those emissions came from road vehicles.

That year, the country’s total GHG emissions stood at 670.4 megatonnes, a decline of 10.4 percent from the 2007 peak of 748.1 megatonnes.

A 2024 study by the University of Guelph found that the federal ZEV mandate would reduce Canada’s GHG emissions by roughly eight percent by 2050 compared to a scenario without the policy. Scrapping the mandate would mean losing that eight percent reduction.

It would also result in over $90 billion in health benefits for Canadians over the next 25 years, including up to 11,000 avoided premature deaths, according to a 2023 report from The Atmospheric Fund.

A 2025 Health Canada analysis shows that the air pollution from on-road vehicles nationally contributes to an estimated 1,200 premature deaths and millions of cases of non-fatal health outcomes annually, with a total estimated economic cost of $9.5 billion each year. The emissions from light-duty vehicles contribute a little over a third of those health impacts.

By 2050, the regulations are projected to reduce various air pollutant emissions from light-duty vehicles, including reducing fine particular matter (PM 2.5) by 36 percent, nitrogen oxide by 50 percent, volatile organic compounds by 61 percent, and carbon monoxide by 68 percent.

“The regulations will contribute to Canada’s climate change goals by preventing 362 megatonnes of cumulative greenhouse gas emissions. The monetized benefits of reducing these greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to be about $96 billion,” a government of Canada report noted.

“Even accounting for the higher purchase price of many ZEVs in 2023, these greenhouse gas benefits, together with the estimated $36.7 billion in reduced energy costs over the next 25 years, give these regulations an estimated total net benefit of $78.6 billion.”

In 2021, the Census of Population found that 83.9 percent of Canada’s 13.1 million commuters, about 11 million people, travelled by car, truck, or van, with nearly nine in ten driving alone, while 13.9 percent relied on sustainable transportation such as transit (7.7 percent) or walking and cycling (6.2 percent), and 2.2 percent used other methods. Commuting habits were still shaped by the pandemic, which saw 24.3 percent of workers at home, but patterns began shifting back by May 2022 as restrictions eased, with Labour Force Survey data showing 12.5 million Canadians commuting by car, surpassing pre-pandemic levels, and vehicle registration trends highlighting a broader transition as gasoline’s share of new registrations dropped from 88 percent in 2020 to 80.6 percent in late 2022 while hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric vehicles more than doubled to 14.7 percent of new registrations. The momentum is now at risk as Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s August 14, 2025 order requiring all provincial public servants to return to the office full-time by January 2026 could put more cars back on the road and drive emissions upward.

The federal government’s approach to emissions policy is also shifting. Carney has declined to endorse firm GHG targets, saying he's focused on ""results, not objectives"".

During a September 12 media briefing in Winnipeg, energy minister Tim Hodgson said Ottawa is in active discussions with Alberta and the oil industry about the future of the sector’s emissions cap, but did not confirm whether the cap would be scrapped.

Hodgson said all parties agree on the need for a ""fundamental change in the emissions intensity of the oilsands.""

Since the announcement, reaction to the EV mandate pause has been mixed. Some industry voices point to tariffs and slowing sales as reasons to hit pause. Many advocates argue demand has not dried up—rather, it has been hampered by the end of federal rebates and limited vehicle availability at dealerships.

In 2024, approximately one in seven new vehicles sold in Canada (13.8 percent) was a zero-emission vehicle (ZEV), according to Statistics Canada. More than 264,000 ZEVs were purchased that year, valued at $17.3 billion. Sales were noticeably stronger in the second half of the year, peaking in September with 30,318 cars sold as new models entered the market.

Monthly new motor vehicle sales in 2024, broken down by total and zero-emission vehicles, show that overall sales peaked in May at 185,178 units, and zero-emission vehicle sales reached a high of 30,318 units in September, reflecting growing consumer interest in cleaner transportation options.

(Statistics Canada)

Momentum faltered in early 2025 after the Incentives for Zero-Emission Vehicles (iZEV) Program, which offered rebates of up to $5,000, ran out of funds in January, two months ahead of schedule due to high demand. Industry experts say its end and the absence of funding for the program since, contributed to falling sales.

A recent S&P report highlighted EV sales in Canada reached 19 percent in Q4 2024, just shy of the 20 percent target set for 2026, before federal purchase incentives were abruptly cut. The final share for the year landed at 15 percent.

Smith says uncertainty is now the biggest barrier for buyers.

“Our next car is going to be an EV. But there's been regulatory uncertainty at the federal level as to whether this availability standard would continue, and the purchase incentives to buy electric vehicles ran out earlier in the year,” he added.

“This current federal government was elected on a platform of bringing those back, and so there's just a lot of uncertainty in the car market when it comes to electric vehicles, and that's translating to a lack of choice with dealerships.”

Smith has been searching for an EV in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) for months, but affordable models remain scarce.

“For a number of the most popular brands, there isn’t much stock. When you ask a dealer about a new model in a preferred colour, the answer is often, ‘maybe in a few months.’ That’s why we need the (EV) availability standard, because globally, EVs are taking over, and Canada risks falling behind,” he posited.

“I think in our country at the moment, because we live next to the United States, and Donald Trump has been so vitriolic in his opposition to our climate policy…there's a tendency in Canada to believe that the whole world has turned against electric vehicles. And in fact, the absolute opposite is the case.”

More than 17 million electric cars were sold worldwide in 2024, making up over 20 percent of all new vehicle sales, a sharp increase from the previous year, according to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Global EV Outlook 2025.

Sales are projected to exceed 20 million in 2025, with electric vehicles expected to account for one in every four new cars sold. China maintained its lead, with EV sales topping 11 million, with electric cars accounting for almost half of all car sales in 2024.

“The over 11 million electric cars sold in China last year were more than global sales just two years earlier,” the report noted.

“The rapid growth in electric car sales over the past five years has had a significant impact on the global car fleet: At the end of 2024, the electric car fleet had reached almost 58 million, about four percent of the total passenger car fleet and more than triple the total electric car fleet in 2021. Notably, the global stock of electric cars displaced over one million barrels per day of oil consumption in 2024. Of course, the stock of electric cars is not spread evenly across the world – in China, for example, around one in ten cars on the road is now electric, whereas in Europe the ratio is closer to one in twenty,” the IEA report noted.

(IEA)

Even in the U.S., the electric car market share continued to grow in 2024, with sales reaching 1.6 million. While the market share increased by ten percent, this is a decline from the significant jump of 40 percent recorded in 2023.

The launch of 24 new electric models expanded consumer choice and increased competition, contributing to a decline in Tesla’s market share from 60 percent in 2020 to 38 percent in 2024, as other automakers saw a 20 percent increase in sales.

Policy changes, including an update to the Clean Vehicle Tax Credit that allowed buyers to receive an instant rebate at the point of sale, likely encouraged adoption, especially with over half of EV sales qualifying for the incentive. Leasing also surged, driven by a 2023 provision reclassifying leased EVs as commercial vehicles, making them broadly eligible for tax credits. By 2024, nearly half of all EVs sold in the U.S. were leased, supported further by additional state-level incentives offered in 27 states.

In Europe, EV sales stagnated in 2024 as subsidies and other supportive policies began to fade. Still, electric vehicles maintained a 20 percent share of new car sales, with gains in 14 EU member states offsetting declines in others.

In larger markets like Germany and France, EV sales slowed as governments scaled back incentives. Germany ended subsidies at the end of 2023, and France has progressively reduced them, including capping environmental bonuses for higher-income buyers and limiting eligibility for support in 2024.

In the United Kingdom, Europe’s second-largest car market, electric vehicles made up nearly 30 percent of new car sales in 2024, up from 24 percent the previous year. This marked the first year of the Vehicle Emissions Trading Scheme, which required 22 percent of new vehicle registrations to be either battery electric (BEV) or fuel cell electric (FCEV).

In Denmark, the electric vehicle share rose by ten percentage points to reach 56 percent, with nearly 100,000 EVs sold in 2024.

Norway reached near-total electrification of sales, with 88 percent of car sales being battery electric and just under three percent plug-in hybrid. The growing share of electric cars led to a 12 percent drop in road-related oil consumption compared to 2021. A planned tax hike on internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and plug-in hybrids, which started in April, is expected to push the battery electric share even higher as the country aims for 100 percent zero-emission car sales by the end of 2025.

In Canada, mandates have been effective, and provincial programs have already shown the impact well-designed incentives can have.

Quebec led the country in 2024, accounting for more than half (53.9 percent) of all ZEV sales in Canada. Its Roulez vert program offered rebates of up to $7,000, and when combined with the federal rebate, Quebec buyers could save as much as $12,000. The looming reduction of the provincial rebate to $4,000 in January 2025 spurred a year-end sales rush. By year’s end, ZEVs made up 30.1 percent of new vehicle sales in the province, the highest proportion in Canada.

British Columbia and the territories ranked second, where ZEVs represented 20.7 percent of new purchases. B.C.’s rebate program offers residents up to $4,000, with additional amounts based on income and vehicle type.

Elsewhere, adoption was slower: Prince Edward Island (7.8 percent), Ontario (7.4 percent)—slowed by Premier Doug Ford’s cut to preexisting subsidies— Nova Scotia (6.5 percent), New Brunswick (5.7 percent), Manitoba (4.9 percent), Alberta (4.2 percent), Newfoundland and Labrador (2.6 percent) and Saskatchewan (2.5 percent).

Despite Ottawa’s orders, B.C. Minister of Energy and Climate Solutions Adrian Dix indicated the province is in talks with automakers and open to “moderating” its targets, but he emphasized that the mandate remains in place.

“We have to make changes in those targets…The question is: do we want to be with the direction of the whole world, or with Mr. Trump?"" Dix said.

Kyriazis notes that the EV sales mandate “often gets debated as if it’s about the auto industry, but really, it’s consumer-focused. Its goal is to make EVs more accessible, affordable, and available for Canadians.”

A recent Abacus Data survey conducted for Clean Energy Canada found that 45 percent of Canadians are certain, very likely, or inclined to choose an EV for their next vehicle. Support is especially strong in provinces like Quebec (55 percent) and B.C. (53 percent), as well as among younger Canadians aged 18 to 29 (57 percent) and 30 to 44 (52 percent).

Despite slower EV adoption in several provinces, a majority of Canadians, especially in major urban centres and younger age groups, remain interested in going electric, with surveys showing support increases further when people are given more information.

(Clean Energy Canada)

In major urban centres, the appetite for EVs is even stronger. A separate survey conducted in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) and Metro Vancouver found that 69 percent of Metro Vancouver respondents favoured EVs.

In the GTHA, where actual EV uptake has lagged, 55 percent still said they preferred an EV over a gas-powered car, and that figure jumped to 62 percent when respondents were given more information about EVs, pointing to significant potential for growth with better public education and policy support.

Ahead of last week’s announcement, Carney had the backing of Premier Ford, who repeatedly called for an end to the federal EV sales mandate in recent months, even as his government poured billions into Ontario’s growing EV and battery manufacturing sector.

“We have to get rid of these mandates so that companies won’t be able to meet their targets. The market will dictate, not governmental dictate,” Ford said during a press conference in July.

Those words were in stark contrast with what the premier had said in January, before the surprise federal election was called, when he pledged to continue supporting Ontario’s EV industry if re-elected.

“I want (to) make it clear that every partner we have in Ontario's electric vehicle and battery supply chain, a reelected PC government will honour our commitment,” Ford said.

When Doug Ford became premier in 2018, his government quickly rolled back several key policies that had been accelerating electric vehicle (EV) adoption in Ontario. Among the first cuts were provincial rebates for EV purchases, incentives for installing home and workplace chargers and EV-friendly provisions in the Ontario Building Code. Public charging stations including those at GO Transit locations were removed, and the cap-and-trade program that funded EV incentives was dismantled. Just eight years after Ontario launched its EV support programs, they were effectively shut down. Ford dismissed the initiatives, claiming they mostly benefited “millionaires who could afford Teslas,” but the numbers told a different story. In 2017, EV sales in Ontario surged to 7,477 units, a 120 percent increase from the previous year. But after the cuts, sales fell sharply: by mid-2019, EV sales were down more than 55 percent compared to the same period in 2018, with second-quarter sales dropping from 7,110 to just 2,933. The downward trend persisted. In 2022, the Ford government released a revised climate plan that made little mention of EVs, despite transportation remaining the largest source of emissions in the province. That same plan was described by the government’s own lawyers in court as little more than a “glossy brochure,” while Ontario’s emissions reached 157 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.

The Progressive Conservative government has also hinted at Ontario’s EV expansion as a key argument for pushing Bill 5, dubbed the Protect Ontario by Unleashing our Economy Act, and accelerating mining in the Ring of Fire, a region rich in minerals but also home to vast peatlands that act as one of the world’s largest carbon sinks.

“I think of some of our broader environmental goals, and one is sustainability. We’re developing, certainly in my community, the electric vehicle industry and, ultimately, for the success of that industry, mining of critical minerals is vital,” PC MPP for Windsor–Tecumseh Andrew Dowie said during the Standing Committee on the Interior meeting for Bill 5 on May 22.

“Also, I find, having now purchased an electric car—I bought it used—boy, I feel like I’m saving a lot of money by not having to fuel it up and use fossil fuels. I feel my environmental footprint is far better than it was before.”

“Canadians know EVs will save them money over time, because they are so much cheaper to fuel and maintain. But it is that upfront cost that continues to be a hurdle, and especially when geopolitics has led countries to box out China and Chinese technology, where so many investments have been made and so much of the cost reductions have been achieved,” Clean Energy Canada’s Joanna Kyriazis said.

“In China, EVs are already cheaper upfront than gas cars, but now we're putting tariffs on those vehicles and those batteries, and so we're kind of pushing out the timeline for when we get to see more affordable EVs upfront.”

Calling Chinese tariffs “the most challenging piece,” Klein says, when the government imposed the 100 percent tariff on Chinese EVs a year ago, he was of two minds.

“On one hand, I understood the need to give our industry time to ramp up without being undercut by lower-cost Chinese models. But now, instead of using that time to ramp up production, we’ve effectively given them permission not to,” he added.

“It’s the worst of both worlds. If we’re going to pause the ZEV mandate, then at least make those Chinese EVs more affordable and let them compete.”

Kyriazis argues that Canada should prioritize making electric vehicles more affordable. The EV availability standard is a key policy to do that—by increasing its stringency, it pressures automakers to shift their focus from luxury models to more accessible, mass-market options.

A 2022 study by Environmental Defence found that enforcing a Clean Car Standard could reduce the median EV price by over 20 percent or roughly $7,200, help Canada meet or exceed its ZEV sales targets, cut 135 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 and ensure the cost of the transition is carried by automakers rather than the public.

She suggests that to balance flexibility for automakers with affordability goals, the policy could offer extra credits for EVs priced under $40,000, the maximum most Canadians want to spend, and for incentives like zero-percent financing, helping lower costs and boost adoption without weakening the policy.

Given the tariff concerns, she notes that automakers operating in Canada also serve the much larger U.S. market, where the recent repeal of fuel efficiency standards by the Trump administration is expected to save them billions in compliance costs — a windfall she says ""should offset tariff impacts, making it easier for automakers to meet Canadian EV sales targets.""

She also urges Canada to revisit tariffs on Chinese-made EVs. “Unlike Canada and the U.S., the UK and EU applied little or no tariffs, encouraging competition and lower-priced models. Reducing tariffs here could help fill the gap for EVs under $40,000.”

A September 2025 report by TD economists supports this view, arguing that Canada should consider strategic partnerships with China to strengthen its EV ecosystem and achieve climate goals. The current blanket tariff approach has limited access to advanced battery technology and affordable EV options, both key to improving adoption.

Chinese firms are leading in low-cost manufacturing, battery innovation and fast-charging technology. Selective, well-managed partnerships such as licensing deals, joint research and development, or battery supply agreements could accelerate innovation, lower costs and expand consumer choice, which in turn would help reverse Canada’s declining EV sales and support domestic production.

Kyriazis emphasizes the need for a broader EV affordability package alongside policy improvements: “First, bring back the federal EV rebate, which has been paused since January. This pause has created pent-up demand and artificially lowered EV sales because buyers are waiting to see if the $5,000 incentive will return.”

Clean Energy Canada’s director of policy and strategy, Joanna Kyriazis, and 70 percent of Canadians support allowing the sale of EVs approved by the EU’s safety standards in Canada. “Currently, Canada aligns with U.S. standards and misses out on many affordable models available in the EU. Recognizing EU standards would open the market to these vehicles, making EVs more accessible,” she noted.

“We need to mainstream EVs by getting them into the hands of everyday Canadians, not just early adopters with higher incomes,” Kyriazis said.

“A retooled EV availability standard that balances flexibility with a strong long-term signal, combined with restoring rebates and easing trade barriers, is how Canada can truly advance the electric vehicle revolution.”

The Atmospheric Fund’s climate policy analyst Samia Anwer believes Canada is at a critical juncture where it has the opportunity to chart its own path instead of following in the footsteps of our neighbours.

“To ensure long-term environmental and economic resilience, Canada must decouple its regulatory direction from the United States. We can no longer afford to be reactive, especially with emissions targets, resident health and safety and local economic opportunities hanging in the balance,” Anwer explained in a statement.

“Key Canadian policies on energy efficiency and clean transportation emissions are at risk. Rather than watering down our standards in response to U.S. rollbacks, Canada should double down – defending, modernizing, and strengthening our own regulations to reflect Canadian priorities, economic conditions and climate commitments. Our environment, our economy and our future depend on it.”

(AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech’s data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”

In July 2023, the city of Moorpark adopted new zoning regulations that allowed the facilities with conditions.

Citing concerns about fire risks, the City Council has since voted to prohibit the sites completely.

Unless approved directly by the state, battery energy storage systems will no longer be allowed in Moorpark.

The City Council voted unanimously Sept. 3 to ban the facilities, which store excess electricity that can be released during peak demand times, from indoor use in industrial areas. Council members cited concerns about fire risks, which they said residents shared.

“I’m doing my job and listening to people in the city, and the people in the city are very concerned about this, so we’ve had a more stringent stance on battery storage,” Mayor Chris Enegren said. “This isn’t something that we wanted to lead the charge on.”

The city has rejected two proposals for battery storage projects, one outdoor and one indoor, since changing regulations to allow them in certain circumstances two years ago. City leaders cited similar safety concerns as the reason for their decision. A bill in the State Assembly, however, could allow companies to bypass local bans.

In July 2023 after Moorpark updated its general plan, the council adopted new zoning regulations that allowed battery energy storage systems with a conditional-use permit indoors within four zones: industrial park, limited industrial, institutional and industrial-flex zones.

Since then, several companies proposed battery energy storage systems to city officials over the years, but only two submitted applications.

Roughly a year later, Hecate Energy challenged the zoning code. The Chicago-based renewable power and storage company submitted an application to construct an outdoor battery energy storage system on a vacant property north of Southern California Edison's equipment staging yard that was zoned for limited industrial use. The company said outdoor facilities were safer in the event of a fire.

Hecate did not respond to an interview request.

The City Council voted unanimously Sept. 18, 2024, to reject a city staff recommendation that the company could apply to amend the zoning rules for the project. They cited safety concerns and an unwillingness to set a precedent for outdoor facilities.

That same month, Prologis, a San Francisco-based real estate company, applied to build an indoor battery energy storage system at 11289 W. Los Angeles Ave., also near the Southern California Edison facility on Gabbert Road. The application is still incomplete.

“For Moorpark, it would mean reliable power; hundreds of jobs tied to the construction of the battery project and logistics facility, along with permanent jobs with the logistics facility; millions in tax revenue for schools and city services; and infrastructure upgrades,” Jacob Morgan, Prologis vice president of development, wrote in an email interview.

The council expressed an interest in reassessing the zoning code in November 2024, determining that battery energy storage systems were not a desired use within city limits.

Though the council cited a desire to use its already limited industrial space for land uses that generate more jobs, the primary factor in the rejection was safety concerns.

Enegren said that if the council had known more about the technology at the time, they would not have allowed it anywhere in the city under the zoning code update.

All four city zones where the facilities were previously allowed are near residential neighborhoods and most were in what are considered very high fire hazard severity zones. Of the three State Fire Marshal designations, the zone carries the most risk for a wildfire.

Ventura County Fire Department officials warned city officials of the risks of the technology and the burden on first responders, especially after similar California facilities in Moss Landing, Escondido and Valley Center made headlines after fires erupted. The former incident burned for days, forcing 1,200 people to evacuate and emitting toxic chemicals.

The city’s concerns were echoed by many residents, Enegren said, leading him to believe that the safety risks outweighed any potential benefits.

“I’m not sure if this is going to help or hurt, but I do know that facilities burning down and residents being concerned is a big deal,” he said.

Of the three public speakers during the July 16 hearing, all were Prologis employees seeking to stop the decision.

“Safety is the No. 1 concern for Prologis,” Morgan told the Star. “Battery technology has advanced significantly. The high-profile battery fires people remember used older, more volatile systems that are no longer standard.”

The proposed project would have used lithium iron phosphate batteries that are designed to self extinguish if a fire were to occur and would have also incorporated cooling and ventilation systems and early warning sensors.

All Prologis projects, Morgan said, meet strict national safety codes and none of the company’s facilities have ever had a fire.

Still, council members were not convinced.

“I’m sure there are a lot of advancements in battery safety,” Enegren said. “But a salesman always tells you that their deal is the best.”

“Prologis is disappointed by that decision,” Morgan wrote. “It is a missed opportunity.”

Sean Anderson, professor of environmental science and resource management, at CSU Channel Islands, said that although there are legitimate safety risks with the new, startup technology, the regulations have become more strict in response to the relatively rare fires.

“We need to validate people's fears and worries about that, but my fear is there are lot of problems we deal with all the time,” he said, referencing the local impacts of worsening climate change such as wildfires and poor air quality. “Staying on fossil fuels is actually way more dangerous. We need to be looking at the entirety of the risk profile, not just what this one dramatic visceral event looks like.”

Anderson cited the California Energy Commission, which declared that roughly 50 gigawatts of energy storage capacity is needed in the next two decades to meet clean energy goals. The current capacity is about 5 gigawatts.

He said that decisions like the one the city of Moorpark made hinders longer-term advancements in safety.

“The outright bans are concerning because they will lead to slower rollouts,” Anderson said. “It makes better sense to have more guardrails. There's a lot of quality we could bring to the systems.”

Prologis' project, however, has not completely been ruled out.

Assembly Bill 205, which Gov. Gavin Newsom signs into law in 2022, would allow Prologis to supersede local regulations by submitting its application to the California Energy Commission. The legislation would apply to large battery energy storage systems, which are an important aspect of the state’s push for renewable energy infrastructure,provided they meet the specific conditions.

“I don’t think it's right that one Assembly bill overrides the will of all the people,” Enegren said. “We can't do much about it. We have to work with it. It's an unfortunate thing to have happened.”

LG Energy Solution is now the third biggest EV supplier in the world

Just five years after its inception, LG Energy Solution has become the third largest EV supplier in the world behind global leader CATL and BYD, both from China.

LGES has signed billion-dollar deals with everyone from General Motors to Rivian.

LG Energy Solution partners:

General Motors: GM has a joint venture with LGES called Ultium Cells, which manufactures battery cells for GM's EVs.

Rivian: The U.S. EV maker signed a deal with LGES to be its battery supplier in 2024. LGES agreed to supply Rivian with 67 GWh of its new 4695-type cylindrical battery cells for five years.

Tesla: Tesla signed a $4.3 billion supply deal with LGES in July 2025. LGES will supply Tesla with lithium iron phosphate batteries sourced from its factory in Michigan, according to reports.

Mercedes-Benz AG: In September, LGES signed a $10.7 billion deal with Mercedes-Benz AG to build EV batteries for the company's vehicles in Europe and the U.S.

LG Energy Solution has numerous other partnerships to supply EV batteries in the U.S., and last week's Department of Homeland Security immigration raid could have put its plans to enter the country on hold.

Tuesday, the company assured the world that it would not abandon the U.S.

LG Energy Solution said Tuesday that it hasn't stopped construction of its plants in the U.S. despite the immigration raid on September 4 that rounded up 475 workers at its Ellabell plant.

More than 300 workers were Korean nationals who were reportedly ""all skilled workers,"" according to The Korea Times, and Hyundai CEO Jose Muñoz said that this could hurt the company's future plans in the country.

""For the construction phase of the plants, you need to get specialized people. There are a lot of skills and equipment that you cannot find in the United States,"" Muñoz said from the sidelines during an automotive conference in Detroit, according to Reuters.

But on Tuesday, LGES confirmed that it is not slowing down its U.S. ambitions.

“All of the locations are working very hard right now to assess and to make sure that we don’t have an impact on our customers,” Bob Lee, LGES' top executive in North America, said at an auto conference in Detroit Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported.

“We have to try to find a plan that works regardless of various, different scenarios, so that’s what we’re doing,” Lee said.

Lee hopes that LGES' misfortune will result in a positive development, allowing other Korean workers with technical skills to obtain visas more easily.

“That was something many people understood, but now, after this crisis, the fact that we’re placing attention on it will be a very good thing,” Lee said.

U.S. asked if detained Korean Hyundai workers could remain in the States

The DHS insisted that the immigration operation was ""about safeguarding the integrity of the economy and preventing the exploitation of workers.""

Great British Energy is already delivering savings to the British public at a local level, following its investment of around £200 million in solar and renewable energy projects on schools, hospitals and public buildings across the country, with solar panels already starting to cut bills for vital public services.

Under its objectives, the company will drive clean energy deployment across the whole of the UK, as a developer, investor, and owner of clean energy projects – working in tandem with the private sector, devolved governments, local authorities and community energy groups.

Throughout this, the company will be required to put working people and communities at the heart of the clean energy transition – by increasing public ownership and community involvement in the development of clean energy projects, and supporting jobs and economic growth across the UK.

The government has also now set a target for Great British Energy to start making returns on its commercial activities as a whole by 2030. This includes a requirement for the company to have a plan for becoming self-financing in place by 2030, with profits reinvested into clean energy projects that will help protect billpayers permanently.

The strategic priorities – agreed by all devolved governments – set a clear vision for how Great British Energy will provide a catalyst for the expansion of the UK’s homegrown, clean energy supply. It follows the passing of the Great British Energy Act in May.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “It is time to make things and own things in Britain again. That’s why we have set up Great British Energy to be a new national champion and allow us to reap the benefits of Britain’s abundant natural resources.

“Great British Energy will place working people, communities and British industries at its core, turbocharging clean energy across the country as part of our clean power mission.”

The government has today confirmed the three key areas that the company should focus on to meet these objectives, including:

Investment in and development of nascent and more established technologies and assets required for Clean Power 2030 and beyond;

Activity in domestic supply chains to build long-term domestic resilience and economic growth;

Supporting the growth of local and community energy, working alongside government to deliver a Local Power Plan that will help to ensure local people and communities benefit from the clean energy transition.

Great British Energy will produce a strategic plan within six months, setting out how it will meet the Energy Secretary’s expectations to support the clean power mission and deliver for the British public.

Great British Energy’s CEO, Dan McGrail said: “Work is already underway at Great British Energy to deliver our Strategic Plan, and we welcome the Secretary of State’s recommendations.

“Most of the clean energy projects in the Government’s’ Industrial Strategy will flow through Great British Energy, enabling us to be the green growth engine for the UK.

“We are going to invest £1 billion in domestic supply chains, which I expect will unlock billions more in investment and create thousands of jobs.

“Along with our partners like The National Wealth Fund, The Crown Estate, Great British Energy-Nuclear and many more, we are primed to develop innovative ways to grow new renewable technologies, ensuring our energy is engineered in the UK.”",https://herald.wales/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stock-picture-solar-panels-Credit-Mark-Stebnicki-via-Pexels-e1738662768156.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 08:59:19.677780

The Treasury recently announced plans to offer the tax credit to companies that operate in the hydrogen production sector. That tax credit aims to build on the existing stance of the federal government and continues the work done by the previous administration. The Biden administration started the United States on a path to transitioning away from fossil fuels towards the more carbon-neutral forms of energy production that hydrogen offers.

The Treasury has finalized the requirements for the 45V program, as part of the Inflation Reduction Act

The Inflation Reduction Act was drafted and implemented in 2022, and it aims to offer a tax credit for hydrogen if the total greenhouse gas (GHG) generated in its production is less than or equal to 4 kg of carbon dioxide per 1 kg of hydrogen. That tax credit builds upon the federal government’s new approach to the energy sector, which has shifted between two administrations.

The final rules include a few significant changes to the existing rule structure, allowing for more flexibility and addressing several key factors that will allow the hydrogen sector in the United States to grow. In a rare state of partisan tranquility, the new rules have been embraced by both the federal government and environmental groups alike.

“These rules incorporate helpful feedback from companies planning investments which will drive significant deployment of clean hydrogen to power heavy industry and help create good-paying jobs. The Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law represent the world’s most ambitious policy support of the clean hydrogen industry. Scaling the production of low-carbon fuels like hydrogen will be a big boost to difficult-to-transition sectors of our economy like heavy industry.” – U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo

“Clean hydrogen can play a critical role decarbonizing multiple sectors across our economy, from industry to transportation, from energy storage to much more. The final rules announced today set us on a path to accelerate deployment of clean hydrogen, including at the Department of Energy’s clean Hydrogen Hubs, leading to new economic opportunities all across the country.” – U.S. Deputy Energy Secretary David M. Turk

Environmental groups have praised the new rule set as well

For hydrogen production using electricity (e.g., “green” hydrogen using renewables and “pink” hydrogen using nuclear), the new rules include building upon safeguards that were suggested in December 2023. For methane-based hydrogen, the rules propose enhancements in the accuracy of upstream methane leakage rates.

The new rules have been embraced by the industry as a whole as well as several environmental groups. The tax credit can be worth up to $3 per kilogram of hydrogen.

“We appreciate Treasury moving toward better hydrogen policy in its final rule for clean hydrogen production,” Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force (CATF), an environmental group, says in a statement. “Hydrogen production must be decarbonized across the supply chain, 99% of which currently uses highly polluting fossil-fuel-based production.”

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered.","SOCIAL CIRCLE, Ga. (AP) — It seems like a terrible time to build an electric vehicle plant in the United States, but Rivian Automotive leaders say they’re confident as the company starts long-delayed work on a $5 billion facility in Georgia.

The money-losing California-based company broke ground Tuesday east of Atlanta despite President Donald Trump’s successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits. Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.

CEO RJ Scaringe said Tuesday that Rivian will sell its R2 sport utility vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because it’s a superior vehicle.

“The description I’ll say for R2 is it isn’t an electric vehicle,” he said. “I describe R2 as an incredible five-passenger offroad machine. And it happens to be electric.”

Georgia plant is key to a mass market and profitability

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian’s key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV in Normal, Illinois, as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.

The Illinois plant will begin making the smaller R2 next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly. But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity. Scaringe said the Georgia operation, able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028, is the “foundation for our growth.” Rivian plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles.

The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it’s limiting production in part to launch 2026 models.

“For Rivian, it’s do-or-die time,” said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. “We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can’t scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.”

Challenges in the electric vehicle market

Sales growth is slowing for electric vehicles in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025’s first half, according to Cox Automotive.

Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors’ slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%. By comparison, Rivian had a 3% share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.

But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful startup automaker.

The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But competition now includes Ford’s F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.

After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025’s first half.

At the same time, some automakers’ ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis last week canceled Ram’s electric truck program. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles in suburban Detroit.

“With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian’s favor,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “However, there still is an EV market out there.”

$1.5 billion in incentives for 7,500 jobs

Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can’t benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.

Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, says he wants to make Georgia “the electric mobility capital of America,” but acknowledged Tuesday that “the road to get here has not been smooth.” He voiced confidence that Rivian can deliver “an innovation revolution” benefitting Georgians.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt. Georgia’s Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.

Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre (800-hectare) site near Social Circle, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology. And then-President Joe Biden’s administration agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.

Despite the Trump administration’s hostility toward EVs, Scaringe said Tuesday that Rivian has built “a very close relationship” with the U.S. Department of Energy and that the company’s goals align with some of Trump’s big ones, including “U.S. manufacturing, U.S. technology, U.S. technology that supports global business, and leading in all those areas.”

Kemp said he has urged Energy Secretary Chris Wright to back Rivian.

Some neighbors still oppose the plant

Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbor to farms and will pollute the groundwater.

“I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?” asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away. He says his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.

There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Scaringe said the start of construction shows Rivian is working through its challenges.

“These are not the kinds of things you start without having clear sight to be able to fully finish and launch,” he said.

The Guardian has long been at the forefront of agenda-setting climate journalism, and in a news cycle dominated by autocrats and war, we refuse to let the health of the planet slip out of sight.

We stand out as a media organisation by examining why the climate emergency is creating a new era of demagogues and how powerful governments, financial institutions and big oil companies are turning their back on climate promises.

The Guardian has tracked how the Trump administration is defunding world-leading climate research agencies, firing droves of scientists and blocking access to cutting-edge information about climate trends. We published the US National Climate Report in full to ensure it can be found, for free, in the public domain.

Guardian reporters are investigating how money from climate deniers and fossil fuel interests is funding thinktanks linked to far-right groups in Britain and Europe. This is a clear attempt to break down the longstanding consensus over climate science and net zero campaigns.

Our reporters hold the corporate enablers of fossil fuel interests to account: from the public affairs firms lobbying on their behalf to water down climate policy to the banks financing “carbon bomb” projects that will blow through the dwindling carbon budget.

In these bleak times, it is also crucial to report on the strength of the resistance and the possibility for positive change: the leaders still seeking global solutions, the youth activists who have launched a new campaign to “villainise big oil”, the taskforce dreaming up radical climate solutions and the campaigns that remind us that the overwhelming majority of people in the world want more ambitious climate action.

2. We will report on how climate breakdown is already affecting people, the natural world and other species, as well as what to do about it

Over the past year, alongside our daily reporting on climate impacts and extreme weather events, several new series shone a light on the people whose lives are being directly altered by the climate crisis, and the solutions people are creating in their own homes and communities.

For This is climate breakdown our reporters worked alongside researchers and humanitarian workers at the Climate Disaster Project in Canada and the International Red Cross to compile a series of testimonies from survivors of recent extreme weather events.

My DIY climate hack shared inspiring examples from readers who are creating their own solutions to the environmental challenges they face – inspiring individuals who have turned their gardens into micro-farms, started free clothing swaps, organised low-waste weddings, invented energy-saving gadgets and more.

Our ongoing Alternatives series highlighted the local communities and political parties coming up with low-carbon ways of living that might actually scale.

And our one-of-a-kind survey highlighted the fears and concerns of hundreds of the world’s leading scientists, and their views on the most powerful climate actions you can take.

As climate records continue to be broken, we reported on new data that illustrates how planetary conditions are changing rapidly:

2024 was the hottest year on record, driving the annual global temperature above the internationally agreed 1.5C target for the first time

Winter temperatures at the north pole reached more than 20C above the 1991-2020 average in early 2025, crossing the threshold for ice to melt

The planet’s remaining carbon budget to meet the international target of 1.5C has just two years left at the current rate of emissions

Humans are driving biodiversity loss among all species across the planet, according to the largest syntheses of the human impacts on biodiversity ever conducted worldwide

Tipping points – in the Amazon, Antarctic, coral reefs and more – could cause fundamental parts of the Earth’s system to change dramatically, irreversibly and with devastating effects. We asked the experts about the latest science – and how it makes them feel

4. The Guardian will eliminate two-thirds of its emissions by 2030 and reduce our impact on nature

Since 2020, our company greenhouse gas emissions have reduced by 48%, putting us well on track to achieve our target of a 67% reduction by 2030. In the last reporting year, emissions fell by 9%.

The biggest reductions so far in our plan have come from our print business, which now accounts for 64% of our total footprint, compared with 73% in 2020. As our business becomes more digital and more global, emissions from our digital products, IT operations and business travel will account for a larger proportion of emissions.

We are committed to reducing all areas of our footprint, which is why we have developed a bespoke climate literacy course for our staff to empower all colleagues to take action in their area of the business.

5. We will seek to decouple our business and finances from fossil-fuel extractive companies

The Guardian has refused advertising from all fossil-fuel extractive companies since January 2020.

The Guardian is supported by the Scott Trust and the returns from its endowment fund. The fund’s environmental strategy is focused on contributing to a reduction of emissions in the real world and to protecting nature and biodiversity. The fund has made significant investments in environmental solutions, with more than £100m now invested in areas ranging from cutting emissions in manufacturing processes to increasing the resilience of food systems in a warming world. Additionally, the fund has made a commitment to invest at least 3% of its value in natural capital and biodiversity solutions.

The endowment’s environmental focus builds on work started in 2015 to divest from fossil fuels.

6. We will be transparent with our progress

We believe transparency is the key to tackling the climate crisis. By sharing our data, our successes and our challenges, we can be part of the global movement to make businesses accountable for their climate and nature impacts.

In the past year we have:

Published our annual company emissions data, explaining what drives our emissions and where they have risen and fallen

Created a digital course, as part of an initiative by the Sustainable Journalism Partnership, sharing examples from experts across the Guardian of how to embed sustainability into journalism and media commercial operations

The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it’s limiting production in part to launch 2026 models.

“For Rivian, it’s do-or-die time,” said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. “We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can’t scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.”

Challenges in the electric vehicle market

Sales growth is slowing for electric vehicles in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025’s first half, according to Cox Automotive.

Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors’ slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%. By comparison, Rivian had a 3% share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.

But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful startup automaker.

The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But competition now includes Ford’s F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.

After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025’s first half.

At the same time, some automakers’ ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis last week canceled Ram’s electric truck program. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles in suburban Detroit.

“With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian’s favor,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “However, there still is an EV market out there.”

$1.5 billion in incentives for 7,500 jobs

Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can’t benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.

Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, says he wants to make Georgia “the electric mobility capital of America,” but acknowledged Tuesday that “the road to get here has not been smooth.” He voiced confidence that Rivian can deliver “an innovation revolution” benefitting Georgians.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt. Georgia’s Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.

Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre (800-hectare) site near Social Circle, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology. And then-President Joe Biden’s administration agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.

Despite the Trump administration’s hostility toward EVs, Scaringe said Tuesday that Rivian has built “a very close relationship” with the U.S. Department of Energy and that the company’s goals align with some of Trump’s big ones, including “U.S. manufacturing, U.S. technology, U.S. technology that supports global business, and leading in all those areas.”

Kemp said he has urged Energy Secretary Chris Wright to back Rivian.

Some neighbors still oppose the plant

Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbor to farms and will pollute the groundwater.

“I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?” asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away. He says his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.

There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Scaringe said the start of construction shows Rivian is working through its challenges.

“These are not the kinds of things you start without having clear sight to be able to fully finish and launch,” he said.

Additionally, Google announced in May that it was investing in three advanced nuclear energy projects with Elementl Power.
Last year, 25 states passed legislation to support advanced nuclear energy, and lawmakers this year have introduced over 200 bills supportive of nuclear energy, according to the trade association Nuclear Energy Institute.","The investment with Meta will also expand the output of a Constellation Energy Illinois nuclear plant.

The agreement announced in June is just the latest in a string of tech-nuclear partnerships as the use of AI expands. Financial details of the agreement were not disclosed.

Constellation’s Clinton Clean Energy Center was actually slated to close in 2017 after years of financial losses, but was saved by legislation in Illinois establishing a zero-emission credit program to support the plant into 2027. The agreement deal takes effect in June of 2027, when the state’s taxpayer-funded zero-emission credit program expires.

With the arrival of Meta, Clinton’s clean energy output will expand by 30 megawatts, preserve 1,100 local jobs, and bring in $13.5 million in annual tax revenue, according to the companies. The plant currently powers the equivalent of about 800,000 U.S. homes. George Gross, professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Illinois, estimates that 30 additional megawatts would be enough to power a city with about 30,00 residents for one year.

“Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,” said Urvi Parekh, Meta’s head of global energy.

Surging investments in small nuclear reactors comes at a time when large tech companies are facing two major demands: a need to increase their energy supply for AI and data centers, among other needs, while also trying to meet their long-term goals to significantly cut greenhouse gas emissions.

Constellation, the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, said in September that it planned to restart the reactor so tech giant Microsoft could secure power to supply its data centers. Three Mile Island, located on the Susquehanna River just outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was the site of the nation’s worst commercial nuclear power accident in 1979.

Also last fall, Amazon said it was investing in small nuclear reactors, two days after a similar announcement by Google. Additionally, Google announced in May that it was investing in three advanced nuclear energy projects with Elementl Power.

U.S. states have been positioning themselves to meet the tech industry’s power needs as policymakers consider expanding subsidies and gutting regulatory obstacles.

Last year, 25 states passed legislation to support advanced nuclear energy, and lawmakers this year have introduced over 200 bills supportive of nuclear energy, according to the trade association Nuclear Energy Institute.

Advanced reactor designs from competing firms are filling up the federal government’s regulatory pipeline as the industry touts them as a reliable, climate-friendly way to meet electricity demands from tech giants desperate to power their fast-growing artificial intelligence platforms.

Still, it is unlikely the U.S. could quadruple its nuclear production within the next 25 years, like the White House wants. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two reactors, at a nuclear plant in Georgia, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.

Additionally, Gross recommends that the U.S. invest more in the transmission grid that moves that power around.

“That’s my biggest concern,” Gross said, adding that spending on the grid has actually fallen off in recent years, despite the voracious demand for energy.

Amazon, Google, and Microsoft also have been investing in solar and wind technologies, which make electricity without producing greenhouse gas emissions.",http://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060425_MetaAINukePower_01_JohnDixon.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 08:59:27.579845

One of the most consequential legislative acts of President Donald Trump’s second administration thus far has been his July 4 signing of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act (OBBBA) into law. The OBBBA will set the spending policies and tax agenda for the remainder of Trump’s second term, permanently extending many of the tax rates of Trump’s 2017 tax bill, as well as making numerous cuts to spending elsewhere.

Perhaps the most controversial spending cut in the OBBBA is the 12% decrease in Medicaid spending; however, overshadowed by that contentious elimination is the fact that the OBBBA will eliminate the electric vehicle (EV) tax credit by the end of September 2025.

What Is the EV Tax Credit?

The EV tax credit was part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. The IRA was meant to incentivize buyers to purchase environmentally-friendly EVs by providing them with a $7,500 tax credit when purchasing a qualifying new EV. The OBBBA will bring an end to that credit.

It now appears, though, that the OBBBA contains a loophole that allows EV buyers to claim an EV tax credit beyond the September 30 deadline set by the bill.

How To Keep the EV Tax Credit Beyond September

As reported by Yahoo Finance, auto manufacturers interpreted the wording of the OBBBA was such that the contract to purchase of an EV must be signed — and the EV must be delivered — all by September 30 in order for the tax credit to be claimed buy the purchaser. However, the IRS (and its interpretation of the new law) has created something of a loophole within the OBBBA’s wording to extend that deadline for EV buyers.

The IRS has specified that “if a taxpayer acquires a vehicle by having a written binding contract in place and a payment made on or before September 30, 2025, then the taxpayer will be entitled to claim the credit when they place the vehicle in service (namely, when they take possession of the vehicle), even if the vehicle is placed in service after September 30, 2025.”

What’s that mean without the legalese? Essentially, as long as an EV buyer has signed a purchase contract and either paid a deposit or the full purchase amount by or before September 30, that buyer is entitled to the EV tax credit, even if the vehicle isn’t in their possession by that date.

While the deadline still remains, this loophole does allow purchasers a slight amount of wiggle room.

Energy Development Corp. (EDC) is planning major upgrades to its geothermal power facilities in Leyte, Philippines, inspired by the technology used in The Geysers geothermal plants in California.

The initiative aims to improve efficiency, extend plant life, and ensure sustainable operations. The upgrades will be based on benchmarking initiatives with American energy company Calpine Corp.

“We will install a wellhead washing system, rock catcher, steam washing, and an additional demister,” Teodulfo Troyo, head of EDC’s Leyte site, told Asian Power. Combined, these deliver purified, high-quality steam that removes impurities and helps ensure efficient and reliable operation of the steam turbines.

A subsidiary of First Gen Corporation, EDC operates three geothermal plants in the Tongonan Geothermal field--the Tongonan, Malitbog and Upper Mahiao facilities. The upgrades will focus on the steamfield facilities that supply energy to all three plants.

Straddling Kananga and Ormoc in Leyte, the Tongonan geothermal field comprises 31 production wells and nine reinjection wells and spans more than 107,000 hectares of protected forest land.

International geothermal consulting firm Veizades & Associates, Inc. will plan the upgrades. This is the same professional geothermal engineering firm that developed The Geysers, the largest complex of geothermal energy facilities in the world.

Troyo said the firm has started collecting data, with final designs and cost estimates to follow. He added the design phase would take at least six months, followed by construction or equipment replacement over two to three years.

EDC is also exploring new technologies such as electrical submersible pumps to revitalise older wells and modular binary plants that don’t require extensive steam piping.

“These are still in the planning stage, but since they are already used abroad, we hope to replicate similar success,” Troyo said, citing the potential to add 10 megawatts (MW) to 15 MW without heavy infrastructure costs.

Turbines and generator rotors in Tongonan’s facilities have been replaced, and operations are now nearly fully automated. “Operations now focus on optimising and monitoring the plant, with less manual adjustment,” Troyo said.

Plans are also underway to replace nine cooling towers with new units that are resilient to typhoons and earthquakes.

With these upgrades, EDC expects Tongonan to remain operational until at least 2046.

Meanwhile, the firm’s other geothermal facilities are also due for rehabilitation and upgrades over the near term. The 180 MW Mahanagdong facilities will undergo rehabilitation and capacity upgrades in three to five years, whilst Upper Mahiao is slated for complete plant replacement to boost generating capacity from 130 MW to at least 200 MW, supported by additional geothermal wells.
