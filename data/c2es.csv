,EVs,2025-07-21 23:29:04+00:00,GovTech,"Sans Incentives, EV Industry Expected to Slow but Not Stop - GovTech","Skip Descant, www.govtech.com, Skip-Descant.html",,,,,https://www.govtech.com/transportation/sans-incentives-ev-industry-expected-to-slow-but-not-stop,"The next few weeks could be a busy season on car lots as shoppers close in on electric vehicle (EV) purchases before federal purchase incentives come to an end.
Much of it depends on cost, and how closely EVs can reach cost parity with gas-burning vehicles, those in the industry said.
“Affordability is a top issue for many auto buyers, so the EV incentives have definitely helped,” Phillips said.
A number of states, like California, already charge EV owners an annual added registration fee.
Regulatory changes could also take some of the wind out of EV sales.","The next few weeks could be a busy season on car lots as shoppers close in on electric vehicle (EV) purchases before federal purchase incentives come to an end.

The federal budget reconciliation bill — known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — recently passed by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump rescinds tax credits for EVs purchased after Sept. 30.

“When the new tariffs were announced, there was a rush by consumers to purchase vehicles before they went into effect. We will see the same thing with the EV federal tax credit, consumers considering buying a new EV will be highly incentivized to act before the incentives disappear on Sept. 30,” Matthew Phillips, CEO of Car Pros Automotive Group, a dealership group representing car dealerships in California and Washington state, said via email. “OEMs [original equipment manufacturers], many of whom have significant EV supply on the ground, are likely to ramp up their incentives during this time to further stimulate sales.”

However, how much headwind the lack of a $7,500 tax credit places on the EV momentum is still an open question. Much of it depends on cost, and how closely EVs can reach cost parity with gas-burning vehicles, those in the industry said.

“Affordability is a top issue for many auto buyers, so the EV incentives have definitely helped,” Phillips said.

Left out of the final draft of the recently passed legislation was an annual $250 fee to be paid by EV owners, ostensibly to make up for their use of roadways without paying the gas tax. Tax experts viewed the proposed fee as overly punitive. A number of states, like California, already charge EV owners an annual added registration fee.

“As far as if or when this idea could come back, it would be during the highway funding reauthorization fight,” Alex Muresianu, senior policy analyst with the Tax Foundation, said.

Regulatory changes could also take some of the wind out of EV sales. The new legislation ends penalties for companies violating fuel economy standards, leaving carmakers with little incentive to invest in the development of EVs or gas-burning cars that operate more efficiently.

California, which has led the nation in adopting new regulations aimed at phasing out fossil fuel vehicles — both in the light-duty sector and in heavy-duty trucking — has paused its rollout of the Advanced Clean Fleets rule and the Advanced Clean Trucking regulations, following actions by Congress, and signed by Trump, to prevent the state from setting its own air protection standards and rules. These actions have been met with a legal challenge from California Attorney General Rob Bonta, joined by the attorneys general of 10 other states.

Federal shifts would also end the Golden State’s regulation requiring that all new cars sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. By the end of the first quarter this year, 23 percent of new-car sales were zero-emission in California, according to Veloz, an EV industry advocacy group based in Sacramento. This is down from about 25 percent at the end of 2024.

“Removing both the tax incentive ‘carrot’ and the CARB [California Air Resources Board] mandate ‘stick’ are going to drastically slow the adoption of full EVs in the U.S.,” Phillips said. “However, don’t count the EV out yet. With a smooth ride, quick acceleration and a lower cost to operate, many people are likely to stick with EVs, and PHEV [plug-in hybrid electric vehicle] sales will continue to grow.”

That optimism toward the future of electrified transportation can be seen in various projects completed or moving forward. Veloz recently launched a new ad and reduction campaign, funded in part with $43.5 million from Electrify America, the nationwide high-speed charging network.

And even though the 2025 Electric Vehicle Outlook by Bloomberg indicates “EV adoption outlook [in the United States] is now much lower as EV policies and support are being rolled back,” the report notes global EV sales will continue to grow and represent 25 percent of new car sales this year.

WattEV, which builds and operates high-speed charging depots for the trucking industry, broke ground last month on its sixth heavy-duty electric truck charging depot in California, located at the Port of Oakland. The facility will be capable of charging 25 heavy- or medium-duty trucks with up to 240 kilowatts per plug. The facility also offers megawatt charging, which includes massive charge cables able to power up freight trucks in about 30 minutes — comparable to refueling a diesel truck.

The project received state grant funding and is expected to be complete in early 2026.

“WattEV welcomes government support for its goal of electrifying transportation, but our business model rests on evidence that electric trucks can move freight as cost‑effectively, if not better, as diesel ones, while delivering substantial environmental benefits,” said CEO Salim Youssefzadeh in an email.

The company has three other heavy-duty charging depots under development across southern California. The Otay Mesa depot near San Diego, with seven megawatt chargers, will be located just 1,000 feet from the Mexico border, to supply the cross-border freight activity. Another depot planned in Baker, Calif., on the Interstate 15 corridor, will serve the freight traffic moving between southern California and Las Vegas. And the company is building out 12 megawatt chargers at the Port of Long Beach. All three sites are intended to reduce charging time to 30 minutes or less.

Louisiana’s settlement could signal a softening stance toward EV makers that rely on direct sales, particularly as consumer demand for electric vehicles continues to grow.
However, details of the settlement remain confidential, and it is unclear whether it will lead to legislative changes allowing Tesla to open direct sales locations in the state.
The resolution of this case may pave the way for new discussions with state lawmakers or regulatory bodies regarding direct sales.","Tesla has reached a settlement with the state of Louisiana, ending what has been a multi-year legal battle over the state’s ban on direct vehicle sales. The settlement, disclosed in a dismissal motion filed in New Orleans federal court on Monday reported by Reuters, resolves all claims between Tesla, Louisiana officials, and local dealership associations, although the details of the settlement remain unclear.

The dispute dates back to August 2022, when Tesla sued members of the Louisiana Motor Vehicle Commission, the Louisiana Automobile Dealers Association, and dealership owners who sat on the commission. Tesla argued that Louisiana’s 2017 law banning direct vehicle sales to consumers unfairly targeted its business model, which bypasses traditional franchised dealerships.

The lawsuit alleged that certain motor vehicle commissioners—many of whom had ties to competing dealerships—used their regulatory power to limit Tesla’s ability to sell, lease, and service vehicles in the state. Tesla called the law an “existential threat” to its operations, accusing the commission of acting to protect entrenched dealership interests rather than consumers.

In mid-2023, a federal judge dismissed Tesla’s lawsuit, but the automaker received some federal help in August 2024 when the 5th U U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans ruled in favour of Tesla, allowing the company to continue its lawsuit. The appeals court also overturned the dismissal of Tesla’s antitrust claim, citing evidence of potential bias within the commission.

Despite these wins, the case continued to wind its way through the courts. Earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by 18 commissioners seeking to overturn the 5th Circuit’s decision. With Monday’s settlement, Tesla’s claims have now been “fully and finally resolved,” according to the court filing.

The settlement represents another step in Tesla’s ongoing campaign to challenge dealership laws across the U.S. Tesla has argued that direct sales offer customers a more transparent buying experience, with fixed pricing and a seamless online ordering process. While Tesla has successfully overturned or worked around similar bans in some states, others—like Texas and Michigan—have resisted changes to their franchise laws.

Louisiana’s settlement could signal a softening stance toward EV makers that rely on direct sales, particularly as consumer demand for electric vehicles continues to grow. However, details of the settlement remain confidential, and it is unclear whether it will lead to legislative changes allowing Tesla to open direct sales locations in the state.

What’s Next for Tesla in Louisiana?

By the Tax Controversy Practice

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the OBBB) into law, making permanent the reduced individual tax rates and brackets established by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and modifying a number of important tax provisions affecting businesses.

This blog post highlights the changes to federal tax law and analyzes the defeat of the “revenge tax.”

Tax Law Changes

The modified tax provisions include:

100% bonus depreciation: Permanent restoration of 100% bonus depreciation for short-lived investments.

R&D expensing: Permanent restoration of immediate expensing for domestic R&D expenses.

QBI deduction: The qualified business income (QBI) deduction is now permanent and the deduction amount is increased from 20% to 23% along with additional changes to the phase-in of previously established limitations.

Qualified structure expensing: Moving away from depreciation schedules, this modification temporarily provides 100% expensing of qualifying structures placed into service before January 1, 2031.

1% floor on corporate charitable deductions: A new 1% floor for the deduction of charitable contributions made by corporations means that only contributions exceeding 1% of a corporation’s taxable income are deductible.

Elimination of miscellaneous itemized deductions including management fees: The disallowance of miscellaneous itemized deductions, including management fees paid by investors to many investment funds, is now permanent. This modification may limit the attractiveness of investment funds to high-net-worth individuals.

Green/energy credits:

The clean electricity production credit (45Y) and investment credit (48E) for wind and solar projects placed in service after 2027 (with exceptions for certain projects that begin construction within 12 months of passage) are eliminated.

The clean fuel production credit (45Z) is extended through 2029, with expanded eligibility.

“Foreign entity of concern” (FEOC) restrictions are added to the clean electricity production credit (45Y), investment credit (48E), nuclear production credit (45U), clean fuel production credit (45Z), carbon oxide sequestration credit (45Q), and advanced manufacturing production credit (45X).

See our Client Alert to learn about how the OBBB disrupts clean energy investment.

Publicly traded partnerships and green energy: Qualifying income is expanded to include income derived from (i) qualifying hydrogen storage and transportation; (ii) electricity production from qualifying nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal facilities; (iii) carbon capture facilities, including electricity production from qualifying facilities with sufficient carbon capture; and (iv) thermal energy from hydropower and geothermal facilities.

CAMT: Intangible drilling and development costs are no longer required to be taken into account for the purposes of computing adjusted financial statement income for the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT).

FTC haircut reduced: The foreign tax credit (FTC) haircut is reduced for foreign income taxes paid or accrued by a controlled foreign corporation (CFC) that are attributable to the CFC’s tested income from 20% to 10% starting in 2026.

GILTI to NCTI: The Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) regime is renamed Net CFC Tested Income (NCTI) and modified such that the effective rate on NCTI for US corporations will increase from GILTI’s current 10.5% to 12.6% in 2026, instead of increasing to 13.125% under prior law.

The 10% FTC haircut will also be applied to any foreign income taxes paid or accrued with respect to a distribution of GILTI/NCTI previously taxed earnings and profits.

Only the Section 250 deduction and deductions directly allocable to the net CFC tested income will be allocated and apportioned to the NCTI foreign tax credit basket, generally providing a higher foreign tax credit limitation than under prior law.

QBAI exclusion removed: Currently, the GILTI regime provides an exclusion for a CFC’s Qualified Business Asset Investment (QBAI)-deemed 10% return, referred to as the Net Deemed Tangible Income Return (NDTIR). Under prior GILTI rules, only the CFC’s net tested income in excess of the NDTIR would generally be subject to taxation. Beginning in 2026, the NDTIR exclusion is eliminated, causing US shareholders to be taxed on their pro rata share of their net CFC tested income.

FDII to FDDEI: The Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII) regime is renamed Foreign-Derived Deduction Eligible Income (FDDEI) in light of the elimination of the deemed return on tangible assets and other modifications. In 2026, the IRC Section 250 deduction will be reduced from 37.5% to 33.34% resulting in a 14% effective rate for FDDEI. The increase from the current 13.125% effective rate on FDII to a 14% effective rate on FDDEI is less than an increase to 16.4% in 2026, which is what prior law would have provided.

BEAT increases: The Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) rate is increased from 10% to 10.5% for 2026, preventing a larger increase to 12.5% under prior law.

Downward attribution of stock restored: The limitation on downward attribution of stock ownership in applying the constructive ownership rules when determining CFC status is restored.

Tariffs Are IN (Still). The Revenge Tax Is OUT.

When the House passed its version of the OBBB on May 22, 2025, it included the Section 899 “revenge tax.” This provision would have granted the executive branch the authority to temporarily increase taxes on countries perceived to impose discriminatory taxes on US taxpayers, such as digital services taxes or undertaxed profits rules.

Despite raising significant questions, the revenge tax was considered likely to be included in the final legislation due to its role as a revenue generator and Congress’s pursuit of tax reform through the budget reconciliation process. Additionally, the revenge tax was viewed as a potential new tool for the executive branch in trade negotiations, possibly shifting the administration’s focus away from ongoing tariff disputes. But that did not happen.

Instead, on June 26, 2025, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent posted on the social platform X that a tentative agreement had been reached between the US and its G7 partners. Under the agreement, US companies would generally be excluded from OECD pillar 2 taxes in exchange for jettisoning the revenge tax.

On July 7, 2025, three days after President Trump signed the OBBB into law, the administration quickly moved back to the business of tariffs by extending the implementation of additional tariffs on more than 50 countries (China excluded) until August 1 to allow more time for trade negotiations.",https://www.lathamreg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/01/GettyImages-519282946_0-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-21 20:01:11.271264

JA Solar’s Phoenix-based solar panel factory will now operate under American Panel Solutions, a new subsidiary that Corning owns. A company spokesperson confirmed the acquisition to PV Tech.

“Corning is excited to leverage our advanced manufacturing expertise and expand our solar capabilities in Phoenix with American Panel Solutions,” said AB Ghosh, VP and general manager of solar at Corning, who also serves as chairman and CEO at Hemlock Semiconductor.

In 2023, China’s JA Solar, the world’s fourth-largest solar panel maker by capacity, announced it would open its first factory in the US. The Beijing-headquartered company invested $60 million and leased space in Phoenix to manufacture photovoltaic products. It was a big win for the Biden administration, which created a domestic clean energy manufacturing growth boom.

However, thanks to the big bill that the Republican-majority Congress recently passed, new rules around “foreign entities of concern” (FEOCs) will make things trickier for solar companies that want to tap into federal tax breaks. If more than 60% of a project’s materials come from China, it will lose access to key tax incentives like the production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC). The thresholds for how much FEOC-linked content is allowed will decrease by 5% yearly until it reaches an allowed 40% FEOC-made by 2030.

Wood Mackenzie research analyst Elissa Pierce pointed out that ultimately, this new rule threatens to create more problems for the US solar industry than it solves:

The solar industry’s supply chain shuffle reveals a fundamental paradox.

Despite billions in tariffs and years of diversification efforts, Chinese companies still control manufacturing through regional subsidiaries.

When Malaysian glass suppliers and Vietnamese frame manufacturers are Chinese-owned operations, we’re not achieving energy security. We’re simply paying higher prices for the same supply chain risk.

These new market distortions could ultimately harm renewable energy deployment while potentially precluding domestic manufacturers from receiving the 45X tax credits due to the FEOC restrictions.

JA Solar is the second Chinese solar company to sell its US factory since the US presidential election. Changzhou-headquartered Trina Solar sold its Texas solar panel factory to T1 Energy (previously FREYR Energy) in December. The acquisition was announced on November 6, the same day Kamala Harris conceded the US election to Donald Trump – just a week after Trina opened the factory.

Meanwhile, the 30% commercial solar tax credit for schools, municipalities, businesses, and nonprofits is being phased out.
The clean energy future we’ve been building in Michigan didn’t happen because conditions were perfect.","We need that same spirit again now.

The recently enacted federal budget reconciliation law nicknamed the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” presents new challenges and shifts directions for clean energy. The law cuts several federal tax incentives that helped make solar panels, heat pumps, weatherization, and other upgrades more financially feasible for both homeowners and institutions.

For example, the 30% federal tax credit for residential energy efficiency improvements and solar installations will disappear after Dec. 31, 2025. That includes upgrades like energy audits, furnaces, water heaters, insulation, and windows. Meanwhile, the 30% commercial solar tax credit for schools, municipalities, businesses, and nonprofits is being phased out. New restrictions on foreign-manufactured solar components could further drive up project costs and create undue risk for entities claiming the credit.

Energy improvements are one of the few ways families can lower monthly bills while also improving their home’s comfort and resilience. They protect against extreme temperatures, make homes healthier, and keep the lights on during outages. For contractors, these projects sustain local, good-paying jobs. For small businesses and public institutions, they reduce operating costs that can be redirected to more pressing needs.

While the federal policy changes may slow the pace of investments, there is still time to act — and opportunities to seize — if we move quickly.

Residential and commercial property owners who move forward now can take advantage of these savings before they’re gone. Residential customers will need to complete their solar or energy efficiency projects by the end of 2025, and commercial property owners need to begin construction of such projects this year to qualify for the full incentives under current rules. Technologies like ground-source heat pumps and energy storage used on commercial properties have longer eligibility timelines, with credits available into the early 2030s, although new import limits will apply to some equipment beginning in 2026.

Organizations like Michigan Saves are working to help homeowners, businesses, nonprofits, and municipalities finance these projects before the window closes. While the tax landscape is changing, the need for reliable, affordable energy solutions is not.

This moment calls for urgency, not retreat. It’s a time for contractors, solar developers, and local leaders to work together, share accurate information, and help communities act quickly to make wise investments. It’s also a time for state and local policymakers to keep investing in complementary programs that bridge the affordability gap that remains.

The clean energy future we’ve been building in Michigan didn’t happen because conditions were perfect. It happened because people came together — contractors, community lenders, local governments, and determined homeowners — to make things better.

We’ve done it before. And we can do it again.

Yes, the rules have changed. But the mission to reduce costs, protect communities, and build a cleaner, more resilient Michigan remains the same.",https://www.bridgemi.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2025-07/S_Talberg-headshot-%20full.png?itok=KILBcmWh,N,,2025-07-21 18:00:50.333215

Production from Oppama will shift to the Nissan Motor Kyushu Co. facility in Fukuoka, which Nissan states will “significantly reduce manufacturing costs in Japan.” This raises questions about efficiency gains in a competitive EV landscape.
Building on that, Nissan plans to cut global production from 3.5 million units—excluding China—to 2.5 million units while achieving 100% plant utilization.
In May, the company unified production of Frontier and Navara pickups at its Morelos, Mexico, plant, previously divided with an Argentine facility.
However, vehicle production in India continues through the ongoing alliance, preserving market presence in a region with rising EV interest.","Nissan Motor Co. has announced the closure of vehicle production at its Oppama plant in Japan by the end of fiscal year 2027, a strategic move tied to the company’s push for profitability amid evolving electric vehicle demands. This decision affects a facility that pioneered the mass-market EV with the Nissan Leaf in 2010.

Strategic Overhaul for Profitability

Nissan aims to return to profitability by fiscal year 2026 through a comprehensive plan that shrinks its global manufacturing footprint, reports AutomotiveDive. The company will consolidate from 17 plants worldwide to just 10 by fiscal year 2027.

Production from Oppama will shift to the Nissan Motor Kyushu Co. facility in Fukuoka, which Nissan states will “significantly reduce manufacturing costs in Japan.” This raises questions about efficiency gains in a competitive EV landscape.

Building on that, Nissan plans to cut global production from 3.5 million units—excluding China—to 2.5 million units while achieving 100% plant utilization. The automaker has confirmed no further production adjustments in Japan beyond this closure. These steps reflect broader industry trends where legacy automakers optimize operations to fund EV transitions, balancing cost reductions with innovation investments.

“Today, Nissan made a tough but necessary decision,” CEO Ivan Espinosa said reportedly. “It wasn’t easy—for me or for the company—but I believe it’s a vital step toward overcoming our current challenges and building a sustainable future.”

Operational Continuity and Worker Implications

The Oppama plant, spanning 18.2 million square feet, opened in 1961 and has manufactured 17.8 million vehicles over its history. While vehicle assembly ends, Nissan will preserve other functions in the area, such as a research center and crash test facility. This continuity supports ongoing R&D critical for EV advancements, like battery tech and safety features.

Approximately 2,400 employees at the production site will stay on payroll until fiscal year 2027 concludes. Nissan is still developing plans for their future roles, which could involve reassignments or retraining. Such measures highlight economic implications for workers in manufacturing hubs, where EV shifts demand new skills but also risk job displacements if not managed carefully.

Delays in U.S. Electric SUV Rollout

In the United States, Nissan is postponing the production start of two electric SUVs at its Canton, Mississippi, plant by 10 months, now set for 2028. The company describes this as a strategic choice rather than a direct response to policy shifts. This delay could influence EV adoption timelines for consumers, as it pushes back availability of new models amid growing demand for affordable electric options.

Operational impacts extend to supply chains, where such postponements might allow for refinements in design or integration of updated technologies, ensuring competitiveness against rivals like Tesla or Ford. Enthusiasts monitoring EV trends should note how these adjustments align with market pressures, including raw material costs and consumer preferences for longer-range vehicles.

Broader Global Manufacturing Adjustments

Nissan’s consolidation extends internationally. In May, the company unified production of Frontier and Navara pickups at its Morelos, Mexico, plant, previously divided with an Argentine facility. This streamlines logistics and reduces overheads, potentially lowering prices for EV-related components shared across models.

Additionally, in March, Nissan divested its 51% stake in Renault Nissan Automotive India Private to partner Renault Group. However, vehicle production in India continues through the ongoing alliance, preserving market presence in a region with rising EV interest. These moves underscore regulatory and economic considerations, as partnerships help navigate tariffs and local content rules while focusing resources on high-growth EV segments.

Overall, Nissan’s actions signal a pivotal shift toward leaner operations, with implications for EV innovation and affordability. As the industry evolves, such restructurings could enhance sustainability efforts, though they demand careful oversight to mitigate disruptions for stakeholders.",https://evxl.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/EVXL-Copyright-0236.jpg,N,,2025-07-21 18:00:38.961022

This is the report’s seventh update in compliance with the Governor’s executive order.

“This report makes it clear that Colorado is delivering on our promises to expand transportation options, improve Colorado's air quality, and expand investments in clean energy technology, including advancements in Geothermal energy, and augmenting our work to deliver clean energy to stabilize energy costs and drive investment in Colorado communities,” said Governor Polis.

Established in 2021, this report, which was biannual until June 30, 2024, covers the period from July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025. This edition highlights work achieved across a broad range of sectors and addresses planned actions outlined in key documents such as the first and second Greenhouse Gas Pollution Reduction Roadmaps (January 2021 and February 2024, respectively) and the Colorado Transportation Vision: 2035 (November 2024).

This report was jointly drafted by the Colorado Energy Office (CEO), Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment (CDPHE), Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Colorado Department of Agriculture (CDA), Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), Office of Economic Development and International Trade (OEDIT), Department of Labor and Employment (Office of Just Transition), the Department of Local Affairs (DOLA), and the Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA).

“With this report representing the work Colorado did in the final six months of the Biden Administration and the first six of the Trump Administration, one important fact jumps out when you read it: Regardless of the federal landscape, we are charging forward in ensuring that all Coloradans have clean air and cost-efficient clean energy and transportation options,” said Colorado Energy Office Executive Director Will Toor. “This report is also a valuable reminder that we are committed to an all-of-government approach in this work. We will not stop until we reach the ambitious climate goals that Governor Polis and the legislature have set for Colorado.”

One of the most notable findings during this period came from the state’s updated GHG Inventory, which was released in November 2024. Overall, the update indicated the state is closer to its future greenhouse gas reduction targets than previously estimated. Modeling projects that Colorado is 87.5% of the way toward achieving its 2030 GHG emissions reduction goal, with just the actions completed by the end of 2023. With the additional Near Term Actions from Roadmap 2.0 – and without any additional action – Colorado is currently projected to achieve the goal before the end of 2031.

Using the same modeling platform, the state further assessed Colorado’s expected progress against 44 other U.S. states and found that Colorado will soon lead the pack in terms of percent reductions relative to a common baseline year of 2005. The modeling also indicated Colorado is projected to be the first state to achieve a 50% reduction in emissions (2031) from its 2005 baseline.

Other sector-by-sector highlights from the past year include:

Transportation

Colorado surpassed California to lead the nation in EV sales percentages in the third quarter of 2024, with new EV purchases exceeding 30% of all Colorado light duty vehicle sales in the fourth quarter of 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, EV sales remained strong at 26%.

One of those organizations provides meals for those experiencing food insecurity in New Hampshire and Maine. The nonprofit Gather had received a Thriving Communities grant of about $350,000 to scale its Seacoast Waste Not program.

According to Tania Marino, culinary director for the nonprofit, they have received no communication about when or if they will be receiving the money.

“It was incredibly disappointing to learn on the same day that we, that we were awarded the grant, that the funds actually were rescinded,” she said.

In just over a year the program has served over 120,000 meals from excess food donated by restaurants, caterers or farmers, for example, that would have otherwise gone to waste.

The grant would help Gather expand the program by hiring more staff members and increasing its transportation capacity and number of partner organizations, Marino said.

According to Heidi Trimarco, an attorney with the Conservation Law Foundation, the impact of these grant terminations was “devastating” to community organizations across the country.

“When they learned that they had been granted the awards, they didn't wait for the money to come in. They got right to work,” she said. “So, as a result of this unlawful grant termination, they're left holding the bag”.

The amicus brief was filed in support of Appalachian Voices in its class action lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency for its termination of Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant programs.

“It's a way for these groups to tell the court that they have suffered significant harm as a result of these cuts and to inform the court the breadth and the extent of the harm that the Trump administration caused by this wholesale slashing of these promised funds,” said Heidi Trimarco, an attorney with the Conservation Law Foundation

As the groups await a decision from the court, Appalachian Voices has requested a preliminary injunction, which asks the court to provide temporary relief by reinstating the terminated funds while the litigation proceeds.

The injunction also asks that the court prevent any future terminations of those funds and provide staffing and resources in support of the impacted programs.

Slate Auto, a 3-year-old startup company in Troy, has revealed its concept for a minimalist EV pickup that addresses the auto industry’s affordability crisis. Called the Blank Slate, the compact truck will be made in only one configuration at the company’s plant in Warsaw, Indiana, to be sold online directly to consumers for about $20,000 after federal incentives. Volume production is intended for late 2026.

Why is it so cheap?

Simplifying the build process to reduce costs means skipping some conventional steps. Because the body is made of composite panels, the plant gets by without the usual stamping presses and bevy of robot welders. Nor is there a paint shop, because the dent-resistant panels (think of Saturn) are slate gray.

Is the inside as blank as the outside?

The Blank Slate is equipped with three knobs to control the heat and air conditioning. Windows crank up and down by hand. Sorry, no infotainment system — but bring your own tech and mount your phone or tablet to avoid struggling with a built-in system. A USB port and a mounting point accommodate your speaker.

What if I don’t want it blank?

The design encourages adaptation and modularity. Accessory do-it-yourself kits (think of IKEA) let the buyer convert the base pickup into either of two SUV variants: a blocky five-passenger SUV with a roll cage and side-curtain airbags and a fastback SUV — pretty racy! To individualize your Blank Slate, order one of the vinyl wrap kits, which start at about

$500, in nearly any pattern and color. Apply it yourself or have Slate do it. You can choose from more than 100 accessories and add-ons, such as ladder racks in “work truck” mode and bike, ski, and gear racks in “play hard” mode. Watch for additional innovations from the aftermarket.

What is the cost after customization?

“We have not announced pricing for accessories yet, specific or directional,” said Slate’s head of public relations at press time in mid-May.

Is it safe?

Standard features of the Blank Slate emphasize occupant safety. There are up to eight airbags, a back-up camera, forward collision warning, traction control, electronic stability control, and active emergency braking. The internal steel cage is a stout safety cell that mates with the battery deck below.

How does it perform?

Power train: The 150-kilowatt (201-horsepower) electric motor is fed by a 52.7-kilowatt-hour battery pack and drives the rear wheels. An 84.3 kWh pack can be ordered.

Performance: 0 to 60 miles per hour in 8.0 seconds, 90 mph top speed

Range: 150 miles with standard battery, 240 miles with extended battery

Efficiency: 96 miles per gallon equivalent

Payload: 1,433 pounds in the pickup bed, which can carry sheets of plywood

Towing: 1,000 pounds

What are the dimensions?

The length of 174.7 inches and width of 70.6 inches place the truck right around the maximum of compact-vehicle class standards. The height of 69.3 inches is on par with a Ford Maverick. The 108.9-inch wheelbase surpasses that of a Honda Civic (107.7). Today’s vehicles — especially electric ones — are heavier than ever. At 3,602 pounds, this one exceeds the weight of the original Ford Mustang by a half-ton.

How do I get one?

Minding the Qs in a hydrogen future Q Hydrogen is headquartered in Park City, Utah, but focused on delivering its first commercial-scale project in New Hampshire.
“My father is the developer of that technology,” Whitaker Irvin Jr. said.
“It takes people who are committed long term, and we’re had continuous progress,” Irvin Jr. said.
“Yes, we can get there,” Irvin Jr. said.","“H2 is important as a long-term solution because it is an infinite source of energy,” pointed out Tim La Valle, creator and host of the H2 Liftoff podcast, in an interview with EnergyTech. “It can be produced wherever there is renewable energy and water, it can be stored indefinitely, and it can be traded as a commodity. It has all the attributes of a preferred, long-term energy solution.”

Indeed, for decades now hydrogen enthusiasts and entrepreneurs have intrigued us with visions of carbon-free long-haul transportation via H2 fuel cell engines, as well as clean energy farms powering electrolyzers producing green hydrogen—the carbon-freest of H2 products—for the nation’s utility-scale power. It is surely a decarbonizing force for good, if only it can overcome issues of supply chain and competitive economic viability.

H2 Infinity and Beyond

The Free EnergyTech E-Book

Right now, gasoline and natural gas are kings of the road, while wind, solar, nuclear and hydro help decarbonize the grid. Hydrogen is still the slow-moving challenger to the throne.

And the challenger is not cheap. One kilogram of hydrogen is about the energy equal of a gallon of gasoline, according to the U.S. Department of Energy and others. In recent times, the cost to produce one kilogram of H2 by electrolysis—which is splitting the hydrogen atoms from water—can range between $4 to $6 per kilogram just at the production level. Add in distribution costs and ultimately the wholesale expense is close to $7 or $8 per kilogram, well above the nearly $4 retail price for gasoline in many regions.

Bringing H2 to the masses in an affordable, competitive way

Hydrogen is super abundant in nature but not in the shale oil and gas way where we can drill down, refine and harness it en masse. Hydrogen is everywhere but embeds itself within other elements. It is usually generated either by steam reforming of methane gas or by electrolyzers. Because it is so light and combustible, the movement of hydrogen cannot simply be moved along the nation’s existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure without some kind of capital-intensive update to hold and transport it safely.

Over time, perhaps as soon as five to 10 years, a host hydrogen entrepreneurs are confident that the energy and carbon-free value of hydrogen will gain momentum in the marketplace. The Trump Administration’s move to end production tax credits and other subsidies for wind and solar should help level the playing field for resources, such as hydrogen and nuclear, which can provide baseload-level power for extended periods to meet future demand from data centers and AI training models. (Editor’s note: The Trump and GOP “Big Beautiful Budget Bill” also sunsets the 45V hydrogen production tax credit but extends that ending all the way through 2027).

“I think we’ll see a lot happen in the U.S.,” said Whitaker Irvin Jr., CEO of startup Q Hydrogen, which is working on unveiling a purported new option in hydrogen production at a former power plant and paper mill in New Hampshire. A former Raytheon engineer, Irvin Jr. has spent years helping ready Q’s process for entry into the public marketplace and production, although he is still relatively non-specific about how Q technology works (more on that later).

“I think Trump is operating from a place of practicality and money,” Irvin added. “We spent a lot of time providing subsidies for industries which cannot stand on their own. We do have to find new ways of funding more sustainable energy resources.”

Right now is a tough time to find competitive footing for alternative energy resources not already scaled up. U.S. production from oil and gas drilling are stabilizing at historic levels, so much so that the nation is now a net exporter of liquified natural gas, while solar, wind and battery storage installation—in cases buoyed by incentives but consistently leading new generation additions—are constantly setting new records.

Many purposes for H2 in many lands

Hydrogen, though, is a valuable energy carrier, and from it it also can produce ammonia both for agricultural and maritime transportation purposes. It might prove its worth as an energy player in decarbonizing regions which struggle to produce enough resources to meet demand on their own.

“Northeast Asia and Europe: Both will more than likely require more energy that they can produce, so energy will have to be imported” La Valle noted. “Hydrogen, at some point, could be that future energy source if nuclear energy is technically not feasible or cost prohibitive.”

Yes, nuclear itself Is hugely expensive and comes with safety concerns borne out by events such as Chernobyl and Fukushima. Oil and gas, meanwhile, are currently abundant but come at an environmental cost, and drillers keep having to drill deeper.

Solar and wind? Well, as the adage goes, the sun doesn’t always shine, and the wind doesn’t always blow.

Enter hydrogen (yes we know it’s always here). Forms of H2 are engaged in experiments trying to achieve commercial-scale nuclear fusion, which is another dream project for dreamers and engineers seeking the future holy grail on abundant, energy-dense and carbon-free power.

With hydrogen, the tried-and-true methods have been steam reforming and electrolysis. The promise emanating from the next generation of H2 startups, such as Q Hydrogen, is that there are new inventions to split energy from water.

Minding the Qs in a hydrogen future

Q Hydrogen is headquartered in Park City, Utah, but focused on delivering its first commercial-scale project in New Hampshire. The company is the brainchild of the Irvins, starting with the father, Whitaker Sr., who was working on finding new ways to solve issues in industrial heating and cooling.

Eventually, Whitaker Irvin Sr. opted to focus on hydrogen production, and his son, Whit Jr., who had been working for defense contractor Raytheon, came on board to help push the company toward commercialization. Test work commenced in Utah with a 12.5-MW project, but the company settled on locating its first planned commercial plant at the site of an old paper mill and power plant in Groveton, New Hampshire.

Calling it the “world’s first power plant completely fueled by clean, affordable clear hydrogen,” Irvin Jr. said, the Q generator will use water from the nearby Upper Ammonoosuc River, routing the water in a cement pre-processing tank to remove particulate matter then process it against magnetic components, utilizing a turbine to produce hyperbolic wave form geometrics and create an interaction of high and low pressure zones.

At some point, Irvin Jr. says, a massive energy exchange takes place and usable green hydrogen is produced. He would not offer much more detail except to say that the Q Hydrogen is valid and has secured support from former New Hampshire U.S. Sen. John E. Sununu and has on its leadership team Gary Morris, the onetime chief financial officer of oilfield services firm Halliburton when former Vice President Dick Cheney was CEO.

“My father is the developer of that technology,” Whitaker Irvin Jr. said. “He was an industrialist in Latin America, working with companies which created pumping systems.

“He originally had a theory with the geometry I mentioned, on how to create a turbine with differentiators. . . etched into the turbine plate surface and create two different flows of air.”

Within that interaction, and others, reportedly Q’s hydrogen is produced at a relatively low temperature rate. And while Irvin is relatively non-specific about the proprietary technology within Q Hydrogen’s business plan, he is confident that the New Hampshire plant can produce about 10 MW of energy per day very soon, and perhaps as high as 100 MW eventually.

“It takes people who are committed long term, and we’re had continuous progress,” Irvin Jr. said. “There’s not been a point where we really stalled.”

Speeding up the scaling up

Whether Q Hydrogen achieves its promises and goals, or whether the world continues with steam reforming combined with carbon capture or electrolyzers creating H2 from water or pyrolysis, the drive toward a hydrogen economy is a gathering force for good, its biggest enthusiasts contend.

“It is a tall order, but it is technically possible and can be achieved if the demand for hydrogen increases,” said La Valle, of the H2 Liftoff Podcast. “The demand will increase when the consumer becomes away of the attributes and benefits of hydrogen.”

La Valle is an H2 true believer, while Irvin Jr. and his team at Q Hydrogen are financially determined to create H2 at an economically scaled level. The Irvins believe that success is around the corner, because a baseload-level and carbon-free resource is required to meet future energy demand from an increasingly electrified industrial sector.

We’ve heard that before. And we’ve seen H2 fuel cell and other electrolyzer inventions fade away, pushing that “it’s always 10 years away” scenario even further out.

Hydrogen believers are not deterred. It’s H2 infinity and beyond for them.

“Yes, we can get there,” Irvin Jr. said. “It may five-ish years. It’s not going to take a decade.”

While skepticism is understandable, incredible progress has been made on H2 infrastructure in Europe and beyond. Forbes has noted there is currently nearly $1 trillion in hydrogen projects underway worldwide.

Maybe the moment is nearly here, and the hydrogen future will be without our hands, not playing hard to get so much anymore.","https://img.energytech.com/files/base/ebm/energytech/image/2025/07/687ea14d8f10070a0fbf9f0e-hydrogen_dreamstime.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-07-21 19:00:47.041802

This decision arrives just ahead of the September 30 expiration of tax credits under the Biden administration, potentially signaling broader industry retreats.

Details of the Production Pause

The suspension affects all variants of the EQE and EQS, including sedans and SUVs, starting September 1, reports Gizmodo. Mercedes-Benz has already closed order banks for these models and informed U.S. dealers of the change.

“Vehicles scheduled for production prior to September 1 will continue to be produced,” a spokesperson told InsideEVs. “This announcement applies only [to] U.S. vehicle orders of these models.”

Production of the EQS SUV and EQE SUV occurs in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, where operations began in 2022. In contrast, the sedan versions are manufactured in Germany and shipped to the U.S. These sedans have not qualified for the $7,500 federal EV tax credit unless leased, due to sourcing rules in the Inflation Reduction Act. Pricing for these models spans $78,000 to $135,000, with the 2025 EQS 450 SUV starting at $105,250.

This raises questions about the immediate triggers. The company did not respond to requests for further comment, leaving room for speculation on factors like demand shifts or supply chain adjustments.

Broader Implications for EV Demand

The timing aligns with the recent signing of a comprehensive bill by President Trump on July 4, which eliminates the $7,500 credit for new EVs and the $4,000 incentive for used ones. Experts view Mercedes-Benz’s action as a potential precursor to similar decisions across the industry. As one observer noted, this story is likely to repeat itself, with only the names at the top changing.

EV sales in the U.S. already declined 6.3% in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2024. Analysts anticipate a short-term surge in the third quarter as buyers accelerate purchases before the September 30 deadline. Building on that, the post-deadline landscape appears uncertain, with warnings that demand for high-end models could weaken significantly without subsidies.

Social media reactions from EV supporters highlight concerns. “Major pause signals deeper EV headwinds,” one user commented on X. Another added, “Benz electric cars are already uncompetitive and losing money, and a $7500 tax credit would make it even worse, so I think that’s why they made that decision.” A third user stated, “Another sign of where EVs are headed in the US thanks to the current administration. It’s unfortunately going to be downhill from here for American EV enthusiasts.”

Industry Outlook and Strategic Shifts

Closing order books and pausing production points to a strategic recalibration amid shrinking incentives. EVs remain pricier than gasoline counterparts, and the loss of federal support could exacerbate this gap, particularly for luxury segments. If other automakers follow suit, the sector might face a slowdown rather than sustained growth.

This development serves as a cautionary indicator. Without new policy interventions, the EV market could stall, affecting adoption rates and innovation. Mercedes-Benz’s retreat reflects fears that subsidies have masked underlying economic realities, prompting a reevaluation of U.S. market commitments.

While the pause is temporary, it highlights vulnerabilities in the EV ecosystem. Stakeholders will watch closely for announcements from competitors, as the incentive cliff approaches.

The region’s power demand is expected to grow by more than 40% by 2030, driven by population growth, industrial expansion, and increased electrification, Xcel Energy said.
We are working to increase speed to market with a stronger, modern, and more resilient energy system that our customers can count on,” said Adrian Rodriguez, president, Xcel Energy – Texas, New Mexico.
Xcel Energy will seek approval of the portfolio from state regulators in the second half of 2025, and the company also plans to issue another all-source RFP to secure additional resources to be operational by 2032.

The utility cited older plant retirements and projected electricity demand increases as reasons for a “major expansion” of electricity infrastructure. The region’s power demand is expected to grow by more than 40% by 2030, driven by population growth, industrial expansion, and increased electrification, Xcel Energy said. New planning reserve margin requirements from the Southwest Power Pool have further raised the bar, with utilities now required to have more capacity to meet increasing seasonal demand.

“This portfolio is about more than just adding power. We are working to increase speed to market with a stronger, modern, and more resilient energy system that our customers can count on,” said Adrian Rodriguez, president, Xcel Energy – Texas, New Mexico. “We’re investing in the right mix of resources to benefit customers by keeping electricity reliable and supporting economic growth so we can meet our region’s energy needs today and in the future.”

Xcel Energy believes the portfolio supports its broader five-year investment plan for Texas and New Mexico, announced in October 2024, which is meant to modernize and expand the region’s energy infrastructure. Many of the proposed projects will be built at existing power plant sites, which can reduce development timelines by leveraging existing infrastructure to interconnect new generation to the grid.

What’s in it?

In 2024, Xcel Energy invited developers to submit proposals for new power projects using “any type of technology.” According to Xcel Energy, power forecasts showed the region has a future need of over 3 GW of accredited capacity, which would translate to more than 5 GW of additional nameplate capacity by the end of the decade. The utility said the current peak demand in its Texas-New Mexico service area was a little more than 6 GW at the time of the request for proposals (RFP).

The RFP process resulted in a mix of energy solutions, including wind, solar, battery storage, and gas power sources, and the projects will be developed through a variety of ownership structures. Some will be built and owned by Xcel Energy, others built by developers and then sold to the company, and some operated under long-term agreements to purchase the power they produce. The portfolio also includes extending the lives of existing natural gas units at Nichols, Maddox, and Plant X.

The selected portfolio includes extensions of 521 megawatts (MW) of existing generation as well as the addition of 17 new power projects that will add 5,168 MW of new nameplate capacity and 3,121 MW of accredited capacity to the SPS system by 2030. Technologies selected include 3,200 MW of dispatchable generation and energy storage and 1,968 MW of wind and solar generation, establishing a foundation for long-term system reliability, economic development, and a resilient energy supply. Specifically comprised of:

2,088 MW of natural gas

1,273 MW of wind

695 MW of solar

1,112 MW of battery storage capacity.

To help meet New Mexico’s 50% renewable energy requirement by 2030, two solar projects in the portfolio will be dedicated to New Mexico customers.

Xcel Energy will seek approval of the portfolio from state regulators in the second half of 2025, and the company also plans to issue another all-source RFP to secure additional resources to be operational by 2032.

We must pass these CRAs and dismantle the harmful, legacy regulations of the Biden era and further to unleash American energy independence that this nation deserves.
Finally, H.R.","As prepared for delivery:

Good afternoon, the Committee will come to order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a recess at any time.

Today, the Rules Committee is convening to consider five separate measures: H.J. Res. 104, H.J. Res. 105, H.J. Res. 106, H.R. 3486, and H.R. 3898.

The three CRAs we’re considering today are all straightforward and supported by local officials bearing the brunt of the Biden-Harris administration’s heavy-handed regulations.

These CRAs are about unleashing American energy independence – something the previous administration was politically allergic to.

One of the things that has always made America great is that we have vast repositories of natural resources that society continues to benefit from.

The problem, to no one’s surprise, is that the federal government under Democrat control, and with support of a bureaucracy that is self-interested, together want to regulate away our natural advantage.

Regulation after regulation is churned out – thereby locking up these natural resources and sidelining American innovation, prosperity, and the opportunity to achieve true energy independence.

I am quite certain our Democrat colleagues will screech until they’re blue in the face that Republicans are shredding environmentalism and doing the bidding of corporations by supporting these CRAs.

Their talking points are so predictable at this point that it’s just embarrassing.

But here’s the truth: Republicans are choosing to embrace American energy independence while Democrats are choosing to embrace overregulation.

We must pass these CRAs and dismantle the harmful, legacy regulations of the Biden era and further to unleash American energy independence that this nation deserves.

H.R. 3486, the Stop Illegal Entry Act, strengthens current law more adequately to deter illegal aliens from entering and reentering the United States.

This legislation helps equip federal officials with even more tools to prosecute aliens who illegally entered the United States under the Biden-Harris administration.

Our Democrat colleagues will never admit that their own policies led to millions of illegal aliens streaming into our country.

They always pivot away from the conversation – typically by attacking President Trump on something entirely unrelated – just to save face.

But the American people know the truth about where Democrats stand on border security and upholding the rule of law.

H.R 3486 requires between five years’ and life imprisonment for an alien who illegally enters the U.S. and is later convicted of a felony, and between 10 years’ imprisonment and life imprisonment for an alien who illegally reenters the United States after being removed following a felony conviction.

These penalties are appropriate responses to repeated violations of U.S. immigration law.

They’re not draconian as some will inevitably claim.

Republicans ran on securing the border and upholding the rule of law that exists in this country – Americans chose us to lead because they support that very same vision and not the lawlessness that was not confronted for four years.

Finally, H.R. 3898, the Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today Act, provides targeted, common-sense reforms that will strengthen the permitting process for permit seekers and holders, while providing clearer instruction and standards for permitting agencies and ensure clean water protections.

This legislation strives once again to find balance within the regulatory and permitting process originally envisioned by the Clean Water Act (CWA) by providing a comprehensive package of commonsense reforms to support energy producers, the agriculture sector, builders, and utilities.

Talk to any contractor, builder, or energy developer in America.

They’ll tell you that the best way to unleash America’s development capabilities is by cutting red tape, streamlining permitting processes, and providing regulatory certainty. It’s rather simple.

The reforms in this legislation are specifically designed to reduce burdensome regulatory requirements, protect against frivolous lawsuits, and increase transparency, while ensuring clean water protections.

As always, I happily invite our Democrat colleagues to join us in supporting the measures that are before us today.

With that, I now yield to the Ranking Member, Mr. McGovern, for any comments he wishes to make.

""Beyond this point, I think we're going to see a different nature of data centre, a much more power-hungry data centre in Australia.""
Much of the power is used to cool computer chips housed in the servers that make up data centres.
""In what that means and therefore what that then means for, again, the compute, the data centre provision and the power to the data centre.""","Consider, for a moment, the year 2008.

Kevin Rudd was less than a year into his first, ill-fated prime ministership, Ricky Ponting was the captain of the Australian Test cricket side, and social media platform Facebook was sweeping the world by storm.

It was also a time of rising demand for electricity.

In fact, up until that time, demand for electricity had been rising steadily for as long as anyone could remember.

There was a basic equation that seemed to explain it — as the economy grew, so, too, did our need for power.

Merryn York, who was at the time working at Powerlink, the state-owned Queensland transmission company, says the equation was the bedrock of planning for the grid.

""Demand for electricity had always responded to economic conditions,"" Ms York says.

But then something unexpected, and unprecedented, happened.

That link between economic growth and electricity demand broke down.

Ms York, now the executive general manager of system design at the Australian Energy Market Operator, explains that electricity demand fell — and for a remarkably long time.

For more than 15 years, demand was subdued as appliances became more efficient, soaring prices made householders increasingly wary about using power and industry contracted.

Power use surges back

Now, however, Australia's long march towards ever greater power needs has resumed.

And it's come back with a vengeance.

""We're really turning a corner,"" Ms York says.

Figures from AEMO show average demand for power in the national electricity market, which spans Australia's eastern seaboard, last year finally surpassed the previous high recorded way back in 2008.

In that time, the way demand for power is measured has changed.

Whereas once there was simply demand, it is now split between ""operational"" demand for power from the grid — excluding rooftop solar generation — and ""underlying"" demand.

On that, more relevant, score, demand in July last year was almost 26,000 megawatts, eclipsing the 25,738MW record set some 16 years ago.

In the first three months of this year, underlying demand rose 1.4 per cent compared with the previous corresponding period to a new record.

Ms York says the numbers are expected to get much higher in the years ahead.

""We are seeing significant growth and we're forecasting significant growth,"" she notes.

Much of the growth to date, and much of what's expected to come, is thanks to the effects of electrification — from cooking and transport to entire industrial processes.

""Electricity demand is now being driven by things like electrification, as people want to decarbonise their electricity usage,"" Ms York says.

""That's playing a role now and will play a stronger role going forward.""

Indeed, AEMO noted in its most recent snapshot of the NEM that electrification was already having an effect.

It was one of the big factors behind the most recent rise in demand, even if the rate of uptake for things like electric vehicles has been slower than expected.

A new centre of demand

For all the implications of electrification, experts say there is another source of demand that looms even larger.

Matt Rennie, who co-owns and runs energy advisory firm Rennie, says our need for data has the potential to change everything.

""It is a big deal,"" Mr Rennie says.

Mr Rennie says Australia is on the cusp of what is likely to be a revolution in the way we use data and — more importantly — how much of it we use.

He says it's a revolution that is being driven by the migration of so many services — from education and games to healthcare and shopping — to the digital realm.

More ominously, he suggests the rise of artificial intelligence is another thing entirely.

In a world where AI becomes ""pervasive"", he says there is likely to be a step-change in demand power that will require round-the-clock supply.

""The thing about AI is that the algorithms that it uses are much more power-intensive,"" Mr Rennie says.

""So as these begin to pervade the way in which we do business and the way in which we plan and conduct our lives, we can expect that there'll be many more of these data centres specifically allocated to training AI systems and then to operate them after that.

""Beyond this point, I think we're going to see a different nature of data centre, a much more power-hungry data centre in Australia.""

Mr Rennie says demand from data centres is already sneaking up and risking the assumptions used by AEMO to forecast electricity requirements.

He notes AEMO's official forecasts show there will be up to 1.5 gigawatts of new demand by 2035 in an ""accelerated data centre scenario"".

However, Mr Rennie says his firm's own research suggests demand will be far higher.

""Our research shows that that's something like 4.9 gigawatts — so two, three times what AEMO was forecasting,"" he says.

To put that in context, a large coal-fired power plant typically has about a gigawatt of capacity.

""One of the interesting things is that Jemena alone, one of the electricity networks in Victoria, has had connection applications for data centres of around 1.5 gigawatts by 2030, Mr Rennie said.

""And that's only for that one distributor in that one state.

'Not seen anything like it'

One person at the bleeding edge of the debate is Alex Coates, the chief executive of data centre operator Interactive.

Ms Coates agrees Australia is on the threshold of a transformation as the twin forces of ""radical digitisation"" and AI combine to propel power demand higher.

She says both applications require huge amounts of extra computing power, or chips.

""That chip must reside somewhere,"" Ms Coates says.

""And of course, it must reside in a place that's secure and safe and reliable, and that's a data centre.""

According to Ms Coates, there are already about 200 data centres in Australia.

Between them, she says, they use about 5 per cent of the power drawn from the grids in which they operate.

Much of the power is used to cool computer chips housed in the servers that make up data centres.

Ms Coates says significant efforts are being made to make cooling more efficient.

Interactive, for example, is exploring two different types of temperature control known as ""liquid-to-chip"" and ""immersion"" cooling to cut its electricity use.

Ultimately, however, she says data centres will need to find new sources of power from somewhere.

""By 2030, we're expecting double the capacity — another 175 facilities,"" Ms Coates says.

""In what that means and therefore what that then means for, again, the compute, the data centre provision and the power to the data centre.""

For Ms Coates, America provides a useful, if cautionary, tale on what to expect.

America 'a salutary lesson'

In the US, demand for power from data centres — especially those connected to AI — has caught almost all forecasters off guard.

Celebrated American energy writer Daniel Yergin noted in an essay earlier this year that data centres alone could consume as much as 10 per cent of power in the US by 2030.

""One large tech company is opening a new data centre every three days,"" Mr Yergin wrote.

""Electricity consumption is already outpacing recent demand forecasts.

""PJM, which manages electricity transmission from Illinois to New Jersey, almost doubled its growth projection between 2022 and 2023 and is warning of the danger of shortfalls in electricity before the end of the decade.

Indeed, Ms Coates says a constant consideration for her business is not only how to secure power supplies, but how to secure them in a sustainable way.

At the moment, she says Interactive draws its power from the grid, meaning it is a mix of renewable and fossil fuel generation.

But she says the company is determined to eventually rely totally on clean energy and may sign deals with generators — so-called power purchase agreements — to do so.

""Certainly we will consider it,"" Ms Coates says.

""I certainly see it continuing as well.""

For both Ms Coates and Mr Rennie, the coming surge in demand for power to meet our insatiable thirst for data is likely to arrive whether Australia is prepared or not.

Climate targets 'on the line'

Mr Rennie says that will almost certainly have consequences for Australia's electricity system, its renewable energy target and its emission goals.

""I mean, we're already concerned about the way in which demand will be met by supply,"" Mr Rennie says.

""We know that the Australian system is growing enormously in terms of demand.

""We know people are buying EVs. We know that these data centres are coming.

""But we also know that coal's coming out of the system, that renewables are taking a little longer than what we thought they would.

""Transmission is now three and a half years behind schedule on average.

""Adding more demand through data centres just takes that to a different level.""

At AEMO, which is responsible for keeping on the lights in Australia's biggest electricity systems, Ms York is optimistic.

She says one of the virtues of forecasting is that it's a ""repeat exercise"", meaning whatever is missed or had changed in one year could be updated the next.

This was true generally, she says, and is no different when it comes to data centres and the ways they will affect Australia's grids.

To that end, she says AEMO has started treating demand forecasts for data centres much more seriously and is endeavouring to better understand the implications.

""Certainly, data centres is something we are specifically considering in our forecasting,"" Ms York says.

""It is quite challenging to know how much of that will turn up here in Australia and where it will be located.

""But it is something that we are very focused on making sure that we are well positioned to support data centres coming to Australia and being able to meet their needs.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/dcf6fff6cea3a428208c636a870e13b5?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=1688&cropW=3000&xPos=0&yPos=156&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-07-21 18:01:09.534971

Dominion Energy (NYSE: D) is a major regulated utility based in Richmond, Virginia. Its bread and butter is delivering electricity and natural gas to about 4.5 million customers—mainly through long-held operations in Virginia, South Carolina, and acquired gas networks. The business is split across regulated power (via Dominion Energy Virginia and Dominion Energy South Carolina), contracted wind and solar energy, and local gas supply, largely thanks to its 2016 Questar acquisition.

For Dominion, stability is built-in. Nearly everything it earns comes under tight regulation, with state and federal authorities setting rate structures that let it recoup investments and earn an approved return. That model creates predictable demand and revenue but keeps things competitive, especially against sector giants like NextEra, Duke, Southern Company, and American Electric Power. Dominion’s size in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, along with its investment in renewables, puts it in the top tier of diversified utilities nationwide.

Recent Performance

Dominion’s shares are up about 12.1% over the last year (to July 18, 2025), trailing the S&P 500’s 13.8% rise. The lag mostly comes down to rising interest rates—a problem for all dividend-paying utilities, since higher yields elsewhere dull their shine. Investors aren’t ignoring Dominion’s sizeable debt or lackluster power prices, either, and patchy, weather-driven demand in some parts of its network has been another hurdle.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

Dominion's sales grew just 0.6% recently, a far cry from the market’s 7.8% average. The firm’s biggest growth levers are expanding its regulated asset base (think: grid upgrades in Virginia, new smart meters, and transmission projects), plus a hefty $50.1 billion capital plan through 2029. That spending prioritizes things like powering data centers and building out offshore wind. First quarter 2025 revenue jumped 12.2% year-over-year to $4.08 billion, helped by increased demand in Virginia and South Carolina, and lower interest costs. Dominion still expects operating earnings for 2025 of $3.28 to $3.52 per share, and is targeting annual EPS growth of 5% to 7% through 2029. But don’t expect fireworks: regulated customer growth is fairly slow, and selling off gas transmission assets will weigh on future revenue. So, growth is steady, but bound by regulatory proceedings and the speed of rolling out renewables.

Quality & Moat

Dominion sits comfortably behind its regulated barriers-to-entry. Its essential status as a utility means it can recover investment—and earn a regulated return—through approved tariffs. Operating margins are solid at 29.2% (compared to a five-year average of 24.7%, and the market’s 17.9%), showing it runs an efficient operation. Management has reliably hit its guidance and kept up dividend payments (currently a 4.7% yield) even when weather and regulatory headwinds blow. Return on invested capital is 4.67% (up from a five-year average of 3.56%), but that’s still far off the market’s 11.85%, so there’s room to do better. Free cash flow yield is in the red at –16.6% (market average: 2.36%), thanks to heavy capital investment and working capital swings. Debt is the elephant in the room, with net debt-to-EBITDA at 6.07x versus a sector average of 1.35x, leaving the company exposed if rates spike. But for now, Dominion has manageable interest coverage and solid BBB-range credit ratings. In short: Dominion’s model delivers steady dividends, but heavy debt and spending blur its quality metrics.

Valuation

Dominion’s forward P/E sits at 20.5x—cheaper than the S&P 500’s 25.0x, but pricier than some pure utilities trading in the high teens. Its EV/Sales multiple of 6.33x is just below its five-year average (6.66x), but above the market’s 4.35x, reflecting its renewable-heavy pipeline. The discount to the broad market makes sense given Dominion’s lower ROIC and negative free cash flow, while the peer premium stems from visible regulated earnings and a backlog in offshore wind. The 4.7% dividend yield is noticeably better than utility rivals (around 3.5%) and U.S. Treasuries—handy for investors hungry for income. Still, current valuation implies only limited upside unless Dominion can speed up debt paydown or spark a re-rating.

Market Sentiment

Analyst views are lukewarm. About nine analysts call it a 'Hold', with average price targets of $58.88—just about 2.9% above recent prices. Short interest is 3.58% of the float (a 20% jump in the past month), with 5.1 days to cover, so there’s a bit of negative positioning. On the brighter side, big institutions own about 73% of shares, since steady income attracts income-focused funds. Insiders aren’t in a hurry to buy or sell, and media sentiment is somewhere between neutral and mildly positive—thanks to recent earnings beats and good news on renewable projects. Overall, investors look set to wait for clearer signs of progress on free cash flow and debt before changing their tune.

Key Risks

Regulatory Risk: Dominion’s profits and returns depend on state and federal approval. If regulators drag their feet or push back on requests, the company can face delays or reductions in its allowed returns.

Interest-Rate Sensitivity: Dominion’s heavy debt (net debt/EBITDA at 6.07x) makes it sensitive to rising borrowing costs. Higher rates mean the company has to pay more interest and faces a higher cost of capital.

Capital Expenditure Overruns: The $50 billion capital plan comes with real risks: cost overruns, permits taking longer than expected, and execution snags—especially with complex renewable and offshore wind projects.

Weather and Demand Volatility: Milder weather cuts demand for electricity, hurting revenue under Dominion's usage-based pricing. On the flip side, extreme weather can stress the grid and drive up operating costs.

Environmental and Decommissioning Costs: Decommissioning nuclear plants and cleaning up environmental liabilities (like old coal ash ponds) can mean unexpected charges and higher ongoing expenses.

Bull Case

Clean Energy Growth: Dominion’s investments in wind, solar, and battery storage put it in a strong spot to capture growing demand for renewables and meet state clean energy targets.

Attractive Dividend Yield: A 4.7% dividend yield—well above what you’ll get from Treasuries or most peers—gives long-term investors a reason to stick around, even if the stock price moves sideways.

Regulated Rate Base Expansion: A $50 billion spending plan and multi-year rate cases in key states offer a clear growth path for regulated earnings and earnings per share.

Valuation Discount: With a forward P/E of 20.5x—below the wider market—Dominion offers some valuation cushion compared to more expensive, fast-growing infrastructure names, thanks to its stable recurring cash flows.

Bear Case

Heavy Leverage: Net debt-to-EBITDA of 6.07x is one of the highest in the sector, limiting Dominion's flexibility and increasing the risk of a downgrade if earnings disappoint.

Negative Free Cash Flow Yield: Free cash flow yield is deep in the red at –16.6%, lagging the market's 2.36%. Until cash generation improves, investors may be slow to reward the stock with a higher valuation.

Regulatory Headwinds: Delays or setbacks in rate cases, or lower allowed returns, could hit earnings—especially if inflation-linked adjustments are dialed back.

Interest-Rate Environment: If rates rise, utility dividends lose some of their appeal compared to bonds. That could keep a lid on sector valuations.

On Our Radar

Q2 2025 Earnings Call: August 1, 2025: Second-quarter results and updated outlook will be discussed at 10 a.m. ET. Investors should watch for operating EPS, spending on big projects, and renewable pipeline updates.

Virginia Rate Case Decision: Due Q3–Q4 2025: The Virginia regulator will decide on Dominion’s latest rate request—a key swing factor for future profits and allowed returns.

SC PSC Electric Rate Review: Late 2025: South Carolina’s regulator will review electric rates, which could affect Dominion’s returns and capital recovery.

FERC Pipeline Approvals: Second half of 2025: The FERC will rule on pipeline and transmission upgrades, shaping the economics of Dominion’s contracted generation and gas supply business.

Investment Conclusion

Dominion Energy is a classic utility play: steady, regulated cash flows, a reliable dividend of nearly 5%, and exposure to America’s clean energy build-out via its massive capital program. On the flip side, high debt, negative free cash flow, and regulatory uncertainty put a ceiling on upside.

Long-term, income-oriented investors may find Dominion’s below-market valuation and sizable yield appealing—especially if the company can keep its spending on track and make meaningful progress on paying down debt. Conservative investors might choose to wait for clearer signs of cash flow improvement or deleveraging before jumping in. For those after steady income with a potential for modest growth, Dominion could be an attractive buy on any pullback. Meanwhile, investors prioritizing rapid growth or a rock-solid balance sheet may want to look to peers with less leverage and stronger cash generation.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-07-21 17:01:37.093429

China weaponizes capitalism against free-market nations. Under the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), China is not merely a country with different geopolitical goals and economic practices but rather the proponent of an economic model that is fundamentally incompatible with the market-based functioning of the global economy. A former director for China on the U.S. National Security Council staff calls it “brute force economics.” While most nations respect a basic set of rules that promotes fair competition, Beijing leverages a wide range of non-market practices to dominate supply chains, create resource dependencies, undermine foreign rivals, concentrate economic power, and destabilize emerging economies. This strategy is fundamentally parasitic, relying on the readiness of others to play by the rules even as China breaks them.

China relies so heavily on exports because creating a consumer-oriented domestic economy would risk empowering citizens at the expense of the ruling party. Yet reliance on exports creates a paradox: China depends upon the very same foreign markets it victimizes to serve as consumers of its chronically excessive production. In this instance, the parasite cannot afford to kill off its host. The United States is China’s largest export market by a substantial margin. Thus, the United States and other market-based economies have the power to push back against Beijing’s manipulation — if we are disciplined enough to use it. We can confront China with the unpleasant choice of accepting certain basic rules or losing access to our markets.

China’s non-market practices, including monopolization, price manipulation, subsidies, export dumping, IP theft, and knowledge transfers, affect industries and supply chains throughout the global economy. This report focuses on the supply chain for one critical technology — advanced batteries — to illustrate the nature of Beijing’s misconduct and identify ways to overcome it. The report is intended as a template for addressing America’s economic security vulnerabilities more broadly, especially with regard to supply chains. If we cannot access the raw materials and components that we need to drive our economy, our adversaries will be able to defeat us by simply withholding those indispensable inputs.

Advanced batteries are increasingly essential to goods ranging from cars, cellphones, and drones to factories and electrical grids. The market for advanced, high-energy batteries is growing rapidly, with breakthroughs in battery technology likely to expand usage to new fields of activity. The production of batteries depends, in turn, on a host of critical minerals — lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, manganese, and graphite — whose extraction and processing are mainly under Chinese control. The Trump administration moved quickly to implement policies that encourage U.S. production of these minerals, but there is a need for countermeasures up and down the supply chain, jointly implemented with free-market partners.

Even though Western scientists pioneered the lithium-ion technology that animates advanced batteries, Chinese battery makers lead the industry, while Beijing’s control of the supply chain enables it to sharply limit foreign competition. This report examines the current state of battery technology and the upstream, midstream, and downstream segments of the battery supply chain. It documents the extent of Chinese control of each segment while examining China’s non-market practices to show how they have cemented Chinese control and constrain its competitors. The report also looks at the efforts of the United States and other free-market nations to diversify advanced battery supply chains and examines potential future innovations that may disrupt market incumbents. Most critically, the report will provide a series of concrete recommendations to push back against China’s manipulations and chokeholds and reassert American leadership in the advanced battery market.

China has already demonstrated a willingness to weaponize supply chains against the United States, constraining exports of graphite and proposing a wide-ranging ban on the export of technology related to batteries and lithium processing. China has also targeted core U.S. allies, like Japan and Australia, while reportedly threatening South Korea with sanctions if it exports its own critical minerals to the United States. China also uses economic leverage to pressure countries to adopt diplomatic positions similar to its own. But this is only the beginning. As tensions with China rise, U.S. economic vulnerabilities across supply chains represent a matter of pressing national security.

To combat this manipulation of global trade by China and other adversaries, we need to develop new, more resilient, and diversified global supply lines. The success of this effort will depend greatly on the United States’ ability to forge a coalition of free-market economies prepared to challenge China’s manipulative conduct. Key partners will include Japan and South Korea (on scaling and technology), Australia, Canada, Argentina, and Chile (on mining and refining), and Mexico (on assembly and co-production). In the upstream segment of the supply chain, Washington and its partners need to break the Chinese stranglehold on both raw and processed critical minerals. There is also a need to stabilize the price of critical minerals, which Beijing manipulates to undermine potential competitors. In addition, Western companies and countries must prioritize greater investment in breakthrough battery technologies that have the potential to disrupt China’s dominant positioning across the supply chain. Finally, there needs to be a concerted effort to promote and weaponize the use of transparency across the supply chain, attacking China’s dependency on stealth and opacity to protect itself from scrutiny.

Despite China’s control of the battery supply chain, this is a time of great vulnerability for Beijing, while the United States and its core allies remain strong. Global recognition is growing that China has been unfairly stacking the economic deck in its favor over the past two decades. It is time for new guardrails, muscular statecraft, and a unified international response to non-market manipulation. Building critical supply chains that are independent of China’s coercive economic practices can help unleash a wave of cooperation among free-market nations that will lift up both established allies and emerging market partners and turn the tide against China’s parasitic economic model.

While humans have used machines to harness power for centuries — windmills have been in use for a thousand years and waterwheels are twice as old — the ability to store power for future use is a relatively recent innovation. Batteries, which allow for (1) stored and (2) mobile energy, are among the most important inventions of the modern era.

The first batteries, sometimes called Leyden jars, were invented in the 18th century but were little more than electrical capacitors — devices that could store high-voltage power but would discharge the power all at once. Benjamin Franklin was apparently the first person to refer to this as a “battery.” Franklin linked multiple Leyden jars together to increase their power and described them with the military term “battery,” meaning a powerful grouping of artillery cannons.

The pivotal innovation in battery technology was the development of a storage system that could hold electricity and discharge it slowly over time and upon demand. Alessandro Volta developed a copper and zinc battery in 1800, separating the two metals with layers of a brine-soaked cloth. The brine solution acted as the first electrolyte, and these “voltaic piles,” as they were known, allowed the first continuous and stable discharge of stored electricity.

Modest improvements in design occurred over the next 50 years, with a major breakthrough in 1859 when Gaston Planté invented a rechargeable lead-acid battery. This battery used two different types of lead for the anode and cathode (positively and negatively charged electrodes), both of which were suspended in a sulfuric acid electrolyte. For the first time, the charge of the battery could be restored once the initial charge was spent. During the discharge phase, anodes sent extra electrons to the cathodes. During the charging phase, electrons were forced back the other way.

Lead batteries are still in use today, particularly where the amount of electricity needed is limited and weight is not a factor. Most nonelectric cars have lead batteries, for instance, which are continuously recharged by the alternator when the engine is running. They are excellent at discharging the brief, large electrical current needed for starting an internal combustion engine but lose their charge quickly. As electrical innovations advanced, large and heavy lead batteries became impractical.

Zinc-based alkaline batteries were developed in the 1950s, allowing major reductions in battery size and weight that propelled massive innovations in electronics — handheld electrical devices, like remote controls and radios, could now be mobile and commonplace. Zinc-alkaline batteries are the common ones we all know today, often scattered at the back of the junk drawer in our kitchens. These batteries are small and relatively cheap but generally non-rechargeable — providing limited utility for devices designed to be used often.

To unlock the communications revolution, batteries needed to be small, lightweight, long-lasting, and reusable thousands of times. Opening up the back of a cellphone to put in new AAA batteries every day is simply not feasible.

The invention of lithium-ion batteries in the 1970s and 1980s met the need for endurance and reusability, fundamentally changing the technological potential of electronics. Lithium — a lightweight metal with an easily removable electron — was discovered to be ideal for electronic applications. Developed (in part) by an American scientist with what may be the most modest name in the history of science — John Goodenough — the new lithium-ion battery used lithium-cobalt for the cathode and graphite for the anode, a chemistry that is still used today. For his work, Goodenough went on to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

Not considering the cobalt- and graphite-based battery good enough, Goodenough also invented a battery that used the simpler elements of iron and phosphorus along with lithium to create what became known as a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery (from the chemical name, LiFePO4). Goodenough’s LFP battery was briefly commercialized in the United States, but complications from a recall during the rollout caused the American company that was championing the technology to go bankrupt. A Chinese company swept in to acquire the intellectual property, a story told below.

Small, powerful lithium-ion batteries transformed the computer industry in the 1980s and ’90s with the commercialization of the laptop. In the 2000s, lithium-ion batteries allowed for the widespread adoption of cellphones. By the 2010s lithium-based batteries became so powerful that they could power cars, drones, buses, and trucks. Large-scale lithium batteries now back up homes, factories, and electrical grids — evening out demand, preventing blackouts, and adding greater stability to our power systems.

Over the past five years, there has also been a rise in military applications for battery-based systems. Batteries will be one of the bullets of future wars. Already, countless U.S. military systems rely on advanced batteries. As former Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks has stated: “Battery technology and lithium ion batteries specifically, are … essential to thousands of military systems from handheld radios, to unmanned submersibles and to future capabilities like lasers, directed energy weapons and hybrid electric tactical vehicles. A healthy battery supply chain is essential to the military.”

This is hardly surprising — soldiers need power and mobility. As the use of drones, robots, and other unmanned weapons platforms increases in importance, better batteries will mean a better fighting force. The Russia-Ukraine war demonstrates the ways in which drone warfare can transform a battlefield, with an estimated 50,000 battery-reliant attack drones used per month. Securing powerful and reliable American-made advanced batteries represents a critical national security priority. Many of the American military’s small drones and similar devices have dependencies upon China, with batteries being an area of particular weakness. During Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, American forces struggled to meet surging demand for the foreign-made batteries in their radios, night-vision goggles, and small drones. Prominent entrepreneur and investor Marc Andreesen has observed: “90 percent of all drones used by the U.S. military are made in China. We have a drone company that’s been trying to compete with a Chinese company. China is now sanctioning our drone company because the battery is made in China. And so, they have significant leverage not just for the drones but for the entire supply chain.” In a hot war or even a cold one, Beijing could also weaponize the battery dependence of economic sectors ranging from cars to computers, communications, and construction.

As this report demonstrates, China has the current advanced battery market dangerously cornered. It manufactures 80 percent of all lithium-ion batteries, but that dominance is only the tip of the iceberg. Even batteries made in other countries (mainly Japan and South Korea) are deeply and dangerously dependent upon China for the underlying components and critical minerals in battery supply chains. China makes 85 percent of the world’s lithium-based anodes and 70 percent of the cathodes. They also make 90 percent of the materials used in those cathodes (known as “cathode active material”) and 97 percent of the material for anodes. China likewise processes 65 percent of the world’s lithium, more than 85 percent of the world’s battery-grade cobalt, and 95 percent of the world’s battery-grade graphite. Across the battery supply chain, Beijing dominates.

China’s Chokehold Over Key Advanced Battery Inputs

The lithium supply chain has three basic stages: (1) upstream — the extraction and refining of lithium and other critical minerals; (2) midstream — the assembly of battery components, such as cathodes and anodes; and (3) downstream — the assembly of batteries into a finished product. Upstream, Chinese dominance has created particularly severe bottlenecks in lithium refining and graphite production. In the midstream, there are massive chokepoints around China-dominated cathode and anode production. Downstream, China weaponizes markets against other established sellers and new players, holding a near monopoly on the final assembly process. These acute vulnerabilities leave U.S. advanced battery supply chains exceptionally exposed to Chinese influence and manipulations.

China’s Upstream Control

The upstream portion of the supply chain includes both the extraction of lithium and the processing of lithium concentrate into battery-grade lithium carbonate or hydroxide. Minerals such as nickel, graphite, cobalt, and antimony also constitute critical parts of the chain. Australia and Chile are the leading providers of lithium concentrate, producing 51 percent and 26 percent of global output, respectively. Nevertheless, China exercises suffocating control over the upstream segment of the lithium battery supply chain by (1) securing raw material resources through acquisitions of foreign mining concessions or offtake agreements and (2) being the sole at-scale processor of almost all battery-grade lithium.

Extraction and Concentration

Brine

About 60 percent of unprocessed lithium reserves are found in the form of lithium brines, or saline groundwater enriched with lithium metal. After being pumped to the surface, the brine is spread across large evaporation ponds, where sunlight and wind help evaporate the water over several months, concentrating the lithium.

These flats are primarily located in regions like South America’s Lithium Triangle, which includes parts of Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia. China has substantial ownership interests throughout the triangle. In Chile, Chinese companies and state-owned entities own 22 percent of Chile’s lithium mining giant Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM) and 26 percent of the Siete Salares-Talison Lithium Project.

China holds varying levels of ownership stakes in Argentina’s Cauchari Olaroz Project, Tres Quebradas Project, Mariana Project, Laguna Verde Project, and the Sal de Los Angeles Project. Chinese companies have inked agreements to source 20,000 metric tons and 35,000 metric tons of lithium in the future from brine deposits in Argentina and Bolivia, respectively.

Russia’s uranium giant, Rosatom, is also investing in lithium brine extraction projects in the Lithium Triangle, constructing a lithium carbonate plant in the Bolivian Salar de Uyuni salt flat in partnership with China’s Citic Guoan Group. This operation is anticipated to produce 14,000 tons of lithium carbonate per year. Recent reports indicate, however, that Bolivia has suspended its contracts with Chinese and Russian lithium companies.

Active and Planned Lithium Triangle Facilities

Hard Rock

Roughly 30 percent of global lithium reserves are found in hard rock deposits, commonly from spodumene, which is favored for battery-grade lithium hydroxide production. (Lepidolite is another type of lithium ore sourced from hard rock. China’s domestic reserves of lithium are mostly low-quality lepidolite sourced from mica. )

Hard rock ore is mined, crushed into a fine consistency, and then subjected to high-temperature roasting and chemical treatments to extract lithium. Australia is by far the largest source of spodumene, producing more than 3.5 million tons in 2024. But in Australian fiscal year 2022-2023, 98 percent of the country’s production went to China. Pilbara Minerals, a major Australian mining firm, has offtake agreements with Chinese lithium companies, including Ganfeng Lithium, Chengxin Lithium Group, Sichuan Yahua Industrial Group, and Yibin Tianyi Lithium. Ganfeng Lithium controls 50 percent of the Mount Marion Lithium Project, while the enormous Greenbushes mine — the largest operating lithium mine globally — is owned and operated by Talison Lithium, a joint venture whose 51 percent majority owner, Tianqi Lithium Energy Australia, is itself a joint venture that is 51 percent majority-owned by China’s Tianqi Lithium.

Active and Planned Australian Lithium Facilities

Clay

In addition to brine and rock, lithium-rich clay deposits, such as those found in Nevada and throughout Mexico, have the potential to be major future sources of lithium. Yet technical challenges to fully exploit the resources remain. Clay extraction, which uses chemicals to leach lithium from the clay, is still largely developmental in nature and not used at scale.

New extraction processes — such as Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) — are being tested to improve the efficiency of processing for both clay and brine deposits. DLE uses filters, membranes, and chemical solvents to selectively extract lithium without the need for evaporation ponds. It is faster and more environmentally friendly than traditional methods, with the potential to unlock previously uneconomical lithium sources. While U.S. companies are deeply invested in DLE, so are Chinese companies — CATL committed to a $1.4 billion investment in Bolivia to extract lithium using DLE methods, and China claims to have already launched multiple commercial DLE projects. Russia is also pioneering a new direct lithium sorption (DLS) process at its Rosatom lithium carbonate plant in Bolivia, in which wastewater is recycled for future extraction.

Processing

Lithium processing — turning raw lithium products into battery-grade chemicals — is a significant bottleneck dominated by China. Chinese companies account for 65 percent of global lithium processing. The remainder of this capacity is largely located in Chile, with small amounts of processing done in Argentina. However, as mentioned above, the Chilean leader in processing is SQM, a company in which China’s Tianqi Lithium holds a substantial ownership stake and three board seats. There are other signs of Chinese determination to corner lithium processing operations abroad. In February 2025, Ganfeng Lithium began processing lithium at its new Mariana facility in northern Argentina while also planning further refining expansions in Argentina.

China also controls much of the intellectual property necessary to process lithium and is considering export restrictions that may prevent American companies from licensing this technology.

Lithium Battery Supply Chain

Non-Lithium Critical Minerals

While lithium is the most significant mineral needed for current-generation advanced batteries, a number of others are required in many types of batteries — particularly the NMC and NCA chemistries preferred by U.S. manufacturers. Here too, China’s mining, ownership, and processing chokehold present substantial vulnerabilities. As Tesla CEO Elon Musk once pleaded, “Please mine more nickel … Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way.” As shown in the chart titled “China’s Processing Dominance of Non-Lithium Critical Minerals,” China processes the vast bulk of global graphite, nickel, cobalt, and manganese.

Graphite represents a particularly difficult bottleneck, with China processing more than 95 percent of the world’s battery-grade graphite. Diversifying graphite processing away from China is complicated, however. Chinese graphite is cheaper than alternatives, in part because Chinese production is permitted to be highly polluting, discharging particulates into the air and dumping waste into local waters. Chinese graphite processing also relies on highly toxic hydrofluoric acid leaching, which can release of dangerous chlorine or hydrofluoric gas and is not used in Western countries on safety grounds. Replacing Chinese graphite production, therefore, may require the development of new technologies to provide safe and cost-effective alternatives to Chinese methods.

China’s Processing Dominance of Non-Lithium Critical Minerals

Non-Chinese Upstream Alternatives

Lithium is not scarce. Lithium brines can be found in many places, including a potentially massive reserve in Arkansas capable of supplying all of America’s lithium needs for the foreseeable future. There are also large deposits under California’s Salton Sea. The American lithium giant Albemarle already produces 460,000 metric tons of lithium per year in Chile and has received an option that would allow it to increase its quota by 240,000 tons.

More investment is also urgently needed to ramp up alternatives to Chinese lithium processing. With new Trump administration efforts to incentivize critical mineral processing and a U.S. lithium market that is expected to grow roughly 500 percent over the next five years, American and other non-Chinese companies are beginning to invest in domestic processing capacity. The U.S. company Piedmont Lithium is developing a lithium hydroxide processing facility in North Carolina aimed at processing spodumene concentrate from its North American deposits and supplying the U.S. battery market. Albermarle also announced plans to build a lithium hydroxide processing facility in Chester County, South Carolina.

Seeking to explore new options for meeting America’s critical mineral needs for advanced batteries, President Trump issued an executive order in April to incentivize the exploration of offshore underwater mining opportunities, particularly around mineral-rich nodules that are abundant on the deep sea floor. These polymetallic nodules are frequently rich in minerals specifically needed for advanced batteries, including nickel, cobalt, copper, manganese, as well as rare earth elements. Recent research, however, suggests that these nodules may contribute to oceanic — and, perhaps, global — oxygen levels, indicating that environmental caution is needed when considering this source of minerals.

Allied countries are recognizing the urgency of diversifying away from China as well. South Korea pledged $7.1 billion last year in policy financing to support domestic investments and diversify key mineral supply chains. In September 2024, Germany’s AMG Lithium opened its first lithium hydroxide refinery in Bitterfeld-Wolfen.

Limited progress is also being made to pivot battery supply chains away from China for other critical minerals. General Motors, for instance, has entered into a multibillion-dollar agreement with Norwegian company Vianode for the supply of synthetic anode graphite. Similarly, Tesla has agreed to purchase nickel from Talon Metals’ Tamarack mine project in Minnesota, marking its first U.S. supply deal for nickel. These deals remain modest, however, in the face of China’s dominance.

The effort to expand U.S. and allied processing capacity also faces substantial permitting, financing, and scaling obstacles creating unnecessary headwinds. Permitting obstacles alone represent an estimated 40 percent of all delays in mining projects, for instance, and processing projects face similar constraints. That said, permitting is also an essential step — protecting American communities from the pollution and safety hazards that citizens in China frequently face. The goal should not be to eliminate those safeguards but rather to reduce needless obstacles and accelerate the process.

As Ford Motor Company noted in a letter to the U.S. Department of the Interior that the “lengthy, costly and inefficient permitting process” makes it difficult for American businesses to invest in extraction and processing projects. The Trump administration recognizes the challenge, and on March 20, the president signed an executive order, “Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production,” seeking to bolster domestic mining and processing capacity. As the executive order states: “Transportation, infrastructure, defense capabilities, and the next generation of technology rely upon a secure, predictable, and affordable supply of minerals … Our national and economic security are now acutely threatened by our reliance upon hostile foreign powers’ mineral production. It is imperative for our national security that the United States take immediate action to facilitate domestic mineral production to the maximum possible extent.” The order sets out an ambitious plan to unlock public and private capital for new projects while reducing the regulations and red tape impeding current ones. It also sets out a pathway for government offtake agreements, use of public land for mining, purchasing raw material feedstock for domestic refining, and exploring the repurposing of prior mining waste for new critical mineral processing. These are all positive steps. What remains to be seen is whether such efforts can overcome obstacles that include high energy requirements for mining projects and potential resistance from community groups.

China’s Midstream Control

The assembly of battery components, especially cathodes and anodes, constitutes the midstream sector of the supply chain. Here, too, Chinese dominance represents a massive bottleneck for non-Chinese battery manufacturers and end-user companies. China produces more than 70 percent of the world’s supply of cathodes and 85 percent of the anodes. Chinese companies also produce almost 90 percent of cathode active material — the key building block of cathode manufacturing — and more than 97 percent of anode active material, often using raw materials (such as refined graphite) that come from China in the first place.

The high input costs involved with cathode production tighten the bottleneck further. Cathodes frequently depend on metals that are expensive to mine, refine, and process. In lithium-ion batteries, cathode materials like nickel, cobalt, and lithium can account for roughly half of the total battery cost. In comparison, anode materials like graphite are less expensive, typically representing around 10 percent of the total battery cost.

To preserve its dominant midstream position, China seeks to limit the proliferation of cathode production technologies. In January 2025, China’s Ministry of Commerce proposed new export restrictions targeting advanced LFP cathode production technologies. These proposed measures would require Chinese firms to obtain licenses before exporting technologies used to produce the most advanced versions of LFP and lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode materials.

Despite costing less than cathodes, anode production is also a major bottleneck given China’s stranglehold on global graphite production. China accounts for roughly 95 percent of battery-grade graphite. Furthermore, in December 2024, China implemented export restrictions on certain graphite products, including flake graphite and spherical graphite, to the United States. In response, U.S. graphite miners have asked the government to impose a 920 percent tariff on Chinese graphite imports to mitigate the impact of China’s export controls.

China’s Dominance of Battery Component and Active Material Production

Non-Chinese Midstream Alternatives

Historically, the United States has lacked large-scale facilities for producing cathodes and anodes, resulting in an inchoate industry that remains vulnerable to Chinese market manipulations. Recognizing this gap, the U.S. Department of Energy allocated $2.8 billion under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to support battery material processing, component manufacturing, and recycling projects. This money has been distributed among 20 companies across 12 states to proliferate the processing of raw materials and manufacturing of battery components. Additionally, the U.S. government has awarded a conditional loan of $755 million to Novonix, an Australian company, to build a synthetic graphite plant in Tennessee.

Midstream alternatives also include novel approaches to battery recycling — Ascend Elements received $480 million to produce lithium-ion battery cathode materials from recycled battery feedstock. Rather than merely focusing on environmental concerns, recycling efforts are a key way to break dependency on Chinese raw materials, as former batteries can be ground into a material called “black mass,” from which highly reusable minerals can be returned to the supply chain without requiring new, Chinese-based inputs. Like battery and mineral technology in general, China already maintains a large head start with respect to battery recycling techniques and supply chains.

EV Battery Market Share

China’s Downstream Control

Downstream, China controls approximately 77 percent of the world’s battery pack assembly, which entails the integration of battery cells into packs for use in EVs, energy storage systems, and other applications. In terms of power output, Chinese firms shipped batteries with 1,215 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of capacity in 2024 out of a global total of 1,545 GWh. With regard to EV batteries specifically, Chinese firms have a 63.5 percent global market share, with just two Chinese firms, CATL and BYD, controlling more than a 52 percent share between them. South Korean firms, including LG and Samsung, have a 23.1 percent share, and Japan’s Panasonic has a 6.4 percent share. What’s more, South Korean and Japanese producers remain heavily reliant on Chinese cathode and anode inputs since those two countries accounted for only 9 percent and 3 percent of global cathode active material production, respectively.

China’s Share of Global Production in Terms of Battery Capacity

Chinese firms send abroad much of what they produce. China’s lithium-powered battery exports surpassed $60 billion in 2024. Exports to the United States hit an all-time high of nearly $2 billion in monthly sales in December 2024. In Africa, China has been fueling a boom in lithium-ion battery usage, with lithium-based batteries now capturing approximately 53 percent of Africa’s battery market. Europe, meanwhile, is China’s largest market for EVs, with almost 40 percent of China’s 2023 EV exports directed to the European Union and another 15 percent going to non-EU European nations. Volvo, the Swedish automaker now owned by China’s Geely, sold 175,000 EVs in 2024, relying upon Chinese advanced batteries made by CATL.

Despite rising trade barriers in Europe and elsewhere, Chinese firms are responding by making strategic investments in tariff-exempt markets. Chinese battery companies are increasingly establishing factories within the European Union to circumvent tariffs and sustain demand. Notable investments include major facilities in Hungary, Spain, and Germany by companies such as CATL and EVE Energy. In Debrecen, Hungary, CATL announced a 7.34 billion euro investment in August 2022 to build a 100 GWh battery plant, marking its largest overseas venture to date. Similarly, EVE Energy committed more than $1 billion in May 2023 to construct a battery plant also located in Debrecen, aiming to produce large cylindrical batteries.

Chinese companies, especially CATL, are also making huge strides in non-EV applications, such as energy storage systems (ESS). In 2024, the ESS sector boomed — global energy storage cell shipments reached 334 GWh, marking a 60 percent year-over-year increase. China led this boom, with CATL and EVE Energy holding a combined 55 percent global market share. Other Chinese companies like CALB and BYD also shipped over 10GWh each in 2024.

How China Corners the Battery Supply Chain

Non-Chinese Downstream Alternatives

The United States has begun to invest in downstream production facilities. By the end of 2024, manufacturers had announced nearly $200 billion in investments dedicated to EV and battery manufacturing facilities — including General Motors’ partnership with LG Energy Solution through their Ultium Cells joint venture. Ultium Cells’ Ohio facility, a 2.8 million-square-foot plant located in Warren, commenced initial battery cell production in August 2022 and currently employs 1,700 people. In December 2024, the plant celebrated the production of its 100 millionth cell. Ultium Cells sources its cathode active materials from POSCO Future, a South Korean manufacturer, and provides its battery cells to General Motors.

Similarly, Toyota and Samsung SDI have committed significant funds to U.S. battery manufacturing projects. While these projects may marginally dilute China’s control over the advanced battery market, they do not necessarily address overwhelming supply chain dependencies in the upstream and midstream segments. While Samsung sources its cathodes from South Korea’s POSCO, Samsung sources anode materials from China’s BTR New Material Group.

Northvolt

Northvolt, once a beacon of Europe’s ambition to lead the world in battery manufacturing, now represents a key warning for aspiring non-Chinese battery manufacturers. A Swedish battery manufacturer founded in 2015, Northvolt aimed to establish Europe’s independence in lithium-ion battery production for electric vehicles. The company secured substantial investments, raising over $15 billion from prominent backers such as Volkswagen, Goldman Sachs, and BMW. Despite these financial advantages, Northvolt struggled with scaling up production to meet high-quality standards and volume targets, leading to major contract cancelations and delayed deliveries. These setbacks led to significant strain, culminating in Northvolt filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States in November 2024.

“When a predator, unbound by the rules followed by its competitors, is allowed to operate in a free market, that market is no longer truly free.”

— Former Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), referring to China.

At the core of China’s quest to dominate the advanced battery market is a set of practices designed to allow China to undercut its competitors and create market distortions that reinforce its control. China’s ability to play both sides — reaping the benefits of market participants while rejecting market constraints — gives it fundamental but unfair advantages that are ultimately parasitic in nature. Where Western stakeholders seek to develop supply chains via free-market practices that accurately reflect the value of lithium and other minerals critical to key industries like the automotive sector, China seeks to monopolize vertically integrated supply chains that enable it to manipulate prices. The blurred line between public and private industry helps make this possible. Beijing also relies on illicit trade practices like IP theft and dumping to bludgeon competitors out of the market. This section identifies key mechanisms by which China distorts the advanced battery and critical mineral supply chains, applying its own state-driven rules of global trade to sustain systemically destructive advantages over market economies.

Subsidies

In 2009, the CCP began a program of massive subsidies for EVs and batteries with a cumulative value that would reach more than $230 billion by the end of 2023. Chinese subsidies dwarf their U.S. counterparts, such as the $2.4 billion for EVs that President Barack Obama signed into law in 2009 and the roughly $5 billion in federal tax credits issued to EV purchasers between 2011 and 2017. This difference in scale is critical. When subsidies, like those in China, reach the point where profitability is no longer a relevant consideration for an enterprise, companies are capable of leveraging a degree of power that can push out profit-based competitors and distort the efficient functioning of markets, leading to outsized economic power and monopolies. As explained by Scott Kennedy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies: “Despite the extensive government support and expansion of sales, very few Chinese EV producers and battery makers are profitable. In a well-functioning market economy, firms would more carefully gauge their investment in new capacity, and the emergence of such a sharp gap between supply and demand would likely result in industry consolidation, with poorly performing companies leaving the market entirely. In this context, given Chinese EV makers’ scale and reach, it is difficult for other countries’ producers who face tighter budget constraints to effectively compete.”

Comparison of EV and Battery Subsidies

On the manufacturing side, Beijing’s subsidies include tax exemptions, manufacturing grants, and low-interest loans aimed at reducing production costs, thereby increasing output. Consumer subsidies focus on direct cash rebates, registration fee waivers, and support for state and local electric fleet adoption, making EVs more affordable and accessible for buyers. These subsidies fundamentally contribute to overproduction as domestic manufacturers seek to take advantage of government incentives absent market demand signals. As a result, Chinese EVs on the market in third countries are frequently being sold at “artificially low” prices that are “distorting” markets, according to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Fundamentally concerned with profit and fiduciary obligations to their shareholders, Western manufacturers cannot compete effectively for market share with Chinese competitors — even in their home markets. While not all subsidies are inherently problematic, the scale of Beijing’s subsidies and the goal of encouraging dependence on Chinese supply chains pose a threat to the proper functioning of markets and, ultimately, national security.

Subsidy Types

Manufacturer Subsidies:

Tax Exemptions

Manufacturing Grants

Low-Interest Loans

Development and Manufacturing Prizes

Sales Rewards

Consumer Subsidies:

Direct Cash Rebates

Registration Fee Waivers

State and Local Electric Fleet Adoption

There are some indications that Beijing recognizes the risk it assumes by propping up an entire industry. In January 2024, Chinese Vice Minister of Industry and Information Technology Xin Guobin said that there was “insufficient” external consumer demand in the EV industry and that Beijing would take “forceful measures” to address “blind” construction of new EV projects. Yet overproduction continues to occur throughout the Chinese economy as the CCP uses its export machine to artificially boost growth numbers for its flagging economy. This excess capacity directly contributes to dumping into export markets at heavily discounted prices, damaging international competitors or pushing them out of the market altogether. (See Dumping section.)

Monopolies

China has given the green light for Chinese companies to monopolize key inputs into the advanced battery supply chain across all mining, processing, component, and end-use stages. The concentration of economic power from these monopolies (or, for finance nerds, these “monopsonies” ) allows China to control competitors’ access to key inputs and set prices in ways that harm non-Chinese entrants into the market.

China, for instance, collectively controls 95 percent of the world’s battery-grade graphite, monopolizing the supply of a mineral essential for the vast majority of battery anodes. In 2023, China produced approximately 1.23 million metric tons of graphite, marking a 50 percent increase from 2021. Nevertheless, China introduced export restrictions on graphite products in late 2023 and again in 2024, allowing Beijing to manipulate global markets by tightening supply. The combination of these two actions led to a spike in graphite prices. Foreign companies frequently find themselves unable to compete on equal footing due to Chinese control over such inputs, adding to the challenge of compensating for the economies of scale that monopoly conditions provide to Chinese companies.

Despite a seeming proliferation of Chinese companies involved in mining and processing critical minerals, manufacturing components, and building batteries and cars, these firms are not true market competitors. Instead, they are better viewed as numerous subsidiaries of “CCP, Inc.” China lacks a clear division between the private and public sectors, and the Chinese Communist Party directs the actions of these private organizations to an extent that would be unlawful on antitrust grounds in any market economy. As a result, Beijing can align the private sector players into a cartel that wields monopoly power against foreign rivals.

Vertical Integration

Within Chinese battery supply chains, single companies often act as supplier, refiner, component assembler, and final manufacturer. Pushed forward by muscular state-led industrial policy and blurred lines between the private and public sectors, Chinese companies can collectively consolidate different portions of the supply chain in ways that market players frequently cannot because of regulatory or economic constraints. This gives those companies outsized influence against competitors and, conversely, insulation against market pressures to which competitors are subject. As the line between the state and private sector is blurred, it also gives the industrial ecosystem that codevelops among Chinese industrial champions an ability to boost scale in ways that market players cannot replicate.

BYD’s Vertical Integration

As one example of this, China’s BYD controls its own supply chain from mineral extraction to complete vehicle assembly. In January 2022, BYD secured a contract with Chile’s Ministry of Mining that grants BYD the rights to extract up to 80,000 metric tons of lithium over a 20-year period. Independently, BYD has set up processing facilities in Guangxi, China, to refine spodumene into lithium carbonate, as well as making other cathode active materials, such as iron phosphate. BYD also controls all facets of battery assembly — BYD assembles its Blade Batteries at its cornerstone Chongquing factory before putting them into cars in BYD factories in China, the United States, Brazil, Thailand, Indonesia, Canada, and Uzbekistan. This control, including extraction, straight-through processing, componentry production, assembly, and distribution, insulates BYD from chokepoints in its supply chain, creating a level of integration that market players would have difficulty replicating. (Tesla is largely an exception in this regard. )

Market economies thrive on decentralization, competition, and open access to resources — factors that are threatened by aggressive vertical integration when combined with monopolies. Moreover, the private sector’s focus on returns in market economies leads to natural fragmentation, while China’s prioritization of national economic growth and the state’s incentivization of production over profits contributes to companies seeking to expand into adjacent industries.

This difference in economic structure leads to systemic advantages for China. By controlling all supply chain inputs, BYD has distinct advantages over competitors who must secure sufficient inputs from limited suppliers under volatile pricing conditions. Across the supply chain, one often sees minerals extracted at Chinese mines, processed at Chinese facilities, transported by Chinese rail to Chinese ships at Chinese-operated docks, sent to Chinese battery manufacturers, and then installed in Chinese cars. When combined with Beijing’s other non-market manipulations, this level of control makes competition from non-Chinese companies nearly impossible.

Price Manipulation

Given the degree of monopoly power that China possesses, it is not surprising that China can, and does, manipulate prices in ways that protect domestic industry champions while strategically boxing out market competitors. Indeed, China has weaponized price volatility both because of its monopoly power and to sustain its monopoly power.

China’s Tsingshan Holding Group is one of the world’s largest nickel producers, with massive factories in Indonesia that process the local nickel ore into minerals suitable for batteries and stainless steel. In 2019, Indonesia — the world’s largest nickel-producing country — instituted a ban on the export of unprocessed nickel ore and put it into effect just a month after Indonesian President Joko Widodo had met with the CEO of Tsingshan and the heads of Chinese companies Huayou Cobalt and CATL — the world’s largest cobalt and battery manufacturing firms, respectively. A source indicated that the Chinese delegation had “lobbied very intensely [for Indonesia] to completely ban exports.” Such a ban would be a boon to China, as Chinese companies control roughly 75 percent of Indonesia’s nickel refining capacity. Since Tsingshan processed its ore within Indonesia, the ban affected only non-Chinese competitors that lacked Indonesian refining capacity. Thus, Tsingshan could continue to supply China’s voracious battery and steel industries. Yet foreign battery and steelmakers would feel the pinch of a substantially restricted supply of nickel ore.

In theory, international stockpiles — most notably, the large nickel inventory at the London Metals Exchange (LME) — are supposed to cushion the impact of supply disruptions. Curiously, however, on the eve of the Indonesian announcement of the ban, an unknown party had begun buying up nickel inventory from the LME at a furious pace. The purchases were made using over-the-counter (OTC) trades that hid the identity of the purchaser from the LME. This $1.8 billion buying spree took 25,000 tons of nickel off the market immediately — the largest withdrawal in the four-decade history of nickel at the LME — and snapped up futures on another 75,000 tons. Once the dust had settled, the primary nickel purchaser came forward — Tsingshan Holding Group. Estimates are they may have bought as much as 80 percent of the haul.

As soon as the 2019 Indonesian nickel ore ban went into effect, Tsingshan’s competitors took a massive hit. Outokumpu, a Finnish steel producer heavily reliant on nickel, saw earnings drop by nearly 50 percent because of the high prices. Then Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) saw the market manipulations and lamented: “Another near-monopoly is born, thanks to [China’s] anti-competitive tactics.”

It would not be the last time Tsingshan substantially altered nickel prices via the LME. In 2022, large Tsingshan OTC purchases led nickel prices to surge nearly 400 percent in three days, causing the LME to take the unprecedented step of canceling $12 billion worth of trades.

China’s control of lithium supplies allows Beijing even greater power to set prices than in the case of nickel. The pricing mechanism for lithium markets is deeply flawed because global prices for both the underlying commodity and derivative futures depend on prices set by China, not market transactions.

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, for instance, bases its price for lithium derivatives on Chinese pricing as relayed by the Fastmarket pricing feed. LME also relies on prices relayed by Fastmarket. Those Fastmarket prices reflect pricing information that Beijing directs state-controlled Chinese mining, shipping, and processing companies to share. The prices are not based on any underlying contracts — all of which remain confidential and opaque regarding actual price. As a result, China can set global lithium prices by fiat, and non-Chinese companies have no visibility into the pricing mechanisms.

Lithium prices have fluctuated wildly over the past decade, tracing a path that follows Chinese interests. When demand for lithium batteries spiked in 2021 due to subsidies introduced by the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, supply became scarce. Chinese producers Ganfeng Lithium and Tianqi Lithium reduced their supply of processed battery-grade lithium and prioritized deliveries to Chinese battery manufacturers with long-term contracts like BYD and CATL. In the months that followed, the price of lithium carbonate rose tenfold from $7,000 per metric ton in January 2021 to over $75,000 per metric ton by the fourth quarter of 2022, harming U.S. battery makers.

On the flip side, low prices and China-driven volatility undermine non-Chinese efforts to raise funds for capital-intensive processing facilities that would increase the supply of processed lithium and dilute Beijing’s control. After hitting record highs that boosted Chinese automakers at the expense of rivals, Chinese firms then drove lithium prices to record lows, with battery manufacturers like CATL starting up mining operations to “dramatically” reduce the price of lithium, according to CATL founder Robin Zeng. This has squeezed non-Chinese lithium producers. According to American mining giant, Albemarle, as of May 2025, around 40 percent of all global lithium projects are at or below the threshold for profitability at current prices, with one-third of the global capacity having been pulled offline. Chris Ellison, the managing director of western Australian mining company Mineral Resources, suggests the situation is even worse, stating, “no one is making money in this market … let’s be really, really clear on that, there’s no lithium companies making money.” The resulting delays, cancellations, and idling of unprofitable projects is occurring at the very time that new projects should be ramping up to address a lithium supply that will need to double by 2030 to meet anticipated demand, according to Albemarle.

Price Volatility in Global Cobalt, Lithium, and Nickel Markets (2015-2024)

The uncertain returns from a market with low or unstable lithium prices render such investments less attractive, particularly since processing facilities can take as long as a decade to build. In 2018, for instance, Canadian firm Nemaska Lithium announced plans to operate the largest spodumene deposit in North America, attracting around $1 billion from funders like SoftBank and Investissement Québec. Shortly thereafter, global lithium prices fell by more than 60 percent. This price collapse heavily affected Nemaska’s financial projections, and the project closed. Absent an independent, non-Chinese pricing mechanism for lithium, China can comfortably drive competitors out of the market at will.

Dumping

China is making way too much of everything. This is particularly true of sectors that the government is prioritizing, like EVs and batteries. This year, China is likely to make more than twice the total global demand for EVs last year. For 2025, Chinese sources indicate that the country is on pace to manufacture more than 36 million new EVs in 2025 despite only 17 million EVs being sold worldwide last year and anticipated global demand of just 20 million electric cars in 2025. Western sources suggest 2025 production may reach only 25 million — still far more than global demand.

This overproduction was not merely a market quirk created by overzealous manufacturers but rather an anticipated consequence of intentional government policy. As early as 2021, Chinese analysts were anticipating massive overproduction from China’s 14th Five-Year Plan, which mandated the production of seven times more EVs than expected domestic demand for 2025, as projected by the Ministry of Public Security.

This wild distortion of market dynamics derives from China’s artificial approach to manufacturing growth. In China, GDP growth figures are not simply reflections of past economic activity. Rather, Beijing announces growth targets a year in advance and the municipal governments establish parameters and incentives that ensure those targets are met. Chinese companies adjust their behavior accordingly.

For 2024, the GDP growth target was set at 5 percent. (China has also announced a target of “around 5 percent” for 2025.) For Chinese companies, that means that the government is expecting them to produce an average of 5 percent more goods than the previous year, irrespective of demand. By delinking production objectives (that is, Chinese supply) from actual demand and putting pressure on Chinese producers to always be supplying more, China ends up making too much of just about everything, depressing global prices.

Beijing cannot absorb this oversupply at home because it has kept its own consumer market undeveloped by design. As the former present of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China has explained: “Overcapacity is the result of domestic policy choices that have led to the rapid, often economically nonviable, expansion of investment and production. This cycle has been sustained by China’s local governments, which have long been incentivized to expand investment and production over all else. These incentives have been compounded by fears of the widespread unemployment that might result from taking production offline.” Building a true consumer economy would require giving consumers more economic power and would necessitate shifting power away from the CCP — a trade that party leaders are unwilling to make.

The combination of China’s weak domestic consumer demand and state-mandated oversupply of goods means that enormous amounts of goods must be sent overseas, flooding international markets with cheap products — sometimes even at prices that are below the production cost, a practice known as “dumping.” By selling at or below cost, Chinese companies often drive local producers outside China out of business, creating dependence on Chinese imports and potentially inflicting long-term damage on local economies. Many scholars refer to the sharp increase in Chinese imports to the United States in the early 2000s as the “China Shock” and hold it responsible for the majority of jobs lost in that period in the U.S. manufacturing sector.

Around the world, countries have opened investigations into Chinese dumping practices and are trying to construct trade barriers to combat it. This pushback extends well beyond cars and batteries to steel, aluminum, solar panels, shipbuilding, cement, paper, glass, fertilizers, chemicals, footwear, frozen warmwater shrimp, and more. The United States, the European Union, India, Argentina, Turkey, Mexico, Australia, Canada, Japan, and South Korea have all launched investigations. Even countries friendly to China, such as Brazil, Vietnam, and South Africa, are pushing back. From 1995 to 2022, China was the subject of 1,565 anti-dumping investigations, nearly one-quarter of all such investigations initiated by WTO members. That represents more than three times the number of investigations initiated against the second-most investigated country, South Korea. In 2024, China accounted for nearly half of all of the global dumping investigations. Facing artificially low prices, importing nations have ample reason to put tariffs on Chinese goods, forcing their prices up to economically sustainable levels.

Knowledge Transfer

China has used its economic weight to extract technology and intellectual property from Western companies, avoiding costly and time-consuming investments in research and development. Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” initiative, which seeks to reduce dependence on foreign manufacturers by developing domestic alternatives, is a major driver of this practice — pushing Chinese companies to coopt foreign tech by both legal and illegal means.

As the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) has put it, “China’s regime of technology regulations forced U.S. companies seeking to license technologies to Chinese entities to do so on non-market-based terms that favor Chinese recipients.” USTR also concluded that China uses the acquired technology to develop new domestic champions that drive out Western competition. The Trump administration’s America First Investment Policy explains the practice:

Certain foreign adversaries, including the People’s Republic of China (PRC), systematically direct and facilitate investment in United States companies and assets to obtain cutting-edge technologies, intellectual property, and leverage in strategic industries. The PRC pursues these strategies in diverse ways, both visible and concealed, and often through partner companies or investment funds in third countries.

Often, foreign companies seeking to do business in China have been explicitly or tacitly required to form joint ventures with local partners. On the surface, this arrangement appeared mutually beneficial: Foreign firms gained access to local expertise to navigate China’s notoriously complex market and byzantine bureaucracy, while China’s economy received a boost and its firms received a share of the profits. In practice, these joint ventures have largely served as a conduit for transferring proprietary knowledge and technology from foreign companies to domestic firms.

With expertise and intellectual property acquired from foreign firms, Chinese companies often develop independent production capabilities, eventually dominating the domestic — and, in many cases, international — markets, often displacing the very partners from whom they had obtained the technology. The case of wind turbines illustrates this point. Xinjiang Goldwind Science and Technology Co. (Goldwind) is the largest wind turbine supplier in the world. Between 1989 and 2001, Goldwind partnered with three European wind-turbine manufacturers — Bonus Energy A/S, Jacobs Energie GmbH, and Repower Systems AG — all of which transferred their proprietary technology to Goldwind in compliance with Chinese law.

Between 2005 and 2023, China’s total cumulative wind power capacity surged from just 1.26 GW to 474.6 GW, an increase from 2 percent to 45 percent of global capacity. This staggering [DR1] increase in global share was driven by China rapidly seizing the lead in global wind turbine production. Chinese companies contributed 65 percent of total new wind turbine manufacturing in 2023. Goldwind was the leading wind turbine manufacturer that year, producing 16.3 GW of new capacity.

Mandatory technology transfer and related practices may collectively cost foreign competitors upward of $600 billion per year. This is both parasitic and unsustainable, as it undermines the incentives for foreign firms to invest both in China and in R&D out of fear that their proprietary tech will be handed over to competitors without adequate legal recourse or protection.

Intellectual Property Theft

Despite its dominant position across the supply chain, Beijing also resorts to state-sanctioned commercial spying and outright theft to reinforce its advantages. It is impossible to get clear data on how widespread this practice is, but the record of federal prosecutions suggests it may be a well-entrenched practice endorsed by the CCP since “80 percent of all economic espionage prosecutions brought by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) allege conduct that would benefit the Chinese state,” according to DOJ. U.S. companies have also filed more than a thousand lawsuits against Chinese firms alleging IP theft, and of the 224 publicly reported Chinese espionage incidents inside the United States, the majority were aimed at acquiring commercial technology.

The battery supply chain is clearly among the targets of espionage. In June 2024, for instance, an individual pled guilty in U.S. federal court to conspiring to steal trade secrets from Tesla to benefit a China-based business specializing in battery technology for electric vehicles. In 2022, a former Apple engineer pleaded guilty to stealing trade secrets from Apple’s autonomous vehicle project. In 2019, a Chinese scientist pled guilty to stealing IP valued at more than $1 billion from Phillips 66 Petroleum Company relating to next-generation battery and energy storage solutions. The theft sought to benefit China’s state-owned Xiamen Tungsten Co., which focuses on battery-related metals research.

The impact of IP theft goes beyond immediate financial losses for affected companies. It disrupts the incentive structure of a competitive market. Companies that know their intellectual assets may be stolen without repercussion are less likely to invest heavily in breakthrough technologies, less likely to enter otherwise important foreign markets, and less likely to hire potentially beneficial foreign employees. This manipulates the development of a genuinely innovative and competitive global battery industry, creating an uneven playing field in which Chinese firms dominate at the expense of rule-abiding competitors.",https://www.fdd.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Monograph_SupplyChain_FullWidthImage_v01-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-21 18:00:46.197831

Or the gas stations of companies like ExxonMobil, whose scientists warned of climate change risk nearly 50 years ago, then saw the company bury their warnings and promote denial instead.","The deadly Texas floods have receded, leaving lost and shattered lives. U.S. President Donald Trump tells us not to politicize the moment, with spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt calling the floods “an act of God,” meaning no one is responsible. But because the floods and the climate disasters that will follow them make the costs heart-wrenchingly visible, they give us the chance to talk about root causes and the choices we face. If we don’t have these conversations, these teachable moments will quickly fade.

Democratic pushback has focused mostly on cutbacks to the National Weather Service andFederal Emergency Management Agency, leaving critical offices understaffed and undermining the ability to plan. But the pushback has focused less on climate change, even as, the day before the floods, the Republicans paid for massive tax breaks for the wealthiest in part by slashing federal support for wind, solar, battery, electric vehicles,, energy efficiency, and other investments that gave us a chance to join China and Europe in leading the technologies of the future. So we need to talk about the choices presented to us by this tragedy—and all the others that will come.

When Democrats have held power, they’ve raised these issues far too little. No American legislation did more to fight climate change than former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, but the new Republican bill mostly gutted it. And Biden was largely quiet in the face of a succession of epic climate disasters, from the fires that destroyed the Maui town of Lahaina and the Colorado town of Superior, to the North Carolina floods on the eve of the election. He did say Hurricane Ida highlighted the “climate crisis.” But the administration never created a sustained conversation. Former Vice President Kamala Harris also stayed mostly silent, and when climate was raised late in her single presidential debate, she discussed it for only a minute and then moved on. So although the administration addressed the issue in groundbreaking ways, they did far too little to bring it to greater public salience. That led to it receding further in perceived urgency for a public that knows climate change is real but hasn’t made it a priority.

Imagine if Biden, Harris, or other key Democrats had gone to the sites of these disasters and not just offered compassion and government aid, but an honest discussion of our choices. At the least this would have underscored the stakes—and given voters a sense that the Democrats were fighting to address it.

We can mourn the lives lost and communities destroyed, while highlighting both the human costs, and the technologies that offer an alternative.

Consider the campaigns to prevent gun violence. For years, those who wanted common-sense gun rules resisted “politicizing tragedy.” Mass shootings kept happening, but other than those most engaged, not enough people spoke out in their wake, because it felt unseemly. Finally, more started to, including political leaders. They told the stories and drew the connections. As the public began to hear them, support for addressing gun violence increased enough to pass the 2022 bipartisan gun safety bill in the wake of the Uvalde shootings.

Those who recognize that climate change is real and urgent no longer have the bully pulpit of the presidency. Instead, climate information is scrubbed from government sites, including guidance on how to prepare for climate disasters, and scientists are fired for even daring to address the issue. But local and national Democratic leaders and engaged citizen groups can still speak out when disasters hit. We can mourn the lives lost and communities destroyed, while highlighting both the human costs, and the technologies that offer an alternative, with 96% of new global electricity demand being met last year by renewables, as they become more affordable than fossil fuels, complemented by batteries whose cost has dropped 95% in 15 years. We can demand accountability for all the recent cuts and demand that the investments be restored.

We can also use those moments to highlight fossil fuel companies that have bankrolled climate denial. This could mean nonviolent protests at their corporate offices that highlight the recent catastrophes. Or targeting banks that fuel fossil fuel investment. Or the gas stations of companies like ExxonMobil, whose scientists warned of climate change risk nearly 50 years ago, then saw the company bury their warnings and promote denial instead. It also means pressuring media to cover the crisis more robustly, including engaging conservative-leaning podcasters and influencers who shape so much of America’s current understanding, and who have started to question Trump’s immigration raids.

Drawing the links at the times when climate change’s invisible march becomes most manifest isn’t politicizing tragedy. It’s making clear that if we care about the lives that are lost, we need to prevent the tragedies to come.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61185158&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C85%2C0%2C85,N,,2025-07-21 17:01:43.462500

A potential move by a soft drink manufacturer could affect farmers of different crops.

President Donald Trump announced on July 16 through his Truth Social account that he’s “been speaking to Coca-Cola about using REAL Cane Sugar in Coke in the United States, and they have agreed to do so.”

Farms.com has contacted Coca-Cola for comment on this claim.

QTS Data Centers said those methods save more than 48 million gallons of water annually in the operation of each data center.
Ren said Google’s Las Vegas data center uses a lot of water for cooling, while the Reno data center doesn’t use water.
Texas has 363 data centers across the state, according to the Data Center Map, a research tool that tracks data center development.
The state is home to 104 data centers, with 76 in the Des Moines market, according to Data Center Map.","In a rural part of Dane County, a developer wants to build a data center campus with 15 buildings over the next decade.

Texas will serve as the home base for Stargate, a $500 billion effort to build artificial intelligence infrastructure, with 10 data centers under construction and 10 more planned.

In Kansas City, Kansas, developers are looking to build a data center at a defunct power plant.

Data centers are expanding across the U.S. to meet growing demand for artificial intelligence, but their growth also raises thorny questions over resources.

The centers are among the most energy-intensive types of buildings, consuming 10 to 50 times the energy of a commercial office building, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. A 2024 federal report found data centers consumed about 4.4 percent of the nation’s electricity in 2023 and that could nearly triple to 12 percent by 2028.

They can also be water-intensive buildings. For example, Google’s U.S. data centers consumed 12.7 billion liters of fresh water for cooling in 2021, according to the University of California, Riverside. Three years later, the company consumed more than 30 billion liters. UC Riverside estimates that running 20 to 50 ChatGPT queries uses roughly half a liter of fresh water.

Zack Pistora, director of the Sierra Club’s Kansas chapter, said he believes the tech companies behind data centers have a responsibility to work to mitigate the environmental impacts of their developments.

“These are some of the richest companies in America, and maybe across the world,” he said. “To ask them to make sure that residents don’t pay more in terms of their electric or water bills, [or] to do right by choosing the right energy sources to not pollute the community or the planet, we feel isn’t too much to ask.”

Efforts to use less water

In Wisconsin, Virginia-based QTS Data Centers is planning the campus of 15 buildings in the town of Vienna.

Tag Greason, co-CEO, said the company wants to do so using methods that will cut down on water consumption. He said QTS will use a system requiring no-water with a refrigerant or a “closed-loop” system that requires a one-time input of water that is then recycled.

“Depending on what the customer needs, we may want a refrigerant, or we may actually want the closed loop,” Greason said, noting the company already uses that technology at projects in Arizona and Texas.

QTS Data Centers said those methods save more than 48 million gallons of water annually in the operation of each data center.

In the southeastern part of Wisconsin, Microsoft is also working on a data center campus. The company has said most of its Mount Pleasant data center campus will use a new closed-loop system design that will consume zero water for cooling.

Yet cooling data centers without consuming water makes them more energy-intensive, according to Shaolei Ren, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Riverside.

“If you use more energy, there will be more carbon footprint,” he said. “And similarly, you’re going to be increasing the indirect water consumption for generating electricity, because generating electricity uses a lot of water as well.”

He points to the differences in energy efficiency between a pair of Google data centers in Nevada as an example; one in Reno and another in Las Vegas. Ren said Google’s Las Vegas data center uses a lot of water for cooling, while the Reno data center doesn’t use water.

In comparing the sites’ power usage effectiveness, or PUE, he found Reno uses almost twice the energy.

“You can reuse these refrigerants to eliminate the downside water usage, but the problem is you’re going to be increasing the energy consumption,” he said.

Ren added that those tradeoffs pose a difficult choice: reduce freshwater use but accept higher electricity demand — potentially from climate change-causing fossil fuels.

Drawing down energy

In Texas, a new report from an electric grid reliability watchdog group found that “the disorganized integration” of large load customers, like data centers, posed the “largest increased risk” to the state’s electric grid.

Texas has 363 data centers across the state, according to the Data Center Map, a research tool that tracks data center development. And more are on the way in the Lone Star State. According to the Texas Reliability Entity’s report, the region is forecasting “unprecedented load growth” driven by new data centers and artificial intelligence.

“When I saw some of the load patterns for AI data centers, it reminded me of a steel mill,” said David Penney, director of reliability services for the Texas Reliability Entity, during a recent regulatory meeting. “Very fast, very large ramps up and down, which creates issues for operators on the grid. They’ve got to be able to manage those sharp load swings.”

Those projected increases in demand have raised concerns that utilities across the country will look to meet the projected load growth through fossil fuels, like coal or natural gas, rather than renewable energy.

For example, Wisconsin’s largest electric utility recently received approval from regulators to build two new natural gas power plants to support data center and industrial growth, as well as announced plans to delay the closure of a coal-fired power plant by one year.

The Sierra Club has called on the tech companies behind data centers to take a more active role in supporting the clean energy transition, and called on regulators to require new large customers to be transparent about their load projections.

Energy and economics

The Kansas City area is scrambling to attract data centers in both Missouri and Kansas. While neither state is a hotspot for development yet, environmentalists are watching closely as developers circle.

A company called PowerTransitions is looking to build a data center at the site of a defunct power station in Kansas City, Kansas, for instance. The plant shut down coal usage around 10 years ago but kept oil burners at the site, said Ty Gorman, a senior campaign organizing strategist at the Sierra Club’s Kansas chapter.

The data center will need 192 megawatts of power, Gorman said.

“The details of that aren’t approved yet, just the zoning and the sale are approved,” he said. “There’s still a community benefits and power agreement to be hashed out with that data center.”

Because the Kansas City Board of Public Utilities, which serves Kansas City, Kansas, is a municipal utility, rather than an investor-owned utility, Gorman said his hope is that it would look to meet increased electricity demand through clean energy instead of fossil fuel generation.

“Investor-owned utilities have a profit motive to own everything and own the most expensive things they can get approved,” he said. “And BPU does not, so it would seem like the data center would be able to go towards the cheapest option, which would be solar and storage.”

Even so, Gorman also said data centers boosting demand does pose real risks to the clean energy transition and efforts to reduce the impacts of climate change.

“The threat of data centers to a livable planet, I think, is very real, and we’re at a tipping point as far as how we deal with the increased requirements to meet this electric need over the next few years,” he added.

Where water can’t be replaced

The Iowa Geological Survey warns that while data centers don’t pose an immediate risk to the state’s water supply, Iowa needs to more strategically plan for using its groundwater to avoid risks in the future.

The state is home to 104 data centers, with 76 in the Des Moines market, according to Data Center Map.

Microsoft used 68.5 million gallons of water in West Des Moines for its five data center campuses last year, making it the city’s largest water user.

Keith Schilling, state geologist of Iowa and director of the Iowa Geological Survey, said the impacts of data centers on Iowa’s groundwater will vary across the state.

“Our groundwater is not evenly distributed across the state,” he said. “We have areas that can provide a lot of high quality water with minimal impact, and others [where] aquifers might be stressed by these new water demands.”

Schilling said there are shallow aquifers around Des Moines that are recharged by precipitation but are also vulnerable to drought and high nitrate concentrations in rivers.

He said some data centers around the Des Moines area are using deep aquifer water that’s thousands of years old — and it won’t be replaced.

“All water lost to this deep aquifer is lost forever in human terms,” he said. “In other areas where we have shallow, plentiful water — eastern Iowa or the Missouri River alluvium — data centers are perfectly appropriate. That water is readily recharged and turned over, and it can supply much larger quantities of water.”

Schilling hopes communities encouraging data center development will consider the sustainability of their groundwater supply before signing-off on a new large-scale water user.",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/datacenterharvestangela.webp,N,,2025-07-21 19:00:31.442116

A bill the Lafayette Democrat introduced earlier this month with U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, would impose a lifetime ban on lobbying for former members of Congress, a six-year ban on lobbying for senior congressional staffers and a six-year ban on congressional offices hiring lobbyists they’ve worked with closely.

It would also require the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate to maintain a public database of lobbyists and more than double the current penalty for violating lobbying disclosure laws.

The measure is the latest collaboration between the two progressives who have teamed up in the past, albeit unsuccessfully, on bills to prohibit members of Congress and their family members from trading stocks.

Other members of Congress, including Colorado’s Democratic U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, have previously proposed similar unsuccessful measures banning members of Congress from lobbying.

Some Republicans, including then-U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, have backed the proposals before. But no Republicans are currently signed on to the Neguse bill, making passage unlikely in the Republican-controlled Congress.

The ban, should it somehow pass, would leave some former members of Congress from Colorado unemployed.

Data compiled by Open Secrets, a government transparency nonprofit, shows at least three of the 13 former members of Congress from Colorado who left Washington since 2009 have worked as lobbyists or at lobbying firms since their departures.

At least six others who departed before then have worked in the lobbying world, too, according to Open Secrets.

Lobbying firms often seek out former members of Congress to join their ranks in hopes that they can use their inside knowledge to sway current members on behalf of clients.

Former Colorado senators and reps have worked on behalf of all kinds of interest groups.

This year, former U.S. Rep. Ed Perlmutter, a Democrat who represented the northern and western suburbs of Denver in Congress from 2007 to 2023, is lobbying on behalf of seven clients through his firm, Holland & Knight, according to Open Secrets. His clients include real estate companies, a chemical company, a battery company, a cannabis association, Denver Health and Colorado School of Mines.

Former U.S. Sen. Wayne Allard, a Republican who served from 1997 to 2009, is the vice president of government relations at the American Motorcyclist Association and has lobbied for other groups, including the American Association of Veterinary Medical Colleges, according to Open Secrets.

Former U.S. Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, who changed his party affiliation to Republican from Democrat during his 12 years in Congress beginning in 1993, has his own consulting firm and has lobbied on behalf of the Indian Gaming Association, according to Open Secrets. Former U.S. Rep. Marilyn Musgrave, a Republican who served from 2003 to 2009, is the vice president of government affairs at the Susan B Anthony List organization. And former U.S. Sen. Timothy Wirth, a Democrat who served from 1987 to 1993, is a board member of the United Nations Foundation and has lobbied for the Better World Fund, which supports UN causes.

Former U.S. Reps. Scott McInnis, a Republican, has in the past lobbied for the Anschutz Corporation, mining companies, the American Red Cross, and other groups with the firm Hogan & Hartson, according to Open Secrets..

Former U.S. Sens. Gardner and Ken Salazar, a Democrat, and U.S. Rep. David Skaggs, a Democrat, have worked for lobbying firms. But none of the three have been registered as lobbyists.

Gardner, who served for one term from 2015 to 2021, is on the board of advisers at Michael Best Strategies LLC, a lobbying firm that represents clients from many different industries. Salazar is back at WilmerHale, a lobbying and law firm, after serving as ambassador to Mexico, and Skaggs has worked at several lobbying firms, according to Open Secrets.

Gardner and Perlmutter, the two most recent departures from the Colorado delegation who are working as lobbyists or at lobbying firms, did not respond to requests for comment.

McInnis said he’s against a lifetime ban on lobbying for former members of Congress.

“Seems kind of a punishment for serving your country,” he said. “I would consider timeouts before lifetime bans.”

McInnis, who said he works mostly in private business now after years of lobbying and then serving on the Mesa county commission, is proudest of lobbying for Anschutz Medical Center. Still, he sees the need for guardrails.

“It’s reasonable that if you’re a former congressman on the defense committee, you can’t be a lobbyist for Russia,” he said.

Neguse’s spokesperson did not make him available for an interview about the bill. In a statement when he debuted the bill, the congressman said “we must clean up government for future generations and ensure our government is serving the American people, not special interests.”

Former Colorado GOP Chairman Dick Wadhams, who ran the organization from 2007 to 2011, also said he favors stricter reporting requirements and increased penalties for rulebreakers, but isn’t on board with a lifetime ban.

“I don’t see the evil nature of this,” said. “This is a feel-good bill. It’s trying to solve a problem that does not exist.”

Untangling Congress from former member lobbyists may be more difficult than it seems. Open Secrets data shows 79 donors to Neguse in the 2024 election cycle that both lobby and have former members as lobbyists. Among the largest donors were lobbying and law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck; the credit union trade association America’s Credit Unions; and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24235842294979.jpg,N,,2025-07-21 18:01:14.264108

The resolution comes at a time when fossil fuel companies are lobbying Congress to grant them immunity against the growing wave of climate accountability lawsuits filed by communities throughout the U.S.

The National Association of Counties (NACo), representing more than 40,000 county elected officials and 3.6 million county employees, passed the resolution last week at its annual conference, pointing to “an increasing number of ‘billion-dollar’ extreme weather events that strain taxpayer resources and county response and recovery capacity.” Earlier this month, deadly flash floods killed more than 130 people in central Texas and caused an estimated $18 billion in damages and economic loss. Tens of millions of people in the U.S. were under severe heat warnings in June, causing strain on emergency services and electrical grids. This week, tropical storm Chantal caused heavy rains in the Northeast, killing people in New Jersey and North Carolina, flooding subway stations in New York, and triggering flood warnings in Pennsylvania and Virginia.

State and local governments are fighting in court to recover the costs of such climate-fueled disasters from the industry that has knowingly fueled them for decades: Big Oil.

""The idea that all compostable packaging would have to comply, would effectively remove compostable packaging from being viable,"" Felts explained.","Nevada receives extremely low marks in the fight against plastic pollution.

This is Plastic-free July and a report called The United States of Plastics from Ocean Conservancy awards the Silver State a score of 1.5 out of five, mostly because of policy inaction.

Dr. Anja Brandon, director of plastics policy at Ocean Conservancy, said this is a prime opportunity for Nevada to show leadership on this issue.

""They have taken no actions yet to regulate plastic pollution,"" said Brandon. ""They've also not taken any bad actions. So essentially, the state is at a blank slate ready for action.""

The report encourages policymakers to consider programs to address microplastic pollution and promote plastic reduction or reuse.

Nevada could follow California's lead, and require plastic producers to take financial responsibility for cleaning up waste from their products.

Brandon also suggested that Nevada could be very influential in the movement toward sustainable tourism.

""You could consider laws like phasing out single-use plastics for personal care products in hotels,"" said Brandon, ""or requiring reusables at stadiums or major events.""

The report also notes that Nevada could benefit from a deposit return program for packaging or beverage containers.

A cleaner environment through less waste is the goal of a new state organization, the Indiana Composting Council.

The council will enlist individuals, schools, businesses and farmers to help bring more organic waste diversion and sustainable soil building to Indiana.

Gowri Somasundaram, president of the council, explained compost starts with decomposed organic matter from food waste and grass clippings to shredded paper. When combined with air and water, the items break down into nutrient-rich soil, while minimizing plant diseases.

She pointed out it benefits the climate, too.

""Organic waste is the majority of the waste that emits greenhouse gas,"" Somasundaram explained. ""Which in turn is tied up with the climate and climate change, and other emissions that comes out of the landfill.""

An uptick in composting means more storage facilities will be needed. Recycling station owners must register with the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and obey regulations about design, location, operation, dust, odor, noise and pathogen control. And the buildings are required to submit yearly updates on the quantity and type of materials processed. Indiana has 15 recycling centers.

The Indiana University Environmental Institute lists coffee grounds, fruits, vegetables and eggshells as ideal for lowering household trash output and minimizing clogged kitchen drains by composting instead. And people can avoid buying expensive chemical lawn fertilizers by using the healthier soil composting produces.

Somasundaram noted there are plenty of ways to get more involved, even for those who are unsure they can make a difference.

""If there is a good support from the community by giving their attendance and asking us the right questions, that is going to help to do the composting in the right way,"" Somasundaram asserted.

She pointed out the council is looking forward to affecting the state by reimagining waste not as an end but as a beginning. She added they will help promote sustainability and the circular economy of the organics industry through education and programming.

California receives high marks in a report on the fight against plastic pollution. This is Plastic-free July and the United States of Plastics report, from Ocean Conservancy, awards the Golden State a score of four-and-a-half out of five.

Report co-author Anja Brandon, director of plastics policy with Ocean Conservancy, largely credits Senate Bill 54, California's landmark law passed in 2022.

""It holds plastic and other packaging producers financially responsible for managing their wasteful products. And it requires that producers make 25% less single-use plastics by 2032,"" she said.

The state also banned most plastic grocery bags a few years ago. Starting next year, the thicker plastic bags now sold at checkout stands will also go away. Shoppers will have to go back to using paper bags or bring reusable cloth bags.

Brandon noted California still has more work to do, adding the state has been slow to implement SB 54's ban on expanded polystyrene foam, which was supposed to take effect last January.

""The state agencies finally issued guidance and an enforcement portal, literally this week. So it's seven months late, but they are finally getting around to enforcing that critical component of the law,"" she continued.

The report also found California is the only state with a law directly addressing pollution from pellets used to manufacture plastics.

California companies making compostable packaging materials said their products could make a huge dent in the problem of plastic pollution but only with changes to state and federal policy.

California passed Senate Bill 54 in 2022. It requires single-use packaging and plastic foodware to be either recyclable or compostable by 2032. The issue is with a companion bill, Assembly Bill 1201, which said compostable materials must be certified organic.

John Felts, cofounder and CEO of Santa Cruz-based Cruz Foam, which makes compostable packaging foam from food waste, said the requirement is a tall order.

""The idea that all compostable packaging would have to comply, would effectively remove compostable packaging from being viable,"" Felts explained. ""The cost, the tracking, making a fully certified organic packaging material is nearly impossible.""

The organic requirement is set to go into effect Jan. 1, but negotiations are underway in Sacramento to delay implementation, a move also supported by the plastics industry. Environmental advocates said plastic waste is choking the planet, disrupting marine ecosystems, and endangering human health, so recycling, reusable containers and compostable packaging are key.

It is estimated 40% of plastic produced today is used to make packaging, much of which is used once.

Julia Marsh, cofounder and CEO of San Leandro-based Sway, which uses seaweed to make flexible packaging, said plastic use is only increasing.

""About 5 trillion bags, wrappers and pouches are produced every year; 11 million metric tons of plastic enter the ocean every year,"" Marsh pointed out. ""That number is expected to triple by 2040, if production rates continue as is.""

Advocates would also like the National Organic Program within the U.S. Department of Agriculture to broaden the term ""organic"" to include certified compostable materials.

Re: Public Citizen Supports Administrative Penalties Against Lyondell Chemical Channelview

Hello. My name is Cassidy Levin and I’m here on behalf of Public Citizen.

We support the proposal to penalize the Lyondell Chemical Channelview facility for their permit violations. However, we take issue with aspects of the agreed order, including the Supplemental Environmental Project approved by the TCEQ, which is intended to be paid to Barbers Hill Independent School District. Barbers Hill is near Channelview; however, it is not in the Channelview community. Barbers Hill ISD is also significantly wealthier and whiter than Channelview ISD. We understand that the company chose a pre-approved SEP rather than taking the time to create a custom SEP that would actually benefit Channelview. This is unacceptable. The agency should reject the SEP, and any SEP that doesn’t benefit the impacted community.

We urge the TCEQ to impose the penalty in full, without deferring any portion in favor of an expedited settlement. We also urge the TCEQ to increase onsite inspections of the Channelview facility. This facility regularly violates its air permits. Since 2020, the facility has had twenty-eight unauthorized emissions incidents. An Air Alliance Houston Report found that Lyondell Chemical Channelview was the second worst polluter in the Houston Area. The TCEQ has assessed penalties of at least $134,266 for these emissions events. Nearly 15% of that amount has been deferred. These enforcement efforts have not been successful in motivating Lyondell Chemical to reduce unauthorized emissions events.

Between 2020 and 2024, LyondellBasell Industries, which wholly owns Lyondell Chemical, reported net income of $14.4 billion. We ask that a more appropriate penalty be assessed, and most importantly, collected, in full. This is the only way to curtail these excessive and unauthorized emissions.

We take issue with the agency’s classification of the release of over a thousand pounds of VOCs into the Channelview community as a minor harm. This underestimation disregards the fact that dangerous chemicals, including carcinogens, were released into a populated area. Crenshaw Elementary School is located less than a mile from the facility. VOCs are also ozone precursor chemicals. Let’s not forget that Channelview is in Harris County, which is in severe non-attainment with the ozone standards of the Clean Air Act.

The community of Channelview is at a higher-than-average risk of environmental burdens. According to the EPA, 86% of those who live within one mile of the facility are people of color, 26% are low-income, and 37% are children 17 years or younger.

The TCEQ must protect the health of the Channelview community.",https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/public_citizen_shared_link.jpg,N,,2025-07-21 15:02:21.540764

When he signed his budget bill into law on July 4, President Donald Trump dealt a heavy blow to America’s electric vehicle industry, ending most federal support for US electric vehicle manufacturing and hobbling automakers’ $100 billion effort to catch up with China, the world’s new automotive manufacturing superpower. Now California alone has the size and market power to fill the void left by Washington’s surrender. Our leaders in Sacramento must step up.

The gutting of EV support never got the national debate it deserved. Americans, including many in Congress, fail to see the real EV issue: China. As the world moves toward a future auto market dominated by electric vehicles — a reality no global auto executive doubts — China has seized the opportunity. It’s China, not the United States, the European Union or Japan, that now rules global automotive manufacturing. For every car, SUV or pickup built in America, China builds about three, and the Chinese have the manufacturing muscle to build five.

Detroit understands this. Along with their European and Asian peers, US automakers have invested tens of billions in North American factories to build the next generation of EVs and compete in global markets. This month at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley put it bluntly: “If we lose this (the race for EVs), we do not have a future Ford.” Unfortunately, the Trump administration is forcing free-world automakers to race against China at a disadvantage. Chinese automakers, awash in government help and subsidies, now manufacture 70% of the world’s EVs. Their advanced, low-priced cars are quickly taking market share in Australia, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. Mexico is a sobering example. In 2017, 1% of Mexican cars came from China. Last year that number was 20%. Despite China’s success, have no doubt that US, European, South Korean and Japanese automakers can compete. Much of the EV technology that the Chinese have exploited was first developed in the United States. Although China has more than 100 EV brands, only a handful are profitable; many will fade away.

For America and its allies to compete in this race, carmakers must succeed in their anchor American market. (Remember, most foreign car companies — Hyundai, Kia, BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes — build EVs in the United States, employing thousands of Americans.) What makes California so important? First, it’s America’s EV leader; over a third of all US EV sales are here; 1 in 4 cars sold in California is electric. Second, California is on the front line of the US auto industry’s research and development battle with China. Lucid developed its world-class power train technology in Orange County. Rivian, in Irvine, licensed its world-class software and electrical architecture to Volkswagen for billions. Tesla has two large factories and several labs here, employing more than 40,000 workers. Ford, the pride of Detroit, has bet the company’s future on a California skunkworks, where hundreds of engineers are working on a new, affordable EV platform designed to compete worldwide.

What can California do to fill the massive void in EV support left by Washington? Plenty. Here are three priorities:

Until Sept. 30, buying or leasing a new EV still qualifies for a $7,500 federal credit. When that ends, California should replace it with a $3,500 state credit to lower most lease payments by nearly $100 a month (as any auto salesman knows, consumers make their decisions based more on monthly payments, not total cost.) The $3,500 credit should also apply to used EV sales. The state has a tangle of consumer EV subsidies; this simple approach should replace them. To control costs to taxpayers, lawmakers could make these “conquest” credits — that is, they would be limited to first-time EV buyers and leasers. This program should not have income limits. The more new EV drivers the better because data show that most consumers happily stick with EVs once they have leased or bought one. Income limits would simply limit sales volume.

Many Californians in large metropolitan areas such as LA or San Francisco live in apartments or condos without the convenience and cost savings of overnight charging. Instead, they are often forced to wait in line at fast-charging stations, where electricity prices are usually higher than at home. This lack of apartment and condo chargers is a “pinch point” in the EV market that California could take the lead in solving.",https://www.gulftoday.ae/gulftoday/uploads/images/2025/07/21/985373.jpg,N,,2025-07-21 15:49:45.961862

Contributing Writer

(Veritenews.org) — After more than a decade of delays, the New Orleans City Council earlier this month (July 10) approved a program to cut energy use in large buildings and help the city meet its ambitious climate goals.

The “energy benchmarking” program will require the owners of buildings 50,000 square feet and larger to track and publicly disclose their annual power consumption starting next year. In 2027, the requirement would expand to buildings more than 20,000 square feet.

“The adoption of this ordinance places New Orleans among dozens of forward-looking cities nationwide that are taking bold action on building emissions,” said Greg Nichols, director of the city’s Office of Resilience and Sustainability.

The council’s vote was unanimous and involved little discussion.

Large buildings account for about 20 percent of New Orleans’ greenhouse gas emissions, according to a fact sheet by the office.

Cities with similar benchmarking programs have seen building energy use fall by an average of 2.4 percent annually, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. About 50 cities, including Austin, Kansas City and Atlanta, track and publish energy use by large buildings.

The data tends to spur investment in older, inefficient buildings and nudges new ones toward greener design, advocates say.

The program would apply to about 1,500 buildings in the city. Energy use would be tracked on an interactive map and published in an annual report.

New Orleans initiated a similar program for city-owned buildings several years ago. Between 2018 and 2021, the program helped reduce energy use by 23 percent, according to Nichols. The city recently created an online dashboard that shows the energy use of municipal buildings.

When New Orleans announced in 2014 that it was developing a benchmarking ordinance, national green building experts praised the move as a show of leadership at a time when few cities had taken similar steps. The effort slowed when some building owners and residents expressed concerns about privacy and fines. City leaders recently worked to ease those worries by requiring the disclosure of a building’s total energy use, not that of its tenants or other occupants. The current ordinance would also waive penalties during the first year and cap fines at $3,000.

Energy benchmarking was incorporated into New Orleans’ climate action plan, which aims to cut the city’s greenhouse gas emissions in half before 2035 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. According to the plan, the benchmarking ordinance was supposed to be passed by the end of last year.

The program recently got a boost from a $50 million federal grant aimed at reducing the city’s greenhouse gas emissions. The city plans to use about $1.5 million of the EPA grant to support a full-time employee who will promote the program and help property owners with compliance.

Southwestern Pennsylvania may be known as having been the center of the US steel industry, but it now has an opportunity to bolster the regional economy through clean technology manufacturing. The region is well-positioned to leverage its existing strengths — like strong manufacturing and cutting-edge research — to turn around decades of economic development challenges since the decline of steel and the offshoring of manufacturing, while also fostering cleantech clusters that diversify and strengthen the regional economy.

In the past decade, cleantech costs have fallen by up to 80 percent, while investment has increased nearly tenfold and solar generation has risen twelvefold. Cleantech clusters — a group of interconnected businesses, research institutions, and other relevant organizations in the same or related clean energy industries located in the same region — could help Southwestern Pennsylvania capture this opportunity. As major innovation hubs, cleantech clusters can generate jobs, attract investment, and increase a region’s competitiveness.

Our analysis revealed three high-potential cleantech sectors that can reinvigorate manufacturing and strengthen regional economic development in Southwestern Pennsylvania: battery manufacturing, solar component manufacturing, and green buildings. To succeed in cluster development, Southwestern Pennsylvania will need to improve coordination and address workforce gaps. Importantly, cleantech cluster development, like all economic development, should ensure employment and other benefits for communities that have historically been left behind.

Creating jobs and developing an equitable workforce

Although Southwestern Pennsylvania has an extensive history of coal mining, steel manufacturing, and fracking, it has in more recent years established itself as an innovation hub in biomedical research, robotics, and even AI. The region’s manufacturing legacy and more recent advanced specialization provide a solid foundation the region can build on to support cleantech cluster development and the economic opportunity it offers.

Battery manufacturing

Battery energy storage is key to a flexible, reliable grid — especially batteries that use easily obtainable materials and recycling-friendly designs. Southwestern Pennsylvania is a prime location for a grid battery manufacturing cluster because of its existing battery manufacturing, technological innovation, and workforce skills. Local companies have helped develop and bring to market alternative chemistries and novel approaches for batteries. For instance, Eos Energy Enterprises received a $300 million Department of Energy loan to scale the manufacturing of its long duration zinc-based batteries, and startup SeaLion Energy developed a regeneration technology that extends batteries’ lifespans. Further developing these technologies could offer a more sustainable solution to meeting global battery storage demand, which is projected to be nearly six times today’s capacity by 2030.

Battery manufacturing has already created jobs in the region, and a fully developed manufacturing and recycling cluster could help attract investments in related sectors like electric vehicles, solar energy, and green buildings. However, the region will still need to develop workforce capacity in specialized roles like semiconductor processing and computer hardware and electronics engineering, and it will need to ensure it has the lab space needed to support development and demonstration of new technologies.

Solar component manufacturing

The United States has rapidly deployed renewable energy resources over the past decade — clean energy investments totaled over $70 billion in 2024 alone, resulting in 37 GW of additional clean energy generation capacity that could power over 7 million homes — but the country has been slow to manufacture solar panels domestically. In recent years, US-based companies like First Solar have developed some parts of the solar supply chain, but gaps remain to meet the current and projected demand for solar. And now, with the repeal of manufacturing and solar deployment tax credits, and with looming tariffs, the picture for domestic solar manufacturing is more uncertain than ever.

However, if you’re going to gamble on domestic solar manufacturing, Southwestern Pennsylvania is a pretty good place to bet on. The region already produces steel and aluminum, setting it up well for component manufacturing, and it has a long history of glass production. Vitro Architectural Glass, North America’s largest glass producer, recently upgraded its facility in Meadville, fewer than 100 miles north of Pittsburgh, to produce flat glass for First Solar. JM Steel has been working with NEXTracker since 2022 to produce racks for solar arrays. This is all important. Southwestern Pennsylvania is one of a handful of places in the country with this past and current expertise.

Further, there is substantial overlap between the workforce skills needed for manufacturing both batteries and solar components, and increasing needed capacity in roles like semiconductor processing and computer hardware and electronics engineering would support both clusters.

Green buildings and related technologies

As residential, commercial, and industrial buildings are built and retrofit to be more efficient and healthier, they’ll do more than create construction jobs. The demand for these green buildings creates additional opportunities for economic development, like locally manufacturing advanced building materials.

There have been substantial recent advances in industrialized and automated production of building components and materials, allowing faster, cheaper, and site-appropriate construction. Modular housing builder Module has a Last Mile Facility in Pittsburgh that includes a construction innovation lab, a workforce training program, and manufacturing space. Southwestern Pennsylvania’s strengths in manufacturing and robotics make it an excellent place to manufacture the materials it needs for its buildings, and state programs can spur additional demand. For example the state’s Reducing Industrial Sector Emissions (RISE PA) program is providing $396 million in grants for industrial facility projects that reduce energy costs and air pollution.

A cleantech cluster initiative can improve coordination and help win cleantech investments

With so many advantages, why isn’t Southwestern Pennsylvania already a cleantech powerhouse? When it comes to deciding where to site facilities, businesses think about Ohio or southern states first, and Southwestern Pennsylvania economic development stakeholders haven’t prioritized cleantech business attraction. A cleantech cluster initiative — an initiative to steer and organize the region’s efforts focused on cleantech to support the industry’s growth in the region — can help Southwestern Pennsylvania attract investment. The region has similar initiatives for other sectors, such as the Pittsburgh Robotics Network and the Pittsburgh Life Sciences Alliance, which have helped build the region’s dominance in these fields. The Robotics Network, for example, developed a dense geographic cluster that provides workspace, leverages public and philanthropic financial support, and plays the role of promoter and convener to connect and coordinate firms, investors, suppliers, and talent. Total investment in Pittsburgh’s robotics sector reached $4.3 billion in 2022.

The initiative could help the region overcome key constraints, like helping economic development stakeholders coordinate to proactively attract cleantech opportunities. It could also facilitate collaboration to identify gaps in the regional economic development and lab-to-market ecosystems and empower organizations in those ecosystems to address those gaps.

These are uncertain times for cleantech manufacturers, but demand for clean energy isn’t going away. Southwestern Pennsylvania’s strengths in innovation and manufacturing position it well to capture the cleantech opportunity. Economic revitalization is within reach if the region can coordinate and proactively prioritize opportunities to build cleantech clusters.

​Brief biographies and statements of interest for each individual are below:

Anna Allen

Biography:

Anna Allen is a proud member of the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes and currently serves as the Regional Government Affairs Director at the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission (CRITFC). In this role, she leverages 15 years of experience in advocacy, community engagement, and equitable policy development to strengthen relationships between tribal governments, public agencies, and community organizations. Prior to joining CRITFC, Anna served in several roles at Multnomah County, as the Policy and Engagement Advisor in the Chair's Office, Interim-Director of the Office of Community Involvement, and later as the County's first Tribal Affairs Advisor.

​Anna's commitment to Indigenous communities extends beyond her professional roles. She has been actively involved in volunteerism, serving on several boards and advisory bodies, including the City/County Homelessness Response System Steering and Oversight Committee, Portland Indian Leaders Roundtable Subgroup, and the US Commission on Civil Rights Oregon State Advisory Committee.

​Statement of Interest:

​I know the future environmental health of Portland and the global community that we're part of rests on the backs of tribal communities who have been successful stewards of the place we call home. If selected to serve, I hope to work with my colleagues on the Committee and PCEF leadership to identify ways the Climate Investment Plan can increase tribal partnerships on issues they've already identified, and contribute to already intentional work to ensure funds are allocated in a way that brings everyone to the table, including technically accessible grant opportunities for small or newly emerging nonprofit partners. Because it's going to take everyone to have a meaningful impact on our climate crisis.

​I seek to create lasting relationships and trust between government agencies and Native communities through leveraging my existing relationships and the ways I approach this work through transparency, candor, and care for everyone I engage with. I hope to bring new relationships to this work that influence institutional change that lives beyond my time on the Committee.

​​André Lightsey-Walker

Biography:

André Lightsey-Walker is a transportation planner and community activist with a deep commitment to climate justice, equity, and community-centered solutions. He currently serves as a Senior Transportation Planner with Oregon Metro, and previously as Planning and Program Manager at The Street Trust. With experience in regional planning, policy development, and grant management, André has worked to advance sustainable transportation and land use strategies that prioritize underserved communities, and improve the quality of life for all Portlanders. As a 4th generation Portland resident and advocate for inclusive decision-making, he brings a place-based perspective to his work ensuring investments drive meaningful and lasting community impact to be enjoyed today and into the future.

​Statement of Interest:

The honor to sit on this committee, engage with other local leaders, and actively contribute to innovative decision-making aimed at healing the city and the people within it is extraordinarily inspiring and completely aligns with my personal goal of service to the community of Portland, a place my family has called home for nearly a century. I am particularly interested in the fact that PCEF stands in direct opposition to contemporary models of resource distribution and in a very prominent fashion shows that alternative ways work.

​I hope to provide useful perspective, specifically in the field of transportation planning in decarbonization, that leads to large scale investment in community projects that not only lead to carbon reduction in the transportation sector but also alleviate the burdens of our transportation system from the populations most impacted. I want to contribute to discussion around investments that offer co-benefits and provide a human centered, holistic approach to municipal scaled problem-solving.

​Robin Wang

Biography:

Mr. Wang is a social entrepreneur and impact finance consultant with a passion for deploying catalytic capital to benefit communities. Having been the owner of an eco-friendly lifestyle media company, the Executive Director of a non-profit Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI), and having served on numerous non-profit boards, Robin brings a unique set of experiences that intersect climate change, justice-centered finance, economic development, and non-profit operations and governance. He is currently working with Oregon Department of Environmental Quality to establish and launch a Community Climate Investment Fund that will deploy comparable carbon reduction resources to benefit communities throughout Oregon.

​Statement of Interest:

It has been an honor and privilege to serve on the inaugural PCEF committee and, in that capacity, working to help launch the fund, guide the first few rounds of climate action grants, and develop the Climate Investment Plan. But much work remains to be done.

​​2023 marked the hottest year on record and marginalized communities are still bearing the brunt of climate change. Humanity needs to double down on climate action. Compared to four years ago, we are very fortunate that PCEF has additional resources that can be deployed. But simply “deploying more” is not the answer. Additional challenges have and will continue to arise in deploying these resources and we need to be strategic, creative and intentional in how we deploy them.

​​Since my initial appointment four years ago, I’ve had the opportunity to work with many other impact funds encompassing affordable housing, consumer justice, economic development, educator wellbeing and other climate initiatives. In my second term, I am eager to apply those many lessons learned to help broaden and maximize the PCEF’s impact while ensuring that its funds are properly stewarded.

​​Megan Horst

Biography:

Dr. Megan Horst is a Senior Associate in Climate Equity planning at Cascadia Consulting, where she helps local municipalities plan for climate equity and resilience. She was previously an Associate Professor in the school of Urban Studies & Planning at Portland State University and the Director of the Masters of Urban and Regional Planning program. She brings substantial urban planning, urban agriculture and local food systems expertise that is recognized both locally and nationally. Dr. Horst also brings a strong equity lens and experience in food justice work.

​Statement of Interest:

​I am excited to work with other committee members to steward the Portland Clean Energy Fund and ensure funds advance climate action and resilience, with a focus on benefitting communities that are often on the so-called frontlines of climate change. As a professor, I specifically bring expertise and enthusiasm in the areas of Regenerative Agriculture and Green Infrastructure, operationalizing PCEF commitments to equity, and in program evaluation. I hope to strengthen ties between PCEF and Portland State University, to help build the capacity of local residents and PSU students to benefit from green jobs and lead climate action work.

​I think it is possible for a green city to also be a just city, and I see PCEF as part of that. I am proud of the first 5 years of PCEF, and look forward to the future.",https://www.portland.gov/themes/custom/cloudy/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-21 17:00:58.825227

Will America listen? - Indianapolis Recorder,"DENISE ABDUL-RAHMAN, DENISE ABDUL-RAHMAN https:, indianapolisrecorder.com, denise-abdul-rahman",,,,,https://indianapolisrecorder.com/indiana-sounding-alarm-on-data-center/,"But beneath this high-tech promise lies a dangerous truth: the rise of massive data centers is putting an unbearable burden on the very communities already facing the steepest environmental and economic challenges.

Data centers consume massive amounts of energy and water.
There clearly are better, more sustainable ways to build data centers, but without rules in place to protect Hoosiers, industry will continue to take the path of least resistance — through our neighborhoods.
Policymakers, utilities and tech companies need to slow down and listen to the communities that will bear the cost.","When we talk about the future of technology, we often talk in terms of progress — faster computing, artificial intelligence (AI) breakthroughs and data at our fingertips.

But beneath this high-tech promise lies a dangerous truth: the rise of massive data centers is putting an unbearable burden on the very communities already facing the steepest environmental and economic challenges.

The NAACP recently took a strong stand. Delegates attending our national convention adopted a resolution that began with the Indiana State Conference to address the growing harm caused by data centers. These sprawling facilities, which power cloud computing and AI platforms like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, may be invisible to most, but their impacts on Hoosiers are anything but.

Data centers consume massive amounts of energy and water. A single AI query can use four to five times more electricity than a typical internet search. Multiply that by millions of queries a day, and you can see the scale of demand. In Indiana and across the country, tech giants like Google, Meta and Amazon are racing to build these hyperscaler facilities, and our state policymakers are incentivizing them to come here with tax breaks galore.

The problem? They’re moving fast without transparency or accountability, and the financial fallout from soaring energy demand is going to land in the laps of Hoosiers who can least afford to pay more.

Not only are utilities scaling up to produce more energy, which will raise consumer rates by hundreds of dollars each year, they’re doubling down on dirty, expensive energy sources that will continue to pollute our state and harm public health.

Indiana Michigan Power is seeking to delay coal plant retirements and acquire out-of-state natural gas capacity. AES Indiana is proposing new gas generators that could double its carbon emissions, while Duke Energy plans to spend $3.3 billion on a massive new gas plant in the southern part of the state. NIPSCO also anticipates a major emissions increase to meet this new load.

State lawmakers have made it easier for utilities to keep coal online and build new fossil infrastructure, passing legislation that allows utilities to recover costs from Hoosiers even as they prioritize corporate tech giants over everyday families.

What’s happening in Indiana is just the beginning. States like Texas, Virginia and Louisiana are seeing similar buildouts, and with each new facility comes more demand for electricity, more fossil fuel emissions, more water usage and more strain on aging infrastructure.

We simply cannot ignore the pollution, displacement and rising utility costs being driven by unchecked data center expansion. Thankfully, there are policy solutions we can embrace that will protect Hoosiers.

The NAACP is calling for mandatory algorithmic impact assessments — modeled after environmental impact assessments — to ensure communities understand and can respond to the risks. We’re also asking for community benefits agreements that guarantee jobs, clean energy investments and protections for water and air.

We’re also calling on Congress and state lawmakers to require transparency from tech companies about their energy and water usage and to put guardrails in place that prevent utilities from offloading spiraling costs onto ratepayers.

There clearly are better, more sustainable ways to build data centers, but without rules in place to protect Hoosiers, industry will continue to take the path of least resistance — through our neighborhoods.

Indiana is leading the call for change. We’re not anti-technology. We’re pro-community, pro-transparency and pro-fairness. We want innovation that works for everyone — not just shareholders and executives in Silicon Valley.

The future of AI should not be built on the backs of those who are already carrying the heaviest burdens. Policymakers, utilities and tech companies need to slow down and listen to the communities that will bear the cost.

The Electric Car Grant program will make some £650 million available for purchase incentives.
Automakers will apply point-of-sale discounts of up to £3,750 on EVs priced at £45,000 or less.
There’s also a £63-million package of investments in EV charging infrastructure.
This may seem like a small thing, but Dunstan Power, Director of EV charging provider Versinetic, pointed out its importance.","As the US government attempts to force our auto industry back into the 20th century, the UK government is pushing forward with electrification. It recently reaffirmed a commitment to phase out the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, and has announced £4.5 billion in funding for a range of programs to support the transition to zero-emission transport.

The Electric Car Grant program will make some £650 million available for purchase incentives. Automakers will apply point-of-sale discounts of up to £3,750 on EVs priced at £45,000 or less.

There’s also a £63-million package of investments in EV charging infrastructure.

The National Health Service (NHS) will benefit from an £8-million fund to support the electrification of ambulances and medical fleets across over 200 NHS sites. Over 1,200 new charging sockets are to be installed, resulting in “millions in cost savings over the next two decades for the taxpayer on maintenance and fuel costs—valuable savings that can be prioritised for patient care.”

The Local EV Infrastructure (LEVI) Fund (established in 2023) supports local authorities in England to plan and deliver charging infrastructure for residents without off-street parking.

A new grant scheme will help businesses install charging points at fleet depots for heavy goods vehicles, vans and coaches.

Another little goodie: £25 million for cross-pavement charging technology. This is a low-tech approach that allows EV owners who don’t have driveways to run a charging cable safely under the pavement (what we call a sidewalk) to charge their cars on the street using their home power (much cheaper than going to a public charger).

This may seem like a small thing, but Dunstan Power, Director of EV charging provider Versinetic, pointed out its importance. Curbside charging “tackles one of the most persistent challenges in the UK market—the 40% of households without driveways who have been effectively excluded from home charging benefits. Accessing domestic electricity rates at 2 pence per mile, potentially saving £1,500 each year, fundamentally changes the cost of EV ownership for millions of households.”

“We know access to charging is a barrier for people thinking of making the switch, so we are tackling that head on so that everyone—whether or not they have a driveway—can access the benefits of going electric,” said Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander.

According to Gov.uk, the UK was the largest EV market in Europe last year, and the third largest in the world—over 382,000 EVs were sold in 2024, an increase of 20% compared to the previous year.",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AdobeStock_288638393.jpg,N,,2025-07-21 15:49:20.424789

Trump just eliminated it. - Grist.org,Zoya Teirstein,,,,,https://grist.org/politics/this-epa-research-office-safeguarded-americans-health-trump-just-eliminated-it/,"For more than half a century, the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Research and Development, or ORD, has furnished the EPA with independent research on everything from ozone pollution to pesticides like glyphosate.
The EPA said it is moving some of ORD staff into other parts of the EPA, including into its air, water, and chemical offices and a new Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions within EPA administrator Lee Zeldin’s office.
“Friday’s announcement is not an elimination of science and research,” the agency said.
But former EPA employees and environmental advocates say disbanding ORD will both weaken the EPA’s research capabilities and put its scientific independence at risk of political interference.
Research conducted at ORD not only grounded new EPA regulations, it also provided the scientific basis for TSCA enforcement.","For more than half a century, the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Research and Development, or ORD, has furnished the EPA with independent research on everything from ozone pollution to pesticides like glyphosate. Last week, after months of speculation and denial, the EPA officially confirmed that it is eliminating its research division and slashing thousands more employees from its payroll in the agency’s quest to cut 23 percent of its workforce. The latest moves add to the nearly 4,000 personnel who have already resigned, retired, or been laid off, according to the agency’s calculations.

The decision came directly on the heels of a Supreme Court order that greenlit the Trump administration’s efforts to downsize and restructure the federal government.

With approximately 1,115 employees — just 7 percent of the EPA’s headcount at the start of President Donald Trump’s second term — the research office has played an outsized role in helping the agency fulfill its legal mandate to use the “best available science” in its mission to protect human health and the environment. ORD science has underpinned many of the EPA’s restrictions on contaminants in air, water, and soil, and formed the basis for regulations on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, PFAS or “forever chemicals,” in drinking water, deadly fine particulate matter in air, carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere, and chemicals and metals like asbestos and lead.

“Without a research arm, it will be very difficult for EPA to issue new standards for air or water pollutants, toxic chemicals, pesticides, or other hazards,” said Michael Gerrard, faculty director of the Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.

ORD, which works with states, local governments, and tribes in addition to its federal work, has six national research programs, each one focused on a different aspect of health and the environment. Research being undertaken at those centers included studying how to safeguard water systems from terrorist attacks, understanding the impacts of extreme weather on human health, and modeling the economic benefits of reducing air pollution.

The EPA said it is moving some of ORD staff into other parts of the EPA, including into its air, water, and chemical offices and a new Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions within EPA administrator Lee Zeldin’s office. The agency said the moves will save taxpayers nearly $750 million, and produce an agency that closely resembles the shrunken version of the agency that existed under President Ronald Reagan in the early 1980s. The aim, the agency said, is to “prioritize research and science more than ever before.”

In an email to Grist, an agency spokesperson called media reports about the disbanding of ORD “biased” and denied that the changes will affect the quality of EPA science. “Friday’s announcement is not an elimination of science and research,” the agency said.

But former EPA employees and environmental advocates say disbanding ORD will both weaken the EPA’s research capabilities and put its scientific independence at risk of political interference.

“Part of the reason why ORD is a separate office is to preserve scientific integrity,” said Chris Frey, an associate dean at North Carolina State University who worked in the office on and off from 1992 to 2024, most recently as its Assistant Administrator under former President Joe Biden. “From a societal perspective, it’s a huge win for the public that those decisions be based on evidence and not just opinions of stakeholders to have a vested interest in an outcome.” The EPA hasn’t said how many ORD scientists will be allowed to continue working at the agency.

Already, the U.S. regulatory system gives chemical companies like 3M and DuPont a large degree of influence over how the chemicals they produce are controlled, a strategy that has been known to fail. Under the Toxic Substances Control Act, or TSCA, the EPA has 90 days to assess a chemical’s risks before it hits the market.

The EPA’s decision to dissolve ORD and integrate a portion of its scientists into the agency’s policymaking infrastructure stands to benefit chemical companies and industrial polluters by rubbing away the boundaries between science and politics, science advocates argue. Research conducted at ORD not only grounded new EPA regulations, it also provided the scientific basis for TSCA enforcement.

“There’s lots of ways that ORD speaking truth about impacts of pollutants was inconvenient for regulated industry,” said Gretchen Goldman, president of the nonprofit science advocacy organization the Union of Concerned Scientists. “They’re probably celebrating over this.”

Despite recent wins, industry trade and lobby groups are pushing for even more freedom. Last week, on the same day the EPA announced it was disbanding ORD and a day after the EPA separately exempted dozens of chemical factories and power plants from Biden-era air pollution and emissions rules, the American Chemistry Council’s President and CEO Chris Jahn floated the idea of making changes to the Toxic Substances Control Act in an interview with The Washington Examiner.

“EPA Administrator Zeldin, the White House, Congress are all looking at this right now,” he said, “to potentially make some updates to TSCA to make it work more effectively for the long run.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2194254181-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-07-21 15:01:46.675088

Canada’s ten largest trading partners outside the United States are placing a priority on low-carbon imports, Canada’s strongest trade opportunities rely on expanding these foundations in the clean economy.
This new report provides even more evidence to support provinces as they explore opportunities in the clean economy.
“Canadian companies, workers and communities are already benefitting from global investment in clean energy, tech and lower-carbon products.
The growth opportunity for Canada’s economy is huge” Smith said.","Toronto, July 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In anticipation of premiers meeting this week on interprovincial trade and economic opportunities, New Economy Canada has identified marketplace signals and economic forces that should guide Canada in attracting new investment and creating good paying, durable jobs.

The report, Strong Signals in the Noise, details how energy transition investments—now flowing at a rate of $3-trillion CAD per year worldwide—are being amplified by mounting concerns about energy security and the realignment of international trade to favour a faster transition built on clean power, electrification and low-carbon materials. The opportunity has never been greater, and with the recent U.S. policy shift, billions of dollars of investment and thousands of jobs are now up for grabs.

New Economy Canada’s analysis shows that all of these factors can play to Canada’s strategic advantage—if governments at every level across the country take decisive action to position Canada as a top investment destination by setting clean economy growth goals, ensuring policy certainty and durability, and spurring capital investment to get things built.

“This report confirms that the clean economy is here to stay, and that it represents the best opportunity for Canada’s future economic growth, stable trade and energy security,” said Merran Smith, president of New Economy Canada.

Strong Signals in the Noise shows that the global investments in the clean economy are growing at 22 per cent per year—as of 2024 they outpaced investments in the oil and gas sector two-to-one—and documents how economic and geopolitical drivers, particularly global concerns about energy security and trade diversification, will keep that momentum going. It also lays out the strong foundations of Canada’s clean economy, and how we can diversify and redefine key trade relationships to seize big opportunities as global investments continue to expand and the U.S. continues to threaten mounting tariffs.

Key indicators and drivers for Canada’s clean economy opportunities:

Canada is already the world’s eighth largest market for clean investments—reaching nearly $50 billion in 2024—the top destination for exploration spending on critical minerals, and ranked second in the world for battery supply chain potential.

80 per cent of the country’s electricity is emissions-free—a world-class asset already serving as a draw for new investments.

Canada’s ten largest trading partners outside the United States are placing a priority on low-carbon imports, Canada’s strongest trade opportunities rely on expanding these foundations in the clean economy.

“Canada has the resources, the talent and the trade routes to boost the energy transition around the world while creating stable jobs and driving innovation here at home,” said Smith.

Provinces are clearly recognizing the economic opportunity at play and have already been leveraging our advantages to attract private sector investment. Ontario has secured billions of dollars in large investments in both established sectors such as batteries and EVs as well as in innovative projects such as small modular reactors. BC Hydro’s 2024 call for power led to contracts that will contribute $5-6 billion of capital investment. This new report provides even more evidence to support provinces as they explore opportunities in the clean economy.

“Canadian companies, workers and communities are already benefitting from global investment in clean energy, tech and lower-carbon products. The growth opportunity for Canada’s economy is huge” Smith said. “We can’t let ourselves be distracted by all the noise, we must follow the signal, move fast and take bold action now.”

Supportive quotes on Canada’s economic opportunity:

Adam Auer, President and CEO of the Cement Association of Canada said:

“For our sector, investing in decarbonization is about driving innovation, attracting investment and strengthening Canada’s building and infrastructure sector to enhance our global competitiveness.”

Andrea Moffat, Senior Director, Investment Stewardship at Addenda Capital said:

“Investing in Canada’s clean energy economy is an investment in growing the resilience of our communities and securing our economic competitiveness for the long-term. We need to scale our efforts by ensuring a strong foundation and building market confidence now, to mobilize the capital required to take advantage of this growth potential in Canada.”

Colleen Giroux-Schmidt, Senior Vice President, Development Western Canada and Federal Government Affairs at Innergex Renewable Energy said:

“We're proud to collaborate with Indigenous partners to bring clean energy to regions across Canada. Our projects deliver meaningful and long-term local economic benefits and opportunities while meeting regional energy needs with affordable, low-carbon solutions. The transition to clean energy is not only essential for the environment but also a powerful driver of global economic growth and community prosperity.”

Denis Krude, President and CEO, Hydrogen Optimized

“The clean hydrogen technology sector is well-positioned to become a significant contributor to Canada’s economy by driving new export opportunities, advancing our science and engineering know-how, building our capacity to manufacture green hydrogen production systems like our RuggedCell™ water electrolyzers, and creating high-value jobs. We are proud to be part of this economic journey.”

Matt Harper, President, Invinity Energy Systems

“Canada is not just ready to compete globally — we’re ready to lead the clean‑energy transition. From our Vancouver factory we see first‑hand how made‑in‑British Columbia vanadium flow batteries are accelerating that transition while creating durable local jobs.”

Mustafa Bulut, Chief Operating Officer and Interim Chief Executive Officer at PowerCo Canada said:

“PowerCo’s $7-billion investment in St. Thomas and the Gigafactory is a strategic, cornerstone project that leverages Canada’s robust clean energy grid and skilled workforce and will establish PowerCo as a global leader in EV battery production, while driving significant economic growth for Canada.”

Source Intelligence has launched its EUDR solution to help companies simplify deforestation risk management and automate compliance workflows ahead of upcoming enforcement deadlines. Purpose-built for the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), the SaaS-based solution enables businesses to streamline supply chain traceability, risk assessment, and due diligence reporting. As companies prepare for the regulation’s requirements, failure to comply could result in fines of up to 4% of annual turnover, making early action essential.

Source Intelligence’s solution enables companies to implement an end-to-end EUDR due diligence workflow, from tracing product origins and validating supplier data to identifying deforestation risk and submitting due diligence statements. A direct integration with the EU TRACES platform allows Source Intelligence to submit statements on behalf of clients as an authorized representative, helping companies streamline final reporting requirements.

With Source Intelligence’s EUDR solution, companies can:

Enhance supply chain visibility by mapping sub-tier relationships and tracking sourcing activity in real time

Identify deforestation risks faster using Article 9-aligned scoring and multi-source environmental datasets

Improve efficiency through automation and a direct connection to EU TRACES

Reduce compliance risk by proactively flagging high-risk suppliers and sourcing areas using satellite imagery and customizable risk models

The platform’s satellite-powered deforestation detection tools assess land use change with precision and provide actionable insights for risk mitigation. These capabilities are bolstered by real-time data validation, customizable risk assessments, and centralized documentation-all designed to help companies operationalize the three-step due diligence process outlined by the European Commission.

“The EUDR requires companies to reach deeper into their supply chains, gather more specific data, and act on risk with greater speed,” said Mike Flynn, Chief Product Officer at Source Intelligence. “Our solution is designed to make that process manageable-combining automation, advanced risk screening, and satellite monitoring to help businesses take control of their due diligence obligations before enforcement begins.”

While the EUDR is already in force, operators and traders must fully implement the required due diligence process by December 30, 2025. Micro and small enterprises have until June 30, 2026. With deadlines fast approaching, Source Intelligence offers a streamlined path to readiness. Interested organizations are invited to schedule a demo and experience the advanced EUDR solution firsthand.

These provisions affect qualification for multiple IRA tax credits and influence how clean energy projects are structured, financed, and sourced going forward. Here’s what you need to know:

BOC IRS Guidance Now Law

IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59 are now codified into the law, helping to determine BOC eligibility more accurately

There are two ways to measure BOC

Physical work of a significant nature, and/or

5% Safe Harbor

Continuity requirement: After BOC is established, taxpayers must maintain continuous efforts to advance the project.

Compliance Tip: Keep detailed records of invoices, contracts, and construction milestones to demonstrate continuous construction efforts and protect eligibility through IRS review or audit.

FEOC and Foreign Influence Restrictions

H.R. 1 sets new eligibility rules for projects that source materials from foreign entities considered a risk to U.S. interests.

All prohibited foreign entities (PFEs) feature new restrictions, including

Specified foreign entities (SFEs), and

Foreign-influenced entities (FIEs)

Material Assistance Cost Ratio: Taxpayers must calculate this ratio to determine if PFE inputs exceed allowable limits, based on a threshold percentage that changes by year and technology type.

Compliance Tip: Developers and manufacturers should review ownership structures and supply chains for ties to foreign entities flagged under H.R. 1. Continuously track sourcing costs to ensure your project doesn’t exceed allowed foreign content thresholds.

We pay Congress to be lawmakers... MARTIN: Yes.","STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

Next, we follow up on the larger meaning of a vote in Congress. Lawmakers approved a Trump administration request to claw back funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting. Some voted yes. Even though they said the request was so vague, they did not know what they were voting for. One was Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

THOM TILLIS: We have no earthly idea what specific cuts will occur, but I'm willing to give OMB and the president the benefit of the doubt that they're going to be responsible cuts.

INSKEEP: Tillis voted for the measure that he said he had no earthly idea about, as did Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

ROGER WICKER: Please give us specific information about where the cuts will come. Let's not make a habit of this. Let's not consider this a precedent.

INSKEEP: All this raises a question - did Congress abdicate its job and its traditional power of the purse? Jonathan Martin has seen a lot of politics. He's a columnist with Politico, and he's on the line once again. Jonathan, good morning.

JONATHAN MARTIN: Morning, Steve.

INSKEEP: How differently did this Congress act last week than Congress has in the past?

MARTIN: Well, it's so rare to see Congress give up perhaps its most prized power, which is the ability to control federal spending. You know, lawmakers crave the ability to direct spending in their states and districts. And to see this, I think, underlines, Steve, the loyalty that the Republican Party today has to Donald Trump and his White House. This is not about the underlying package of cuts to various programs for public broadcasting. This is about saluting what Trump and his White House wants and voting the party line, and doing so, as those clips make clear, without even knowing what the actual substance of the bill is.

INSKEEP: I want to underline this. These are taxpayer-funded jobs. We are taxpayers. We pay Congress to be lawmakers...

MARTIN: Yes.

INSKEEP: ...To be assertive in these...

MARTIN: Yes.

INSKEEP: ...Taxpayer-funded jobs. Did they abandon their responsibility?

MARTIN: Well, it's hard to conclude otherwise if they're openly saying that they don't know what they're voting on but they're still going to be toeing the party line. And it's not terribly different, Steve, than the big piece of legislation that they passed earlier this month, the tax bill, I guess, the tax bill-plus, you could call it, in which I think a lot of these lawmakers were simply voting in an up or down referendum on Donald Trump. And that's really what this is all about. Increasingly, politics has become tribal. It's about the front of the jersey rather than the back of the jersey, to put it in sports terms, not about the individual. It's about voting for the team. The team, in this case, is Team Trump.

INSKEEP: I think if you're in favor of Trump or just an outside analyst, you can say that Trump was fairly clever to cram everything into that one giant bill because it became an up or down vote on Trump.

MARTIN: Including, by the way, raising the debt ceiling, which your listeners know is anathema for a lot of the sort of far-right crowd in today's Congress. And the fact that that was put in the bill was precisely because it gave those folks no choice when everything else was also in the bill. Yes.

INSKEEP: Brian Schatz of Hawaii, a Democrat, told his fellow senators that they were abdicating something that they really like, abdicating their own power, and that they would come to regret it.

MARTIN: Yes.

INSKEEP: What does happen now to the much more bipartisan appropriations process, where traditionally...

MARTIN: Yeah.

INSKEEP: ...Especially in the Senate, lawmakers from both parties weigh in, and they come to a compromise?

MARTIN: Well, it was no coincidence that the lawmakers who did vote against this in the Republican caucus and the Senate all happened to be appropriators. Collins, Murkowski and McConnell all understand the power of the purse because they've been on that panel. You make a really good point, Steve. There's an old joke about Congress that there's three parties - there's Democrats, Republicans and appropriators. The appropriators always found themselves to be the most bipartisan members because they were going over the goodies. They were trying to figure out who could get what for their states and districts in terms of federal spending. And this is the opposite of that.

You know, this is not only giving up institutional power. It is cutting spending rather than finding ways to direct it for your political benefit, which, of course, was the way for decades and decades in Congress. And Schatz raises an important point. What happens now when a Democrat is in charge in the White House, and the Republicans in Congress are not going to want to give up their spending authority? But there's now a precedent set.

INSKEEP: Chuck Schumer suggested this ruins the appropriations process, and Democrats won't play ball in a few weeks when they need to get a budget done. Do you believe that?

MARTIN: I think it's going to make everything harder, including keeping the government open. It's hard to see any goodwill left between either party, Steve, on the Hill. And I think, given that, that we are headed toward at least the threat of a shutdown this fall.

INSKEEP: Jonathan Martin of Politico, it's always a pleasure to hear from you. Thanks.

MARTIN: Thank you, Steve.

Maxine Joselow reports for The New York Times.

In short:

The EPA extended key deadlines for coal ash cleanup by a year, giving utilities until 2027 to report contamination and until 2029 to begin groundwater monitoring and cleanup planning.

President Trump signed proclamations exempting certain coal plants and industrial facilities from pollution rules for two years, citing national security and technical limitations.

Critics argue the delay exposes communities — often low-income and near coal plants — to ongoing risks from contaminants like lead and mercury in drinking water.

Key quote:

“It’s one more year of hazardous contaminants getting into the groundwater. And the more chemicals that get into the groundwater, the more difficult and expensive it is to remediate.”

— Lisa Evans, senior counsel at Earthjustice

Why this matters:

Coal ash is the toxic residue left after coal is burned for electricity. It contains dangerous heavy metals such as arsenic, lead, mercury, and lithium, which can seep into groundwater and contaminate drinking water supplies. Exposure to these contaminants is linked to cancer, neurological damage, and developmental delays in children. Hundreds of coal ash sites exist across the United States, many near low-income communities and communities of color.

In June, Redwood Materials, which is based in Carson City, launched Redwood Energy, a new business that deploys both used EV packs and new modules into fast, low-cost energy-storage systems built to meet surging power demand from AI data centers and other applications.

The collaboration marks a significant step toward taking GM’s advanced battery technology beyond EVs, and builds on GM and Redwood’s existing collaboration.

“The market for grid-scale batteries and backup power isn’t just expanding, it’s becoming essential infrastructure,” says Kurt Kelty, vice president of batteries, propulsion, and sustainability at GM.

“Electricity demand is climbing, and it’s only going to accelerate. To meet that challenge, the U.S. needs energy storage solutions that can be deployed quickly, economically, and made right here at home. GM batteries can play an integral role.”

The memorandum enables Redwood to pair that integration expertise with both second-life GM EV packs and new U.S.-built batteries, delivering a domestic solution from cell to system.

Already, GM second-life electric vehicle batteries are being repurposed to help power the largest second-life battery development in the world and the largest microgrid in North America, at Redwood’s 12MW/63MWh installation in Sparks, Nevada, supporting the AI infrastructure company Crusoe.

“Electricity demand is accelerating at an unprecedented pace, driven by AI and the rapid electrification of everything from transportation to industry,” says JB Straubel, founder and CEO of Redwood Materials.

“Both GM’s second-life EV batteries and new batteries can be deployed in Redwood’s energy storage systems, delivering fast, flexible power solutions and strengthening America’s energy and manufacturing independence.”

U.S. electricity demand continues to grow, driven in part by AI data centers that are on track to triple their share of national electricity usage to 12 percent by 2028 from 4.4 percent today.

The goal is to protect Texas energy jobs and companies from pressure tied to environmental activism.
The company said it had changed its approach and was no longer targeting fossil fuel companies.
The report recommends Texas officials review BlackRock’s actions and consider putting the company back on the boycott list to protect the state’s energy industry.
“But those aren’t reasons to let them skirt Texas law.”","(The Center Square) – A new report says BlackRock, the world’s largest investment firm, is still acting against fossil fuel companies in violation of Texas law, even though the company was recently removed from the state’s boycott list.

Texas passed a law in 2021 called Senate Bill 13. It’s aimed at preventing financial companies from punishing or limiting business with fossil fuel producers if the reasons go beyond what federal or state law requires. The goal is to protect Texas energy jobs and companies from pressure tied to environmental activism.

Companies on the list are barred from doing business with the Texas state government.

BlackRock was on that boycott list but was removed earlier this year. The company said it had changed its approach and was no longer targeting fossil fuel companies.

However, the American Energy Institute and Consumers’ Research say BlackRock is still pushing companies to meet climate goals that go far beyond the law.

Their joint report points to BlackRock’s voting rules that push companies to set so-called “science-based” net-zero emissions targets; these goals aim to phase out fossil fuels by 2050.

“It’s important, because as they try to escape the consequences of those actions, people need to be served by all the facts,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Center Square in a phone interview. “This report puts an end to the mess that BlackRock is currently spreading – that they’ve corrected or ended their actions boycotting or punishing the oil, gas and other industries they think need to eliminate their carbon emissions.”

The report also says BlackRock supports shareholder proposals that would restrict fossil fuel use and even impact farming and cattle production. It notes that BlackRock still refuses to invest in many coal companies and is being sued by the Texas Attorney General over claims it is working with other firms to limit fossil fuel production.

Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute, said in a statement that the 2021 Texas legislation “was designed to protect the livelihoods of millions of Texans and ensure that our capital markets remain accountable to the law rather than to ideologically driven activist campaigns.”

Isaac added that BlackRock’s removal from the boycott list “demonstrates how quickly the commitment to that principle can be undermined when powerful corporations deploy public relations campaigns to obscure their true behavior.”

Isaac further told The Center Square in a statement: “BlackRock never stopped discriminating against American energy companies, it has simply gotten better at disguising it. The evidence shows they still pressure companies to adopt radical net-zero policies, punish directors who don’t comply, and push shareholder demands that would devastate Texas jobs and agriculture. Any action to penalize fossil fuel production is a violation of state law. It’s time policymakers held BlackRock accountable for continuing to weaponize trillions of dollars against the industries that power our economy.”

Texas law defines an energy boycott as any action that harms or limits business with fossil fuel companies based on demands that go beyond existing laws.

The report also notes that BlackRock’s recent exit from some climate groups doesn’t impact how the company pressures fossil fuel producers. BlackRock still participates in these groups through affiliates and keeps similar policies in place, the report said.

The report recommends Texas officials review BlackRock’s actions and consider putting the company back on the boycott list to protect the state’s energy industry.

Hild said he hopes Texas lawmakers take the report seriously and act accordingly.

“Texas has taken a strong position leading the way in pushing back against BlackRock’s abuse of the American economy,” he said. “When they see the truth – that BlackRock is still engaging in that behavior that violates Texas law – we expect them to put the company back on the list.”

“BlackRock may be doing a lot to cozy up to Texas, whether it’s investments in natural gas or the new stock exchange,” he added. “But those aren’t reasons to let them skirt Texas law.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/95/595fabbb-5b14-43e9-bdc4-405ce5e62f3d/686d9fc3252f8.image.jpg,N,,2025-07-21 13:03:28.561423

Until recently, global oil demand peaked every year with the arrival of the Northern Hemisphere’s winter.

If anything, the physical oil market even feels a bit tight.","Shifting seasonality means global demand will be lower in the fourth quarter than the third.

By Javier Blas

The oil market is deceptively calm. Below the apparent tranquility lies an underappreciated transformation that has slowly reshaped the market over the last 25 years — because the arrival of China and India as big consumers hasn’t just given an enormous boost to demand, it’s also altered the market’s seasonality. And that matters a lot this year.

Until recently, global oil demand peaked every year with the arrival of the Northern Hemisphere’s winter. As temperatures dropped from October onward, heating oil and kerosene consumption spiked from the US to Germany to Japan. Hence, as recently as 2014, the fourth quarter still marked the annual high for crude demand and, typically, prices. Since then, the seasonality has flipped: Now, the third quarter sees higher demand and prices.

The shift means the market is now at its tightest from July to September, rather than October to December. While one-time events can still have an effect — the 2008 global financial crisis, for example, or the Covid-19 pandemic that started in early 2020 — looking over a long enough timescale reveals the change clearly. Because it happened incrementally over a quarter of a century, it often doesn’t get the attention it deserves. But the chart below makes it obvious.

Source: Bloomberg calculations based on IEA data

Note: Excludes 2008 due to the impact of the global financial crisis on oil demand, and 2020 and 2021 due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic

The change has three notable features. First, consumption of winter fuels including heating oil and kerosene is on a structural decline in the industrialized world, replaced by natural gas and electricity. Back in 1990, about 17% of American families heated their homes by burning some kind of refined petroleum product; today, that share has fallen to 9%. The collapse in demand for heating oil in Europe is even more pronounced. At the same time, jet-fuel consumption in those regions, which typically peaks during the summer holidays, is growing fast.

Second, oil demand in fast-growing emerging nations follows different seasonal patterns, partly because of their locations closer to the equator, but also because of the larger role of their all-year-round industrial oil consumption. While industrialized nations mostly abandoned oil-fired power stations after the 1970s energy crisis, some emerging market countries, particularly in the Middle East, burn lots of crude for electricity generation and water desalination. At the peak last summer, Saudi Arabia burned more than 800,000 barrels a day to generate electricity for air conditioning — more than the daily total petroleum demand of Belgium.

And third, climate change is reducing heating consumption by making winters warmer, and boosting holiday travel by making summers hotter.

So this year, global third-quarter oil demand will be 500,000 barrels a day higher than fourth-quarter consumption. In a dataset going back to 1991, the current year will mark only the fifth time when winter demand will be lower than summer consumption.

Despite rising production from the OPEC+ cartel, oil prices have stabilized in recent weeks at just over $65 a barrel — about $10 above the lows seen in early May. If anything, the physical oil market even feels a bit tight. It helps that China has mopped up much of the oil surplus, putting in May and June barrels into its expanding strategic and commercial stockpiles.

Source: ICE Europe Ltd

But the squeeze will prove temporary; put another way, the market is defying gravity. Because of shifting seasonality, the Northern Hemisphere’s summer is now the tightest period of the year. Winter — and an accompanying decrease in demand — is coming.

For now, the few remaining oil bulls have a few straws of hope to cling to. Global crude refinery intake is rising swiftly this month and looks set to peak in August at a record 85.4 million barrels a day — enough to absorb the series of OPEC output increases. As a result, global oil stocks aren’t increasing meaningfully near where it matters most to the market: the pricing points in northwestern Europe, home of the Brent benchmark, and the central area of the US, home to the West Texas Intermediate yardstick.

But by October, when all of the cartel’s supply hikes will have arrived, along with extra oil from Brazil, Guyana and Canada, refinery throughput will drop to 81.7 million barrels a day, according to the International Energy Agency. The difference – 3.7 million barrels a day – is equal to a couple of mid-sized OPEC nations. Even if China continues stockpiling as much as it has done over the last two months, the surplus would be so large that oil will flow into inventories elsewhere, including near the pricing points on both sides of the Atlantic.

For sure, the market – and I – may be wrong about demand, supply, or both. The expected oil surplus during the now seasonally weaker fourth quarter may be smaller than anticipated. Still, on paper, the glut is so big that even if it turns to be a bit smaller, it would still be enough to put a lot of downward pressure on the market.

As I said, winter is coming for the oil market.

Coal-fueled power in the United States will cost about $230/MWh in the United States and about $270/MWh in Europe in 2030, according to the report.
By then, gas-fired power will cost about $100/MWh in the United States and about $150/MWh in Europe, it said.
In the report’s “high coal demand case,” thermal coal use plateaus and then falls slowly toward 2050, remaining 32% higher on average.
“Our high coal demand case is … a reminder of what can still be prevented.” It’s unclear how durable coal demand will prove if near-term demand pushes up prices and Western financial institutions remain reluctant to finance new mining projects, WoodMac said.","Dive Brief:

Rising electricity demand and a slowdown in the buildout of alternative sources of power generation could extend the use of coal globally and displace 2,100 GW of gas and renewables by 2050, Wood Mackenzie said in a report earlier this month.

Under a high demand scenario,coal-fired power generation could peak in 2030, four years later than the analysis’ “base case” forecast.

The economics and politics of coal are strongest in Asia. In the United States, coal is more expensive than gas or solar and storage, but the cost of building new gas power plants has nearly doubled and long-duration energy storage technology is not yet mature enough to convert solar and wind into true “baseload” resources, the report said.

Dive Insight:

In Asia, national security concerns and economics favor coal for now, said Anthony Knutson, global head of thermal coal markets at Wood Mackenzie, although when it comes to just levelized cost, hybrid solar and storage remain cheaper than coal or gas.

“While the long-term trajectory towards renewables remains intact, the path is proving far more complex than many anticipated as countries grapple with energy security and affordability concerns,” Knutson said in a statement.

Wood Mackenzie expects the levelized cost of unabated coal-fired power in the Asia and Pacific region to remain below $100/MWh in 2030, lower than the expected levelized cost of gas-fired power there.

Coal-fueled power in the United States will cost about $230/MWh in the United States and about $270/MWh in Europe in 2030, according to the report. By then, gas-fired power will cost about $100/MWh in the United States and about $150/MWh in Europe, it said.

Hybrid solar and storage will undercut coal and gas in all three regions, coming in around $60/MWh in Asia, $70/MWh in Europe and $80/MWh in the United States.

Though the economics of gas-fired generation are more favorable in the U.S. than in Asian and European countries that rely on liquefied natural gas imports, its ability to match surging AI load growth forecasts is limited, the report said. While long-duration energy storage technology has advanced significantly in recent years, it cannot provide baseload power yet, it said.

It’s also becoming more expensive to replace aging coal plants with gas and renewables, causing “sticker shock” for power producers looking to make the switch, the report said. It blamed tariffs, reshoring of production and infrastructure delays for pushing up the cost of new solar while noting a near-doubling of U.S. costs for new gas power plant builds.

Higher replacement costs and rising capacity market prices are increasing the value of existing coal assets, WoodMac said. Capacity prices rose nearly tenfold across parts of the PJM Interconnection last year, leading the grid operator to set a capacity price “collar” for its next two auctions.

In the report’s “high coal demand case,” thermal coal use plateaus and then falls slowly toward 2050, remaining 32% higher on average. The base case sees thermal coal use peaking next year and falling steadily through 2030.

Combined with a corresponding slowdown in additions of cleaner power generating capacity and without “significant investment in carbon capture and storage capacity,” carbon emissions from unabated coal could rise by 2 billion tonnes, according to the report.

WoodMac said that could further threaten international efforts to limit warming to 2°C or less, which renowned U.S. climate scientist James Hansen called “dead” earlier this year. Hansen first warned of the dangers of human-caused climate change in a 1988 Congressional hearing that environmentalists credit with raising public awareness of the issue.

The analysis is not a forecast but “a warning of what inaction could bring,” Wood Mackenzie Director of Energy Transition Practice David Brown said in a statement.

“Without urgent actions, the world faces a growing risk of drifting towards a 3°C pathway,” Brown said. “Our high coal demand case is … a reminder of what can still be prevented.”

It’s unclear how durable coal demand will prove if near-term demand pushes up prices and Western financial institutions remain reluctant to finance new mining projects, WoodMac said. Sovereign wealth funds and private equity groups would need to step up to cover the investment shortfall, it added.

And the global coal fleet’s long-term viability likely rests on asset owners’ willingness to invest in plant upgrades that improve load-following capabilities and overall efficiency; retrofits that allow co-firing with alternative fuels like hydrogen and ammonia; and bolt-on carbon capture infrastructure, WoodMac said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/M1pvuVfVZS_QeIkrwpU4WMDvgebLtOfFooxU0Lx6YPk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9UcnVtcF9jb2FsX3NpZ25pbmcuanBn.webp,N,,2025-07-21 15:01:30.495033

The station's launch follows U Power's delivery of battery-swapping compatible taxis in May 2025.

The new facility, a collaboration between U Power and SUSCO Public Company Limited, marks the first 24/7 smart battery-swapping station in the region designed for electric taxis and ride-hailing fleets. The initiative aims to support the expanding electric vehicle (EV) market in Thailand.

In April 2025, U Power, working with UNEX EV and CP-MG, delivered the initial fleet of swappable electric vehicles now in use as taxis and ride-hailing services in Phuket. The operational station is expected to complete the ecosystem for these vehicles, from power to operation, providing a framework for potential expansion across Southeast Asia.

The Thailand Station is designed to facilitate battery swaps within minutes and is compatible with various vehicle types, including future autonomous vehicles, according to U Power. The station is built to withstand tropical climates, offering protection against heavy precipitation and humidity. U Power stated that this is the first zero-carbon battery-swapping station in the region and will integrate with the company's Battery-bank system, allowing EV drivers to earn ""battery-tokens"" through swapping activities.

Johnny Lee, CEO and Chairman of U Power, stated the company's goal is to establish a comprehensive battery-swapping ecosystem for smart, reliable, and zero-carbon energy solutions. U Power's strategy, termed ""Vehicle-Station-Cloud-Token,"" focuses on creating a data-driven energy infrastructure that integrates mobility energy and digital energy trading.

Industry analysts suggest that the deployment of such infrastructure could be a critical step in accelerating EV adoption in Southeast Asia, a region where range anxiety and charging infrastructure limitations have been noted as challenges for electric mobility growth. The focus on taxi and ride-hailing fleets could also provide a practical testbed for the scalability and efficiency of battery-swapping technology in high-utilization commercial settings. However, the long-term success will likely depend on widespread adoption, standardization of battery packs, and competitive operational costs compared to traditional charging methods.

U Power has also entered into several agreements in other regions, including a partnership with Beijing Foton to promote battery-swapping compatible electric heavy trucks, buses, and vans in Southeast Asia, South America, Hong Kong, and Macau. The company also announced plans to deploy 5,000 swappable EVs and corresponding stations in Singapore and to launch its first station in Peru in partnership with Ualabee.

LS Power Making Deals

LS Power has had a particularly active 2025 so far.

In June, LS Power acquired ENGIE Services, rebranding it to its previous name, OPTERRA Energy Services. OPTERRA provides comprehensive energy solutions including energy efficiency upgrades, renewable energy systems, energy storage, microgrids, operations and maintenance, HVAC, and lighting as well as measurement and verification services. Since 1974, OPTERRA has completed more than 9,000 public sector projects across North America, including the City of Milpitas’ integrated energy and water savings program, which is projected to save the city more than $30 million; the modernization of 72,000 streetlights for the District of Columbia; and Chula Vista Elementary School District’s 8.1 megawatts of solar installed across 48 sites and microgrid for emergency backup.

In May, LS Power announced plans to sell off a portfolio of natural gas generation facilities and a commercial and industrial virtual power plant platform CPower to NRG Energy in a cash and common stock transaction valued at approximately $12.0 billion Enterprise Value, representing an acquisition multiple of 7.5x 2026 EV/EBITDA, or 50% of estimated new build replacement cost. The acquisition doubles NRG’s generation capacity with the addition of 18 natural gas-fired facilities totaling approximately 13 GW. These facilities, located across nine states, expand NRG’s generation footprint in the Northeast and Texas, where most of its load is located. CPower, a leading C&I VPP platform, operates in all the country’s deregulated energy markets and has approximately 6 GW of capacity representing more than 2,000 commercial and industrial customers.

In January, LS Power completed its acquisition of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corporation’s large-scale renewable energy business. With the close of the transaction, LS Power formed a new company, Clearlight Energy, the new destination for the BP onshore wind projects mentioned above. Clearlight manages and grows acquired operating wind and solar assets, located throughout the United States and Canada; 44 projects with more than 3,000 MW of generating capacity.

Algonquin’s renewable energy business boasted a development pipeline of 8,000 MW of renewable and storage projects throughout North America. Clearlight Energy acquired 1,800 MW of the development pipeline.

The bill ends a wide range of clean energy tax credits that have supported investment in wind, solar, and energy-efficient technologies. These credits didn’t just help homeowners go solar, they incentivized larger-scale clean energy projects that would have expanded Arizona’s electricity supply, lowered prices, and created thousands of jobs.

Now, with those incentives gone, electricity prices are set to rise faster than they otherwise would have, and lower-income households will be hit hardest.

Electricity is the second-largest household expense for low-income families, behind only rent—and it ranks higher than food. The nonpartisan Energy Innovation Policy & Technology analysis finds that, thanks to HR1, electricity prices in Arizona will increase much faster than they otherwise would have.

Electricity Price Impacts of HR1 In Arizona

Assessing Impacts Of HR1 On U.S. Energy Costs, Jobs, Health, Emissions

Here’s what’s coming because of HR1:

Wholesale electricity prices in Arizona are forecast to increase 18% by 2030 beyond what they otherwise would have risen, and 69% by 2035.

Arizona households could see $140 higher electricity bills each year by 2030, and $220 more by 2035 – that’s in addition to the hikes that would already have been projected to occur without HR1.

Commercial and industrial electricity users will also have price hikes; costs they will pass on to customers.

Why the increase in electricity prices under HR1? Arizona is expected to lose 10 gigawatts of electricity generation capacity by 2035 due to HR1’s rollback of clean energy tax credits. For low-income families, these rising utility bills have a ripple effect. Many will face choices between paying the rent, or keeping the A/C on, or buy groceries.

When electricity bills outpace even food costs, the social determinants of health start are harmed. Access to utilities is as vital to health as access to doctors. Losing that access through disconnection, eviction, or constant stress leads to chronic stress and mental health decline, increased risk of heat-related illness and respiratory conditions, poor developmental outcomes in children as families are forced into survival mode.

That’s capacity that would have kept prices down. Instead, utilities like APS will have every excuse to push prices even higher, especially since they at least currently have a super-compliant regulator (the ACC).

APS Rate Hikes & the Corporation Commission’s Industry Capture are Undermining Health – AZ Public Health Association

And it’s not just households that will suffer. EIPT forecasts $3.9B in lost GDP and up to 20,000 clean energy jobs lost in Arizona by 2035 due to HR1. That’s fewer employment opportunities and less economic resilience especially in rural and underserved communities.

This is a textbook case of how energy policy becomes health policy.

By stripping clean energy incentives, HR1 threatens not just our climate goals but the stability and health of Arizona families. It’s a silent crisis—until the bills come due.",https://azpha.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cropped-icon-04-32x32.png,N,,2025-07-21 13:01:23.522321

It's expected to become the world's first small mass-market EV equipped with a semi-solid-state battery.

The estimated range is 537 kilometers (333 miles) on China's Light-Duty Test Cycle.

Solid-state batteries have long been regarded as the crown jewel of EV tech—offering the promise of more range, faster charging, better cold-weather performance and lower fire risk thanks to superior thermal stability.

But a single solid-state battery that delivers all of those benefits and remains affordable is unlikely to materialize anytime soon. Like today’s lithium-ion batteries, different flavors of solid-state tech will likely emerge, each optimized for specific use cases.

Now, in the world’s largest EV market, we’re seeing the first signs of that future coming to life. China is already the hotbed of battery manufacturing and innovation and it’s now about to bring a semi–solid-state battery to an affordable mass-market vehicle.

British carmaker MG Motor—owned by China’s state-backed SAIC Motor—has announced that its compact MG4 hatchback, priced between 80,000 yuan and 120,000 yuan (around $11,000 to $16,500), will soon come with a semi–solid-state battery.

If so, it would be the first truly budget EV in the world to use the technology, CarNewsChina reported.

It’s an early sign that this next-gen tech won’t be limited to expensive cars or performance-focused models. It can be engineered for affordable EVs also and maybe even serve as a better alternative to lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries.

In a conventional EV battery, a liquid electrolyte allows ions to move between electrodes during charging and discharging. Solid-state batteries swap the liquid for a solid electrolyte. Semi–solid-state batteries, as the name suggests, use a gel-like electrolyte, offering a hybrid solution that mixes the aspects of both designs. MG's battery will use only 5% liquid electrolyte.

As with all battery chemistries, it’s about tradeoffs. The pack going into the MG4, supplied by Chinese battery maker QingTao Energy, has an energy density of around 180 watt hours per kilogram. That’s significantly lower than Tesla’s 4680 lithium-ion cells, which are estimated at 272–296 Wh/kg. They’re also far behind American startup Factorial’s semi–solid-state cells rated at 375 Wh/kg.

But it seems like this battery wasn’t built to win range contests. The goal here appears to be affordability, cold-weather performance and safety—especially compared to LFP batteries, which dominate the Chinese EV market.

The MG4 is expected to deliver 537 kilometers of range on the China Light-Duty Test Cycle, which translates to roughly 217 miles under the stricter EPA test (assuming a 35% reduction). For a $16,500 compact hatch, that’s impressive. It outpaces the BYD Seagull’s 415 km CLTC range. It may be a perfect daily driver or even a road tripper, thanks to China’s excellent charging infrastructure.

MG says the battery maintains its range and performance even at -7°C (19°F) and has passed rigorous safety tests, including puncture torture tests. The pack’s 70 kWh capacity—larger than the Seagull’s 30–43.2 kWh LFP battery—also helps explain its superior range.

Too bad it won’t come to the U.S. This is the type of EV that’s actually been missing stateside and something EV fans have been clamoring for.

Semi-solid-state batteries are being developed in the U.S., too. But the development here seems to be focused more on longer range and performance, not much on affordability—not in the short-term at least.

Stellantis will start testing the Dodge Charger Daytona EV with a solid-state battery next year. Mercedes-Benz and BMW have already installed solid-state batteries in a prototype EQS and an i7.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/VzvMPR/s1/2025-mg4-ev.jpg,N,,2025-07-21 15:01:21.018563

In the wake of the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” (OBBBA) there has been a rush to assess the impact of this legislation on the energy sector, and especially on clean energy investment. As has been widely reported, the new bill undoes much of the clean energy subsidies contained in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Shortly before and after the passing of the IRA, there was a cottage industry producing analyses about how much new clean electricity generation it would induce, and how far it might take us toward targets like the Paris climate agreements. Now that many of these IRA provisions are being dropped, a new set of studies are emerging with estimates of what the repeal of these provisions will do.

The coverage I’ve seen of the removal of the IRA subsidies shares the same weakness of much of the coverage of the IRA’s passage. There is too much focus on overly specific numbers presented with an implied level of scientific precision, when in fact we are all making educated guesses about what tilting the economics of generation investment might do.

Almost all of these studies used some kind of long-run engineering electricity planning model. These deterministic models co-optimize the investment and operation of existing and newly deployed electricity supply technologies subject to the requirement to satisfy electricity demand in a single or sequence of future years. Typically both operational characteristics of specific generation technologies and limits of the transmission network are also captured, with varying degrees of detail and methods.

These models are necessarily very complex, and can be very sensitive to modeler choices of both input assumptions and model specifications. Even so, engineering models often miss some “real-world” frictions, like NIMBYs, that can delay construction, and can therefore over-estimate the amount of new generation that will be built. Sensitivity to input assumptions is typically tested using specific scenarios, with some kind of “high”, “low”, and middle scenario typically presented.

The range of outcomes one can get from models like these, let alone from the real world, can be very wide. My colleague Aaron Smith and I have been on a mission to change the conversation about how these models should be used and consumed by the policy community. The world is an uncertain place, and we need to consider how policies interact with those uncertainties. In a 2024 paper on the IRA, we combined statistical forecasting methods with a simplified electricity expansion model to try to generate statistically rigorous “error bars” around the effects policies like the IRA can have on energy markets.

For example, one of the big determinants of electricity market outcomes is the price of natural gas. For more than 20 years, natural gas plants have usually set the price in wholesale power markets. The higher the cost of gas, the more attractive renewable sources like wind and solar get. Conversely, if natural gas prices remain low, or drop even lower, investment in gas powered combined cycle plants might see a resurgence.

We don’t know what the natural gas price will be 10 years from now, but we can estimate a statistical distribution of the possible outcomes. The same goes for other drivers of generation investment, like electricity demand and interest rates. We developed joint forecasts of these variables for a target year of 2030 and tested the impact of a $26 production tax credit on the optimal investment levels.

In the OBBBA, most of the largest cuts in IRA tax expenditures come from ending a production tax credit earned by newly constructed renewable energy generation. This credit depended upon several criteria, and ranged in value from $15 to potentially $35 per MWh, but most projects were expected to earn a credit worth $26/MWh. In our earlier work, we ran our simulation for the year of 2030 in the western US electricity grid (WECC), evaluating investment levels for each of 1000 draws of potential future market conditions. Our results implied that not only do the tax credits increase the amount of new renewable energy coming out of an expansion model, they also raise the floor on the range of those amounts.

In order to see what an IRA phase-out would do to this, I tried the same exercise with different hypothetical levels of a production tax credit. I looked at tax credits of $6.5, $13, and $19.5 per MWh, along with the “no PTC” credit level of zero. This figure plots the range of (additional) renewable energy generation in the western grid across the range of possible future market conditions. The high end of the range of future renewable energy is largely unaffected by the PTC. These are future states of the world where electricity growth is robust, natural gas prices are high, and interest rates are reasonably low (or at least not super high). It is the mirror image future states of the world, in which natural gas prices fall below even current levels, where the IRA has its largest impact. These are the possible futures where renewables would not be economic but for the IRA tax credits.

The impact on GHG emissions in the WECC is, not surprisingly, almost the inverse picture. With no renewable PTC, there is a wide range of possible annual emissions. Heavily subsidizing renewable MWh certainly reduces mean emissions, but the most remarkable impact is how much it narrows the range of potential annual emissions. Removing the incentives takes the grid back to a very uncertain world.

Policies like the IRA’s electricity production subsidies can significantly reduce the uncertainty of future outcomes. The elimination of the subsidies means a much wider range of outcomes. To our minds, this is an important aspect of energy modeling that is largely missed by the fact that these studies are overwhelmingly dominated by deterministic engineering models.

In many cases, information about the distribution of future outcomes is more important than a specific point estimate of the single most likely outcome. Outlets like 538 helped reshape the narrative around elections from binary outcomes like “calling states” to more probabilistic framings. When it comes to energy and climate policy, we should work to do the same.

In his first six months back in office, Trump signed multiple executive orders to boost coal, oil, and gas while gutting green energy tax credits and defunding climate-related science.

Trump’s administration is shutting down 10 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) labs and plans to reduce the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency workforce by at least 23%.

Experts and former officials say Trump is dismantling the science infrastructure that supports public health and environmental protections, while rewarding fossil fuel donors.

Key quote:

“Trump’s actions are a patent attempt to roll back decades of environmental progress, not because it makes any sense, economically, but because it does two things that Trump wants.”

— Naomi Oreskes, historian of science at Harvard University

Why this matters:

Climate science, public health, and weather forecasting all depend on the integrity and funding of federal agencies like NOAA, the EPA, and USGS. These agencies monitor pollution, study severe weather, and provide data that protects communities from disasters. Gutting them not only hinders our ability to respond to climate threats but erases decades of progress built by bipartisan investment in science. The government's dismantling of this research capacity jeopardizes early warning systems, undermines health protections, and leaves frontline communities more exposed to flooding, heat waves, and air pollution.

In short:

Inland counties in North Carolina suffered the highest death toll from Hurricane Helene, largely due to absent flood evacuation plans and delayed local warnings despite accurate federal forecasts.

While Florida’s coastal areas issued early, mandatory evacuations based on long experience with hurricanes, most inland North Carolina counties treated themselves as safe zones — guiding coastal evacuees in, not preparing to flee themselves.

Climate change has dramatically increased the amount of water storms can carry, causing record-breaking rainfall events and shifting the deadliest hurricane impacts from coastal surge to inland floods.

Key quote:

“Any given community can’t know if it’s going to be the next one that’s going to have a flood that is orders of magnitude larger than the largest flood they’ve known. But we must all know now that we should be prepared.”

— Rachel Hogan Carr, co-chair, World Meteorological Organization flood warning project

Why this matters:

Climate change is intensifying rainfall in the U.S., causing unprecedented flooding in places far from the coast. Many inland communities — especially in mountainous or riverine regions — lack the evacuation infrastructure, planning, and public messaging that have become standard in hurricane-prone coastal zones. This mismatch has deadly consequences: More than half of hurricane-related deaths now stem from freshwater flooding, a figure that has doubled over the past decade. Local governments often don't issue evacuation orders in time, partly due to terrain and logistics, but also because of outdated assumptions about where danger lies.

In short:

After Hurricane Francine, the nonprofit Imagine Water Works distributed emergency supplies, posted heat safety tips, and offered sanctuary for LGBTQ+ Louisianans, who are at greater risk of displacement after disasters.

A landmark academic paper published in 2022, “Queer and Present Danger,” revealed LGBTQ+ people face higher risks during climate emergencies due to housing insecurity, lack of family support, and discrimination in shelters.

Legislative backlash has escalated under the Trump administration and in states nationwide, undermining protections for LGBTQ+ people even as extreme weather events accelerate.

Key quote:

“We stand firm in our joy and in our belonging even through the storm.”

— Chenier Klie Kliebert, director of Imagine Water Works

Why this matters:

Climate disasters do not affect everyone equally. LGBTQ+ people, especially those who are also people of color or low-income, face disproportionate harm in the aftermath of hurricanes, wildfires, and heatwaves. They’re more likely to lack stable housing, face discrimination in shelters, and be left out of official recovery planning. Studies have shown that in states with anti-LGBTQ+ laws, rates of disaster displacement and mental health crises are significantly higher among queer and trans people. With federal disaster agencies underfunded and emergency systems fraying, the burden increasingly falls on mutual aid networks like those in New Orleans.

In short:

Texas meteorologists warned of severe flash flooding days before a July 4 disaster killed at least 133 people, but some local authorities and camps delayed evacuation despite clear alerts.

In Los Angeles, officials failed to act decisively on strong fire weather warnings in January, contributing to a wildfire that killed 12 and destroyed over 6,000 structures.

Experts point to “warning fatigue,” gaps in communication, and inconsistent responses by emergency officials as reasons alerts often fail to trigger lifesaving decisions.

Key quote:

“I don’t want to ever see a nightmare like [this]. It’s 2025. We shouldn’t be doing this.”

— Chris Suchan, chief meteorologist, WOAI-TV Channel 4

Why this matters:

As climate change fuels more intense weather events, timely responses to official warnings are critical to saving lives. But disasters in Texas and California show that even when alerts are accurate and early, action can lag due to skepticism, lack of coordination, or simple human error. Flash floods, wildfires, and other extreme events are hitting with increasing frequency, but public trust in warnings may be eroding due to perceived false alarms. The human and environmental costs of delayed evacuations or unheeded alerts can be devastating. Without stronger systems for communication and accountability, both the health and safety of communities and the integrity of emergency management remain in jeopardy.

In short:

Andre Correa do Lago, Brazil’s veteran climate diplomat and COP30 president, says global conflicts and economic tensions are distracting leaders from climate commitments.

Despite hosting the summit in the Amazon, Brazil is facing scrutiny for auctioning oil rights near sensitive ecosystems, while defending the decision as a tool to fund clean energy transition.

The U.S. government under President Trump has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, weakening global cooperation, though many U.S. states and cities continue to follow its goals independently.

Key quote:

“Unfortunately, we are having wars, we're having very serious things happening, but in spite of that, climate change is progressing, and climate change is a bigger and bigger threat.”

— Andre Correa do Lago, president of COP30

Why this matters:

Global temperatures have now stayed above 1.5 degrees Celsius for twelve consecutive months — a marker long considered a red line for preventing widespread ecological and social disruption. Scientists warn that even temporary overshoot will fuel stronger storms, deeper droughts, and surging health risks. At the same time, oil and gas production continues to rise, especially in countries like Brazil that sit atop valuable fossil reserves. Meanwhile, diplomatic focus has shifted to wars and trade disputes, making global cooperation harder just when it’s most needed. Climate change remains a borderless threat, and delays in cutting emissions will be felt in air quality, water availability, disease patterns, and disaster intensity around the world — especially by those least equipped to adapt.

In short:

The EPA confirmed it will eliminate its research office, a division central to assessing health and environmental risks, after months of denials and following a green light from the U.S. Supreme Court to proceed with deep cuts to federal agencies.

The office, which once employed over 1,100 scientists, has already seen more than 325 staff depart, with further layoffs expected though not yet initiated formally.

Critics say the move weakens science-based policy, while supporters, including industry groups, argue it reduces bureaucracy and increases efficiency.

Key quote:

The science office “is the heart and brain of the E.P.A. Without it, we don’t have the means to assess impacts upon human health and the environment. Its destruction will devastate public health in our country.”

— Justin Chen, president of A.F.G.E. Council 238

Why this matters:

Independent research from the EPA’s science office has guided public policy on drinking water safety, air quality, and chemical exposure for decades. By shutting it down, the government significantly limits its ability to respond to environmental health risks, such as wildfire smoke, fracking-related pollution, and toxic chemical exposure. The move will delay and weaken action on a wide range of human health threats, including cancer-linked substances and endocrine disruptors in the environment.

In short:

President Trump’s allies are exploring plans to privatize the National Weather Service (NWS), which currently provides free public forecasts, warnings, and emergency alerts.

If successful, the move could channel federal weather data to private firms for resale, benefiting companies with ties to current Trump cabinet members.

Critics warn that privatization would make critical forecasts less accessible, particularly for low-income communities that rely on free alerts during natural disasters.

Why this matters:

The National Weather Service issues warnings for hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and other extreme events that can mean the difference between life and death. Privatizing these services could restrict access, placing low-income and rural communities at particular risk. Historically, private weather companies have lobbied to limit public access so they can profit from repackaging taxpayer-funded data. This raises deep concerns about environmental justice and equity, especially as climate change fuels more severe and frequent disasters.

“The renewable lobby claims that new gas plants can’t be built in time to meet rising power demand.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – In case you missed it, the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board wrote the following op-ed this week highlighting the need unleash reliable American energy including natural gas, oil, coal, hydropower, and nuclear, and discussing why subsidies for unreliable energy sources fail to meet the needs of American communities.

Key Takeaways:

Americans need reliable baseload power, not subsidized renewables that will fail to meet our energy needs. As energy demand increases, proven sources like natural gas, oil, coal, hydropower, and nuclear are the only way to ensure a reliable and stable energy grid.

The Inflation Reduction Act increased subsidies for wind and solar in ways that have distorted energy investments. Because the subsidies can offset more than 50% of a project’s cost, solar and wind became more profitable to build than new baseload gas plants, which jeopardizes our grid.

Power shortfalls are projected for 2030, with 104 gigawatts of baseload power being retired in the next five years. Even if that production is replaced, as planned, with solar and wind, shortfalls will still exist.

Coal, nuclear and gas plants are still needed to back up solar and wind, but they cannot remain profitable if they are only operating part-time. As a result, many plants have been forced to close.

In Case You Missed It…

“Democrats are attacking the GOP’s budget bill for phasing out subsidies for wind and solar power, claiming this will cause power shortages and higher electric rates. The evidence suggests the opposite, as a new Energy Department study illustrates.

“As we’ve been writing for years, the reliability of the U.S. electrical grid is in trouble. The Energy report projects potential power shortfalls in 2030, as 104 gigawatts of baseload power retire in the next five years. But here’s the really bad news: That shortfalls will exist even if that production is replaced, as expected, with 209 gigawatts of the mostly solar and wind generation under development.

“Americans would lose power in 2030 for an average of 817.7 hours (34 days), assuming typical weather conditions. If heat waves or storms stress the grid, outages could reach 55 days. Even without plant shutdowns, Americans would lose power for 269.9 hours (11 days) amid demand growth. The power shortages would be worse in middle America, where demand is growing fastest owing to AI data centers and renewables are displacing coal and gas.

“How can this be? The answer is that the Inflation Reduction Act turbo-charged subsidies for wind and solar in ways that are distorting energy investment. Because the subsidies can offset more than 50% of a project’s cost, solar and wind became more profitable to build than new baseload gas plants. The credits enable wind and solar to under-price coal and gas plants in competitive power markets.

“Any wonder that solar, wind and batteries (which also qualify for IRA subsidies) are projected to make up 93% of new utility-scale electricity capacity this year? Coal, nuclear and gas plants are still needed to back up solar and wind, but they can’t make a profit running only some of the time. Thus many have been closing, jeopardizing grid reliability.

“The renewable lobby claims that new gas plants can’t be built in time to meet rising power demand. Ergo, the argument goes, taxpayers must subsidize wind and solar to meet electric demand. But if what they say is true, why do wind and solar need subsidies? There will be a market incentive to build wind and solar anyway.

“It’s true there’s a shortage of new gas turbines owing to surging global demand. But turbine manufacturers are expanding production, and the phaseout of the IRA tax credits will provide them with more certainty to make investments in new capacity.

“Turbine makers expanded production in the early 2000s as demand for new gas plants rose, but they were left with excess capacity when demand weakened last decade. That was in part because federal subsidies and state renewable mandates encouraged utilities to procure power from solar and wind in lieu of gas.

“Wind and solar projects also face long wait-times to connect to the grid—from four to nine years according to a recent study. The IRA increased delays by increasing the projects in the pipeline. So the phaseout of the tax credits could benefit renewable projects that don’t need subsidies to be economic.

“The claim that tax credits reduce electric rates is contradicted by experience. Wind and solar must be backed by peaker gas plants or batteries, which both cost more than three times as much as baseload power. Renewables also cause price spikes when there are power shortages, and they require more transmission investments to balance fluctuations in loads and frequencies.

“All of this is why Texas’s residential power prices have risen some 40% over the last seven years. The renewable lobby says the financial benefits of the tax credits are passed onto electric customers, which may be true when state-regulated utilities build projects. But the credits usually pad the profits of independent generators.

“The best way to make the grid reliable again is to let supply and demand work in energy markets without the distortions of mandates and subsidies. The GOP budget bill takes a step in that direction that should be welcomed.”

What’s going on in Texas?

Solar Power Plants Continue To Rise In Texas

No doubt about it, US President Donald Trump and his office-holding allies have bent over backwards to shrink the mighty US solar industry down to the size of a kitten. That’s particularly evident in Texas, where the state legislature has turned sour on solar as well.

It didn’t use to be that way. For a number of reasons, Texas — an epicenter of US fossil energy activity — has also become a centerpiece for the domestic solar industry (here and here are two more examples).

Despite the current downwards spiral in energy policy, utility-scale solar power projects continue to stream into Texas, at least for the time being. The flood could soon turn into a trickle, but that’s up to the voters. If solar development slows down, perhaps ratepayers in Texas will begin to wonder why their utility is suddenly investing in more expensive power generation assets when the cleaner, less expensive alternative of solar power is sitting right there at their fingertips.

Whether or not ratepayers will stop wondering and start rising up to use the power of their votes to demand more solar power from their elected officials is another question for another day. However, even if ratepayers are asleep at the wheel, leading corporate energy consumers are not, and the Ash Creek project is a case in point.

Microsoft Backs New Solar Power Plant

Th 408-megawatt (AC) Ash Creek solar power plant is located in Hill County in Texas, between the energy-sucking populations centers Austin and Dallas. The project took several years to reach the start of construction, but once that happened it was off to the races.

The clock started in 2016, when the firms Orion Renewable Energy Group LLC and Eolian initially developed plans for Ash Creek. In 2021 Primergy acquired the project and picked up the pace. One key milestone was an assist from Microsoft, which engaged in a long term power purchase agreement accounting for the entire 408 megawatts. PPAs provide solar developers with guaranteed off-takers, helping to attract investors to a project before construction begins.

A Billion-Dollar Solar Power Plant For Texas

With the Microsoft PPA in hand, in March of 2024 Primergy nailed down $588 million in financing. The transaction was supported by a laundry list of global financial firms including the Japanese firms MUFG Bank (part of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group) and SMBC (Sumimoto Banking Corporation), along with BNP Paribas, Commerzbank AG, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, ING Capital, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, New York Branch, and Rabobank.

If the US solar market dries up as intended, these global investors can simply pack up and take their economic development dollars elsewhere. As of last year, though, the US energy transition was still charging full steam ahead. “We are thrilled to continue our relationship with Primergy and support its growing solar and storage portfolio,” enthused MUFG Managing Director, Project Finance Americas Louise Pesce in a press statement supporting the Ash Creek project, dated March 12 of 2024.

“We are committed to creating a sustainable future by financing solar projects that have a positive community impact, like Ash Creek Solar,” Pesce emphasized.

The $588 million deal was not the end of the money trail. Last fall Primergy also secured another $350 million in tax equity financing, supported by a to-be-named Fortune 500 telecom firm along with Truist Bank, bringing the total to almost $1 billion.

More Solar Power Plants, More Community Benefits

By March of 2024 construction was under way on the Ash Creek project, with the firm SOLV Energy on board as the engineering, procurement, and construction partner. Now here we are midway through 2025 and the clean kilowatts are already flowing into the Texas grid.

“Projects like Ash Creek Solar provide thoughtful energy solutions to meet the needs of consumers, drive long-term value, and strengthen America’s energy independence,” Primergy CEO Ty Daul noted in a press statement on July 17.

“We are proud to work alongside Microsoft, our local stakeholders, and the broader Hill County community to ensure this project delivers reliable and affordable energy to the grid, along with economic growth for the community for years to come,” Daul emphasized, referring to the estimated $100 million in tax payments the Ash Creek project will pump into Hill County.

Lease payments to land owners will also contribute to the local economy. In addition, Primergy and SOLV Energy partnered with the nonprofit education organization Heart of America on improvement projects in the Abbott and Penelope Independent School Districts.

Texas Will Keep Rolling In Solar, For Now

The start of commercial operations for the Ash Creek project follows on the heels of a rapid-fire series of new utility scale solar power plant announcements in theTexas pipeline. In an interesting twist, that includes the Texas utility El Paso Electric’s forthcoming 150-megawatt solar project in neighboring New Mexico. The Texas grid is almost entirely separated from its neighbors, except for a handful of border connections including the El Paso Electric system.

Other than that, the island effect of Texas’s walled-off grid has motivated ERCOT, the Texas grid operator, to support any and all available in-state energy resources, including solar power, with corporate buyers like Microsoft front and center.

Of course, a firm public policy in support of solar power would help. With that out of the picture, Microsoft is reportedly open to giving natural gas an opportunity to power its new data centers. Meta has already gone there, one example being a natural gas plan for its proposed new data center in Louisiana.

For the record, Louisiana has been notoriously late to the solar party. Despite ample sunshine, the state ranks a lowly 31 in installed solar capacity on a 50-state list. In contrast, Texas ranks among the top states right alongside California and Florida.

What Is This EAPA Of Which You Speak?

In another interesting development regarding the solar industry in Texas, Meta has apparently figured out that it can offset (or greenwash, as the case may be) its new gas power plants in Louisiana by supporting more solar power plants in Texas.

Earlier this year Meta signed EAPAs (Environmental Attributes Purchase Agreements) for four solar projects under the wing of the global renewable energy developer Zelestra. On June 25, the firm Adapture Renewables also announced that it reached two EAPAs with Meta, covering two forthcoming solar projects in Texas for a total of 360 megawatts.

“These agreements support Meta’s sustainability goals and reinforce the ongoing collaboration between the two companies to advance clean energy deployment at scale,” Adapture explained.

EAPAs are new to the pages of CleanTechnica. If anyone out there knows exactly how they work, drop a note in the comment thread. As far as I can tell, EAPA refers to the financial transaction that supports RECs (Renewable Energy Credits), so basically it’s another way of saying REC without saying REC.

All that aside, it’s worth noting that Adapture anticipates shunting all 360 megawatts of EAPA-supported solar power into the Texas grid 2027, which is just around the corner.

“The growth in data center load and the expected future growth in data center load are unique and unprecedented and uncertain and require a different approach than simply asserting that it is just supply and demand,” Monitoring Analytics’ report said.

Data centers house the physical infrastructure to power most of the computing we do today, but many AI models and the large AI companies that power them, like Amazon, Meta and Microsoft use vastly more energy than other kinds of computing. Training a single chatbot like ChatGPT uses about the same amount of energy as 100 homes over the course of a year, an AI founder told States Newsroom earlier this year.

The growth of data centers — and how much power they use — came on fast. A 2024 report by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission in Virginia — known as a global hub for data centers — found that PJM forecasts it will use double the amount of average monthly energy in 2033 as it did in 2023. Without new data centers, energy use would only grow 15% by 2040, the report said.

As of July, the United States is home to more than 3,800 data centers, up from more than 3,600 in April. A majority of data centers are connected to the same electrical grids that power residential homes, commercial buildings and other structures.

“There are locational price differences, but data centers added anywhere in PJM have an effect on prices everywhere in PJM,” Joseph Bowring, president of Monitoring Analytics said.

Creeping costs

At least 36 states, both conservative and liberal, offer tax incentives to companies planning on building data centers in their states. But the increased costs that customers are experiencing have made some wonder if the projects are the economic wins they were touted as.

“I’m not convinced that boosting data centers, from a state policy perspective, is actually worth it,” said New Jersey State Sen. Andrew Zwicker, a Democrat and co-sponsor of a bill to separate data centers from regular power supply. “It doesn’t pay for a lot of permanent jobs.”

Energy cost has historically followed a socialized model, based on the idea that everyone benefits from reliable electricity, said Ari Peskoe, the director of the Electricity Law Initiative at the Harvard Law School Environmental and Energy Law Program. Although some of the pricing model is based on your actual use, some costs like new power generation, transmission and infrastructure projects are spread across all customers.

Data centers’ rapid growth is “breaking” this tradition behind utility rates.

“These are cities, these data centers, in terms of how much electricity they use,” Peskoe said. “And it happens to be that these are the world’s wealthiest corporations behind these data centers, and it’s not clear how much local communities actually benefit from these data centers. Is there any justification for forcing everyone to pay for their energy use?”

This spring in Virginia, Dominion Energy filed a request with the State Corporation Commission to increase the rates it charges by an additional $10.50 on the monthly bill of an average resident and another $10.92 per month to pay for higher fuel costs, the Virginia Mercury reported.

Dominion, and another local supplier, recently filed a proposal to separate data centers into their own rate class to protect other customers, but the additional charges demonstrate the price increases that current contracts could pass on to customers.

In June, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission convened a technical conference to assess the adequacy of PJM’s resources and those of other major power suppliers, like Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc., ISO New England Inc., New York Independent System Operator, Inc., California Independent System Operator Corporation (CAISO) and Southwest Power Pool (SPP).

The current supply of power by PJM is not adequate to meet the current and future demand from large data center loads, Monitoring Analytics asserts in a report following the conference.

“Customers are already bearing billions of dollars in higher costs as a direct result of existing and forecast data center load,” the report said.

Proposed changes

One of the often-proposed solutions to soften the increased cost of data centers is to require them to bring their own generation, meaning they’d contract with a developer to build a power plant that would be big enough to meet their own demand. Though there are other options, like co-location, which means putting some of the electrical demand on an outside source, total separation is the foremost solution Bowring presents in his reports.

“Data centers are unique in terms of their growth and impact on the grid, unique in the history of the grid, and therefore, we think that’s why we think data centers should be treated as a separate class,” Bowring said.

Some data centers are already voluntarily doing this. Constellation Energy, the owner of Three Mile Island nuclear plant in central Pennsylvania, struck a $16 billion deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI energy demand needs.

But in some states, legislators are seeking to find a more binding solution.

New Jersey Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee, authored a bill this spring that would require new AI data centers in the state to supply their power from new, clean energy sources, if other states in the region enact similar measures.

“Seeing the large multinational trillion dollar companies, like Microsoft and Meta, be willing to do things like restart Three Mile Island is crazy, but shows you their desperation,” said co-sponsor Zwicker. “And so, okay, you want to come to New Jersey? Great, but you’re not going to put the basis (of the extra cost) on ratepayers.”

New Jersey House members launched a probe into PJM‘s practices as the state buys its annual utilities from the supplier at auction this month. Its July 2024 auction saw electrical costs increase by more than 800%, which contributed to the skyrocketing bills that took effect June 1.

Residents are feeling it, Smith said, and he and his co-sponsors plan to use the summer to talk to the other states within PJM’s regional transmission organization (RTO).

“Everything we’re detecting so far is they’re just as angry — the other 13 entities in PJM — as us,” Smith told States Newsroom.

Smith said they’re discussing the possibility of joining or forming a different RTO.

“We’re in the shock and horror stage where these new prices are being included in these bills, and citizens are screaming in pain,” Smith said. “A solution that I filed in the bill, is the one that says, ‘AI data centers, you’re welcome in New Jersey, but bring your own clean electricity with them so they don’t impact the ratepayers.”

Utah enacted a law this year that allows “large load” customers like data centers to craft separate contracts with utilities, and a bill in Oregon, which would create a separate customer class for data centers, called the POWER Act, passed through both chambers last month.

If passed, New Jersey’s law would join others across the country in redefining the relationship between data centers powering AI and utilities providers.

“We have to take action, and I think we have to be pretty thoughtful about this, and look at the big picture as well,” Zwicker said. ”I’m not anti-data center, I’m pro-technology, but I’m just not willing to put it on the backs of ratepayers.”",https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2025/07/2.-Depositphotos_power-lines-electricty.jpg,N,,2025-07-21 13:03:53.965354

The Cultivating Investment in Recycling and Circular Local Economies (CIRCLE) Act calls for establishing a 30% investment tax credit on private investments in certain recycling infrastructure, phased out over 10 years. Local municipalities that make similar investments would receive a direct rebate equal to the credit, according to the bill.

It’s co-sponsored by Reps. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., and Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa. The Recycling Partnership, the main bill supporter, spent the last few months organizing stakeholders from a range of industry and environmental groups. Supporters include the Solid Waste Association of North America, Association of Plastic Recyclers, the Aluminum Association, The Recycled Materials Association, Closed Loop Partners, Keurig Dr. Pepper, World Wildlife Fund and others.

Anthony Tusino, The Recycling Partnership’s director of public policy and government affairs, said the bill offers common ground by touching on themes that both Republicans and Democrats value.

“On the conservative side, we see enthusiasm for domestic investment and domestic manufacturing, while on the other side of the spectrum, we see real enthusiasm because of the environmental benefits of recycling,” he said. That makes the CIRCLE Act “pretty naturally bipartisan, because we see real convergence around the same principles and the same concepts — maybe from different perspectives — but they naturally align in the CIRCLE Act and in other areas of recycling.”

According to the bill, the tax credit would reduce a private entity’s tax liability on qualified investments on infrastructure designed to recycle paper, metals, glass, aluminum and other materials. Investments could include items like machinery, operational equipment or software, TRP said.

The bill is also designed to help local governments that often bear the costs of waste management improvements, as such municipalities sometimes have “no choice but to pass those costs on to constituents in the form of taxes,” said Suozzi, who previously served in local government before his time in Congress, in a statement.

The Recycling Partnership estimates the bill could save local governments $9.4 billion while also diverting more material from disposal. CEO Keefe Harrison added in a statement that the bill could also help generate up to 200,000 new jobs and divert 169 million tons of recycled materials to domestic markets.

Under the Trump administration, the U.S. government has seen recycling investments as a key way to rely less on other countries for critical materials used in manufacturing. Lawmakers underscored that perspective during a Congressional hearing last week exploring options for bolstering chemical recycling, framing it as an economic driver.

Fitzpatrick called CIRCLE a “fiscally smart, environmentally responsible solution” for building reliable and efficient recycling systems that can strengthen domestic supply chains and keep the U.S. competitive on a global economic stage.

“We really recognize that domestic manufacturing and investments in the American economy are really important, and so we built the CIRCLE Act to live up to that expectation,” Tusino said. “There is a need for investment in the national recycling system, as we know very well, and so how could we build incentives to increase that investment?”

Amy Lestition Burke, CEO of SWANA, noted that the bill will help reframe waste as an important resource. “Greater investment in recycling infrastructure is vital to expand our supply chain resilience in the U.S. Many of our recycling facilities are decades old and in need of upgrades or replacements, while some parts of the country are still lacking basic recycling infrastructure,” she said in a statement.

Robin Wiener, president of ReMA, said in a statement that the bill’s proposed 30% tax credit for certain recycling infrastructure will create positive ripple effects in the industry, such as helping to “unlock private capital, drive innovation, increase material recovery, and help scale domestic processing capacity.” The bill, she said in a statement, “sends a clear signal: recycling is not just good policy—it’s essential to American prosperity.”

The bill is also designed to fit into other state-level economic drivers for recycling, such as state extended producer responsibility programs. Seven states have passed such laws for packaging, and each includes a range of strategies for funding recycling infrastructure and other initiatives.

“At the state level, we have EPR, labeling systems and recycled content frameworks, but at the national level, what was really ripe was conversations about the tax code and investing in American jobs, infrastructure and so on,” Tusino said.

The Recycling Partnership sees a national EPR program as an “end goal,” but the CIRCLE Act is a sort of “on-ramp” to helping scale up infrastructure regardless of whether a state has adopted EPR for packaging.

New research finds that more Americans are shifting their money from checking and savings accounts into financial vehicles that pay an investment income — a trend that helps to explain the resilience of the U.S. economy after a bout of high inflation and recent uncertainty due to tariffs.

The analysis by JPMorganChase Institute examined the accounts of 4.7 million households and found that people’s total cash reserves are increasing when including new amounts going into brokerage accounts, money market funds and certificates of deposit to assess people’s well-being.

Inflation-adjusted cash balances in checking and savings accounts “remain low with a flat-growth trajectory,” but since the middle of 2024 total cash reserves have been increasing and approaching historical growth trends once the additional accounts are included, the analysis said.

“Families across many income bands are now seeing a turnaround in their total cash,” said Chris Wheat, president of the institute.

Wheat said it had been “hard to square the circle” of consumer spending staying strong despite the lack of growth in checking and savings accounts, an issue that can now be explained by people in a higher-interest rate environment shifting more money into accounts that yield investment returns. He said people appear to be using the other accounts to manage their cash, rather than simply making long-term investments.

Wheat cautioned, however, that the trend might be short term and that the institute doesn’t have a basis yet as to whether it will continue.

That’s in no small part because, as Pro Tax’s Brian Faler notes this morning, lawmakers like a good acronym about as much they enjoy passing party-line fiscal packages via budget reconciliation.

The questions about what to call this most recent GOP megabill start at the top. The measure’s official name isn’t the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, though recent surveys have suggested that’s what lots of tax professionals have taken to calling it.

Other ideas floating out there include OB3 and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s preference, “O Triple B.”

All this grasping about is definitely a throwback to the original 2017 Trump tax cuts, which offered standards like GILTI (for the levy on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income) and the provision known as Foreign Derived Intangible Income that some people spelled out or dubbed “fiddy.”

But the Democrats also contributed to this “what do we call this” game back in 2022, when they enacted a new minimum tax on large companies’ book income that lots of people like to call “cam-tee.” (That’d be for corporate alternative minimum tax.)

And now, much like back in 2017, lots of the confusion over how to shorthand new policies focuses on international provisions. In fact, Republicans replaced GILTI, though some tax pros say they’re just going to keep using that term instead of sounding out a new acronym that could be called “necktie.” (That would be for NCTI, which stands for “Net CFC Tested Income.”)

WELCOME BACK TO Weekly Tax, where somehow President Donald Trump isn’t as worried about what to call tax provisions as he is other stuff.

A bit more on the megabill: We’re still waiting on that final CBO score of the legislation. But our team of Taylor Miller Thomas, Paula Friedrich and Jonathan Lai are out with a more visual representation of how the measure piled trillions of more dollars on to the federal debt.

NEXT UP? Now that OB3 (or take your pick) has passed, one of the next big questions is whether Republicans can and will try to pass another reconciliation measure in the coming months — perhaps a “2 Big 2 Beautiful” bill, if we’re continuing the “what’s the name of this?” theme.

But even after all the work the GOP did with the megabill, there remains one big tax deadline approaching on Dec. 31 — the expiration of expanded incentives for buying health insurance that are a particular priority for Democrats.

Whether to extend those credits could easily spur a standoff between Democrats and Republicans over a potential bipartisan health care package, as our Benjamin Guggenheim noted over the weekend.

It’s not clear how much bipartisan lawmaking can occur in the wake of the battering process that produced the megabill, though there are no shortage of health care proposals with broad support. But Democrats will push hard to get those premium tax credits into any such health deal — or perhaps a bipartisan tax deal, should that have a chance to materialize.

Lots of congressional Republicans support simply watching those tax credits lapse, but check back on the politics in the fall and beyond. Millions of people would be threatened with losing their health insurance if those incentives lapse, and that could leave some in the GOP interested in a deal.

COMING AFTER THEM: House Republicans are proposing to slash IRS funding by almost a quarter, as our Jennifer Scholtes noted on Sunday.

The House Appropriations’ financial services subcommittee will consider that spending measure this afternoon, which would set up another potential showdown over IRS funding.

Government funding lapses in just over two months, at the end of September, and there is a lot of uncertainty over how negotiations to keep the government open will play out. The House’s aggressive posture on the IRS — it proposes to reduce IRS funding to $9.5 billion for the upcoming fiscal year, a drop of 23 percent — fits with the Trump administration’s broader goals for the agency.

Bessent and other senior administration officials have sketched out a vision in which the IRS sheds further employees, after already losing about a quarter of its staff just over the last six months, and then leans in further on automation for core functions.

Still, cutting IRS funding by almost $3 billion could be a step too far for the Senate, which usually takes a more bipartisan approach to spending matters. (Though not always!)

House Republicans are targeting regular IRS spending after largely succeeding in gutting the special funding stream that Democrats approved for the tax collector in 2022.

The Inflation Reduction Act set aside an extra $80 billion or so for the IRS, with around $45 billion of that earmarked for increased enforcement efforts. But over the last two-plus years, Republicans have succeeded through a variety of methods in erasing more than 90 percent of the enforcement funding, cutting it down to just under $4 billion.

But in other ways, targeting the IRS for further savings right now makes for interesting timing. Republicans did just pass the megabill, after all, which will bring about more work for the IRS — including fleshing out the rules for Trump’s campaign promises, like cutting taxes on tipped income and overtime pay, both of which could be prone to gaming.

Push for More Power The issue of meeting energy demand is being driven by data centers working on artificial intelligence and extreme weather that strains the grid.","The Trump administration’s urgent messaging about electricity reliability is at odds with Republicans’ removal of tax incentives for renewables such as solar and wind, leaving legal and industry analysts questioning the ability to meet energy demand.

“The combination of a bill that downplays our best and cheapest new sources of electricity and then a report that claims that we’re going to run short in the coming years is absolutely horrendous,” said Joel Eisen, an energy law professor at the University of Richmond.

The reconciliation law signed July 4 terminated multiple energy-related federal tax credits affecting clean vehicles and energy efficiency in homes—as well as limiting access to tax incentives for renewable energy projects.

Shortly after the bill went into law, the Energy Department released a report evaluating the electric grid’s reliability—warning that coal plants shouldn’t be retired due to increased energy demand.

“This report affirms what we already know: The United States cannot afford to continue down the unstable and dangerous path of energy subtraction previous leaders pursued, forcing the closure of baseload power sources like coal and natural gas,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement July 7.

The study is just one development in a series of energy moves taken during President Donald Trump’s second term, such as using emergency powers under the Federal Power Act to allow soon-to-be retired coal plants to keep running. Trump on July 18 also allowed coal plants to bypass air pollution rules on grounds that the waivers are needed for national security purposes to meet energy demand.

Though the president has indicated support for more climate-friendly sources like nuclear and geothermal energy, fossil fuels have been the top priority.

“Looking at both of these documents and also the administration’s broader policy, what we really see is this effort to sort of prop up these outdated, expensive, unreliable energy sources at the expense of better alternatives,” said Romany Webb, deputy director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University.

Push for More Power

The issue of meeting energy demand is being driven by data centers working on artificial intelligence and extreme weather that strains the grid.

Federal Energy Regulation Commission Chairman Mark Christie (R) expressed concern at the commission’s May and June meetings over fortifying the grid.

Christie pointed out that when dealing with the recent heat waves, grid operators were “tight,” which means “they were at the edge of their resource adequacy.”

While there’s consensus that demand will go up, it’s unclear by how much over a given period of time.

“There’s this sort of inherent inconsistency in some of the different policy actions that we’re seeing from the administration,” said Webb.

While different groups advocate for using only fossil fuels or only renewables, some law professors and utility associations say having a mixture of energy sources makes the most sense.

A “diverse generation portfolio” is a strength because “everything’s got an Achilles heel of some sort,” said John Godfrey, senior government relations director at the American Public Power Association. He noted that wellheads can freeze and wind sometimes doesn’t blow enough.

Alexandra Klass—Biden’s former deputy general counsel at DOE and an energy law professor at the University of Michigan—also recognized the benefits and drawbacks of various energy sources, saying “we need a mix of all of these resources for reliability.”

Still, not everyone agrees the US can afford to keep relying on fossil fuels due to their impact on the climate.

“Keeping fossil fuels on the grid exacerbates our climate disasters, which then end up upending our access to electricity,” said Jean Su, director of the energy justice program at the Center for Biological Diversity.

Impact of Law and Report

Dampening renewables’ abilities will affect what energy resources are available to support the fatigued grid.

“The reconciliation law has an enormous impact on the supply that will be available to meet demand on the wholesale markets, which the DOE says is going to be constrained,” said University of Richmond’s Eisen.

Without the credits, a number of renewable projects “may not be economically viable” or “they may still be able to go forward, but at a higher cost to customers,” said Tim Fox, managing director at ClearView Energy Partners LLC.

If the industry sees “some projects that are in relatively advanced stages of development being canceled, that could exacerbate that supply demand equilibrium,” he said.

There’s also the financial impact of favoring some sources over others.

The final version of the reconciliation law may cut new electricity capacity additions and increase consumer power prices, according to a study from the Energy Innovation Policy & Technology LLC, a non-partisan energy and climate policy think tank.

The goal of the DOE report is to say “‘we need to keep aging coal plants open and not retire them,’ and that’s going to cost consumers a huge amount of money,” said Klass.

Coal involves fuel and transportation costs that don’t come with wind and solar, she said. “There are cheaper ways to get electricity.”

The budget package passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump in early July invests millions of dollars in improving the farm bill safety net, preventing animal diseases and making provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent.

Texas Farm Bureau President Russell Boening called the passage of the (OBBB Act) a major step forward for agriculture.

“The OBBB Act includes many critical provisions that strengthen the farm safety net, provide much-needed tax certainty and support the long-term viability of Texas farms and ranches,” Boening said. “These measures are essential as producers face rising input costs and a challenging economic landscape.”

The act invests $65.6 billion into the farm safety net. It sets higher reference prices under the farm bill’s Price Loss Coverage program, adjusts formulas for the Agriculture Risk Coverage program and enhances crop insurance.

“Modernizing important farm safety net programs and making permanent critical tax provisions could be the difference between staying in business or shutting down the family farm,” American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) President Zippy Duvall said.

The improvements to farm bill safety net programs are needed to reflect today’s agricultural economy.

“Prices being paid to farmers continue to fall, while expenses remain stubbornly high. The combination is taking a toll. America lost more than 141,000 farms in a five-year period, leading to more consolidation of family farms,” Duvall said. “Increases to reference prices, as well as investments in conservation, research and trade, are desperately needed, especially since it’s been seven years since passage of a new farm bill. Farmers will stand a better chance of enduring tough times so they can plant for another season.”

The nearly 1,000-page bill funds voluntary conservation programs for six years, including the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, the Conservation Stewardship Program and the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program.

The legislation makes adjustments to the Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFDP) and the Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP).

LFDP now increases to two monthly payments, and producers may be eligible after four consecutive weeks of drought instead of eight.

The bill funds LIP indemnity payments at 100% of the market value for livestock losses due to predation and 75% of market value for livestock losses due to the weather. The program will now also cover the loss of unborn livestock due to a disaster.

Producers may also benefit from increased funding for animal disease prevention and livestock health.

“Funding for the (National Animal Health Laboratory Network), as well as funding for the National Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program and National Animal Vaccine and Veterinary Countermeasures Bank, was substantially increased in the One Big Beautiful Bill,” U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann (R-KS) said in a recent House Ag Subcommittee hearing. “The One Big Beautiful Bill included $233 million per year for the three-legged-stool with $10 million per year directed towards the NAHLN, which is on top of existing discretionary federal spending.”

The Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (TVMDL) is a charter member of NAHLN, which was created over two decades ago.

The bill also includes provisions from the Feral Swine Eradication Act to provide $105 million for the Feral Swine Eradication and Control Pilot Program.

“We applaud the administration’s leadership and our congressional allies who recognized the urgent needs of agriculture and delivered meaningful solutions,” Boening said. “We are especially grateful to the many members of the Texas delegation who stood with farm and ranch families and worked to ensure this bill puts farmers and ranchers first.”

The OBBB Act makes several expiring provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, including the increase in the death tax exemption to $15 million per individual, or $30 million per couple, adjusted for inflation.

It also makes the Section 199A Small Business tax deduction permanent. That allows small businesses, like family farms and ranches, to deduct 20% of the business income.

Farmers and ranchers may also be allowed to deduct the cost of eligible equipment expenses, up to $2.5 million.

The bill also makes investments in trade promotion, agricultural research, disaster assistance and other programs.

“It has investments in research, investments in animal health, including our large animal veterinarians and the three-legged stool when it comes to animal health,” U.S. Rep. Glenn “GT” Thompson, House Agriculture Committee Chairman, said.

The OBBB Act was signed by the president July 4.

Since the bill includes funding for many farm bill programs, Thompson said he looks forward to the House Ag Committee considering a slimmer farm bill this fall.

According to Agri-Pulse, Thompson predicts Farm Bill 2.0 will cost less than $8 billion.

The phaseout of federal support for most types of large-scale clean energy with President Trump’s budget, along with his administration’s efforts to dramatically boost production and use of climate-warping fossil fuels, is gloomy news for many environmentalists, cleantech startups and investors. The Trump Administration is also making it harder to build new wind and solar projects on federal land.

Look beyond Washington, however, and the story is far more upbeat.

Electricity produced worldwide from renewable sources will likely pass coal-fired power for the first time this year and grow steadily through the end of the decade, the International Energy Agency estimates. By 2030, global electricity generation from solar, wind and other sources should top 17,000 terawatt-hours, up nearly 90% from 2023–enough to power both China and the U.S., according to the IEA.

Within the U.S., California now gets 67% of its electric power from renewable and zero-carbon sources, including solar, wind, hydro and nuclear. That figure should only increase in the next few years: the state added 7,000 megawatts of clean energy capacity to its grid in 2024, along with massive amounts of battery storage capacity. More than 20,000 megawatts of new clean energy is already under contract to be added by 2030, according to the state.

“The world’s fourth-largest economy is running on two-thirds clean power–the largest economy on the planet to achieve this milestone,” said California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Meanwhile, the EU estimates that renewable energy now accounts for a quarter of electric power production in its member countries and should reach 45% by the end of the decade. China, already the world’s top producer of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and electric cars, is moving even faster. In May alone, it installed 93 gigawatts of solar capacity and 26 gigawatts of wind power. Though the country remains the world’s biggest source of carbon emissions, especially due to its heavy use of coal, that could soon change as its solar and wind capacity keeps growing. Sales of electric vehicles in China, already the world’s biggest market for them, will likely also surpass those of gas-powered cars for the first time this year.

The loss of U.S. incentives for solar power–and the manufacturing to support it is particularly problematic given how rapidly it’s growing globally, adding to concerns that China and other countries will gain an insurmountable lead in the technology. It’s also bad news for the country, which is staring down the barrel of an energy crisis thanks to power-hungry data centers fueling AI. That’s because solar and wind are not only cheaper to build than fossil fuels or nuclear, these plants are also more likely to be completed on time and on budget.

“It took from the invention of the photovoltaic solar cell, in 1954, until 2022 for the world to install a terawatt of solar power; the second terawatt came just two years later, and the third will arrive either later this year or early next,” environmental writer Bill McKibben said in the New Yorker.

Fortunately for the planet, even if the U.S. pace of new renewable power production slows in the next few years, there’s no sign the rest of the world will follow suit.

The Big Read

GM Supplying Batteries For Data Center, Energy Grid Packs

General Motors, which has poured billions of dollars into producing electric vehicle batteries at U.S. plants, is partnering with Redwood Materials to use some of its cells for stationary energy storage systems for the power grid as well as AI data centers.

The Detroit-based automaker, which already supplies battery scrap materials to Redwood for recycling, plans to supply both new and used U.S.-made battery cells that Redwood will package as large stationary packs, the companies said. The move comes after Reno-based Redwood, founded by Tesla cofounder and current board member JB Straubel, last month created a new unit to supply energy storage packs called Redwood Energy.

“The market for grid-scale batteries and backup power isn’t just expanding, it’s becoming essential infrastructure,” said Kurt Kelty, GM’s battery chief. “Electricity demand is climbing and it’s only going to accelerate.”

Finding additional uses for battery cells beyond EVs can help GM maximize its investment in R&D and production of that technology as Trump Administration policies, distilled in the just-enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act, darken the outlook for not only EV sales but large-scale wind and solar projects. Pursuing new applications for cleaner, less-polluting energy technology is exactly what many investors are encouraging companies to do.

Riccardo Farina of The Ocean Cleanup on working with AWS and using AI to battle the Great Pacific Garbage Patch

How big a problem is plastic in the ocean?

There is more than 200 million pounds of trash estimated to be in the ocean, with many more entering every year. The debris causes damage to marine life; it will break down into microplastics entering the food chain. Recent studies have also highlighted that floating plastic limits the ability of the ocean for carbon sequestration, which is crucial for climate regulation.

Moreover, plastic entering the ocean from a river also affects the global community and damages ecosystems such as mangroves. This is a manmade problem and an environmental challenge that we are on a mission to solve. We’re a nonprofit. We’re a data-driven organization. Most importantly, we’re also project-based. We envision a future where ocean cleanup is not needed anymore and we can go out of business. We can dissolve.

To achieve this goal, we have a dual strategy: removing the legacy plastic in the middle of the ocean and also preventing the inflow of plastic into the ocean via rivers. In the initiative that we have announced with AWS, we mainly focus on the ocean.

What is AWS doing to help?

In the ocean, we’re tackling the great Pacific Garbage Patch, an area two times the size of Texas located between San Francisco and Hawaii. There is a bit of a general misconception that there is a floating island of plastic, which would make our job very easy. But actually, the plastic is very widespread over a large area. A key challenge is actually identifying areas with high concentrations of plastic.

We have already developed the hardware of the solution, which is a floating barrier that has been shown to be capable of continuously harvesting a large amount of plastic. To date, we have removed more than 1 million pounds of trash from that environment. However, a key challenge is to identify what we call hotspot areas, areas with high concentrations of plastic.

The collaboration with AWS will enable us to better detect, track and identify and predict areas in the Pacific with the highest concentrations of plastic. Together we'll develop and deploy a machine-learning and artificial intelligence platform that will be able to predict where the plastic will be, so we can steer our operations and our ships and increase the efficiency of our operations and of our efforts. AWS will provide us with a variety of technologies such as IoT, satellite imagery, computational modeling power and also deploying drones and GPS trackers to collect better data, which will be combined with publicly available data and data that we have in-house. Then by leveraging high computational power, we want to develop a steering tool so we can predict where the highest concentrations of plastic are and we can increase the efficiency of our operation. With AWS, we'll be able to drastically accelerate our efforts.

We also want to have a net positive effect on the environment and we want to make sure that whenever we harvest plastic, in no way are we damaging marine species. Currently, we have an environmental observer on board monitoring with an underwater camera the interaction our system has with marine life species. We'll work together with AWS to develop an AI infrastructure that will be able to automate as much as possible this procedure so we can allocate more resources to the plastic removal initiative.

What are you doing with the collected plastic trash?

We recycle that material into pellets. In 2021, we released our first product, a pair of sunglasses … to show the world that it's possible to turn trash into treasure. Now we're moving to an approach where we partner with a third party so they can have access to our catch and can turn it into long-lasting products to show to the world that it is indeed possible to give second value to this unique material–and also to raise awareness to our mission.

When it comes to rivers, the process is a bit different, but we partner with the local waste management infrastructure. Our responsibility lies with intercepting the trash and then ensuring that it’s properly handed over to the local waste management infrastructure. We are also exploring ways to repurpose that material into long-lasting products. Last year, we repurposed the catch coming from our Interceptor 006 in Guatemala to produce a limited edition LP of the latest Coldplay album.

The plastic we collected from the ocean has been repurposed for a limited edition trunk liner for the Kia EV3 model–Kia is one of our global partners.

Last week began with a Supreme Court order that cleared the way for the mass layoffs at the Education Department, and ended Friday with the Environmental Protection Agency announcing it will eliminate its scientific research arm and begin firing hundreds of chemists, biologists and toxicologists and other scientists, after denying for months it intended to do so. The move has sparked widespread backlash from public health experts and climate advocates who have warned this could lead to the dismantling of protections that shield communities from hazardous chemicals, water contaminants and toxic pollution. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has aggressively gutted the EPA staff and other regulations at President Trump’s behest.

JENNIFER ORME-ZAVALETA: Yeah. Thank you for having me.

So, the Office of Research and Development was part of EPA upon its creation, and the main purpose for the office is to provide science to help inform agency decisions and help to solve environmental problems. It provides essential information on air quality, water quality, the communities where we live, and helping to ensure that they’re safe, and, more importantly, protecting public health.

By eliminating this office, the administration has also proposed the creation of a different science office that would be under the administrator’s office, and moving some staff to the agency’s program offices, the air, water, chemicals office and the Land and Emergency Management Office. But there’s also been encouraging a number of staff to leave through these deferred resignation programs or early retirements. And by doing so, we are losing a treasure trove of historical knowledge, of scientific expertise, and really it’s going to limit what information, what science would be available for the agency to consider in protecting our health and our environment.

AMY GOODMAN: DOGE talks about the restructuring saving the country money, I think something like $748 million. Are they really saving the government money here, or just using this as an excuse to wipe out regulations that have been put in place to protect Americans?

JENNIFER ORME-ZAVALETA: Yeah, no, it’s not going to be saving — saving money. And first off, the $700 million budget exceeds what ORD’s budget is. And if anything, it’s going to be shifting the economic burden, sending it more to communities, to hospitals, to families, in helping to address their healthy needs. It’s really — the cost saving is just a guise. It’s misleading, and it’s going to have consequences for the American taxpayer. People are not going to be protected. So, I’ll leave it there.

AMY GOODMAN: Let me ask you something. The EPA says it will create a new office called the Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions to replace your office’s functions. Could you talk about the significance of this?

JENNIFER ORME-ZAVALETA: Sure. So, right now the Office of Research and Development is a national program office, and it’s to be led by a Senate-confirmed leader, assistant administrator. And those assistant administrators have usually been very well respected, renowned scientists. By moving this office, by eliminating ORD and moving it to the administrator’s office, it will not be led by a Senate-confirmed leader. It will be under the administrator’s office, which opens the door for perhaps greater political oversight. And it’s unclear, really, what the function of this office is going to be, what kind of research, if any, they’ll be conducting, or are they going to be really an in-house contract laboratory that will only do work as requested by the programs within the agency?",https://www.democracynow.org/images/story/52/78152/full_hd/SEG3_EPA2.jpg,N,,2025-07-21 12:02:55.367586

Trump has nominated a guy named David LaCerte to serve on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. (FERC) There’s sparse public material available about LaCerte, a tribute to his prior accomplishments. LaCerte’s record is almost devoid of relevant experience and expertise.

“FERC Commissione”r is not usually considered an entry-level job in energy law. FERC cases involve the management of the entire U.S. energy grid, except for part of Texas. Energy law and regulation are extraordinarily complex and technical, but the issues are big – management of massive U.S. electricity markets, permitting of natural gas pipelines, setting rates for electricity transmission, and ensuring grid reliability.

So far as I can tell, LaCerte has no professional background involving any of these issues. LaCerte has served in two significant positions. He was the head of the Louisiana Secretary of Veteran’s Affairs. (He resigned from that in 2015 after state investigators accused his department of misspending thousands of dollars and failing to report crimes against veterans. LaCerte then sued the investigators for defamation.) He has also had two stints under Trump at the Office of Personnel Management, which is what the Feds call HR. also worked as acting managing director at the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board starting at the end of President Donald Trump’s first term.

LaCerte has had one brush with energy regulation. He was a special counsel at the big ouil and gas law firm, Baker Botts for two years, starting in January 2023. While there, he worked on energy litigation and environmental, safety and incident response issues. None of that has much to do with FERC,

I’m sure we’ll be learning more about LaCerte. Maybe no one has mentioned a degree in energy economics, or a term on a state public utility commission. But what we do know at this point is … unimpressive.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FERC.jpeg,N,,2025-07-21 12:03:42.129621

This strategic pivot helps utilize underused factories and taps into rising demand from utilities and data centers, according to a recent analysis from the WSJ.

The Shift from EVs to Stationary Batteries

Battery companies that once prioritized electric vehicles now target utilities, renewable energy developers, and AI-driven data centers for their products. This change addresses overoptimistic EV forecasts from five years ago, which led to multibillion-dollar plants in the U.S. South and Midwest sitting underused or delayed. Energy storage systems, or ESS, have stepped in as an alternative, compensating for the EV slowdown.

Selling these stationary batteries was once overlooked. “ESS was the ugly duckling for a long time within our organization,” said Jaehong Park, an executive at LG’s battery arm. Yet, installations of energy-storage batteries in the U.S. more than tripled from 2021 to 2024, with projections showing 34% growth in 2025, per energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.

This growth stems from renewed U.S. electricity demand after 15 years of stagnation, driven by AI data centers, manufacturing, and broader electrification. Energy-storage systems manage extra grid demand and offset outages.

“If you have an outage of a massive data center or a giant gas plant, batteries can plug that hole,” said Stephanie Smith, chief operating officer of Eolian, a battery and renewable-energy company owned by BlackRock. “They can react in microseconds, and so you’re able to address so many different problems on the entire grid.”

Key Companies Leading the Transition

Tesla exemplifies this trend, generating billions from energy storage. Its storage segment revenue, including solar panels, grew 67% last year to $4 billion, offsetting a $6 billion drop in EV sales. Customers include utility providers like Intersect and Elon Musk’s xAI, which bought $191 million in Tesla Megapack products in 2024.

General Motors is exploring a deal to supply new and used batteries to recycling startup Redwood Materials for large storage systems. “Right now, there is a hunger for more energy from every source,” said Redwood founder J.B. Straubel.

LG’s battery unit, partnering with GM, Honda, and Hyundai on EV factories, diversified in late 2023 as EV markets softened. It repurposed a $1.4 billion expansion at its Holland, Michigan, plant—originally for EVs—into its first U.S. facility for stationary storage, using low-cost chemistry similar to Chinese competitors.

“We saw there is a rapid and urgently growing demand in the U.S. Here’s an opportunity for us to address it more quickly,” said Tristan Doherty, LG’s chief product officer for storage batteries. This move advanced LG’s entry into U.S. energy storage by a year.

Even a Chinese-owned manufacturer, once set to supply Mercedes-Benz, now eyes energy storage to revive a stalled Kentucky factory.

Challenges and Implications for EV Enthusiasts

China dominates this market, thanks to decades refining low-cost chemistry for stationary batteries, notes Sam Adham, a battery expert at market-research firm CRU. Despite U.S. tariffs under the Trump administration, Chinese options often remain cheapest.

U.S. firms counter by maximizing existing sites. LG expects U.S. EV demand to fall 10% this year and plans to cut capital spending by up to 30%. “Rather than building new capacity on new sites, we do want to try to maximize and fully utilize the existing sites that we have as much as possible,” said Chief Financial Officer Chang Sil Lee in January.

For EV owners, this pivot raises questions about battery supply chains. While it stabilizes manufacturers financially—LG’s sales shrank 24% last year amid EV pullback—it could delay EV-specific innovations. Building on that, domestic production offers reliability. Excelsior Energy Capital, buying from LG’s Michigan plant, values U.S.-made batteries for avoiding geopolitical risks.

“We can look our buyers of power straight in the eye and say, ‘This is a domestically sourced supply chain and we can commit to these timelines,’” said Anne Marie Denman, co-founder of Excelsior reportedly. “It isn’t subject to geopolitical winds.”

This transition underscores broader electrification trends, where batteries support not just vehicles but the grid powering them. EV enthusiasts might see long-term benefits as storage advancements improve charging infrastructure and energy reliability, even as short-term EV growth lags.

The move follows public opposition gathered during the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) scoping process and board listening sessions. TVA is now evaluating alternative sites, including one in a nearby industrial park, to support rising electricity demand across its seven-state service area.

TVA serves over 10 million people and is navigating both political expectations to “unleash American energy” and regional pressure to balance reliability, affordability, and environmental responsibility. The agency says natural gas remains a core part of its generation mix, with 6,200 megawatts of new gas-fired capacity in the pipeline and 3,570 MW already under construction.

“With potential changes in the regulatory environment, we are reviewing options such as working with the Administration to extend the life of certain assets in our fossil fleet,” TVA stated in its July update.

Why It Matters

TVA’s shift reflects a broader trend in U.S. energy planning: balancing near-term power needs with longer-term climate and regulatory pressures. While natural gas remains critical for capacity and grid stability, the decision to explore new siting options—after public feedback—suggests growing sensitivity to community concerns and environmental justice issues.

What’s Next

Environmental Review: TVA continues formal reviews under the NEPA for all new site options.

Infrastructure Planning: Massive transmission investments will be needed to connect any new generation, including gas, solar, or storage.

Regional Power Demand: Rising loads from industrial growth, EV manufacturing, and data centers are driving urgency across the Southeast.

Environmental groups such as the Sierra Club and the Southern Environmental Law Center have long criticized TVA’s gas-heavy plans, calling for more aggressive investment in clean energy.

In other words, the carmaking game is all about great products at competitive prices, not simply tailoring everything to meet some government's ever-shifting safety and emissions rules.

Reader, that's a lie. In reality, the car industry is one of the most heavily regulated ones on earth, and the rules dictate everything from how your next car will be shaped to how clean it will be. The car companies get tight little boxes to operate in, and they spend years and billions of dollars in capital trying to make profitable cars that can also meet all those rules.

But six months into the Trump administration, those rules—ones that the auto industry in America has been operating under for years, and in some cases decades—are out the window now. And what happens next is anybody's guess.

A look at this chaotic situation kicks off this Monday edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of industry and technology news. Also on deck: Stellantis gets a steep tariff bill, and questions arise about how Huawei-powered cars are being sold in China. Let's dig in.

30%: Everything Is Weird

I'll summarize this situation as succinctly as I can: here in the United States, tariffs are in, electric vehicle tax credits are out (or will be on Sept. 30, anyway), penalties that pushed for more fuel-efficient engines are dead, and the global supply chains are still unpredictable. The Trump administration has sought to radically re-shore car production in America—gas car production, specifically—while rolling back fuel economy rules, emissions regulations and policies driving EV growth.

Basically, this wasn't the plan for the auto industry in America. It's spent years gearing up for a more electric and electrified future under the Biden administration—and decades of ever-stricter fuel economy and emissions rules before that—including locally made EVs and U.S. battery plants.

And the tariffs mean that no car company is entirely sure where to build cars now, let alone how to price them. Here's Automotive News with more:

To put it plainly, vehicle product planners are trying to steer through a bumpy ride. “The next four-plus years will be the most uncertain and volatile time in product strategy ever,” Bank of America analysts wrote in their annual Car Wars study in June.

By the time EV and trade policy become clearer, the auto industry probably will have lost as much as 18 months of planning, said Michael Robinet, vice president of forecast strategy at S&P Global Mobility.

“There has been a colossal effort to just reduce exposure and try to control what you can control,” Robinet said. “Companies are all trying to plan day to day and have very little, if any, long-term focus on where technology, efficiency and all those factors that we used to invest a lot of time and energy in end up.”

Automotive News puts together an annual look at the next few years of product strategies for each car company. Plans always shift, but in 2025, creating a roadmap is an especially unenviable job.

Arguably the worst part for carmakers is that the world's biggest car markets—including the U.S., Europe, China, the rest of Asia and so on—are all moving at different speeds now toward the technologies of the future. So is the play gas, hybrid or electric? Actually, it's all of the above:

Different segments of the market will demand a variety of powertrains, so “the investment is going to have to be made everywhere,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. “Some of that money is going to be spent prematurely and some of that money is going to be spent too late, but everybody is going to have to spend it.”

“If you can’t even handicap what’s going to happen day-to-day because it feels like these decisions aren’t tied to macroeconomic fundamentals but to some negotiation that you’re not a part of, you go from being a participant in the economy to a hostage,” [Dan Hearsch, global co-leader of the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners] said.

“You’re just watching people negotiate with your life. That’s the situation that we’re finding ourselves in, waiting to see what these different governments do.”

I can't tell you where this nets out long-term, but in the immediate term, new-car affordability is probably going out the window.

60%: Stellantis Braces For A $2.7 Billion Tariff Hit Already

Case in point: Jeep, Ram and Fiat parent company Stellantis, which operates many U.S. plants but is deeply international and was already struggling with sagging sales. Now, tariffs alone have it facing a $2.7 billion bill as it rethinks a lot of future plans, reports Reuters. A year ago it was turning a $6.5 billion profit in the first half; not so much these days.

Stellantis said on Monday it booked 3.3 billion euros in pre-tax charges for the first half as it cancelled programmes, including a hydrogen fuel cell project, kept setting aside money for fines linked to U.S. pre-Trump carbon emission regulation, while investing more in popular hybrid cars in Europe and large gasoline-powered models in the U.S. market.

The automaker's results were ""worse than consensus, but we think poor numbers were anticipated,"" Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois wrote in a client note. Bernstein analysts said that despite a ""big"" earnings miss, restructuring steps taken by Stellantis ""suggest decisive actions.""

[...] Last year, Stellantis imported over 40% of the 1.2 million vehicles it sold in the United States, mostly from Mexico and Canada. In April this year, the company said it had reduced vehicle imports in response to tariffs and would calibrate ""production and employment to reduce impacts on profitability"".

Quite a turnaround job for the new CEO.

90%: The Curious Case Of Huawei EV Subsidies In China

Meanwhile, China's EVs may be hyper-advanced, but that industry has giant headaches of its own: price wars, waning demand, too many brands and too much competition, a nervous national government and much more.

So let's talk about Huawei. I would argue that it hasn't been as flashy as Xiaomi has been in this regard, but it's another Chinese smartphone and tech giant getting into the EV space—both with its own software and by white-labeling cars made by other automakers. Huawei's Harmony Intelligent Mobility Alliance (HIMA) works with Chinese players like SAIC, JAC and Chery to build out new brands quickly.

But Wired points out that it's getting a lot of government help to do this—like, an unusual and specific degree of government help, even by China's standards:

Since May, at least 10 Chinese provincial and municipal governments have announced consumer subsidies ranging from 2,000 to 5,000 RMB (about $280 to $700) per car, according to social media posts collected by WIRED. The exact amount and conditions vary, but they all have one thing in common: The rebates can only be used to purchase a vehicle that runs Huawei’s HarmonyOS operating system and its autonomous driving system.

The Chinese government has subsidized electric vehicles since 2009, helping drive the country’s rapid adoption of them over the past decade. But those incentives, both on the national and local level, were phased out two years ago as the government urged auto companies to reach profitability on their own. But even during the heyday of EV discounts, experts say they were never explicitly restricted to a single company.

It remains unclear which company or organization is actually funding the discounts in every case. It could be Huawei, as all the announcements clearly benefit it, or one of the auto manufacturers that have partnered with it and uses Huawei’s smart driving technologies.

That story's worth a read in full.

My take is that it's another sign of how volatile and cutthroat the Chinese EV market is. The level of brand overabundance and factory overcapacity we see right now cannot last forever. Until then, these companies will do damn near anything to get ahead, even by inches instead of miles.

100%: Are There Any Winners In This Current Moment Of Industry Chaos?

“In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity,"" Sun Tzu wrote in The Art of War. What opportunity exists amid all this chaos and who's going to be smart enough to seize on it?

The auto industry's big problem is still affordability. Forget EVs for a second; this business is in trouble if a Nissan Sentra or something costs $30,000. If some company can really figure out how to drive the value proposition here, it could emerge victorious when the dust settles.

The move follows public opposition gathered during the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) scoping process and board listening sessions. TVA is now evaluating alternative sites, including one in a nearby industrial park, to support rising electricity demand across its seven-state service area.

TVA serves over 10 million people and is navigating both political expectations to “unleash American energy” and regional pressure to balance reliability, affordability, and environmental responsibility. The agency says natural gas remains a core part of its generation mix, with 6,200 megawatts of new gas-fired capacity in the pipeline and 3,570 MW already under construction.

“With potential changes in the regulatory environment, we are reviewing options such as working with the Administration to extend the life of certain assets in our fossil fleet,” TVA stated in its July update.

Why It Matters

TVA’s shift reflects a broader trend in U.S. energy planning: balancing near-term power needs with longer-term climate and regulatory pressures. While natural gas remains critical for capacity and grid stability, the decision to explore new siting options—after public feedback—suggests growing sensitivity to community concerns and environmental justice issues.

What’s Next

Environmental Review: TVA continues formal reviews under the NEPA for all new site options.

Infrastructure Planning: Massive transmission investments will be needed to connect any new generation, including gas, solar, or storage.

Regional Power Demand: Rising loads from industrial growth, EV manufacturing, and data centers are driving urgency across the Southeast.

Environmental groups such as the Sierra Club and the Southern Environmental Law Center have long criticized TVA’s gas-heavy plans, calling for more aggressive investment in clean energy.

Officials on Thursday unveiled the outline of their plan to use an upcoming renewable energy hub to bring new economic opportunities to an underserved Queens community.

Across the street from the Queensbridge Houses, one of the largest public housing developments in the country, officials debuted the “Reimagine Ravenswood” plan, which would bring a host of community benefits to the area in tandem with a similarly named plan to turn the notorious fossil fuel energy station in the area into a renewable energy hub.

“Reimagine Ravenswood” is a new initiative that proposes investments in environmental justice, economic opportunity and public space improvements funded and pushed by the Queens borough president, the state and developer Rise Light & Power.

The plan is a follow up on “Renewable Ravenswood,” a plan proposed in 2022 that would turn the Ravenswood Generating Station, the largest fossil fuel plant in the city which has contributed to the area's “Asthma Alley” nickname, into a hub for renewable energy, by surrounding it with community benefits.

“There cannot be a starker example of environmental racism than this one,” Borough President Donovan Richards said in the shadow of the generating station on Thursday. “But we're here today because we finally are righting this wrong.”

The “Reimagine Ravenswood” proposal includes plans to get local residents from Queensbridge and the nearby Ravenswood Houses into green energy jobs created by the energy plan, to create infrastructure for bikes and zero-emission vehicles, as well as to expand public space and access to the waterfront nearby.

“This isn’t just about energy — it’s about equity, opportunity, and transformation,” said Rise Light & Power CEO Clinton Plummer. “We’re committed to making Renewable Ravenswood a model for how clean energy infrastructure can uplift communities and create good-paying union jobs.”

Richards said the plan’s goal is to make sure the environmental and economic benefits the renewable generating station brings feed directly into the surrounding communities.

“This development is home to tens of thousands of hardworking families who make this city run but have been disenfranchised and disinvested in for decades,” he said.

Locals say the plan is a move towards reversing those issues.

“For decades we have been fighting for cleaner air, good jobs and our fair share of investment,” said Ravenswood Residents Association President Carol Wilkins. “This plan takes a hard look at the disparities we face but also the bright opportunity ahead with a Renewable Ravenswood.”

Renewable Ravenswood was first pitched in 2022 as a way to start the work to reverse what Richards described as the ""environmental racism” that has stemmed from the health and pollution the generating site brought to the area.

“If you're curious how this part of Queens got its nickname Asthma Alley, all you have to do is look up,” he said. “There couldn't be a starker visual in this borough than this power plant towering over public housing residents.”

The renewable plan will turn the generating station, known for its large red and white smoke stacks, into a source of clean energy by interconnecting multiple sources of energy to the site, and constructing new off-shore energy sites.

However, the local efforts may clash with the federal government, which has cut funding and tax credits for renewable energy projects since the start of the Trump administration.

Richards and Rise Light & Power officials said that while federal funding will be necessary in order to bring both projects to fruition, they weren’t concerned about the future of their plans.

TAX CREDIT WHIPLASH — POLITICO’s Marie J. French and Ry Rivard: The accelerated phaseout of federal tax credits for clean energy has increased uncertainty for state efforts to bolster renewables.

States are delaying procurements of new renewables, including offshore wind and solar, as they evaluate the energy impacts of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Energy experts and policymakers expect consumer costs to be higher due to policy changes in the GOP megabill.

“Those costs will certainly increase, not just from short term supply shocks and the loss of federal tax credits but also from the uncertainty,” said Julia Hoos, an energy analyst with Aurora Energy Research.

Why it matters: New York, New Jersey and other Northeast states have ambitious renewable energy goals. Democratic leaders were already signaling delays in meeting them after rising costs led to canceled contracts before President Donald Trump’s election, but the looming end of federal support elevates the uncertainty and potential for missed milestones.

“These goals were based on, predicated on, offshore wind and solar really emerging as primary energy sources,” Gov. Kathy Hochul told reporters on July 11. “But I have to deal with the reality that with a president that’s hostile to those interests — and has told me directly that — how do we pretend that the goals will be met when all the incentives to invest in those industries has dissipated?”

PJM TO HEAR FROM GOVERNORS — POLITICO’s Ry Rivard: The embattled operator of the nation’s largest electric grid agreed to hear from concerned governors’ offices next week following a bipartisan letter from state leaders questioning whether it has its act together.

In recent days, 10 governors, including three Republicans, have questioned the direction taken by PJM Interconnection LLC, which runs the grid and energy market for 13 states and Washington, D.C.

PJM board Chair David Mills said Friday the grid operator would make time at the July 23 PJM Members Committee meeting to hear from the governors’ representatives, who are expected to urge the grid operator to fill two seats on its nine-seat board with people handpicked by the states.

On Wednesday, the governors of Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Virginia told PJM it is facing an “unprecedented crisis of confidence.” On Thursday, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, sent PJM a separate letter saying he supported his fellow governors’ position. While blue states have long criticized PJM, the bipartisan criticism is perhaps the most serious political threat to PJM in its decades of existence.

In a letter to governors, Mills — a former energy industry executive and consultant — defended his organization’s record and said PJM is keeping the lights on “through some of the most challenging circumstances that any grid operator, anywhere, has faced.”

What you may have missed

NETFLIX EXEMPTION — POLITICO’s Ry Rivard: Netflix is getting a major exemption from New Jersey’s new coastal flood rules after months of lobbying over permitting issues at the sprawling former Army base it is working to redevelop.

The carve-out will allow one of Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s pet projects — a $1 billion film and television studio — to avoid complying with climate change regulations his administration has been working on since before the pandemic.

Changes to the draft rules show the administration plans to exempt film studios, like Netflix, that have partnerships with the state’s Economic Development Authority.

Netflix is planning to build 12 soundstages at Fort Monmouth, a 292-acre former Army installation in Eatontown and Oceanport, New Jersey.

State Sen. Declan O’Scanlon, a Republican who represents the area, said he’s “thrilled” Netflix got the carve-out but said every coastal development project should get the same level of “deliberation and fair consideration.”

The governor called changes to the flood rule a compromise. “This is a classic situation where you’re trying to get the right balance,” Murphy told reporters Tuesday in Newark.

In lobbying disclosures from this year and last year, Netflix reported lobbying the DEP “regarding environmental permitting issues related to the development of the former United States Army Base named Fort Monmouth.” The company also reported lobbying Eric Brophy, the governor’s deputy chief of staff for economic development, about “DEP flood report rules.”

OFFSHORE WIND TRANSMISSION TERMINATED — POLITICO’s Marie J. French: President Donald Trump’s quest to stop “windmills” in the ocean has led New York to abandon a major transmission project intended to support offshore wind.

The decision to cancel the proposed investment is an acknowledgment that New York will not meet its 2035 offshore wind target given Trump’s indefinite pause on permitting for the technology. Offshore wind is fundamental to the state’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Public Service Commission Chair Rory Christian criticized federal attacks on the industry and said the commission’s decision was necessary to protect ratepayers. The commission canceled the process to select a transmission plan during its regular monthly meeting Thursday.

— On the 2035 target: “Staff does not expect any additional generation to be developed in the New York Bight until federal policy changes, and even if the federal government resumes its support of the industry in a few years, projects will likely not be operational by 2035,” said Liz Grisaru, a senior adviser for policy at the department, during the meeting. After the meeting, DPS spokesperson Jim Denn said “while the goals will be difficult to achieve by 2035, it is possible more offshore wind projects could come online by then depending on whether there are any shifts in federal policy.”

— Reactions: The New York League of Conservation Voters’ Julie Tighe said the group is “deeply disappointed” by the decision. “While the federal government continues to undermine progress on clean energy, New York should be doubling down on our commitment to become energy independent, not stalling it,” she said in a statement. “These lines take many years to plan, permit, and build — by kicking the can now, we’re risking falling behind in our clean energy transition and driving up costs in the future.” Natural Resources Defense Council’s Chris Casey also found the decision “deeply disappointing.”

“Rather than stepping back, the state should be continuing low-cost, high-value work — such as completing the grid operator’s cost benefit analysis, selecting the most effective project, and advancing state-level approvals — to position New York to move quickly once federal barriers ease,” he said in a statement.

The Alliance for Clean Energy New York and the New York Offshore Wind Alliance, which pushed for work to continue on the transmission project, issued a more milquetoast comment: “Offshore wind projects can take more than a decade to develop, spanning far beyond state and federal election cycles. We encourage New York State to continue developing infrastructure in the near-term that will enable new generation to come online, addressing reliability and affordability for New Yorkers.”

ENERGY ASSISTANCE EXPANDED — POLITICO’s Marie J. French: More utility customers in New York will receive bill discounts under an expanded affordability program approved Thursday.

The Public Service Commission voted to expand eligibility for the state’s “energy affordability program” to moderate-income residents. The move is expected to provide financial assistance to an additional 1.6 million households.

“With this expanded policy, we expand our reach to more households — households who had previously been excluded from this vital support because they didn’t meet legacy criteria — even though they were still struggling to pay their bills,” said Public Service Commission Chair Rory Christian. “More New Yorkers will be able to afford to keep the lights on.”

Utility costs have been raising affordability concerns, with Gov. Kathy Hochul slamming proposed rate hikes and customer advocates pointing to the high number of people unable to pay their bills.

The expanded program was required by the state budget passed in 2023 as lawmakers sought to address those concerns.

— Also at the PSC: The commission took steps to hold utilities accountable for delays and problems with community solar credits and billing. New performance metrics could penalize utilities, although the commission only adopted two of six proposed measures. That was partly due to a recognition that complaints about consolidated billing have declined in recent years and that any costs to improve utility billing systems would be passed on to ratepayers. “I think these provisions are going to encourage the right behavior from utilities and also, compensate customers if utility behavior is not aligned with our expectations,” Christian said.

About 224,000 customers across the state are enrolled in community distributed generation programs, according to Department of Public Service staff. The commission also authorized the utilities to increase the fee utilities collect from community solar projects from 1 percent to 1.5 percent to cover their costs to comply with the order .… The commission also approved a Rochester transmission project to improve reliability … Central Hudson will have to start demand response programs and non-pipeline alternatives under a gas planning order.

NEXT GOVERNOR COULD EASILY REMAKE BPU — POLITICO’s Ry Rivard: New Jersey’s next governor could quickly remake state energy policy after taking office by filling three seats on the powerful five-seat Board of Public Utilities.

The board has been down a member for more than a year and a second vacancy opened Wednesday following the abrupt departure of Republican member Marian Abdou, who said she was leaving to tend to her family.

A third spot could open next March, when Democratic commissioner Zenon Christodoulou’s term expires.

That means unless Gov. Phil Murphy, a term-limited Democrat, can get the Senate to quickly approve a pair of new members, his successor will be able to totally reshape the board during their first months in office.

UTILITY CALL CENTER LAW UNCERTAIN — POLITICO’s Marie J. French: The fate of a union-backed measure to keep and expand utility customer service jobs in New York is uncertain after a federal court ruling.

GREENWAY — Gov. Phil Murphy broke ground on a new rails-to-trails greenway to connect Newark and Jersey City. In the bed of an old Norfolk Southern line, the trail for bikes and pedestrians will eventually extend for nine miles through parts of Essex and Hudson counties. The first mile, which is in Newark and expected to be completed by the end of 2026, will cost about $65 million. It will be the first new state park in decades.

Brendan Gill, an Essex County commissioner who championed the project, said it took 15,000 letters to Murphy and other officials to get going and had been under discussion for well over a decade. “There was excuse after excuse after excuse as to why this project was never going to happen,” he said.

The law phases out credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy while enhancing federal support for fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.
Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit.
About 10% of new solar power capacity under development is on federal lands, said Sylvia Leyva Martínez, a principal analyst at the Wood Mackenzie research firm.
While only about 1% of the combined capacity of pending wind projects are on federal lands, delays could affect nearby infrastructure that supports renewable projects, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Diego Espinosa.","WASHINGTON (AP) — All solar and wind energy projects on federal lands and waters must be personally approved by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum under a new order that authorizes him to conduct “elevated review” of activities ranging from leases to rights of way, construction and operational plans, grants and biological opinions.

The enhanced oversight on clean-energy projects is aimed at “ending preferential treatment for unreliable, subsidy-dependent wind and solar energy,” the Interior Department said in a statement Thursday. The order “will ensure all evaluations are thorough and deliberative” on potential projects on millions of acres of federal lands and offshore areas, the department said.

Clean-energy advocates said the action could hamstring projects that need to be underway quickly to qualify for federal tax credits that are set to expire under the tax-cut and spending bill that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4. The law phases out credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy while enhancing federal support for fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.

“At a time when energy demand is skyrocketing, adding more layers of bureaucracy and red tape for energy projects at the Interior Department is exactly the wrong approach,” said Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. “There’s no question this directive is going to make it harder to maintain our global (artificial intelligence) leadership and achieve energy independence here at home.”

In the legislation, Trump and GOP lawmakers moved to dismantle the 2022 climate law passed by Democrats under President Joe Biden. And on July 7, Trump signed an executive order that further restricts subsidies for what he called “expensive and unreliable energy policies from the Green New Scam.”

That order was part of a deal the Republican president made with conservative House Republicans who were unhappy that the tax-cut bill did not immediately end all subsidies for clean energy. A group of Republican senators, including Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Utah Sen. John Curtis, had pushed to delay phaseout of some of the credits to allow currently planned projects to continue.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, describing it at a Cabinet meeting last week as an expensive form of energy that “smart” countries do not use.

Even with the changes approved by the Senate, the new law will likely crush growth in the wind and solar industry and lead to a spike in Americans’ utility bills, Democrats and environmental groups say. The law jeopardizes hundreds of renewable energy projects intended to boost the nation’s electric grid as demand is set to rise amid sharp growth from data centers, artificial intelligence and other uses, they said.

“This isn’t oversight. It’s obstruction that will needlessly harm the fastest growing sources of electric power,” said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, an industry group. He called the move “particularly confounding” as lawmakers in both parties seek to streamline permitting for all sources of American energy.

‘Level the playing field’

The Interior Department said Thursday that Burgum’s order will “level the playing field for dispatchable, cost-effective and secure energy sources,” such as coal and natural gas “after years of assault under the previous administration.″

“American energy dominance is driven by U.S.-based production of reliable baseload energy, not regulatory favoritism towards unreliable energy projects that are solely dependent on taxpayer subsidies and foreign-sourced equipment,” said Adam Suess, the acting assistant secretary for lands and minerals management.

While Democrats complain the tax law will make it harder to get renewable energy to the electric grid, Republicans say it supports production of traditional energy sources such as oil, gas and coal, as well as nuclear power, increasing reliability.

In the Senate compromise, wind and solar projects that begin construction within a year of the law’s enactment are allowed to get a full tax credit without a deadline for when the projects are “placed in service,″ or plugged into the grid. Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit.

The law retains incentives for technologies such as advanced nuclear, geothermal and hydropower through 2032.

About 10% of new solar power capacity under development is on federal lands, said Sylvia Leyva Martínez, a principal analyst at the Wood Mackenzie research firm. Those projects could be delayed or canceled if Burgum does not issue permits for them, she said. Related projects such as transmission lines could be affected, too, she said.

While only about 1% of the combined capacity of pending wind projects are on federal lands, delays could affect nearby infrastructure that supports renewable projects, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Diego Espinosa.

Waterkeeper Alliance, Lake Eerie Waterkeeper, and Food & Water Watch (collectively, “Waterkeeper”) filed a Complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (“Court”) against the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (“OEPA”) challenging a Clean Water Act Total Maximum Daily Load (“TMDL”). See Case No. 3:24-cv-00779.

Waterkeeper argues that EPA failed to comply with its mandatory legal duties under the Clean Water Act to establish an TMDL sufficient to remediate the phosphorus pollution impairing Ohio’s Western Lake Eerie Water Basin.

The organizations further argued that the TMDL issued by the OEPA and approved by EPA fails to meet the requirements of Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act and applicable regulations. This is alleged to include a failure to meaningfully address the point source discharges of the watershed’s many concentrated animal feeding operations.

A waterbody can only assimilate a finite amount of “load” of certain pollutants before it will fail to maintain the applicable water quality standard. This pollutant loading limit is referred to as the TDML.

Section 303 of the Clean Water Act requires each state to identify those jurisdictional waters within its boundaries for which the technology-based effluent limitations required by the statute and defined by EPA are not stringent enough to attain the water quality standards. Waters so designated are known as “water quality limited segments” or “impaired waters”. Each state is required to periodically submit this list of waters to EPA.

The development and implementation of TMDLs provides a link between water quality standards and effluent limitations. A TMDL quantifies the maximum allowable loading of a pollutant to a waterbody and allocates this maximum load to a contributing point and nonpoint sources. The purpose of such allocations is to ensure water quality criteria are not exceeded, thereby protecting the waterbody’s designated uses.

Waterkeeper argues that the EPA approved TMDL fails to hold certain point sources accountable for discharges and asks that the Court vacate and set aside what they deem a deficient TMDL.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15833_1120.jpg,N,,2025-07-21 12:03:04.299339

(OTC Pink:XTPT), a U.S.-based critical minerals exploration and development company, is pleased to announce the acquisition of an additional 1,240 acres of highly prospective ground in the Big Creek District of Nevada (See Figure 1.). This expansion further strengthens the company's strategic position in one of the United States' most historically significant antimony-producing regions.

Figure 1 : Claim Layout of ""Stibium Creek Project""

The newly acquired land surrounds the historic Bray-Beulah Mine and Hard Luck Pradier (See Figure 3.), both of which were past producers of high-grade antimony ore. This acquisition complements Xtra Energy's broader national platform aimed at restoring domestic antimony supply chains.

""This is another strategic step toward securing control of Nevada's most important antimony-producing corridors,"" said Mac J. Shahsavar, P.Eng., Chairman and CEO of Xtra Energy Corp. ""We are focused on building scalable, domestic antimony supply in historically proven districts with near-term development potential.""

Figure 2 : Project Proximity + Recorded Historic Production

Historic and Geological Significance of Big Creek

The Big Creek Mining District is located on the western flank of the central Toiyabe Range in Lander County, approximately 10 miles south-southwest of Austin, Nevada and approximately 50 miles from XTPT's Flagship Project American Antimony (See Figure 2.). The area is accessible via well-maintained dirt roads leading south from the U.S. Highway 50.

Mining activity in the district dates back to the 1860s, when silver-bearing veins were first discovered. However, due to the high content of antimony and copper, early silver extraction proved difficult, leading to rapid abandonment of many of the initial operations. Interest revived in 1890 with the discovery of the Pine Mine in nearby Dry Canyon and surged again during World War I (1916-1918) in response to strategic demand for antimony. Production between 1935 and 1969 was intermittent and tied to volatile market conditions.

There are two principal historical workings located in Big Creek Canyon:

The Bray-Beulah and Hard Luck-Pradier workings

Figure 3 : Notable Historic Mines within Claim Boundaries

Other historical workings include:

Toi Claims

Victoria Claims

The patented Bray-Beulah Mine (also known as the Genessee) is located on the west side of Big Creek, approximately 4.8 miles from the canyon mouth, hosted within the Ordovician Valmy Formation. The Hard Luck-Pradier workings lie about 1,000 feet to the north. While initially located as a silver mine in 1864, antimony was not recognized in the Bray-Beulah until 1891, when it was relocated by J. Bray.

Between 1891 and 1898, the Bray-Beulah produced over 1,000 tons of 60% antimony ore from at least two underground adits totaling over 900 feet of workings. The Bray-Beulah is reported to have been the third-largest antimony producer in Nevada, yet virtually no ore has been extracted since World War I, leaving the area largely underexplored in the modern era.

Figure 4 : Historical Workings of the Bray-Beulah Tunnel

Strategic Expansion for XTPT

With this acquisition, Xtra Energy gains the opportunity to:

Conduct modern geological, geochemical, and geophysical evaluation of a highly mineralized corridor

Target underexplored extensions of historic workings with known high-grade stibnite zones

Evaluate potential for early monetization of stockpiled or remnant ore materials

This project complements XTPT's existing holdings at its flagship American Antimony Project in Nevada and its recent acquisition of the Gold Creek District in Washington State-solidifying the company's position as the national leader in the U.S.-based antimony development.

What People Are Saying Dan O'Brien, a senior analyst at Energy Innovation, told Newsweek: ""This bill will raise energy prices for all Americans.","The budget reconciliation bill signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4 repeals many renewable energy incentives introduced by the Biden administration, which analysts warn could limit energy production and increase costs for Americans nationwide.

According to the climate policy think tank Energy Innovation, the energy provisions of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" will raise wholesale electricity prices by 25 percent by 2030 and by 74 percent by 2035, while increasing the rates consumers pay by between 9 and 18 percent over the decade.

In response to these fears, the White House told Newsweek that the bill will ""turbocharge oil production,"" lowering overall energy costs and providing ""further relief to American families and businesses.""

Why It Matters

The projected increases in Americans' energy bills, which are already rising for reasons beyond the GOP's budget, will further strain household budgets, particularly in regions that have adopted or planned to expand their adoption of clean energy technologies to meet their electricity demands.

In addition to rising energy costs, analysts believe the bill could also see hundreds of thousands of job losses, as renewable energy projects across the country are halted or canceled outright.

What To Know

The bill, signed into law after months of interparty debates and revisions, amends several clean energy grant programs enacted during the presidency of Joe Biden and via his flagship 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The budget pulls funding for clean energy programs and phases out various renewable tax credits, primarily by shortening the qualification window for wind and solar projects.

According to Energy Innovation, the downstream impacts of the bill on renewable energy projects—many of which will be abandoned as a result—will ""significantly hamper the development of domestic electricity generation capacity,"" resulting in a 340 gigawatt decrease in generation capacity by 2035 despite the simultaneous efforts to increase nonrenewable energy production.

Their research found that the bill will raise energy costs for all Americans, but Dan O'Brien, a senior analyst at the think tank, told Newsweek recently that these impacts would ""vary by state."" This, he said, depends on each region's geography and potential for solar and wind developments, as well as states' willingness to support investments in such technologies without federal assistance.

Below is a map detailing Energy Innovation's estimates for the annual energy cost increases expected by 2030 and 2036 as a result of the Big Beautiful Bill.

According to the findings, Nevadans will see the most significant price hike by the end of this decade, with the bill adding $300 to the average $1,600 currently paid annually in the state. Energy Innovation said this significant increase is due to the declining deployment of new energy resources, which will result from the bill's passage.

Nevada has long been a leader in incorporating green energy, with renewables accounting for 43 percent of Nevada's total in-state electricity generation in 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Nationally, these account for around a quarter of America's total generation.

By 2035, Missouri is expected to see the largest increase of $640, followed by Kentucky and South Carolina, both at $630.

""As deployment of new energy resources and advanced manufacturing decline under the bill, Missouri will lose out on significant planned private investment,"" the think tank wrote in its analysis, adding that the state will also see annual losses of $1.4 billion in its gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030, rising to $3.5 billion by 2035.

What People Are Saying

Dan O'Brien, a senior analyst at Energy Innovation, told Newsweek: ""This bill will raise energy prices for all Americans. The impacts will vary by state. Some states in the South and Midwest have enormous potential for wind and solar development due to their unique geographies, but little state policy to back this investment. As a result, these are the states where we forecast lots of projects will fail and where dependence on increasingly expensive natural gas generation is likely.""

He added: ""Much of energy cost inflation is due to increases in the price of power as fewer low-cost renewables are added to the grid. In fact, we find this bill will increase the inflation-adjusted price of electricity over a sustained period of several decades for the first time since the energy crisis of the 70s and 80s. Nationally averaged, this comes in at 10 to 18 percent increases for residential, commercial, and industrial consumers.""

White House assistant press secretary Taylor Rogers told Newsweek: ""Since Day One, President Trump has taken decisive steps to unleash American energy and drive oil and gas production to reduce the cost of energy. The One Big Beautiful Bill will turbocharge oil production by streamlining operations for maximum efficiency and expanding domestic production capacity, which will deliver further relief to American families and businesses.""

Harry Godfrey, managing director and head of federal engagement at Advanced Energy United, previously told Newsweek: ""As this bill has been debated over the past 6 months, we've seen pullbacks, particularly from domestic advanced energy manufacturing companies.

""Those pullbacks speak to the upstream impact of this bill. Manufacturers, making multi-decadal, multi-billion dollar investments in new factories and assembly lines, are looking out beyond the horizon and seeing a shrinking U.S. market for technologies like solar inverters, wind turbines, batteries (particularly for EVs). So it's little surprise they're getting cold feet. They're the canaries in the coal mine.""

What Happens Next

Beyond energy bills, the think tank estimates that the decreased incentives for investments in renewables will also result in a $980 billion hit to America's GDP over the budget reconciliation window, alongside around 760,000 job losses by 2030.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2686955/energy-bills.png,N,,2025-07-21 11:05:03.430733

American Resources Corp (NASDAQ:AREC) and its subsidiary ReElement Technologies have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Impossible Metals Inc to jointly develop a vertically integrated US-based supply chain for critical minerals, the companies said on Monday.

The partnership aims to combine Impossible Metals' deep-sea nodule harvesting technology with ReElement's refining capabilities to deliver copper, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and rare earth elements from seabed to finished product within the US.

Under the agreement, ReElement will refine deep-sea nodules collected by Impossible Metals and deliver separated, high-purity materials to downstream customers. The venture seeks to reduce reliance on China for key minerals used in defense, energy storage, and advanced manufacturing.

The companies said their combined approach—mining in federal waters near American Samoa and refining in Indiana—offers an end-to-end supply chain solution intended to enhance environmental stewardship while supporting national industrial goals.

“We're excited to bring ReElement's advanced refining capabilities to this important mission and serve as the toll processor for materials essential to America's energy and defense security,” Mark Jensen, CEO of ReElement told shareholders.

“Both of our teams share a clear vision for establishing an efficient, scalable, and 100% US mining-to-processing supply chain for the critical materials necessary for defense and advanced industrial purposes,” Oliver Gunasekara, CEO of Impossible Metals added.

Impossible Metals, which has advocated for US seabed mining policy, plans to deploy its autonomous underwater platform, Eureka III, in 2026 to collect polymetallic nodules without disturbing marine life. The company has also prompted the Department of the Interior to begin permitting for deep-sea mineral extraction in US federal waters.

The initiative follows an executive order signed in April by former President Donald Trump aimed at accelerating offshore critical mineral development. The order underscores growing political support for domestic sourcing of rare earths and other strategic resources.

Shares of American Resources jumped on the update, adding 14.3% at $1.54 on Monday morning.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI1XzA3XC8yMDI1LTA2LTIwLTA5LTU1LTM2LWMyYmQxZjE0ZmRjYTEwNWExZDFlNDY0NTFmMWQ2ZjlhXzY4N2U0NTNkNmFiZDcuanBnIiwiZWRpdHMiOnsicmVzaXplIjp7IndpZHRoIjoxMjAwLCJoZWlnaHQiOjYzMCwiZml0IjoiY292ZXIifX19,N,,2025-07-21 12:04:25.147047

Under the Biden Administration, over 10 million unvetted illegal immigrants entered the United States from over 160 countries, including countries on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. Furthermore, over 400 illegal aliens on the Terrorist Watch List were encountered at the border during the Biden presidency.

In addition to their disastrous open border policies and resulting historic illegal border crossing numbers, the Biden Administration also failed to prosecute the illegals who defied U.S. immigration law in a timely manner and remove them from our country. This lack of consequences due to Biden’s refusal to enforce our laws provided incentive for migrants to continue entering and reentering the U.S. illegally, knowing most likely they’d be released.

Between January 2021 and January 2024, the Biden Administration prosecuted less than 1,000 illegal entry cases per month, reducing deterrence and undermining our rule of law. Migrants who disregard our immigration laws, particularly more than once, have demonstrated their willingness to break our laws: why wouldn’t they disregard other laws, as well? Over 70 percent of the aliens charged for illegally reentering the U.S. in fiscal year 2023 had criminal records.

Under current law, migrants face a fine and up to six months' imprisonment for a first illegal entry, a fine and up to two years' imprisonment for a second illegal entry, and a fine and up to two years' imprisonment for illegal reentry. A migrant who illegally reenters after being convicted of a felony or three or more misdemeanors can face up to 10 years in prison, with aliens who illegally reenter after an aggravated felony conviction can face up to 20 years.

We cannot allow illegal immigration to go unpunished or undeterred. House Republicans are bringing legislation to strengthen current law with harsher penalties to better deter criminal migrants from entering the U.S. illegally and provide more resources to prosecute illegals who entered under Biden.

H.R. 3486, the Stop Illegal Entry Act, introduced by Rep. Stephanie Bice, increases penalties for aliens who illegally enter or reenter the United States to discourage migrants from coming to the U.S. illegally and keep criminal aliens that disregard federal immigration law out of American communities.

President Trump has delivered on his promise to shut down the border, with crossings hitting record lows under his leadership; but there is still work to be done to undo the damage of the Biden Administration. This bill ensures migrants think twice before flouting U.S. law and crossing illegally into our country.

Reforming the CWA Permitting Processes to Promote Clarity and Growth

The Clean Water Act (CWA) is the principal law regulating the quality of the nation's surface waters and controlling water pollution, aiming to ""restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters."" The CWA is meant to support American farming, fishing, and manufacturing industries and maintain healthy communities across the country.

Unfortunately, however, the Clean Water Act has been used over the years to hold up permits, preventing critical infrastructure and energy projects from advancing with red tape and lack of regulatory clarity and hurting the communities it’s meant to serve.

House Republicans are bringing forward legislation that includes targeted, common-sense reforms to bolster and simplify the permitting process for permit seekers and holders, increase regulatory certainty, and provide more clarity for agencies issuing permits.

This commonsense bill incorporates several separate or previously introduced bills that together overhaul the permitting process to allow our nation to build safer, smarter, and faster by cutting red tape while continuing to protect clean water. The legislation doesn’t roll back the Clean Water Act, but limits its scope by redefining navigable waters and improves regulatory clarity so permit holders, seekers, and agencies can comply while supporting critical projects.

Let’s stop holding up infrastructure projects and energy development that would strengthen our nation with bureaucracy and federal red tape, and instead make it easier for permit holders, seekers, and agencies to build the right way.

Rep. Mike Collins’ legislation, H.R. 3898, the Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today (PERMIT) Act, consists of commonsense, targeted reforms to the Clean Water Act to cut burdensome red tape, streamline the permitting process, increase efficiency, provide regulatory clarity, and promote critical growth and development while continuing to protect clean water.

The American people want government that’s efficient, productive, and supports growth – not government that’s overflowing with burdensome bureaucracy and impossible-to-understand or reach requirements. House Republicans are delivering.

Reversing a Biden-Era RMP Amendment Crushing Montana Coal Mining

Last November, the Biden Administration’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) approved a Resource Management Plan (RMP) Amendment for the Miles City Field Office located in Miles City, Montana, which guides the management of BLM lands in the Miles City Field Office, including land use allocations of areas available for further coal leasing consideration and those that are not.

Staying in line with his administration’s radical ‘Green New Scam’ and anti-American energy agenda, the Biden RMP Amendment allocates a whopping ZERO acres of BLM administered coal as available, and 1,745,040 acres unavailable for further coal leasing consideration in the Miles City Field Office planning area.

This radical RMP Amendment limits future coal leasing in the area to essentially none – shutting down domestic energy production, threatening access to affordable, reliable American energy, killing jobs, and negatively impacting the economy in Montana.

We should be encouraging domestic energy production so we can stop relying on foreign nations for our energy, threatening our national security – especially since we produce energy much cleaner and safer than anywhere else in the world. House Republicans are bringing forward legislation to overturn the Biden BLM’s disastrous RMP Amendment that crushes domestic production by stifling coal mining in Miles City, Montana.

H.J. Res. 104, introduced by Rep. Troy Downing, expresses congressional disapproval of the RMP Amendment submitted by the Bureau of Land Management relating to ‘‘Miles City Field Office Record of Decision and Approved Resource Management Plan Amendment,’’ which essentially ends future coal leasing of BLM lands in the Miles City Field Office area, threatening American energy independence and security.

Energy security is national security. House Republicans won’t stop fighting to unleash American energy and keep the U.S. energy dominant by cutting Biden-era energy-crushing and job-killing regulations.

Promoting Energy Development and Production in North Dakota

In early January, the Biden Administration’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) approved a Resource Management Plan (RMP) for the North Dakota Field Office to replace the 1988 RMP, guiding management of BLM lands across North Dakota for the next 20 years. This includes 58,500 acres of BLM-administered surface land and 4.1 million acres of BLM-administered mineral estate.

Once again, the Biden Administration put their ‘Green New Scam’ agenda and radical environmental activists over American energy security, jobs, and a strong economy: the Biden-era North Dakota RMP severely limits oil and gas development and coal leasing in the state, crushing future development, domestic energy production, and the benefits that come with it.

The harmful RMP would end leasing on over four million acres – 99 percent of federal coal acreage – and prevent leasing on 213,000 acres – 44 percent of federally owned fluid mineral acreage – of North Dakota federal lands.

This is unacceptable, and will only hurt North Dakotans, the state’s economy, the job market, and national energy security. We must unleash American energy, not shut it down. House Republicans are bringing forward legislation to reverse this burdensome RMP and unshackle energy development and production in North Dakota, lowering costs for hardworking families, creating jobs, and bolstering our national security.

Rep. Julie Fedorchak’s legislation, H.J. Res. 105, nullifies the Bureau of Land Management rule relating to ‘‘North Dakota Field Office Record of Decision and Approved Resource Management Plan’’ that severely restricts coal leasing and mineral resource development in North Dakota, hindering the expansion of American energy production and the economic opportunities it provides.

America needs an all-of-the-above energy strategy that supports American energy independence and security – House Republicans are fighting to deliver.

Unleashing Alaska’s Mineral Resources and Energy Development

In November 2024, the Biden Administration’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) approved a Resource Management Plan (RMP) for the Central Yukon region of Alaska, guiding the allocation of public land use in the region, including mineral and energy resource development. The planning area is made up of roughly 55.7 million acres, with about 13.3 million of those acres being public lands managed by the BLM Central Yukon Field Office.

This disastrous RMP designates 21 areas of critical environmental concern or research natural areas, consisting of around 3.6 million acres – imposing federal red-tape that blocks resource development such as pipeline and oil and gas development, significantly hindering energy production in the region.

The economic impacts from shutting down mineral exploration and development will only harm Alaska and hardworking Americans, with no payoff. Crushing domestic energy production in Alaska by impeding resource development, including pipeline and oil and gas development, kills jobs and threatens America’s energy, and therefore national, security.

House Republicans are bringing legislation to stop these burdensome and damaging restrictions on energy development in the Central Yukon region of Alaska, unleashing American energy, safeguarding jobs, shoring up energy security, and lowering energy costs for hardworking Americans. It’s past time we unlock Alaska’s full potential and unleash its extensive energy and mineral resources.

H.J. Res. 106, introduced by Rep. Nick Begich, reverses the Bureau of Land Management rule relating to ‘‘Central Yukon Record of Decision and Approved Resource Management Plan’’ that blocks resource development such as pipeline and oil and gas development in the region, hurting energy production and crushing job creation.

The Sunderland eHGV project was led by charge point operator, Gridserve, and brings together Nissan, haulage partners Fergusons, Yusen logistics, and used vehicle specialists, ECA. Funded as part of the UK Government’s £200m Innovate UK scheme, the site has seven charging stations capable of powering up to 10 eHGVs simultaneously.

The site is the first of its kind in the UK to support an end-to-end electric supply chain. The all-electric trucks will collecks parts from Nissan’s UK supply base stretching as far as Derby in the Midlands and deliver them to the Sunderland factory where they will be used to built the upcoming Nissan Leaf, plus all-electric versions of the Qashqai and the Juke.

According to Nissan, the distance between Sunderland and Derby equates to around 1.5 million miles (2.4m kilometres) travelled annually. Using eHGVs will lead to a reduction of 1,500 tonnes of CO2 per-year.

The newly-built hub also supports the Nissan EV36Zero vision for sustainable manufacturing, which aims to produce the Japanese carmaker’s electric vehicles and batteries in one single renewable energy-powered factory.

Regarding this eHGV milestone, Michael Simpson, Nissan’s supply chain management vice president, said: “It is fantastic for our plant to be leading the charge to an electrified supply chain with this project.

“We welcome the support we’ve received from our partners to bring the charging station to life and we’re proud of what we have achieved. The charging station looks brilliant and is a big step forward in Nissan’s EV360 vision, which brings together electric vehicles, zero carbon energy, and battery manufacturing.

“We’re exploring further opportunities to allow other hauliers to use the charging station as well as looking at other areas to maximise its full potential.”

Daniel Kunkel, Gridserve CEO added: “”The decarbonisation of transport logistics is much stronger and reaches far wider when done in partnership. This is why, as leaders of the Electric Freightway consortium, we are so pleased to support this UK first with Nissan and their haulage partners.

“Depot charging is critical for the electrification of HGVs, going hand in hand with future public infrastructure developments. As a first shared usage site, this location is leading the way in sustainable freight logistics.”",https://evpowered.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nissan-eHGV-site-Sunderland-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-21 12:02:17.501382

The nation’s natural gas utilities are already hard at work innovating to find new, more flexible answers and grow storage options.
The industry is utilizing flexible solutions like LNG storage to stockpile natural gas as a liquid in tanks connected to natural gas transmission or distribution pipelines to help manage demand on peak days.","America’s natural gas utilities are working alongside state governments and businesses to deliver more energy to consumers, support manufacturing, and ensure reliable energy for data centers across the country. The natural gas industry is a driving force fueling the economy of the future and is leading the way within the energy sector for the speedy delivery of adequate and affordable fuel to facilities that are being built today.

Today, new energy infrastructure is needed quickly, and natural gas often proves the fastest way to ensure the timely delivery of the energy that new facilities need, helping to jump start the economy and meet this administration’s ambitious goals without delay. It is because of the natural gas industry’s ability to meet rising demand reliably, affordably and as rapidly as new factories and data centers can be built that makes this fuel America’s strategic advantage in the AI race.

America’s domestic natural gas resources are abundant with more than 100 years of recoverable natural gas supply at our disposal. We also have a robust delivery system with 2.8 million miles of pipeline networks already in operation in the United States providing reliable, affordable and safe fuel for rapidly scaling domestic manufacturing and emerging data centers.

More than 189 million Americans and 5.8 million businesses use natural gas because it is affordable, reliable, safe and essential to improving our environment. Commercial and industrial customers have saved more than $500 billion over the last decade by using natural gas, and that affordability compared to electricity is expected to continue through at least 2050.

Only one in 650 natural gas customers experience a planned or unplanned natural gas outage in any given year on average. Comparatively, electric customers experience an average of one outage per customer per year. Beyond keeping your house warm and appliances operating, that statistic means hundreds of thousands of dollars saved from disruption and down time at data centers and manufacturing facilities.

For all these reasons, America’s natural gas industry is ready and able meet the demand of today and tomorrow. The natural gas industry has an eye on the future and is consistently taking steps to ensure demand will continue to be meet two, three and even four decades down the line.

Demand has increased rapidly, and while the natural gas system is consistently working to reliably meet that growing demand, long-term investment will also be needed to help ensure the infrastructure can keep up as demand continues to grow.

Natural gas storage has remained relatively stagnant over the past decade while demand has risen, with underground storage capacity growth slowing to just 0.1% per year since 2014. At the same time, utilization of underground storage has increased to meet growing demand in the winter and the summer due to rising use of natural gas for electric generation.

Official government outlooks project production of natural gas to increase as demand rises. It is imperative that in addition to delivering more molecules to customers, the delivery system also maintains its ability to store natural gas to help keep prices relatively low and stable and continue to preserve reliability during extreme weather events.

The nation’s natural gas utilities are already hard at work innovating to find new, more flexible answers and grow storage options. The industry is utilizing flexible solutions like LNG storage to stockpile natural gas as a liquid in tanks connected to natural gas transmission or distribution pipelines to help manage demand on peak days. These plants are particularly helpful in places like the Northeast, where underground storage is unavailable due to geology and the ability to build new pipelines has been hindered by state policies.

Increasingly, LNG storage can also be co-located with electric power plants, helping to optimize pipeline capacity and improve reliability for electric generators. This added flexibility is critical for maintaining reliability when variable forms of renewable energy like solar and wind face low-production days.

As natural gas continues to lead the way in meeting rising demand, it is imperative that federal and state policies keep pace to help enable permitting of new infrastructure, reduce wait times, and limit endless litigation that can bog down projects in places for a decade or more. American infrastructure has long been stuck behind a byzantine permitting process that imposes unnecessary and detrimental delays and a legal system that bogs down challenges to new projects for years in court.

Congress must pass meaningful and durable permitting reform, including judicial reforms for natural gas and all energy projects, to deliver the energy capacity our nation needs. Similarly, state regulators should take heed – energy availability is one of the largest attractors for business investment. States that do not have policies that welcome new energy infrastructure will lose out on jobs that could boost their economies.

With the hope of new investments into natural gas infrastructure, alongside needed permitting reforms that Congress is poised to pass into law, natural gas utilities stand ready and are already working to meet the challenges of America’s future energy needs. Much-needed reform will drive economic progress for this country, homeowners and businesses alike and help ensure Americans have access to the reliable energy they want, need and expect. In the meantime, America’s natural gas industry is innovating, building and delivering on our promise of reliable, affordable and safe energy for our families and businesses.",https://www.aga.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1316766511-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-21 10:02:01.480832

Antwerp, Belgium, July 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Blink Charging Co. (NASDAQ: BLNK) (“Blink” or the “Company”), a leading global owner, operator, and provider of electric vehicle (EV) charging equipment and services, today announced its collaboration with leading Belgian office property company, Group Bernaerts, to expand upon Group Bernaerts’ sustainability goals for its Belgian properties.

Evolving from a collaboration that began in 2022, Group Bernaerts now operates 88 Blink charging stations across its various properties in Antwerp and Mechelen. This number is expected to double by the end of this year, with Group Bernaerts planning to expand its charging infrastructure, both underground and above ground.

“We offer EV charging parking management solutions through collaborations with third parties,” said Alex Calnan, Managing Director of Europe at Blink Charging. “Using platforms specifically designed for complex multi-tenant environments, we optimize the use of parking spaces are actively utilized rather than left vacant. This maximizes the value of each charging location, benefiting both the property owner and the community.”

“Every single one of the Blink Chargers on our properties in Antwerp and Mechelen is used daily,” said Nico Van Daele, Managing Director of Group Bernaerts. “In fact, the number of kilowatt-hours charged at our sites has tripled each year. The comprehensive service that Blink delivers was exactly what we needed – and what our tenants wanted.”

“Above ground, we will focus on semi-public chargers near highways, concert halls, and event venues,” said Van Daele. “This way, the chargers will also be useful after office hours and on weekends.”

Before the collaboration began, office tenants were independently installing their own charging stations in their designated parking spaces, each using private meters. This led to an uncontrolled proliferation of charging stations, creating significant technical and operational challenges. To regain control, and implement a more structured approach, Group Bernaerts reached out to Blink.

“Office owners are rapidly being confronted with this new, urgent need from their tenants. We understand that this can be overwhelming. That’s why we take over the entire process, from technical analysis and design to installation and implementation,” explained Anthony Poshcet, Head of European Sales and Marketing at Blink. “Plus, every client has a dedicated contact person at Blink to answer questions and provide support. Group Bernaerts is one of the first real estate owners to proactively invest in charging infrastructure for their tenants - an essential need that will only continue to grow. Their forward-thinking approach aligns perfectly with our own drive to continuously adapt to change.”

International Tax Provisions.","With the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), attention turns from Congress to the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as they develop administrative guidance to implement the bill. The bill's scope, magnitude, and speed of enactment, combined with relatively little legislative history and several retroactive effective dates, puts a priority on timely guidance. This week, we consider what guidance Treasury and the IRS are likely to prioritize given their limited resources.

Trump Campaign Tax Relief Proposals. Perhaps the greatest priority is developing guidance for Trump's marquee tax relief provisions – no tax on tips and overtime, the seniors deduction, and the deductibility of domestic car loan interest. These items top the list given the political desire to maximize and accelerate the bill's positive economic impact and the inherent complications of writing rules for provisions that are effective retroactively to the beginning of 2025. Not surprisingly, the IRS issued a fact sheet last week noting future transition relief for each of these provisions for 2025.

Retroactive Relief with Respect to Domestic R&E Expensing. In addition to providing permanent expensing of domestic research and experimentation (R&E) expenditures, the OBBBA also provides specific elective retroactive relief for expenditures capitalized between 2022 and 2024. Taxpayers need early administrative guidance to determine if and how they benefit from electing retroactive relief, as this election must be made in the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2024.

Termination, Phase-Out, and Restrictions on Inflation Reduction Act Green Energy Credits. After the enactment of the OBBBA, the White House weighed in with a rather unique executive order directing Treasury action within 45 days to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits for wind and solar facilities, including the issuance of new and revised administrative guidance.

International Tax Provisions. While perhaps not at the scale of comprehensive reform of international tax rules seen in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the OBBBA contains significant changes to these rules that must be carefully layered atop the existing complex international tax statutory and regulatory regime. Guidance is needed to implement the changes that converts global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) to Net Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) Tested Income and foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) to foreign-derived deduction eligible income (FDDEI), as well as guidance to explain how these provisions, as well as the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT) and section 163(j), operate and interact with one another.

With respect to these provisions and many others, we expect to see an initial round of sub-regulatory guidance (notices, FAQs, and Q&As) followed by a formal ""notice and comment"" regulatory process. We also wouldn't be surprised to see executive orders from the president that further direct the content and timing of particular OBBBA regulations. #TaxTake

In a single sweep of legislation, the newly signed law slashes green energy investments, props up fossil fuels, and, according to multiple models, threatens to erase decades of hard-won climate progress.

What’s at stake:

Signed on July 4 with patriotic fanfare, the bill repeals landmark clean energy tax credits and green-light fossil fuel expansion — from drilling on public lands to tax breaks for coal, oil, and gas companies. Think of it as a U-turn from the climate roadmap laid out in the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act.

According to modeling by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES), the legislation will increase U.S. emissions by 8% above where they would have been otherwise. Brad Townsend, the group’s policy chief, put it bluntly: “From an emissions perspective, this bill is a disaster.” He likened it to undoing a third of all climate progress made in the past two decades — with a single signature.

The impact by the numbers:

+8% emissions vs. previous projections (C2ES)

134 million: The equivalent number of gas-powered cars added to the road (Rhodium Group)

575 million metric tons: Extra carbon dioxide projected in 2035

53–59% fewer new green energy projects expected on the grid between 2025–2035

25% projected emissions cut by 2035 (Princeton) vs. 40–44% under Biden-era policy

The Biden administration had aimed for a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030. Under the new law, that goal is all but out of reach.

A rollback in the face of record-breaking weather:

The bill’s timing is as stark as its content. It passed just as parts of Texas endured deadly floods and heat waves swept across the country, grim reminders that climate change isn’t theoretical. It’s here, and it’s deadly.

But while the rest of the world scrambles to slow the planet’s warming, this bill sends the U.S. in the opposite direction. It eliminates programs for pollution reduction in underserved neighborhoods and cuts off funding for electric vehicles, solar, and wind — just as global demand for renewables surges.

No new goals, just more gas:

Unlike the Biden administration, which had explicit emissions targets, the Trump administration has offered no new climate benchmarks. The focus, instead, is on domestic energy dominance, read: fossil fuels.

What this means for the rest of us:

Models differ slightly in how bad things might get, but all point in the same direction: more emissions, fewer clean energy projects, and a tougher future for the planet. “Every extra ton of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere,” said analyst Ben King, “has some impact on the likelihood of extreme weather.”

So while the bill might score political points with Trump’s base, it’s the atmosphere and future generations that will pay the real price.

Bottom line:

This isn’t just a policy shift. It’s a climate pivot with global consequences. In a moment when the science demands urgency, the U.S. has chosen retreat. The “big, beautiful bill” might look like victory from the Rose Garden, but on the front lines of climate change, it reads more like surrender.

Sign up for its newsletter here.

A pair of new climate studies suggest an intensification of strong storms called nor’easters and other disruptive extremes affecting the East Coast of North America on an overheated planet.

Nor’easters generally form within about 100 miles of the East Coast between North Carolina and Massachusetts, often when cooler air from Canada meets warm, moist air over Gulf Stream waters. Those contrasting air masses can start to spin with a nudge from the jet stream, fueling storms that can produce damaging winds, coastal flooding and intense, disruptive snowfall in the winter.

The strongest nor’easters are already significantly windier and rainer than they were in the middle of the 20th century, said University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann, a coauthor of a study published on 14 July in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

A 2022 study showed a similar trend of intensification for storms forming over the Atlantic and hitting Europe, and that the track of those storms is moving northward, potentially putting unsuspecting areas more at risk.

“There are two reasons to look at the most intense nor’easters,” Mann said via email. “First, from an impact standpoint, they do the most damage, including coastal erosion, destruction and paralyzing snowfalls. The 1962 Ash Wednesday storm, with 84 mile per hour gusts, is a great example. In today’s dollars, it did $21 billion worth of damage.”

And just last February, a classic nor’easter described at the time as a “bomb cyclone” dropped several feet of snow over parts of Virginia and North Carolina and caused damaging flooding along parts of the Massachusetts coast, Eastern Long Island, and the Jersey Shore.

Mann said the increases in the intensity and precipitation rates of the strongest nor’easters have likely been fueled by increases in ocean temperatures and the increased moisture capacity of a warming atmosphere.

The researchers tracked 900 nor’easters back to 1940 in combination with a careful reanalysis of historical climate conditions surrounding the storms, including notable events like the Perfect Storm in 1991, Storm of the Century in 1993, and Snowmaggedon in 2010.

In the very strongest storms, the wind speeds have increased about 5.4%, from 69 to 71 mph, “but since destructive potential goes as the wind speed cubed, that’s a roughly 17% increase in destructive potential,” Mann said.

Overall, he added, a lot of research suggests that extra warming in the Arctic, which reduces the temperature contrast between high latitudes and midlatitudes, will lead to less storminess overall, but the destructive potential of intensifying nor’easters warrants attention.

Compared to other types of storms, nor’easters feed more off the heat of the ocean, which remains considerable in winter, “So those storms that can make it past the obstacles to development have the potential to grow stronger than they otherwise would have,” he said. “While we don’t see any evidence of increased intensity for the ‘average’ nor’easter, the strongest ones are clearly getting stronger.”

“My interest in these storms, and how they’re being impacted by climate change has been inspired by two personal experiences,” he said, first noting the March 1993 “storm of the century,” which caused 270 deaths and $12.2 billion worth of damage across 26 states, according to the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration.

Mann said the storm disrupted a spring break road trip in Florida, where the temperature in St. Augustine dropped from the 70s to 40s in a few hours.

“We drove past Okefenokee Swamp later that day and it was snowing,” Mann said. “Then we stopped off in Southern Georgia for the night and temperatures dropped to the mid 20s. We froze. I will never forget that.”

He said he remembers another infamous nor’easter, Snowmaggedon, from February 2010 because a U.S. senator who rejects science that proves human-caused warming used the occasion to build what he called an igloo in an attempt to cast doubt on climate science. At the same time, Mann said he ended up stuck in a hotel room for three days with several feet of snow blocking most roads in Pennsylvania.

As such storms grow stronger in a warming world, said Anthony Broccoli, an atmospheric scientist at Rutgers University who was not involved in the new study but who also researches nor’easters, “it will be important to remember that the strongest nor’easters can have impacts comparable to category 1 and 2 hurricanes, with effects encompassing a larger area.”

With sea level rise accelerating along the East Coast, Broccoli added that nor’easters “will lead to greater coastal flooding even without any changes in storm intensity.”

The increased thermal energy from warming oceans is likely driving the trend toward stronger nor’easters, and there could be other large-scale changes to ocean currents and winds that could shift the tracks of nor’easters, potentially raising unexpected risks in new areas, he said.

The new research doesn’t mean that temperatures are getting colder, but that the frigid air that still does form over the Arctic in winter will still make its way south, showing up perhaps more frequently in unexpected regions, or with increased unusual seasonal extremes that can damage crops.

The Arctic Connection

Large-scale changes affecting nor’easters and cold weather extremes in the United States likely include accelerated warming of the Arctic region, climatologist Judah Cohen said in an email interview. Cohen, a visiting scientist at MIT and director of seasonal research with Atmospheric and Environmental Research, published an 11 July study in Science Advances that bolsters evidence for a climate connection.

Cohen said that, as far as he’s concerned, the new paper is “preaching to the choir,” because its conclusions are consistent with his own research showing that “Arctic change can lead to episodic increases in severe winter weather in the U.S. east of the Rockies including extreme cold and disruptive snowfalls.”

The temperature contrast between the Arctic and the midlatitudes is one of the main forces that creates key winds at different altitudes, like the jet stream and polar vortex, and moves weather systems around the Northern Hemisphere.

Cohen’s work over recent years suggests that accelerated warming of the Arctic “stretches” the polar vortex—like elongating a round rubber band—into positions that let cold polar air spill southward more frequently.

He noted that two of the most recent nor’easters specifically named in the new paper by Mann and his coauthors, in March 1993 and January 2018, occurred during stretched polar vortex events. The new paper, he said, “provides a medley of possible causes but doesn’t settle on any one cause.”

His own recent paper, he said, shows “for the first time that stretched polar vortex events are overwhelmingly associated with extreme cold and heavy snowfall in the Eastern U.S.,” compared to other polar vortex configurations.

Often the polar vortex flows in a tight coil around the North Pole, containing the Arctic air, but Cohen’s study, and other research, suggest a trend to more frequent stretched polar vortexes and the associated cold-air outbreaks and storm impacts. Taken altogether, he said the new research helps explain regional “winter cooling trends and an increased number of heavy snowfalls in the Eastern U.S. over the past two and a half decades.”

Geronimo Power is building a 250 MW solar project in Wisconsin to facilitate data center development. Meanwhile, 38 Degrees North has raised more than $230 million while acquiring a 250 MW project portfolio, SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry has joined forces with GS Power Partners to cut energy costs through community solar, DESRI and El Paso Electric have started construction at the Santa Teresa solar and storage facility in New Mexico, OCI Energy has sold a 120 MW solar project in Texas to Sabanci Renewables, Sol Systems secures $675 million in financing to develop 500 MW solar + storage project pipeline. Read all about these developments in this edition of the Projects Weekly.

Geronimo Power has started onsite construction at its 250 MW Portage Solar project in Portage County, Wisconsin, within the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) market. The project joins Apple River Solar, which announced the start of construction earlier this year in Polk County, Wisconsin.

“The true value of renewable energy isn’t in the power it provides to the local grid,” said Joe Ibrahim, VP of construction at Geronimo Power. “It’s about the immensely positive impact to local economies in the form of new revenue streams and job creation. We anticipate the addition of Portage Solar to our Wisconsin portfolio will contribute more than $100 million statewide. That’s a huge milestone for us and a big win for our project communities.”

Cool factor: Portage is anticipated to contribute more than $73 million in direct economic impact over the first 20 years of operation through the creation of new tax revenue, jobs, increased local spending and charitable giving. This includes $24 million in new tax revenue to be distributed to the local county and townships. These contributions, combined with Apple River, will result in more $100 million in direct economic impact across the Badger state.

Construction of the project marks the first for Geronimo to partner with engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) firm Burns & McDonnell. The project is expected to create more than 300 construction jobs, with a goal of filling all positions through local Wisconsin craft labor. Portage has a previously announced power purchase agreement (PPA) .

“As demand for data centers continues to grow, so does the need for reliable, renewable energy,” says Leslie M. Duke, chair and CEO, Burns & McDonnell. “We are proud to support Geronimo Power in the build out of the Portage site. Together with local union halls and contractors, we are supporting the workforce and strengthening the community as we build.”

Above and beyond tax revenue and job creation, Portage Solar will also pledge approximately $1.25 million to local charities and organizations over the first 20 years of operation through a dedicated charitable fund.

38 Degrees North raises more than $230 million, adds 250 MW portfolio

Community solar and distributed renewables platform 38 Degrees North has closed on a growth equity investment Climate Adaptive Infrastructure (CAI) and Kimmeridge Energy Management Co. LLC, bringing its total growth capital raised above $230 million to date. The company also completed the acquisition of Kimmeridge-backed community solar developer U.S. Light Energy, including its project pipeline of more than 250 MW.

“With rapidly rising electricity prices due to the dramatic increases in power demand from data centers, A.I. and the electrification of transportation, it’s clear that we need to accelerate the deployment of local clean energy projects that provide homeowners and small and medium sized business owners with meaningful long-term savings,” said 38 Degrees North founders Ryan Bennett, Jake Carney and Chris Bailey. “CAI and Kimmeridge’s support will be key to helping us unlock new opportunities with great development partners, landowners, and customers.”

Cool factor: Founded in 2015, 38 Degrees North is an established platform focused on development-stage and construction-ready distributed generation and community solar projects. To date, the company has successfully aggregated, financed, constructed, and managed more than 400 MW across over 100 projects through partnerships with high-quality institutional investor partners. The company previously closed a growth equity investment from S2G Investments in late 2023.

Norton Rose Fulbright served as legal counsel to 38 Degrees North on the corporate raise as well as the acquisition of U.S. Light Energy, while Kirkland & Ellis LLP represented CAI and S2G, respectively, and Foley & Lardner LLP advised Kimmeridge.

SUNY partners with GS Power to cut energy costs through community solar

GS Power Partners (GSPP) is providing the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF) energy cost savings through its Saratoga II community solar farm. The college has subscribed to GSPP’s solar farm, which is located in Middle Grove, New York, through a partnership with GSPP and Community Solar Authority (CSA). In addition to delivering substantial savings, the initiative supports the development of renewable energy infrastructure in upstate New York, reinforcing ESF’s commitment to a cleaner, more sustainable future.

“As one of the first large-scale SUNY participants in community solar, ESF is leading by example in pursuing cost-effective and community-centered sustainability solutions,” said Amanda Zurla, GSPP’s chief development officer. “Through our partnership with CSA, we were able to connect ESF with an existing project so they would realize the benefits quickly. It is our hope that the program will expand to other campuses in the future.”

Cool factor: Driven to set the standard for sustainability, ESF began searching for a community solar partner to help them support renewable energy production affordably. GSPP was able to meet ESF’s requirement for consolidated billing, and is delivering a 10 percent savings on electricity delivery costs at the main Syracuse campus, amounting to tens of thousands of dollars annually.

“We wanted to find a solution that aligned with our sustainability goals, reduced our utility expenses, and didn’t create more administrative burden,” said Michael Amadori, Energy Manager at SUNY ESF. “Community solar checked all those boxes. And most importantly, it delivers clean, affordable energy to our communities and contributes to the decarbonization of the grid.”

In addition to SUNY ESF, 530 households in New York State benefit from Saratoga II community solar credits through National Grid. Community solar adds another layer of sustainability to ESF’s campus, which is also moving toward all-electric heating systems, training staff on new energy technologies, and exploring additional heat recovery strategies.

DESRI, El Paso Electric start construction on solar + storage facility in New Mexico

DESRI and El Paso Electric (EPE) has begun construction on the Santa Teresa Solar and Storage project in Doña Ana County, New Mexico, after receiving its financial notice to proceed (FNTP).

“The Santa Teresa Project is a cornerstone of DESRI’s growing partnership with El Paso Electric and a prominent example of how cost-effective solar and storage assets can power New Mexico’s future,” said Hy Martin, chief development officer of DESRI. “The project not only contributes to regional grid stability via large-scale energy storage, but it also underscores our shared commitment to clean energy and economic development in Doña Ana County and across the state.”

LG Energy Solution Vertech will provide U.S. made battery energy storage systems and the AEROS software suite for the project with continuous support through a long-term service agreement. SOLV Energy will serve as the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor for the Project and will also provide ongoing operations and maintenance services once the Project is operational.

Cool factor: Santa Teresa is a 150 MWac solar facility with a 600 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS). The project has a 20-year power purchase agreement with EPE. The project is expected to generate enough renewable energy to power approximately 60,000 EPE customer homes each year. Santa Teresa is DESRI’s second project to begin construction in EPE’s territory, following the 130 MWac solar and 260 MWh BESS Carne project, which began construction in 2024.

“This project is about more than adding solar power. It’s about delivering lasting value to the communities and businesses we serve,” said Dave Hawkins, VP of system planning and operations support at El Paso Electric. “By providing clean energy and added capacity to the entire region, we’re strengthening reliability, supporting sustainability and investing in future economic development growth.”

OCI Energy sells 120 MWac project to Sabanci Renewables

OCI Energy has sold the 120 Mwac Project Pepper to Sabanci Renewables. The transaction marks the first collaboration between the companies with additional transactions under consideration.

“This collaboration reflects our confidence in the U.S. energy market and our commitment to scaling a resilient power portfolio,” said Tolga Kaan Doğancıoğlu, CEO of Sabanci Climate Technologies. “With this latest addition, we now hold 660 MWdc of solar capacity either operational or under construction, building toward our long-term goal of a 3,000 MWdc renewable portfolio by 2030.”

Cool factor: Located in McLennan County, Texas, Project Pepper is a utility-scale solar power project, strategically sited to meet growing demand for reliable and affordable energy in the region. OCI Energy developed Project Pepper from inception and led all phases of site acquisition, pre-construction site studies, permitting, and grid interconnection. Sabanci Renewables will now finance, construct, own and operate the project, which is expected to reach commercial operation in Q3 of 2027.

Project Pepper marks OCI Energy’s continued leadership in utility-scale solar and battery energy storage project development across the U.S., with a pipeline of over 5 GWac of projects currently under development.

Sol Systems secures $675 million to support 500 MW solar + storage portfolio

Sol Systems has acquired a $675 million revolving construction finance facility to support the buildout of its upcoming portfolio of solar and storage projects.

“This facility is a major step forward in scaling Sol’s operating portfolio,” said Richard Romero, CFO of Sol Systems. “It gives us the capital to reliably and quickly deliver clean energy projects across the country.”

Cool factor: This financing will fund construction loans, tax equity bridge loans, and letters of credit — supporting an initial 500 MW of projects planned in Illinois, Ohio and Texas. The first group of projects is expected to come online by the end of 2026. The portfolio supported by this financing is comprised of a robust pipeline of shovel-ready projects aligned with state-level and corporate decarbonization goals.

“We’ve seen long term energy supply and demand market dynamics drive continued investment into renewables,” said Dan Diamond, chief development officer at Sol Systems. “Customers continue to leverage utility scale solar for cleaner, faster, cheaper generation supply. This sizable financing paves the way for the growth of our IPP platform.”

It sold the site, along with seven other natural gas power plants in the southeastern US, to Kgen Partners in 2004 for $475 million.
Satellite images suggest little infrastructure remains at the site, but it has utility lines connecting to Memphis Light, Gas, and Water and Texas Gas Lines, which in turn connects into the 200MW Southaven natural gas power plant operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority.
Speculation that the company had purchased the power plant has been swirling for some time, with company staff having been spotted at the site.
Speaking earlier this month, xAI’s Brent Mayo, who manages the company’s operations in Memphis, said: “We are not publicly disclosing what’s happening there [at the power plant].","xAI has purchased a former natural gas power plant close to the site of its new data center in Memphis, Tennessee.

Property records show the company has bought the land, which formerly housed a Duke Energy power station.

It is on Stanton Road, across the state border from Memphis in Mississippi, and six miles from Tulane Road, where Elon Musk’s AI company is planning a one million sq ft data center to house GPUs, which will form part of its Colossus supercomputer.

First reported by the Daily Memphian, the power station has been purchased by MZT Tech LLC, a company based in the same Palo Alto, California, office as xAI. According to records, xAI is the managing member of the LLC.

The 114-acre Southhaven plant was built in 2003 by Duke Energy, and at one time, could provide 640MW of power.

It sold the site, along with seven other natural gas power plants in the southeastern US, to Kgen Partners in 2004 for $475 million. Satellite images suggest little infrastructure remains at the site, but it has utility lines connecting to Memphis Light, Gas, and Water and Texas Gas Lines, which in turn connects into the 200MW Southaven natural gas power plant operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority.

According to the DeSoto County property register, xAI appears to have bought the property from Julie James for $10.

DCD has contacted xAI for comment. Speculation that the company had purchased the power plant has been swirling for some time, with company staff having been spotted at the site.

Speaking earlier this month, xAI’s Brent Mayo, who manages the company’s operations in Memphis, said: “We are not publicly disclosing what’s happening there [at the power plant]. There’s a lot of wheels turning around what that could be and what we’re looking at. Everything is still on the table right now.”

xAI already runs a data center in Memphis, and recently gained permission to permanently install natural gas turbines at the site, much to the chagrin of environmental and civil rights campaigners.

The company has apparently been thinking outside the box to meet its power needs, with Musk stating a couple of weeks ago that it intends to buy a power plant from abroad and import it into the US to provide energy for its data centers.",https://media.datacenterdynamics.com/media/images/xAI_power_plant.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.png,N,,2025-07-21 10:02:16.256696

The National Climate Assessments were one of the most approachable resources that broke down how climate change will affect the places people care about, she said.
If the administration can convince the courts that climate change isn’t a health consideration, it could end that regulatory obligation.
The EPA’s climate change website, for instance, is still up and running, even though all references to the phenomenon were erased on the agency’s home page.
Until the National Climate Assessments disappeared, she would have said that “climate erasure” was an inappropriate characterization of what’s happening.","For 25 years, a group of the country’s top experts has been fastidiously tracking the ways that climate change threatens every part of the United States. Their findings informed the National Climate Assessments, a series of congressionally mandated reports released every four years that translated the science into accessible warnings for policymakers and the public. But that work came to a halt this spring when the Trump administration abruptly dismissed all 400 experts working on the next edition. Then, on June 30, all of the past reports vanished too, along with the federal website they lived on.

A lot of information about the changing climate has disappeared in President Donald Trump’s second term, but the erasure of the National Climate Assessments is “by far the biggest loss we’ve seen,” said Gretchen Gehrke, who monitors federal websites with the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative.

The National Climate Assessments were one of the most approachable resources that broke down how climate change will affect the places people care about, she said. The reports were also used by a wide swath of stakeholders — policymakers, farmers, businesses — to guide their decisions about the future. While the reports have been archived elsewhere, they’re no longer as easy to access. And it’s unclear what, if anything, will happen to the report that was planned for 2027 or 2028, which already existed in draft form.

So why did the reports survive Trump’s first term, but not his second?

You can view their disappearance a few ways, experts said — as a flex of executive power, an escalation in the culture war over climate change, or a strategic attempt to erase the scientific foundation for climate policy.

“If you suppress information and data, then you don’t have the evidence you need to be able to create regulations, strengthen regulations and even to combat the repeal of regulations,” Gehrke said.

This isn’t climate denial in the traditional sense. The days of loudly debating the science have mostly given way to a campaign to withhold the raw information itself. “I don’t know if we’re living in climate denial anymore,” said Leah Aronowsky, a science historian at Columbia Climate School. “We have this new front of denial by erasure.”

By cutting funding for research and withholding crucial data, the Trump administration is making it harder to know exactly how the planet is changing. In April, the administration pulled nearly $4 million in funding from a Princeton program to improve computer models predicting changes in the oceans and atmosphere, claiming the work created “climate anxiety” among young people. That same month, the Environmental Protection Agency failed to submit its annual report to the United Nations detailing the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. In May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ended its 45-year tradition of tracking billion-dollar weather disasters. Trump also hopes to shut down the Mauna Loa laboratory in Hawaiʻi, which has measured the steady rise in atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide since the 1950s — the first data to definitively show humans were changing the climate.

“This kind of wholesale suppression of an entire field of federally sponsored research, to my knowledge, is historically unprecedented,” Aronowsky said.

In a response to a request for comment, a NASA spokesperson said that it has “no legal obligations to host globalchange.gov’s data,” referring to the site that hosted the National Climate Assessments, adding that the U.S. Global Change Research Program had already “met its statutory requirements by presenting its reports to Congress.”

The EPA directed Grist to a webpage containing past greenhouse gas emissions reports, as well as a version of what was supposed to be this year’s report obtained by the Environmental Defense Fund. However, the agency confirmed that the latest data has not been officially released.

The White House declined to comment, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration did not respond.

Last year, a leaked training video from Project 2025 — the policy roadmap organized by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank — showed a former Trump official declaring that political appointees would have to “eradicate climate change references from absolutely everywhere.” The strategy appears to be designed to boost the fossil fuel industry at a time when clean energy has become competitive and the reality of climate change harder to dismiss, as floods, fires, and heat waves have become perceptibly worse. “We will drill, baby, drill,” Trump said in his inauguration speech in January.

The administration hasn’t exactly been subtle about its endgame. Lee Zeldin, the head of the EPA, doesn’t deny the reality of climate change (he calls himself a “climate realist”), but he’s zealously dismantled environmental programs and has recommended that the White House strike down the “endangerment finding,” the bedrock of U.S. climate policy. It comes from a 2007 Supreme Court ruling on the Clean Air Act that required the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants since they endanger public health. If the administration can convince the courts that climate change isn’t a health consideration, it could end that regulatory obligation.

“If you’re removing information about climate change, its reality and its impact on people, then I think it’s a lot easier to make the case that it’s not an environmental health issue,” Gehrke said.

There’s a word for the idea that ignorance can serve political ends: agnotology (from the Greek “agnosis,” or “not knowing”), the study of how knowledge is deliberately obscured. What Trump is doing to information about climate change fits squarely in that tradition, according to Aronowsky: “If you remove it, then in a certain sense, it no longer exists, and therefore, there’s nothing to even debate, right?”

Climate denial first took off in the 1990s, when the oil and gas companies and industry-friendly think tanks started sowing doubt about climate science. Over the decades, as the evidence became rock-solid, those who opposed reducing the use of fossil fuels gradually shifted from outright denying the facts to attacking solutions like wind and solar power.

What the Trump administration is doing now marks a radical break from this long-term trend, said John Cook, a climate misinformation researcher at The University of Melbourne in Australia.

“This is a 180, not just a turn, but diving into something we’ve never even seen before,” he said.

On the other hand, Cook said, the administration is taking a classic climate denial tactic — painting scientists as “alarmists” or conspirators who can’t be trusted — and turning it into government policy.

Half a year in, the second Trump administration’s treatment of climate information hasn’t yet reached the “eradication” levels that Project 2025 aspired to, at least on government websites. The EPA’s climate change website, for instance, is still up and running, even though all references to the phenomenon were erased on the agency’s home page. Most of the website deletions so far have served to isolate climate change as an issue, erasing its relationship to topics such as health and infrastructure, Gehrke said.

Until the National Climate Assessments disappeared, she would have said that “climate erasure” was an inappropriate characterization of what’s happening. “But now, I’m really not so sure,” she said.

Rachel Cleetus, the senior policy director with the Union of Concerned Scientists, thinks that the administration’s actions actually go beyond erasure.

“They’re literally trying to change the basis on which a lot of policymaking is advanced — the science basis, the legal basis and the economic basis,” she said. Her biggest concern isn’t just what facts have been removed, but what political propaganda might replace them. “That’s more dangerous, because it really leaves people in this twilight zone, where what’s real, and what’s important, and what is going to affect their daily lives is just being obfuscated.”",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/616d079/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+38/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fd6%2Fad%2Ff0ce1a9d4b639e2723f068226c7f%2Fnatl-climate-assessment-colorful-2-gif.JPEG,N,,2025-07-21 08:59:11.577513

State of play: The cap-and-trade program, which requires polluters like oil refiners to buy credits when they exceed a carbon cap set by the state, has grown into the state’s largest of funding for climate programs, generating revenue that state officials reinvest in things like high-speed rail, electric vehicles and clean energy. But uncertainty about what the program will look like in the future has caused credit prices to drop from $42 at an auction in February 2024 to around $26 in the May 21 auction.

And a report released last week by Clean and Prosperous California, a nonprofit that advocates for carbon markets, found lawmakers’ delay in reauthorizing the program has cost California up to $3 billion in potential revenue over the past year.

Federal threats: President Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans have taken steps that seriously undermine California’s climate agenda, like revoking the state’s zero-emissions sales mandate for cars and trucks, ending the $7,500 federal tax incentives for EV buyers and restricting funding for solar and wind projects. That’s putting more pressure on the state to fund these programs, and could complicate negotiations over how cap-and-trade revenues are spent.

The global technology, software and engineering company continues to evolve into a high-impact automation technology leader, embedding sustainability across its operations, culture and product portfolio.

With climate ambition backed by engineering expertise and cross-sector partnerships, Emerson is aiming to be well positioned to help accelerate the global transition to net zero.

Climate action

Emerson’s net zero operations goal targets a 90% absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030, with full value chain net zero targeted for 2045.

The company reported a 48% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2024 compared to its 2021 baseline, driven by a 30% cut in energy intensity and a shift to 57% renewable electricity across its global operations.

Scope 3 emissions, which account for 97% of the company’s footprint, fell by 13% across the same period, with product energy use (Category 11) representing the largest contributor.

Emerson’s roadmap to 2030 includes energy efficiency initiatives, renewable electricity procurement, fleet electrification and Scope 1 abatement through low-carbon fuels.

Its internal carbon price, set at US$90 per ton of CO₂ equivalent in 2024, helps drive investment decisions that align with sustainability objectives.

The company also supports global energy grid decarbonisation through membership in RE100 and Clean Energy Buyers Association and by deploying its own automation technologies to enable energy transition projects.

“We are taking action to enhance our environmental sustainability performance while supporting our customers in achieving their own sustainability goals,” comments Lal Karsanbhai, CEO and President of Emerson.

“In 2024, 57% of the electricity used across our global operations came from renewable sources, bringing us closer to our goal of achieving net zero operations by 2030.

“At the same time, we are advancing more sustainable product design by embedding environmental considerations into our innovation and engineering processes and delivering technologies and solutions that help our customers meet their sustainability objectives.”

Technology driven sustainability

Through its “Greening By Emerson” strategy, the company is actively enabling customers to reduce emissions, improve efficiency and meet regulatory requirements.

Its technologies are deployed in critical infrastructure across energy, manufacturing, life sciences and transportation.

Emerson’s automation systems played a central role in New Zealand’s first fleet of grid-scale solar farms and in PosHYdon, the world’s first offshore green hydrogen platform in the Dutch North Sea.

In Canada, Emerson and Spartan Controls partnered with ConocoPhillips to deploy emissions-reduction technologies that cut over 12 million tons of CO₂ since 2016.

Its software and control systems also support carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities in South Korea and the United States, offering real-time monitoring, data analytics and optimisation tools for purification, compression and storage phases.

Across these sectors, Emerson is helping scale low-carbon fuels, accelerate hydrogen deployment and reduce methane leakage through intelligent sensors and actuators.

Circular economy and resource efficiency

In 2024, Emerson expanded its circularity agenda with a goal of achieving zero waste to landfill by 2032.

The company diverted 58% of operational waste away from landfill, up from 57% the year before.

Its waste profile includes 94% non-hazardous waste, with recycling, reuse and composting prioritised across sites.

Initiatives like Waste Treasure Hunts were introduced to help manufacturing teams identify reduction opportunities on-site.

In China, its Measurement & Analytical team replaced single-use packaging with a durable, recyclable solution, while in the US, sustainable packaging pilots reduced foam use, eliminated plastic and switched to paper tape.

Emerson also partnered with the University of North Texas to develop green metal powders for additive manufacturing, halving the carbon footprint compared to conventional methods.

Water stewardship and biodiversity

Alongside emissions and waste, water reduction is another key pillar of Emerson’s environmental goals.

The company aims to reduce purchased water by 10% by 2032 and in 2024 it reported consumption of 1,321 megalitres, down from 1,346 the year before.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/11ec9798c2af14741401a13446b91bf4:6635d22edde4b9828012d844e0d72ab4/mike-train.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-21 11:04:26.822366

Question marks hover over projects including Allentown’s electric vehicle pilot and Mack Trucks’ investment in electric garbage trucks as governments and businesses alike await further guidance as to whether ongoing, grant-funded work still aligns with the administration’s funding guidelines.

The combination of expiring tax credits and uncertainty surrounding federal grant disbursement means investments that once looked like a sure thing are at best on a shorter timeline and at worst no longer financially feasible.

Expiring tax credits also leave consumers with a short runway to take advantage of savings on solar arrays, home energy efficiency improvements and electric vehicles.

As the Trump administration’s budget bill takes aim at the incentives the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act created for investment in clean technologies, here’s a look at where Lehigh Valley’s green industry stands:

Green vehicles and clean fuels

Allentown calculated it could save $225,000 leveraging federal and state grants, plus federal tax credits, to lower the cost of its electric vehicle pilot program.

The city plans to buy seven electric vehicles and install charging infrastructure.

The project relies on significant federal and state investment, with $120,000 in U.S. Department of Energy grants and $60,000 in state grants going toward vehicle purchases. Federal tax credits would further decrease the electric vehicles’ cost.

To see how the math breaks down, consider the cost of one pilot vehicle: Listed at $46,000, the vehicle is eligible for $17,000 in federal grants, $7,500 in state grants and another $7,500 in federal tax credits. That leaves the city paying only $14,000.

The pilot project will bring the city’s electric vehicle total to eight, with an anticipated annual fuel savings of nearly $11,000.

But determining whether or not to buy additional electric vehicles won’t mean simply running the numbers on whether electric charging does indeed prove that much cheaper than gas.

Federal tax credits for electric vehicles expire at the end of September. The DOE has so far given no indication that it will rescind its grant, but it’s likely future grants will be scarce.

Then there’s the cost of charging. Allentown is waiting on state grant applications to move forward on installing its $120,000 charging infrastructure. If it can get those chargers in service by June 2026, the city can still claim a 30% federal tax credit on the project.

On Tuesday, state Rep. Josh Siegel’s office announced the project had earned $60,423 from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.

Whether or not future funding will emerge for additional charging infrastructure is an open question.

Deadlines to complete the electric vehicle pilot before tax credits close seem achievable, but a lack of guidance from federal grant administrators complicates future contingency planning, Allentown Sustainability Coordinator Veronika Vostinak said.

Researching the funding landscape has always been a part of local government sustainability planning, but that process is becoming more uncertain, Vostinak said.

“We’re spending a lot of time trying to figure out what is happening,” she said.

Much larger investments are also awaiting word from federal officials.

Volvo received $208 million from the Energy Department in July 2024 to convert manufacturing facilities to support work on electric vehicles, including electric garbage trucks made at the Mack Trucks site in Lower Macungie Township.

“The conversion grant is a five-year project for which we have not yet received any disbursements,” Mack Trucks spokesperson Meg McDonald said in an email. “We’ve been informed that the DOE will be in touch to discuss modifications, but to our current knowledge the project will continue.”

Lehigh University’s solar array that powers the school’s Murray H. Goodman campus is one example of a completed project that leveraged federal tax credits.

Standard Solar owns and operates the 3-megawatt installation, which went fully operational in November.

Federal tax credits, including the investment tax credit that covered 30% of the project cost, enabled the company to offer the university an electricity rate that is less than half the market rate, said Eric Partyka, director of business development for Standard Solar.

Without those tax credits, the company would have offered a rate 20%-30% higher, Partyka said.

As tax credits expire, solar companies will have to raise the rates they charge for electricity provided in purchase agreements and lower construction costs, which could mean asking subcontractors in the electrical trades to lower their rates, Partyka said.

“I think it will make a lot of things like this — like Lehigh — may not be viable,” Partyka said.

States will have an increasing role to play in keeping the solar industry competitive, Partyka said, adding that Pennsylvania could provide a large boost to its solar market by passing community solar legislation that would enable customers to receive credits for energy generated at shared, off-site arrays.

“I feel like we’re close,” Partyka said of the state’s long-running efforts to enact community solar. “It’s not like it’s a pipe dream.”

Consumer savings expiring

Consumers will need new options to save on energy bills as costs rise and the tax credits that subsidized household investments in green energy are set to end.

Energy industry analysts forecast the budget bill will lead to a decrease in renewable energy generation, rising greenhouse gas emissions and an increase in consumer energy costs.

Average energy costs for a U.S. household will rise $165 a year by 2030 and more than $280 a year by 2035, according to analysis from Princeton University’s ZERO Lab and Evolved Energy Research consultants.

See the full report below:

Tax credits that reimbursed consumers for solar arrays, home energy efficiency improvements and electric vehicles are set to end this year after the budget bill cut short Biden-era programs designed to last a decade from the 2022 passage of the IRA.

Homeowners seeking to move to solar power must install arrays by the end of 2025 to claim the consumer tax credit that covers 30% of project costs. IRS data shows 30,670 Pennsylvanians claimed that credit in tax year 2023, for a total of nearly $149.9 million in savings.

Pennsylvanians also took advantage of a tax credit for home energy efficiency improvements, with 134,720 taxpayers filing for more than $118 million in savings for tax year 2023. That credit, designed to pay for efficiencies such as better insulation, upgraded heating and cooling equipment, and home energy audits, will also expire at the end of the year.

Tax credits for electric vehicles end at the end of September. A total of 10,680 Pennsylvanians claimed a Clean Vehicle Tax Credit in tax year 2023, with an average savings of $6,738. Another 820 Pennsylvanians claimed the credit for previously owned clean vehicles, with an average savings of $3,452.

Lehigh County saw 4,238 electric vehicles registered in the first quarter of 2025, according to PennDOT. That only amounts to 1.23% of total registrations, but the number of electric vehicles registered shows a steady climb from the first data point: 2,512 in the third quarter of 2023.

Surely Florida’s governor could figure out how to outlaw this heat.

He solved that pesky climate change business by simply erasing any mention of it in state statutes.

Or maybe we could use Celsius: 37 degrees sounds a lot better than 100.

The best you can hope for is to reach some kind of accommodation with it, appease it the way the ancients would sacrifice a goat or a chicken to butter up a surly god given to smiting people for fun, or figure out ways to avoid the worst of it.

To Do List

I’m a native Floridian; I have suggestions:

Find a swimming pool. Lie in the water. Do not get out unless you are joined by an alligator — which happens quite often — and then extricate yourself slowly. No sudden movements. (Gators do not follow homeowners’ association rules.)

If reptiles run you out of the pool, try a bathtub. Yes, your skin will become quite wrinkly, but it’s better than heat rash.

Go shopping. You’re risking heatstroke getting from the parking lot to the door, but once you get inside your favorite big box store, the air-conditioning will be delightfully frosty.

You can spend hours and hours in Walmart, looking at “school clothes” even if you don’t go to school. Florida’s Back to School sales tax holiday runs throughout August. Unfortunately, the guns and ammo sales tax holiday doesn’t begin until Sept. 8. But it’ll still be hot enough to scald a scorpion and still be hurricane season.

You can get yourself a bargain firearm suitable for firing into the storm!

Bribe a grocery store or restaurant to let you sit in their walk-in freezer. Make sure you’ve got a cell signal in there: We don’t want any tragedies.

Speaking of ice, here’s something you can do using your home freezer. Stick a pair of jeans and a t-shirt in there, wait three hours, then put them on.

They’ll be stiff for 20 minutes or so, but you’ll enjoy the personal air-conditioning.

Leave. Go to Greenland.

Forget Canada (they’re certainly trying to forget us). Greenland will be the 51st state. The only reason it hasn’t happened already is that Donald Trump has been too busy blowing up the National Weather Service, NASA, and NOAA.

But you don’t want to wait till half of Florida flees our polluted aquifers, flooded suburbs, hurricane-ravaged condos and malarial sinks.

Get ahead of the crowd and scope out Nuuk’s best spots for Musk Ox steak and Eric the Red beer.

You’ll never run out of ice in Greenland.

Not for five or six years, at least.

Rising tide

This dang Chinese hoax is warming up everything from the Antarctic to the Indian Ocean to the Pacific to the north Atlantic.

Greenland’s ice sheet is melting, faster and faster every year. So are the glaciers and the icebergs.

How do I know this? Because some of NASA’s global climate change research websites are still up (see link above), but who knows for how long.

Now where do you think that all that water from the ice sheets will go?

If you answered “everywhere,” you’re correct.

If you said, “Especially Florida,” you get bonus points.

One of the annoying little quirks of vast quantities of melting ice is rising sea levels.

We live in the southernmost state, the most watery state, the one that floods if you stare at it hard.

A lot of us live just a few feet above sea level.

Since 1970, the sea level has risen seven inches, which might not sound too bad, except even a Category 1 hurricane — Debby in 2024, say — can produce a storm surge of 2-5 feet.

With a whopper like Helene, it’s more like 15 feet.

You see the problem.

Seas aren’t only rising, they’re getting hotter. Hotter seas breed bigger storms.

Over the past few weeks, the temperature of the Gulf of Mexico (no, I’m not calling it by that fake Trump name) has ranged from 80 to 92 degrees.

The warmer the water, the faster it evaporates, the faster it evaporates, the heavier the rainfall.

Add to that temperatures in the high 90s and you get a heat-plus-humidity situation which almost certainly violates the Geneva Conventions on torture.

Compared to the poor souls along the Guadalupe River in Texas, we’ve been lucky.

Our luck is unlikely to hold. Every part of Florida is susceptible to flash floods.

Deflection, denial

This is, of course, a global problem.

China is now the worst greenhouse gas offender, but the U.S. is right behind and, given how the regime hates being Number Two, I’m sure we will soon regain the title of Biggest Threat to Human Life on Earth.

New research by the nonprofit Climate and Community Institute shows the 17% increase in the Pentagon’s budget translates into an enormous increase in carbon emissions: 178 tons in 2026.

That’s half of what the entire United Kingdom emits.

We’re not stopping there, either. Trump is enabling extractive industries to pillage the land from sea to shining sea, making swingeing cuts to wind and solar energy programs, and ordering an ancient, costly, and dirty Michigan coal plant to stay open.

What, you ask, is Florida doing about this?

(Can you hear me laughing bitterly?)

To be fair, the governor did sign a ban on drilling along the Apalachicola River.

But when it comes to the climate crisis, he deflects and denies.

In addition to trying to deep-six the whole issue by refusing to name it and calling attempts to address the causes of the precipitous rise in temperatures “left-wing stuff,” he wants you to believe monster storms have always happened in Florida and always will.

It’s just “tropical weather.”

And despite what Marjorie Taylor Greene, Georgia U.S. representative and weekend scientist, says, weather is not controlled by the government.

But just to be sure, she says she’ll sponsor legislation prohibiting “the injection, release or dispersion of chemicals or substances into the atmosphere for the express purpose of altering weather, temperature, climate or sunlight intensity.”

Ahead of the curve

Florida, always ahead of the crazy curve, has already passed such a bill, and the governor has signed it.

He cites dark fears of “chemtrails” deployed by shadowy green activists trying to fight climate change by “injecting different things in the atmosphere, blocking the sun and doing all this stuff.”

He added, “We’re the Sunshine State. We want to have the nice sunshine.”

First of all, “chemtrails” are not a thing. Those white lines swooshing behind aircraft are condensation trails, i.e. little bitty ice crystals formed when the exhaust from the plane hits the cold high-altitude air.

Second, while there’s some preliminary research on using geoengineering to reflect sunshine back into space, we don’t know how this might affect rainfall or food production and many scientists don’t think it’s feasible or desirable.

Moreover, why spend billions fooling with the sun when we could develop sustainable power, stop burning fossil fuels, encourage clean energy, and hold polluters accountable for destroying the environment.

Despite most Floridians figuring they can ride this thing out in their air-conditioned caves, the reckoning will soon come.

The hotter it gets, the more air-conditioning we’ll use; the more we crank up the AC, the hotter it gets.

No matter what nonsense the MAGA brain trust comes up with, data are still data.

Storms are stronger. The seas are invading. The heat is becoming increasingly deadly: Florida leads the nation in heat-related illnesses.

Science doesn’t care what Marjorie Taylor Greene, Donald Trump, or Ron DeSantis believe.

As I said, you can’t beat the heat. But the heat can — and will — beat you.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-44/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/img_1687-1024x6831753095776.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=KhIIlXBU,N,,2025-07-21 08:02:36.549299

State research officials in North Dakota are examining two new options — pairing geothermal with active oil and gas sites and using captured carbon dioxide as a feedstock for geothermal power production.

The North Dakota Industrial Commission in June greenlit a $250,000 feasibility study to look into whether those two new geothermal technologies could be used in the state.

Bipartisan support for geothermal power — along with federal tax incentives for geothermal and carbon capture and storage, or CCS, projects — created an environment where companies and researchers can start to explore different methods of production, said Matt Villante, an earth scientist with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

“Learning from these first-of-a-kind demonstration projects is really critical to moving the sector forward,” Villante said at a recent webinar hosted by the U.S. Energy Association. “There is extensive support for both geothermal and CCS around the globe, but also in the United States.”

In an executive order, President Donald Trump has called for removing “all illegitimate impediments” to developing geothermal projects. And Energy Secretary Chris Wright has prioritized geothermal as a target for the Department of Energy’s research and development efforts.

Another big factor: The 45Q federal tax credit for capturing, storing or using carbon dioxide was preserved after concerns it would be gutted as part of Republicans’ megabill that Trump signed into law this month.

Exploring new methods of harvesting energy from geothermal sources has proved popular across the political spectrum, said Drew Nelson, vice president of programs, policy and strategy with Project InnerSpace, a nonprofit that advocates for the use of geothermal. Green energy advocates have lauded geothermal as a way to harness low-carbon resources, he said, and people who support fossil fuel development point to the industry’s technical overlap with oil and gas drilling.

North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong (R) said at an Industrial Commission meeting in June that working to grow the industry in his state was an obvious choice.

“There was a lot of discussion about this at the Western Governors’ Association, and it was one of the rare places in energy where you have room bipartisan support,” Armstrong said. “It makes it real simple.”

While support for geothermal is widespread, projects exploring new ways to produce it are not. In 2023, only about 0.4 percent of the nation’s power came from geothermal sources, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Nelson said investors are still waiting for the existing technology to become safer bets, which has left little room for exploring new technologies.

‘A few variables’

Geothermal energy is typically harnessed by drilling and pumping up brine from deep within the earth. That brine is usually at least 300 degrees Fahrenheit when it reaches the surface, and the heat is used to generate steam to turn massive turbines to generate power.

But instead of using brine to transfer the earth’s heat to the surface, some researchers are looking instead at using captured carbon dioxide.

“When you look at a few variables in combination, carbon dioxide tends to come out on top relative to water,” said Jeff Bielicki, a research lead for sustainable energy at Ohio State University’s Sustainability Institute.

There are a few ways it could be used, Bielicki said. One use could be injecting vast quantities of CO2 underground to push out the hot brine. Another approach could be pushing CO2 underground to the heat source, and pumping back up the heated CO2 to power the turbines, then injected the cooled carbon dioxide back underground in a closed-loop system.

A third method would essentially use hydraulic fracturing techniques to break apart “hot dry rock” with carbon dioxide, Bielicki said.

“The ability for the carbon dioxide to flow through the permeable rock in ways that are related to its density and viscosity is higher than that of water,” Bielicki said. “That’ll allow it to pick up more heat.”

Carbon dioxide can lose more heat than the brine when it reaches the surface, Bielicki said, but it remains a potential vehicle for geothermal heat.

Oil could also prove to work as a conduit for bringing geothermal heat to power plants, Bielicki said.

“Anytime you’re producing a fluid, whether it’s brine or oil or natural gas, and bringing it to the surface, it’s likely to be warm, and potentially even hot enough to pull off the heat and use it,” he said.

Geothermal companies and oil companies for years have discussed repurposing old and nonproducing oil and gas wells into wells used to harness geothermal energy, Nelson said. But pulling heat out of active oil operations is a newer concept, Bielicki said.

Geologically, most oil and gas basins differ from the ideal underground environments for harnessing geothermal power, Bielicki said. Some deeper wells reach crude deposits that are nearly 250 degrees Fahrenheit underground, according to the EIA.

That’s not quite hot enough to power most geothermal power plants, Bielicki said, but companies are looking at ways to harness geothermal energy at lower temperatures.

He said some active oil sites are already using geothermal power at their wellheads.

“There have been investigations that have looked at, well, can we pull the heat off of this oil and use it?” Bielicki said. “And sometimes they do use it mostly my understanding is mostly locally on the field on the site of the oil production.”

Seeking value

North Dakota officials are hoping to dig further into using carbon dioxide and oil production to generate more geothermal power.

Already the state has studied using decommissioned oil wells to produce geothermal power, said Tyler Hamman, assistant vice president of strategic partnerships for the University of North Dakota’s Energy & Environmental Research Center. Now, the Center has been awarded $250,000 to study whether geothermal wells can produce both power and more oil from older wells.

He said more oil is likely to also come to the surface in the process of drilling for geothermal brine.

“You separate the two on the surface,” Hamman said of the brine and oil. “But it’s basically oil and gas that wouldn’t be economical to recover without having some sort of value-added opportunity, like producing geothermal energy along with it.”

He said his research center will also study whether the value-added proposition of geothermal could work for carbon dioxide use and storage.

“Anytime you’re doing anything with the subsurface, there’s always opportunity to look at the possibility of CO2 storage,” Hamman said.

But getting pilot projects for new geothermal technologies takes time and money, especially when it’s a first-of-its-kind project, Nelson said. He said the industry is just now at a place where investing in geothermal projects of any kind seems less risky for investors.

“How do we turn this from a couple of wells into an industry where the financial community knows how to price and risk and fund it?” Nelson said. “That’s where the industry is right now.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/5b/c8/6e5cc41b41359b67e11128068486/fervo-project.jpg,N,,2025-07-21 10:02:19.905445

As Brazil prepares to host the UN’s COP30 climate summit in the Amazon this November, the country's actions now send a conflicting message about its environmental commitments.","Brazil’s congress has passed sweeping legislation that could dismantle decades of environmental safeguards, fast-track deforestation, and weaken Indigenous land rights.

Tiago Rogero reports for The Guardian.

In short:

Brazil’s lower house approved a bill that allows most polluting projects — such as mining and large-scale agriculture — to bypass traditional environmental reviews by self-declaring their impact online.

The law sharply limits the role of Indigenous and quilombola rights agencies by excluding lands not officially titled, though many have been awaiting legal recognition for years.

Environmental groups and legal experts argue the law is unconstitutional and plan to challenge it in Brazil’s supreme court, especially if President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s expected veto is overridden by the conservative congress.

Key quote:

“We’re seeing the implosion of Brazil’s environmental licensing system, that is going to become full self-licensing, where a company just clicks a button and the permit gets printed.”

— Suely Araújo, public policy coordinator, Climate Observatory, and former president of Brazil's environmental protection agency

Why this matters:

Environmental licensing laws are Brazil’s frontline defense against deforestation, industrial pollution, and displacement of Indigenous communities. Rolling back these safeguards opens vast areas of the Amazon and other ecologically sensitive regions to mining, agribusiness, and infrastructure projects with little oversight. The Amazon plays a vital role in regulating global climate and rainfall patterns; its degradation could accelerate warming and destabilize ecosystems worldwide.

This is now the 'summer of the EV'

Following the passage of President Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" the federal EV tax credit has officially been axed. You have until September 30 to make a purchase and qualify for the $7,500 credit on a new EV (or $4,000 on a used one).

""If you're interested in driving an EV — either new, used or leased — now is the time to act,"" Ingrid Malmgren, senior policy director at Plug In America, told CNBC. ""This is going to be the summer of the EV, because come the end of September those credits will be gone.""

The EV silver lining tucked away in the new bill

Yes, we're losing the federal EV tax credit, but it's not all gloom, as Wired reports. Buried in the bill's language, there's a small but hugely important detail: The legislation doesn't eliminate Biden-era tax credits for EV manufacturers, as many had feared it would.

So car companies, battery makers, and minerals miners will still be incentivized to innovate and optimize, which could lead to much lower prices for consumers.

Which models are affected by the vanishing tax credits?

Edmunds has listed the 29 currently qualified EV models that are going to lose out after September 30. Ten of them are Teslas, two are Kia models, two are Hyundais, three are Fords — and the list goes on.

EV mythbusting: Batteries last longer than many people think

New research is highlighting — and demolishing — some of the myths that still plague the EV industry.

For one thing, batteries do not need replacing after a few years, unless your usage is unimaginably extreme: In the US, most come with an eight-year, 100,000-mile warranty.

Did you really need another reason to visit Costco?

Apparently, yes — and it's not for the cheap gas.

The big box retailer just announced a pilot program in Florida to provide EV chargers to shoppers, the latest proof of the growing trend away from ""destination charging"" and toward ""charging destinations"" (where EV drivers looking to charge are being lured to retailers where they hadn't planned to shop).

If you thought a $100,000 EV was expensive …

Then make way for the latest American EV startup, Dacora Motors, which aims to earn the American ultra-luxury title with its eponymous $500,000 electric sedan (that, by the way, is the starting price).

July marks the 10th anniversary of Wabtec Corporation’s Evolution Series Tier 4—one of the most modern diesel locomotives serving North America and the first freight locomotive to meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Tier 4 emission standards.

The nearly 1,200 units delivered so far have traveled more than 500 million miles of track—almost the distance between the Earth and Jupiter (569 million miles). Wabtec’s Tier 4s in operation today are approaching a combined 10,000 years of running time, according to the manufacturer.

GE Transportation (acquired by Wabtec in February 2019) began producing Evolution Series engines in 2003 to meet the EPA’s Tier 2 locomotive emission standards (see chart below and scroll down to watch video). By 2015, it had taken the technology even further, when the government agency required manufacturers of locomotive diesel engines to lower PM (particulate matter) 70% and NOx 76%, compared to Tier 3 standards.

GE Transportation leveraged other GE business units to develop elements of the new engine, including power assembly, Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR), common rail fuel system, and turbocharger. In April 2015, it completed the first production test of its Evolution Series Tier 4 engine, and in July 2015 delivered the first production locomotive model to BNSF. Today, that Class I railroad has more than 350 locomotives that are Tier 4-compliant and roughly 65% of its fleet is Tier 3 or better.

Reduced Emissions and Operational Costs

The 432,000-pound, six-axle Evolution Series Tier 4 locomotive delivers 4,500 hp and can reach a maximum speed of 75 mph pulling thousands of tons of freight, according to Wabtec.

It offers:

Variable speed auxiliaries. “Six panels and auxiliary inverters/motors eliminate the need for an auxiliary alternator, contractors and cycle skippers, and allow for increased fuel efficiency and reliability.”

A two-stage charged air system featuring heat exchangers that “allows for 50% more heat rejection and a 25% capacity increase.”

An increased platform length (+16 inches) and weight (+8,000 pounds).

Base engine improvements, including “larger bearing size, longer induction hardened crankshaft, top feed fuel injectors, and simplified double-walled high-pressure fuel lines.”

Engine Control Unit (ECU) and power supply with “50% more sensors and a separate power supply” to offer improved reliability, durability, performance and diagnostics.

Two-stage turbocharging, which is said to allow for a higher compression ratio, fuel efficiency, and reduced thermal stress.

EGR, which “meets Tier 4 Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) standards.”

An engine mainframe with a “larger casting (+8 inches) and increased weight (+7,000 pounds) allow[ing] for larger bearings and crank with increased cylinder pressure capability for better reliability and performance.”

Wabtec in 2019 celebrated the delivery of its 1,000th Evolution Series Tier 4 unit to CN.

“This achievement underscores [GE’s] bold decision in 2013 to develop a Tier 4 locomotive,” Wabtec CEO Rafael Santana said at that time; Santana served as President and CEO of GE Transportation before taking over Wabtec leadership. “Delivering 1,000 locomotives in less than five years proves it was the right locomotive at the right time to meet market needs.”

The Evolution Series Tier 4 unit saved railroad customers more than $1.5 billion in urea infrastructure and operational costs, Wabtec said in 2019. When combined with Wabtec’s digital solutions, like Trip Optimizer, the added functionality enabled the locomotive to realize 3%-17% savings on fuel costs and further emission reductions, it noted.

‘Innovation With Purpose’

“In 2008, the EPA defined the rules for Tier 4 emission standards, which made it extremely challenging from a technology evolution standpoint,” Rogerio Mendonca, President, Freight Equipment at Wabtec, told Railway Age earlier this month. “Many [manufacturers] went with what they called the aftertreatment strategy with urea. But that meant extra equipment, complex refilling, etc. So, Wabtec [GE] made a decision, and probably not a very easy one because it would require an extensive redesign of the engine. We adopted Exhaust Gas Recirculation technology that avoids all the extra equipment, extra fluids, etc.”

The company’s objective, he said, was not only to meet EPA’s standards, but also to “innovate with purpose,” focusing on efficiency, reliability and economics for customers.

Today’s Wabtec Tier 4 engines can run on biodiesel and renewable diesel fuels—the manufacturer has achieved B20/R100 across all its major engine platforms—as well as liquified natural gas. Wabtec is also preparing its Tier 4 engine to burn hydrogen.

“The Tier 4 is a great platform for today, and it’s a great platform for whatever comes in the future, in terms of internal combustion fuels,” Mendonca summed up. “This is the platform that will evolve.”

What will they build?,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/energy-and-tech-companies-said-theyre-investing-90b-pa-what-will-they-build,"Trump signed a budget reconciliation bill this month that cancels tax credits for wind and solar energy projects, which observers say will slow their entry into the market.
Shapiro told reporters that he also questions the Trump administration’s opposition to clean energy projects.
Two projects involve nuclear energy.
Constellation Energy said it will spend $2.4 billion to increase the output of its existing nuclear power plant near Limerick, Montgomery County.
Another element of Shapiro’s Lightning Plan is a state board dedicated to streamlining the permitting process for new energy projects.","A score of energy, tech and capital investment companies announced their commitments nearly a week ago to more than $93 billion worth of projects to prepare Pennsylvania for a role in the artificial intelligence revolution that proponents say will transform the world’s economy.

The projects range from plans to build a fleet of new nuclear reactors across the country to workforce development programs to train the next generation of tradespeople and technicians to build and operate new power plants and data centers.

Announced to coincide with GOP U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick’s Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit in Pittsburgh last Tuesday, the investments were cast as crucial to winning a race against China to dominate in AI.

And with President Donald Trump headlining the event at Carnegie Mellon University,, the panelists largely reflected Trump’s “Drill, baby, drill,” fossil fuel-forward energy policy.

With the exception of nuclear power, Trump falsely disparaged renewable energy during his remarks in a roundtable discussion on AI and feeding its demand for electricity. Trump signed a budget reconciliation bill this month that cancels tax credits for wind and solar energy projects, which observers say will slow their entry into the market.

“You can own your own electric plants, and they’ll be powered by maybe nuclear, maybe gas, maybe coal. You know, we brought coal back in,” Trump said. “They won’t be powered by wind, because it doesn’t work. I hate to say it just doesn’t work. It’s rather intermittent.”

In fact, wind energy is becoming a key source of electricity, according to the World Economic Forum, which cited a record 117 gigawatts of new capacity installed globally in 2023. A gigawatt is enough electricity to power about 750,000 homes.

Environmental advocates protested the summit, with hundreds of people flooding the streets around CMU. They condemned plans to power AI using fossil fuels, warning that it would increase carbon emissions that cause climate change and, despite claims to the contrary, make electricity more expensive for consumers.

Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro also drew criticism for his participation in the summit.

“This is exactly the wrong direction on energy at this critical time. Pennsylvania has a chance to pivot right now and lead on the renewable energy transition that we need to fight the climate crisis. This meeting is just about planning more fracking projects and asking Pennsylvanians to sacrifice our health and the environment yet again.” Sandy Field, chair of the Climate Reality Project: Susquehanna Valley PA chapter, said in a statement.

Shapiro told reporters that he also questions the Trump administration’s opposition to clean energy projects. “I think that reconciliation bills is bad from Pennsylvania,” he said. “It’s somewhat ironic that we’re here talking about energy jobs and the bill that the president presumably will be touting would gut 26,000 energy jobs. I think it’s a bad deal.”

Eric Epstein, chair of TMI-Alert questioned whether many of the projects will happen. His group is opposed to restarting the former Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Dauphin County to power an artificial intelligence data center.

“Most of the proposed projects are in the planning or fantasy stages, and depend on private equity, investment from outside of the state and federal government subsidies,” he told the Capital-Star, adding that political and financial factors could affect their viability.

So, what’s in the $93.5 billion investment that McCormick touted at his summit? The Capital-Star broke down the list.

Six natural gas projects totaling $24.2 billion that range from new electricity generating capacity, such as Frontier Group’s plan to convert the former Bruce Mansfield coal-fired power plant in Beaver County to a 3.6 gigawatt natural gas-fired plant, to gas driller Equinor’s plan to increase natural gas production. Two of the projects on the list include the price of natural gas that will be purchased to fuel existing or upgraded power plants, including an agreement in principle to buy $15 billion worth of gas.

Two projects involve nuclear energy. Constellation Energy said it will spend $2.4 billion to increase the output of its existing nuclear power plant near Limerick, Montgomery County. That’s in addition to Constellation’s announcement earlier this year of a $1.6 billion deal with Microsoft to restart the former Three Mile Island power plant, renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center. It’s also applying to renew its license for the Peach Bottom Clean Energy Center in York County to continue operating those reactors until 2054. Westinghouse Electric Co. said it will build 10 new nuclear plants in the United States, which will generate an estimated $6 billion in economic activity and create 15,000 new jobs in southwest Pennsylvania.

Hydroelectric power is the sole source of renewable energy among the projects announced.. Brookfield Asset Management said it has a $3 billion 20-year deal with Google to purchase electricity from the Safe Harbor and Holtwood hydroelectric dams on the Susquehanna River. Brookfield said it will relicense and overhaul dams, which were built in the early 20th century, to produce 3 gigawatts of electricity.

Two of the commonwealth’s major electric distribution companies, PPL Corp. and First Energy, said they will expand their grid capacities to support the demand from data centers. First Energy said it will spend $15 billion on infrastructure improvements in 57 counties. PPL said it will spend $6.8 billion on grid improvements and a joint venture with investment manager Blackrock Inc. to build a gas fired power plant near Marcellus shale gas supplies.

Three tech firms said they will invest in workforce development projects. AI product developer Anthropic will inject $2 million towards programs at Carnegie Mellon University to support advancing AI-powered energy solutions and building the cybersecurity workforce needed to protect America’s energy infrastructure. Social media company Meta will make a $2.5 million gift to support early-stage Carnegie Mellon University-affiliated startups, including those in the energy, infrastructure, health care and defense industries. Google said it has launched a new “AI Works for PA” initiative offering free training for one million Pennsylvania small businesses and Pittsburgh residents. The tech giant also provided a grant to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and National Electrical Contractors Association electrical training program.

Data centers, like ones that Amazon Web Services announced in May it will build in Luzerne County and in Bucks County, are warehouse-like buildings containing vast numbers of computers to perform the processing that AI applications such as Chat GPT need. The AWS center planned adjacent to the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station in Salem Township could add about 1.2 gigawatts of demand to the commonwealth’s electricity grid.

PJM Interconnection, the organization that operates the electricity grid for Pennsylvania and 12 other states, has predicted its peak demand will grow by about 70 gigawatts to 220 gigawatts by 2040. The growth is being driven not only by AI, but also the increased electrification of transportation and industry.

Recognizing that Pennsylvania is facing a power crunch in coming years, Shapiro has proposed a plan to ensure the commonwealth remains competitive in the energy market. It would leverage the state’s natural gas resources while making it an attractive location for sustainable energy technologies. Part of the plan, now under consideration as a suite of bills before the General Assembly, is a goal to obtain 35% of the state’s energy from renewable sources by 2035.

Another element of Shapiro’s Lightning Plan is a state board dedicated to streamlining the permitting process for new energy projects.

State Rep. Greg Vitali, who chairs the House Environmental and Natural Resource Protection Committee said those and other renewable energy initiatives, including a bill to allow shared community solar developments, have not passed yet.

“We are certainly not doing what we should be doing as a state as far as expanding renewables,” Vitali said, adding that the loss of tax credits would make it harder. “I’m not expecting much help from the federal government at all.”

After speaking last Tuesday on a panel with McCormick and AWS CEO Matt Garman, Shapiro expressed cautious optimism about the projects announced during the summit.

“Obviously, there’s a difference between what someone says in a press release today and when shovels go in the ground in the future,” he said. “I want to see all of these dollars come to Pennsylvania, and we’re going to be working closely with the companies that want to plant a flag here, to allow them to get their shovels in the ground and scale up and create jobs.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-96/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/homer-city-power-plant-capital-and-main-1024x6831753091643.jpeg?h=199d8c1f&itok=x2s55bd4,N,,2025-07-21 08:59:23.860810

The IRP should assume Dominion achieves the energy efficiency targets that the SCC itself established for the company.","When Dominion Energy Virginia filed its latest integrated resource plan (IRP) last fall, critics (including me) complained that the company failed to lay out a cost-effective approach that would meet soaring energy demand from data centers while complying with Virginia’s decarbonization mandate. We hoped regulators at the State Corporation Commission would reject the IRP and demand better of our largest utility.

Instead, they chickened out.

The SCC’s final order, issued July 15, is short but not really to the point. The order finds Dominion’s IRP “legally sufficient,” while citing previous SCC orders for the proposition that “acceptance” doesn’t mean approval “of the magnitude or specifics of Dominion’s future spending plans.” It would be hard to imagine a less enthusiastic endorsement, and the lack of analysis leaves advocates wondering, where’s the meat?

SCC says Dominion’s future spending plan ‘legally sufficient,’ warns against impact on consumers

It’s true that an IRP is “only” a planning document; it doesn’t commit a utility to carrying out the plan, and the SCC still has to approve any project the utility decides to move forward with. But the point of the exercise is to ensure utilities are on the right track; that their demand projections are on target and their plans for meeting demand are realistic, cost-effective and comply with all relevant laws. This needs discussion and analysis, not merely an up-or-down vote.

Admittedly, the SCC has a long history of approving lousy IRPs while directing Dominion to do a better job the next time. That was the case here, too, with the order directing Dominion to do a few things differently in its next IRP, due in the fall of 2026.

First, the SCC wants to see a 20-year timeline instead of the 15-year period that Dominion used this year, which is all the law requires. It’s an obvious ask, even apart from the fact the SCC cites that the regional grid operator PJM uses a 20-year planning window. A better reason is that we are just 20 years away from Dominion’s 2045 deadline for full decarbonization under the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA), and anything the utility does now will have consequences extending out to that deadline.

The SCC also neglected to mention that using just a 15-year window, and omitting the 25-year planning period that Dominion included in previous IRPs, allowed the company to avoid showing the economic consequences to consumers of spending money for fossil fuel generation that either will shut down or may become economically obsolete by 2045, long before the plants are paid off. If Dominion thinks it can justify sinking customers’ money into assets it knows will become stranded, we all deserve to see the rationale.

The order also directs Dominion to include in its modeling at least one pathway that complies with the requirement of the VCEA that carbon-emitting facilities (including any new gas plants) be retired by 2045. This goes beyond obvious: the lack of a VCEA-compliant plan should have prompted the SCC to reject the IRP outright.

But of course, Dominion claims new gas plants are needed for reliability, which would make them legal under the VCEA in spite of their carbon emissions and questionable long-term viability. Reliability is a red herring, as I’ve argued, and other parties to the IRP case modeled how Dominion can meet demand without building new fossil fuels. Dominion should have been required to prove its case.

But here again, the SCC chose not to engage on the issue. Requiring Dominion to do better next time is as far as it is willing to go. This is unfortunate, but the silence can’t last: in March, Dominion filed for approval of the first of its planned new gas plants. The SCC will have to address need and reliability to make a decision in that case, and it would have been better for all concerned if it had grappled with these questions now.

The order falls short in other ways, as well. While the SCC expresses concern about forecasted rate increases, it doesn’t even mention the data centers that are driving the problem.

This is astonishing; even before Dominion filed its IRP last fall, the commission ordered the company to supplement the record with an analysis of data center impacts. When Dominion did so, it became clear that all of the load growth (and likely, much of the projected rate increases) results from this one industry. It’s beyond strange that the SCC does not even mention the supplement it ordered, or discuss whether Dominion’s duty to serve truly prevents it from protecting existing customers.

The order also accepts Dominion’s argument that it had to artificially limit the amount of low-cost solar it could include in its modeling, due to the increased difficulty of siting solar projects in Virginia. It’s true that many rural counties have been denying permits to solar projects, even as they approve data centers. But I’ve also heard a Dominion lobbyist tell legislators that permit denials have not been a problem for the company, an assertion that may have persuaded some legislators to vote against bills that would make solar siting easier. It appears Dominion tells legislators one thing and the SCC another.

The SCC’s order contains a few other requirements for the next IRP, mostly things that really should have been included in this one. The IRP should model Virginia’s return to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, reflecting a Virginia court’s ruling that Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s withdrawal was unlawful. The IRP should assume Dominion achieves the energy efficiency targets that the SCC itself established for the company. Dominion should include an analysis of impacts on base rates and should share its modeling with utility watchdog Clean Virginia, as well as run modeling based on SCC staff inputs. Long-duration storage, a maturing technology that can replace gas combustion turbines, should be included in the next modeling.

Is it too hot for common sense?

“Do better next time” is a well-worn directive from the SCC to Dominion, but it is deeply disappointing at a time when Virginia is facing an unprecedented surge in demand from data centers and accompanying increases in utility rates.

It’s disappointing in another way, too: this is the first major ruling from the SCC since two new judges were added to the three-member commission, and all three were appointed by a Democratically-controlled Senate. If there was ever a time for the SCC to get tough with Dominion on its climate obligations, this should have been it.

No doubt, the problem lies in Dominion’s influence over the entire process. The utility doles out exceedingly generous campaign donations to members of both parties, so the company retains influence no matter who is in power. Not only does this give Dominion sway over who is appointed to the SCC, but commissioners have to be mindful that getting reappointed at the end of their six-year terms depends on how satisfied these Dominion-backed senators are with their rulings.

As long as Dominion is allowed to shower senators with unlimited campaign cash, the SCC will never be free of the utility’s pernicious influence.

Meanwhile, though, Dominion’s poor performance, and the SCC’s unwillingness to call it out, demonstrate the necessity of the comprehensive IRP reform legislation that the governor vetoed this spring. The Commission on Electric Utility Regulation is already working on similar legislation for the next session.

Passing the IRP reform bill may not inject the SCC with greater courage, but it will ensure the commission, and the public, get a fuller look at the facts.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mercury-60.jpg,N,,2025-07-21 08:01:48.152822

The platform said buying a solar system by the end of the year would save the average homeowner $9,000 via the 30% federal tax credit.
""Without the federal credit, solar becomes significantly less accessible to middle-class homeowners seeking true energy independence,"" it stated.
""The solar industry expects a significant rush of installations in the second half of 2025,"" according to the site.
""The elimination of the residential solar tax credit represents a fundamental shift in federal energy policy, ending two decades of bipartisan support for home solar installations,"" EnergySage concluded.","The One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated the federal solar tax credit, and experts are urging homeowners to act before it's too late.

What's happening?

The Inflation Reduction Act created incentives for people to invest in clean energy through 2034, but those benefits will now end Dec. 31, EnergySage reported.

The platform said buying a solar system by the end of the year would save the average homeowner $9,000 via the 30% federal tax credit. Solar panels will remain affordable in 2026 and beyond because of falling equipment costs and rising energy costs, but it will take 15 to 20 years for installations to pay for themselves instead of eight to 10.

EnergySage noted that this will impact working families the most, as 44% of households that installed solar power in 2023 earned less than $100,000. ""Without the federal credit, solar becomes significantly less accessible to middle-class homeowners seeking true energy independence,"" it stated.

Why is this important?

While the cost of solar energy fell from $3.80 per watt in 2014 to $2.50 per watt in 2024, residents are paying more for power from the grid because of rising demand and utilities' power generation and infrastructure expenditures. EnergySage added that artificial intelligence-powered data centers are also causing an issue.

""Despite a growing number of these massive data centers coming online, Congress just ended the main incentive for this grid-stabilizing technology,"" the company stated. ""Without distributed solar generation to help balance the load, the grid becomes more vulnerable to load-shedding requests, brownouts, and rolling blackouts.""

Solar systems and battery backups reduce reliance on the grid and lock in rates at or near $0, but this change could increase electricity costs for the average household by $143 annually, per EnergySage.

It pointed out that the average 11-kilowatt setup costs about $20,000 instead of $28,160 with the credit. It takes two to four months to get solar installed. ""The solar industry expects a significant rush of installations in the second half of 2025,"" according to the site. ""This could lead to longer wait times and scheduling challenges for homeowners who delay their decision.""

What's being done about the end of the tax credit?

While it's too late to contact your representatives to push back against this bill, you can install solar panels to reap the rewards of the IRA before they vanish. (Companies have longer to act.)

If you're on the fence, EnergySage has a mapping tool that shows costs and incentives by state. This and other free tools will enable you to compare quotes and find vetted local installers. Not only will you save thousands of dollars, but you will also reduce the heat-trapping pollution that is pushing global temperatures higher and contributing to increasingly frequent and severe extreme weather events.

According to a report released Sunday by the federation, titled “The Impact and Implications of the U.S. Trump Administration’s Large-Scale Tax Cut on the Automotive and Battery Industries” (translated), the bill effectively repeals policies favorable to electric vehicles (EVs) under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), along with other green executive orders. Notably, the EV tax credits that spurred Korean automotive and battery firms to expand investment in the U.S. will end in September.

Hyundai Motor Group has been investing about $8 billion in building a dedicated EV plant in Georgia to expand its presence in the North American EV market. Expectations had been high after five of its EV models — the Ioniq 5, Ioniq 9, EV6, EV9 and GV70 — became eligible for tax credits this January, but the enactment of the bill has raised concerns over investment recovery. Korea’s three major battery makers — LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI and SK On — which have pursued more than 72 percent of their U.S. operations through joint ventures with automakers, also face risks of reduced capacity utilization and deteriorating profitability.

The FKI urged swift passage in the National Assembly of a proposed revision to the Korea Development Bank Act, which would establish a 50 trillion won ($36 billion) Advanced Strategic Industry Fund, as well as a bill for state guarantees on fund bonds. It also called for the introduction of direct tax refunds for research and development as well as facility investments in national strategic technologies because the current corporate tax deduction framework offers no benefits for companies incurring operating losses.

The report also recommended offering tax incentives for domestic production of strategic technologies like batteries at levels competitive with other nations, and extending the duration of the supply chain stabilization fund, currently set to end in 2029, to help Korean companies respond to global supply chain crises.

“To ensure that the EV and battery sectors become future growth engines, comprehensive support combining funds and tax benefits must be expedited,"" said Lee Sang-ho, head of FKI’s Economic and Industrial Division.

On the same day, the Korea Enterprises Federation (KEF) also called for tax system improvements to stimulate economic vitality, including the introduction of direct tax refunds. In a proposal submitted to the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the KEF urged the extension of the temporary investment tax credit set to expire this year and its expansion to cover large companies. It also called for designating the culture and content industries as national strategic technologies and for reviewing an extension and expansion of tax credits for video content production.

The KEF further argued for reforming inheritance and gift taxes to enhance corporate sustainability and capital market vitality, proposing a shift to an inheritance acquisition tax system that aligns with global standards by taxing inheritances based on the actual assets received. Additionally, it recommended introducing corporate tax deductions for companies that expand shareholder returns, and providing incentives for individual investors through separate taxation on dividend income and benefits for long-term investments.

Deutsche Bahn’s 150-billion-euro upgrade of the country’s rail network presents the perfect chance to demand the use of more climate-friendly construction materials such as green steel and cement – if the government acts quickly, she said.

Germany has set up a 500-billion-euro fund for investments in infrastructure and climate action over the coming decade. Through new procurement rules, the fund could boost demand for green steel and cement, but the government has so far refused to seize this chance, Nallinger told Clean Energy Wire. Regulation reform could lead to Deutsche Bahn being required to use green steel and cement in its network overhaul, but Germany’s transport ministry has been slow to act.

Public procurement can be a key driver for industry’s move to climate neutrality as it regulates investments amounting to billions of euros. Low emission steel and cement are much more costly than the high-emission conventional varieties, making them uncompetitive without support.

Mining interests are still eyeing property near the refuge, they say, and to preserve additional acreage, they need to build on their advocacy efforts, including persuading environmental groups to buy mineral rights in other areas attractive to mining businesses and highlighting easements for purchase along mineral-rich Trail Ridge.

And they say they need to continue to press Georgia leaders to enact the legal protections for the Okefenokee that have eluded them for years at the state Capitol. Lawmakers will return to Atlanta for a new legislative session in January.

“We can’t rest on our laurels,” said Brian Foster, a spokesman for Georgia Conservancy, one of the environmental groups leading the charge. “There is still a lot of work to be done.”

There’s a reason for their urgency, Georgia environmentalists said.

In the late 1990s, the environmental community thought the Okefenokee was safe from mining after chemical giant DuPont was persuaded to donate thousands of acres to The Conservation Fund because of public opposition to DuPont’s mining plans.

Three decades later, Alabama-based Twin Pines Minerals, which has owned land along Trial Ridge since 2019, appeared close this year to realizing its plans to mine the area for titanium dioxide, a whitening agent in toothpaste, paint, sunscreen and other products.

But The Conservation Fund, a nonprofit based in Arlington, Virginia, stepped in again, announcing late last month that it would spend almost $60 million to purchase close to 8,000 acres owned by Twin Pines.

Environmentalists were elated, but quickly turned their attention to protecting land that could still be purchased for mining.

“If there is one thing that is abundantly clear to us is that the past is prologue when it comes to the Okefenokee,” said Christian Hunt, chairman of the Okefenokee Protection Alliance.

“Roughly 25 years ago we were pretty much in the same position we’re in today,” said Hunt, who also is director of national wildlife refuges and parks program for Defenders of Wildlife. “It’s very clear to everybody involved at this stage that goodwill alone is not going to save the swamp and we need to secure durable protections.”

Environment Georgia launched a campaign to collect 10,000 signatures calling on Gov. Brian Kemp to pursue permanent protections for the Okefenokee just days after The Conservation Fund’s announcement. The organization hopes to meet its goal by the end of the summer.

“We know that there are mineral rights that are still in the hands of people who could and would like to use them, so we would like to make sure that we find a permanent protection that ensures that there is not another mine proposed,” Environment Georgia Director Jennette Gayer said.

“Our hope is that we do not find ourselves in the same position a couple of decades from now,” she said.

Kim Bednarek, executive director of Okefenokee Swamp Park and Adventures, said environmentalists are not the only ones concerned about the refuge. It has a direct impact on the economies of Charlton, Ware and Clinch counties, which are home to the majority of the Okefenokee’s shallow, 438,000-acre, peat-filled wetland along the Georgia-Florida border.

A healthy Okefenokee promotes agritourism in the three small south Georgia counties, which have a combined population of about 54,000 people, as well creating jobs and encouraging workforce development, she said.

In addition, the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge has been nominated to be a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which could further boost its visitation numbers, Bednarek said. A decision on the nomination is expected next year.

More than 800,000 people visit the Okefenokee annually, according to Okefenokee Swamp Park and Adventures. Visitors spend about $91.5 million in Ware, Charlton, and Clinch counties.

“It’s really a huge opportunity for the region and the gateway communities around the Okefenokee to benefit from increased tourism and educational and research activities,” Bednarek said. “We want to see more sustained attention and investment in the communities and the people around the Okefenokee. If the people are benefitting from a conserved landscape, then they’ll want to make sure the landscape stays preserved.”

Megan Huynh, senior attorney and wetlands and coasts program leader for the Southern Environmental Law Center, echoed Bednarek.

“Now that the mine is gone, there’s a responsibility to support opportunities for those communities that aren’t at odds with the health of the Okefenokee,” she said.

Mike Worley, president and CEO of the Georgia Wildlife Federation, said the goal is to use every available tool to ensure the future of the Okefenokee.

“The main thing right now is to celebrate the victory that we’ve had and be prepared to finish the job,” he said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-81/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/07c8c7b7-a573-484b-b321-1e644181ccea-11753088578.jpeg?h=16013371&itok=a1JUXSNp,N,,2025-07-21 05:59:34.862905

The project has now officially been canceled. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator.)

The long-controversial Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project was officially canceled Thursday, bringing to an end the battle over the largest and most expensive effort to build land along Louisiana’s sinking coastline.

The Louisiana Coastal Restoration and Protection Authority confirmed the project would no longer be moving forward in a statement on Thursday. CPRA chairman Gordon Dove, in a phone call Friday, added that while CPRA “remains committed to coastal restoration,” the keystone project would be ended in its current form.

Proponents of the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion emphasised the wealth of scientific research that went into the planning for the axed project, as well as the urgency of stemming Louisiana’s rapid wetlands loss with the nearly 20 square miles of land the project expected to build over the next 50 years.

Political battles over the increasing cost of the nearly $3 billion plan and its impact on industries such as oyster harvesting were key elements that led to the eventual death of the project. Those in the oyster industry laud it as a victory for their livelihoods, while environmentalists and scientists lament the loss as a massive backwards step for coastal restoration.

“ We needed Mid-Barataria, frankly, many decades ago. It was a really big deal that it was under construction finally, and we had the resources to do it. And now all of that is cast aside,” said Amanda Moore, senior director of the Gulf Program at the National Wildlife Federation.

Over a football field of land is lost along the coast every 100 minutes, attributed to a wide variety of factors including sea level rise, subsidence and overengineering of sediment-carrying rivers such as the Mississippi. Sediment diversions aim to reconnect the river with wetlands and mimic the way it naturally used to build land.

“The need has not changed. There’s only one thing that has changed and that is the political landscape, so that is what ended this project,” said James Karst of the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana.

For Karst and many others, the cancellation of the project didn’t come as a surprise. Gov. Jeff Landry openly opposed the project, saying its impact on Louisiana fisheries would “break our culture,” as his administration took steps to slow its progress.

“We kind of knew it was going to get canceled,” said Peter Vujnovich, a third-generation oyster harvester based in Port Sulphur, adding that he’s “glad” for fewer “negative impacts on people that make a living out and about on the water.”

Vujnovich said his hopes for the success of future coastal restoration projects “depends on how they move forward. He added that he wants to see the forces who planned the Mid-Barataria project more actively involve communities and “include everybody,” like oyster harvesters, in future efforts.

The project’s budget did set aside $400 million to mitigate impacts to local communities, including the oyster industry, though many opponents felt it wasn’t enough.

“Hopefully, they’ll learn from this,” Vujnovich said.

Mitch Jurisich, chairman of Louisiana’s Oyster Task Force, gave a “hallelujah” in response to the project’s death. He credits Landry’s involvement as a turning point in the effort to sink the Mid-Barataria coastal restoration plan.

“Gov. Landry and chairman Gordy Dove with CPRA, they joined forces with us,” he said. “They basically turned the tide by stepping in with us.”

In a statement announcing the cancellation, the Trustees Implementation Group responsible for overseeing the funds provided for the project said CPRA determined “the project is no longer viable due to multiple factors, including the suspension of a federal permit by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and ongoing litigation.”

Construction of the project started in 2023, but it faces lawsuits from Plaquemines Parish and oystermen trying to halt it. In April, Dove ordered a pause on all work related to the project. A few weeks later, the Army Corps of Engineers suspended one of its permits.

In a letter to CPRA, the corps said it suspended the permit for a variety of reasons, including a shift in the state’s commitment to the project, the ongoing lawsuits and claiming the state “deliberately withheld” information the corps needed for its environmental impact statement.

The last factor instigated a social media firefight between Landry and former Gov. John Bel Edwards, with an X post from Landry harkening the issue to a real-life “John Grisham” novel exposé and balking at the high cost.

The project was already funded with $3 billion set aside in the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Trust, which came from the settlement from the BP oil spill disaster that devastated the Gulf Coast and the industries it supports in 2010.

In the past, Dove has suggested a smaller, cheaper version of the diversion, which could include channeling the Mississippi’s sediment and fresh water at a rate anywhere from 5 to 30 times less than the 75,000 cubic feet per second called for in the Mid-Barataria plans.

“We haven’t heard any complete replacement plan … I think when you’ve got a problem of this magnitude, going with a smaller, less effective tool to do the work, you gotta think about whether that makes sense,” Karst said.

Jurisich said he is in favor of a smaller diversion.

“We may look at a small freshwater diversion here or there, just to kind of nourish the newly created land. But you know, we killed the beast that was going to kill us, and that’s the best,” he said.

The state has already authorized more than $600,000 for the Mid-Barataria diversion, and the remainder will now be used to close out the project. The rest of the money will return to the Deepwater Horizon trust to be used for future coastal restoration projects, which will need to go through a new approval process.

Moore, with the National Wildlife Federation, said by canceling the Mid-Barataria project, the state is not only losing arguably the most important project in its Coastal Master Plan to fight land loss, but also the decades of planning and resources that went into it.

”Time is something that is really worrisome to us because it took us decades to get a project like this moving forward,” she said. “And for Louisiana’s coast, I think you’re gonna be looking at least a decade or more if you’re gonna see something else come through.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/fairfieldsuntimes.com/content/tncms/custom/image/d034bece-aa1f-11e8-89d5-631de6079630.jpg?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-07-21 08:59:38.530709

Recent events show TVA can’t carry out even its most basic responsibility of delivering reliable energy to its consumers.

TVA also has spread itself thin, focusing on nontraditional service sectors like broadband expansion and green energy initiatives.

The new TVA board should refocus on delivering reliable, abundant and affordable energy to the Tennessee Valley while reducing burdensome regulations.

President Donald Trump and Tennessee’s two U.S. senators, Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, are pushing for reform of the Tennessee Valley Authority, and they are right to do so.

Thankfully, just this past week, Trump nominated four new TVA board members who await U.S. Senate confirmation.

Trump’s concern over TVA and its trajectory started during his first term, when he learned that the nation’s largest public utility was concocting a plan to ship taxpayer-funded jobs overseas.

In 2020, he signed an executive order that restricted federal agencies from outsourcing jobs to foreign workers, fired TVA chairman Skip Thompson and another board member, and criticized then-CEO Jeff Lyash’s overall compensation.

And, in the intervening four years, TVA has shown no signs of meaningful progress.

TVA has failed to deliver reliable energy to consumers

In 2022, the agency ordered rolling blackouts in Tennessee as temperatures plummeted during a severe winter storm due to the power grid failing to keep up with demand. Similarly, in 2025, the agency again demanded residents “conserve energy” – suggesting thermostat levels in the 60s during chilly January and keeping air conditioning at 78 degrees earlier this summer due to TVA’s inability to meet base load power demands. Also, in 2024, electrical equipment failures knocked all three TVA nuclear plants offline.

It’s a pattern that has become a familiar one for Americans across seven states – Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina and Virginia – who are forced into a client relationship with this government-backed monopoly. And it’s evidence of the fact that the TVA can’t carry out even its most basic responsibility of delivering reliable energy to its consumers.

Not only has the service that TVA provides been highly unreliable, it has also become consistently more expensive. In fact, TVA has raised rates 10% in just two years, and with no competition in sight, consumers are unlikely to catch a break anytime soon.

To recap: higher prices and increasingly unreliable service when it matters most. But it gets worse. In recent decades, the TVA has spread itself thin, focusing on nontraditional service sectors like broadband expansion and green energy initiatives. The unreliability of TVA’s energy has led some businesses to look outside Tennessee because TVA cannot guarantee that they can meet the required power load. In fact, Sen. Hagerty said TVA has become “the limiting factor” on economic development projects in Tennessee.

But there is some hope on the horizon. Trump recently stepped back into the mix and dismissed TVA board member Michelle Moore, known as one of the top drivers of its clean energy focus. While clean energy may be a goal shared by many, it is unserious to suggest our infrastructure has the capacity to transition entirely to wind and solar immediately without unacceptable disruptions. Too many on the left have been willing to destroy Americans’ current way of life for unreachable goals because of this obsession. Another board member was also removed shortly thereafter, leaving the agency without a quorum and thus prevented from moving forward.

TVA key in Trump goal to make America energy independent

Trump has promised to make America energy independent, and he seems to mean business. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee recently highlighted how Tennessee can be a leader in nuclear energy again if TVA can be transformed by a new board focused on its actual mission.

Trump has the support of Lee and many in the U.S. Senate − including Blackburn and Hagerty, who recently wrote an opinion piece in Power magazine that said, “(The) TVA Board of Directors lacks the talent, experience, and gravitas to meet a challenge that clearly requires visionary industrial leaders. The group looks more like a collection of political operatives than visionary industrial leaders.”

Trump and Tennessee’s senators have rightly called attention to TVA’s more recent failures. Now, the administration and Congress must work with the new incoming TVA board to refocus on its foundational duty of delivering reliable, abundant and affordable energy to the Tennessee Valley while reducing burdensome regulations and fees that hinder private sector innovation and competition.

Further, appointees should commit to eliminating wasteful spending and misguided ventures into nonessential sectors such as broadband and unrealistic green energy mandates.

It’s time for Trump and Congress to deliver on their promise of reform and restore accountability, affordability and reliability to one of America’s most crucial utilities. Tennessee’s economic future depends on a refocused and supportive TVA.","https://www.knoxnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/15/PKNS/85213140007-hannah-cox-headshot.jpg?crop=991,558,x0,y132&width=991&height=558&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-07-21 05:59:42.862965

With emissions from air travel accounting for 2.5% of global CO₂ output, regulatory pressure, corporate commitments, and technological innovation are converging to make Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) a cornerstone of the net-zero economy. As of July 2025, SAF production capacity has surged to 30,000 barrels per day (b/d) in the U.S. and is projected to hit 15.5 million tonnes globally by 2030. This rapid growth, coupled with structural bottlenecks and policy tailwinds, creates a compelling investment thesis for infrastructure, production, and technology players.

Policy-Driven Demand and the Race to Scale

The EU's ReFuelEU Aviation mandate (2% SAF blending by 2025) and the U.S. SAF Grand Challenge (3 billion gallons annually by 2030) have created a regulatory floor for demand. These policies are already reshaping supply chains. For example, the EU's reliance on imported feedstocks like used cooking oil (UCO) and soybean oil has driven up prices and created a premium for producers with secure, traceable feedstock access. Similarly, U.S. projects like Phillips 66's 10,000-b/d and Diamond Green Diesel's 15,000-b/d facilities are leveraging the Inflation Reduction Act's 45Z tax credit to expand capacity.

However, policy alone is not enough. Structural bottlenecks—such as limited feedstock availability, fragmented collection systems, and underdeveloped distribution networks—threaten to slow progress. For instance, the U.S. currently produces SAF at 30,000 b/d but faces a 2030 feedstock gap as demand outstrips supply of UCO and animal fats. This creates an urgent need for alternative pathways like e-SAF (green hydrogen + CO₂) and alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) technologies, which are still in early commercialization but hold long-term scalability.

Investment Opportunities in Infrastructure and Production

The SAF supply chain offers three distinct investment layers:

Feedstock Logistics and Collection Systems

The lack of standardized UCO collection networks in regions like Asia-Pacific and Europe presents a critical gap. Independent traders control 80% of UCO in Asia, leading to inefficiencies and high costs. Companies building digital platforms to aggregate and trace feedstock—such as startups leveraging blockchain for transparency—could capture significant value. Similarly, waste segregation and pre-treatment infrastructure for municipal solid waste (MSW) and agricultural residues will become essential as HEFA's feedstock limitations become apparent.

Production Facilities and Technology Innovation

The U.S. and Asia are leading in SAF production, but Europe lags behind, with only 30% of announced projects under construction. This underdevelopment highlights opportunities for firms building modular, plug-and-play SAF plants or retrofitting existing refineries. For example, co-processing refineries (which blend SAF with conventional jet fuel) and standalone renewable diesel-to-SAF facilities are gaining traction. Investors should also monitor companies developing next-gen technologies like e-SAF, which could become a $100 billion market by 2040.

Distribution and Airport Infrastructure

Existing jet fuel infrastructure is incompatible with SAF blending at scale. Airports and fuel service providers face a $20–30 billion investment need to upgrade storage tanks, pipelines, and delivery systems. China's Civil Aviation Administration is already testing SAF refueling trials, while the U.S. is incentivizing airport upgrades through federal grants. This creates a niche for engineering firms and EPC contractors with expertise in aviation fuel logistics.

Data-Driven Insights and Market Dynamics

The SAF market is highly capital-intensive, with production costs currently 3–5 times higher than conventional jet fuel. However, costs are expected to decline as scale increases and policy incentives mature. For example, the 45Z tax credit in the U.S. provides up to $1.29 per gallon for SAF produced from non-ILUC feedstocks, a critical bridge until production becomes economically viable. Investors should also monitor the 45Z extension beyond 2027, as its expiration could disrupt momentum.

Risks and Strategic Considerations

While the long-term outlook is positive, near-term risks include:

- Feedstock Competition: SAF producers face headwinds from renewable diesel demand for road transport, driving up soybean oil and tallow prices.

- Policy Uncertainty: Delays in EU blending mandates or U.S. tax credit extensions could slow adoption.

- Technological Hurdles: e-SAF and FT (Fischer-Tropsch) pathways require breakthroughs in green hydrogen production and carbon capture.

To mitigate these risks, investors should prioritize companies with diversified feedstock portfolios, strong policy alignment, and partnerships with airlines or airports. For example, firms securing long-term supply contracts with major carriers like United or Lufthansa can lock in demand and reduce exposure to market volatility.

Conclusion: A Multi-Decade Transition

The SAF industry is at an inflection point. With global demand set to reach 196 million tonnes by 2050 and policy frameworks solidifying, investors have a unique opportunity to back the infrastructure and technology that will decarbonize aviation. The next five years will be critical in determining whether SAF becomes a foundational pillar of net-zero aviation or remains a niche solution. For those willing to navigate the early-stage risks, the rewards are substantial: a sector poised to grow at 30%+ annually, backed by trillions in global climate commitments.

In the coming months, watch for companies securing feedstock supply chains, securing government contracts, and pioneering next-gen technologies.

But the franchise law now stands in the way of Scout’s plans to sell cars directly to customers.
Robert Kittle, a spokesman for the office of Attorney General Alan Wilson, said he believes the franchise law is valid.
All the agency can do is refer reports of illegal activities to the State Law Enforcement Division, a spokesman said.
""According to current state law, businesses that sell and/or repair vehicles must be franchised.”","WASHINGTON — Gov. Henry McMaster believes a federal lawsuit could untangle a limiting South Carolina law that makes it illegal to buy trendy vehicles — like Elon Musk’s Tesla or Scout Motors soon-to-come electric SUV — directly from manufacturers.

McMaster supports changing the franchise law to help grow the state’s thriving automotive sector, but he faces stiff legislative opposition and resistance from the powerful lobby that represents auto dealers.

Legal action may help clarify the statute. The law has been on the books since 2000, but state agencies are mired in uncertainty about who has the power to enforce it or bring legal action.

“If the Justice Department or anyone else is successful in convincing a federal court that South Carolina’s law is unconstitutional because it violates the Commerce Clause, automobile manufacturers won’t be required by law to sell their vehicles through dealers anymore. They will be able to sell them directly to consumers,” McMaster’s spokesman Brandon Charochak said in a statement to The Post and Courier.

On the opposite side, a key state lawmaker who supports old-fashioned car dealerships said federal intervention is unnecessary. But he acknowledged corrections may be needed to tamp down recent activities by manufacturers who are opening “pop-up” repair shops around the state that may be illegal.

“Do we want the courts making all of our laws?” asked Republican Rep. Chris Wooten of Lexington.

The conflicting views reflect two sides of a long-running debate over how the state should handle direct auto sales to consumers, which are illegal under a South Carolina law that forbids manufacturers from selling cars or opening repair shops. A proposal to change the law was defeated in February after intense lobbying from the S.C. Auto Dealers Association, which represents 270 local dealerships, and electric vehicles manufacturers, who are trying to eliminate the middleman and offer their own sales and repairs.

A potential Justice Department challenge to SC law

McMaster used a $1.5 billion package of state incentives to convince Scout Motors to build a manufacturing plant in Blythewood, near the state capital of Columbia. But the franchise law now stands in the way of Scout’s plans to sell cars directly to customers.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s Justice Department has taken up the issue. The agency’s anti-trust division has said it considers auto franchise laws in 17 states anti-competitive and more responsive to special interests than consumers. A top Justice official testified recently that the agency will work with lawmakers and attorneys general in the states, but, if necessary, will try to get Congress to preempt the state laws.

McMaster has not discussed the issue with Justice officials, according to Charochak. But the governor stepped into politically treacherous waters in February when he voiced support for changing the law. He said in a radio interview it was important for S.C. consumers to “get what they need, as quickly and conveniently as possible.”

Scout, which is part of the Volkswagen group, says it intends to use internet sales when its vehicles begin rolling off the assembly line in 2027. McMaster heavily recruited Scout, and the defeat of the proposed S.C. Consumer Freedom Act left the company in a position where it could not legally sell its products directly to South Carolina consumers.

Scout wrote to the special Justice Department task force studying monopolistic laws and asked it to eliminate franchise laws.

Wooten and other opponents say the dealership system has worked well for decades and provides thousands of jobs in sales and repair centers statewide. They believe electric vehicle companies should comply with the existing law by setting up dealerships, which requires posting bonds, establishing permanent sales addresses and registering with the state regulator — the S.C. Department of Motor Vehicles.

“We're not having problems with our franchise dealers,” Wooten said. He believes local auto dealers contribute to their communities with personal service and civic engagement, such as sponsoring Little League teams.

“They're actually creating and stimulating the economy more than most other entities. So why are we looking at changing it for a small group of people?” he said.

Is controversial franchise law even enforceable?

South Carolina’s law was passed when consumers typically bought new cars from dealers who worked under contracts with specific manufacturers. Shopping on huge suburban car lots usually meant long test drives and hours of bartering over final prices, which included a cut for dealers.

Electric vehicle makers argue that they could control prices by eliminating third parties and dealing directly with customers through online sales that allow customization from the comfort of home. But under the S.C. law, buyers interested in EVs must now travel to neighboring states where direct sales are legal to take possession of a vehicle or have it repaired under warranty.

Recent developments have exposed gaping loopholes. For one, the law has no specific language describing who will enforce it, leaving it unenforceable. Popular manufacturers like Tesla and Rivian are testing the law by directing customers using their apps to pop-up service centers in South Carolina. Neither Tesla nor Rivian responded to questions.

State Sen. Larry Grooms, R-Berkeley, a supporter of dealers, said these manufacturers may find themselves facing lawsuits.

Wooten said the shops are illegal, but the law needs to be amended to give the S.C. Department of Motor Vehicles specific enforcement power.

Tesla recently added South Carolina to its website as a state in which its expensive cars and trucks can be leased, prompting a spirited discussion about legality in online chat groups. Until recently, customers wanting to lease Teslas had to make those arrangements and pick up vehicles in another state.

Robert Kittle, a spokesman for the office of Attorney General Alan Wilson, said he believes the franchise law is valid.

""As far as who enforces it, the law does not specify,"" he said. ""As we said in our opinion, someone who has standing can sue to enforce it. Standing would be up to the court to determine.”

Kittle was referring to a February opinion written for Sen. Shane Massey, the Senate majority leader. In the opinion, Wilson’s office said the DMV, the licensing authority for auto dealers, was the agency most likely to win standing in a lawsuit.

“A court could well conclude that the DMV would have standing to enforce the requirement in South Carolina that a manufacturer may not engage in the sale of automobiles in this state,” the opinion stated.

But Wooten, after consulting with DMV officials, said the agency needs a legislative fix to broaden its enforcement power.

The DMV regulates licensed dealers, and neither Tesla nor Rivian has applied for a license. All the agency can do is refer reports of illegal activities to the State Law Enforcement Division, a spokesman said.

A SLED spokesperson said the agency has no current investigations involving Tesla or Rivian.

“At this time, it is illegal in the state of South Carolina for manufacturers to sell or repair vehicles directly from the factory,"" the spokesperson said. ""According to current state law, businesses that sell and/or repair vehicles must be franchised.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/53/053fb01c-e1e2-4244-b9e9-a04619e17753/687a38b4558c5.social.jpg?resize=1500%2C1065,N,,2025-07-21 11:05:40.176746

The 2024/2025 document details ambitious policy moves, regulatory upgrades, and partnership initiatives since 2024, underscoring the central bank’s commitment to anchoring Singapore’s financial system in climate resilience and sustainable growth.

In a period marked by what MAS chief sustainability officer, Gilian Tan, described as “global headwinds affecting climate action”, the regulator is taking proactive steps. These range from new disclosure standards to sectoral innovation, signalling Singapore’s intention to “stay the course in our sustainability journey” and seize the “significant economic opportunities” presented by regional energy transition.

MAS chairman Gan Kim Yong said: “The [Asian Development Bank (ADB)] estimates that manufacturing related to renewable energy in Southeast Asia could generate up to US$100bn in annual revenue by 2030 and create up to 6 million jobs by 2050.”

However, he also noted the economic risks of inaction. “The stakes are high,” he warns, referencing ADB’s projections that climate inaction could slash Asia Pacific’s GDP by as much as 41% by the century’s end. Yet, he remains optimistic, stating “the economic case for Asia’s transition is growing” with renewable energy already making up a significant share of the energy mix in several Asian countries, “supported by its falling costs”.

MAS continues to leverage its unique position, pushing policy and public-private partnerships that set new regional standards. Notably, the regulator is currently rolling out IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards for Singapore stock exchange-listed issuers using a phased approach. This comes as other regulators in the region, such as Japan, are reportedly considering delaying implementation of the standards in light of the EU’s omnibus process.

MAS said it will strengthen the climate resilience of its foreign reserves portfolio and has also developed a roadmap to manage its Climate Transition Programme (CTP) equities portfolios against climate indices.

To bridge global differences in green finance, MAS collaborated last year with China’s central bank and the EU to publish a multi-jurisdiction common ground taxonomy. This harmonised framework serves as a guide for identifying green activities across major economies, removing barriers for cross-border capital flows.

MAS also launched an industrial transformation infrastructure debt programme to support Asia’s green and transition financing needs. The initiative is bolstered by a $500mn pledge in concessional capital from the Singapore government to match dollar-for-dollar concessional capital from other parties.

Meanwhile, an interim report by the Transition Credits Coalition outlined key insights developed so far on the use of transition credits to accelerate the early retirement of coal-fired power plants, crucial in coal-dependent Asia.

However, MAS’s efforts go beyond financial policy. In partnership with the Institute of Banking and Finance, the MAS successfully upskilled a significant cohort of finance professionals for the green transition. Since the launch of the sustainable finance jobs transformation map last year, at least 4100 professionals have been trained through the IBF-accredited training, according to Tan.

“While the road ahead will have its challenges, continued collaboration…will position us well to strengthen our financial sector’s resilience and build a sustainable future for Singapore and the region,” said the MAS chief.",https://greencentralbanking.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MAS-commits-to-stay-the-course-on-sustainable-finance-amid-global-headwinds-meta-image.png,N,,2025-07-21 08:01:56.994826

,Clean Energy ,2025-07-21 09:03:38+00:00,Raleigh News & Observer,North Carolina is recruiting 243 jobs projects. It's his job to close the deals.,"Brian Gordon, Travis Long",,,,,https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article310924205.html,"Last week, his team celebrated North Carolina again topping CNBC’s annual list of best states for business.
How many jobs projects is North Carolina competing for?
Chung: So, it’s 243 active projects right now that we’re working together with the Commerce Department and our local partners.
It just fits the needs (of a company) a little bit better than what we have available here in North Carolina today.
N&O: Do you sense any nervousness among companies that announced North Carolina projects that were inspired or propelled by Biden-era federal policy?","Even the state ranked No. 1 for business loses more jobs projects than it wins.

Competition for new factories and corporate offices is fierce as rival states top each other with incentive offerings. Still, it is the job of Christopher Chung to keep North Carolina’s batting average high.

Chung is the CEO of the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina (EDPNC), a public-private group that attracts new companies and encourages existing companies to expand in the Tar Heel State. Last week, his team celebrated North Carolina again topping CNBC’s annual list of best states for business.

In an interview with The News & Observer the next day, Chung shared how many $1 billion-plus projects the state is now recruiting, what the transition from Biden to Trump has meant for clean energy jobs, and the number one reason companies pick other states over North Carolina.

The conversation has been edited for clarity and length.

N&O: Top line pipeline numbers. How many jobs projects is North Carolina competing for? How many of those projects promise an investment above $1 billion?

Chung: So, it’s 243 active projects right now that we’re working together with the Commerce Department and our local partners. About three-quarters of those are business recruitment deals where it’s a company that doesn’t have a presence here today that we’d be trying to attract. The other quarter of the deals are incumbent employers that we’re working with on a potential expansion in their existing operations.

N&O: What’s a ballpark sort of success rate that you all hope for?

Chung: If it’s an existing employer expansion, I would say we probably win two out of every three of those, or greater, because you’ve got a little bit of that power of incumbency, so to speak. You don’t have to convince them about what the business climate and workforce are in North Carolina.

So it’s not as much of a jump ball as it would be where a company is contacting half a dozen states and saying, ‘Hey, we’ve got this factory we’ve got to put somewhere, and we’ll entertain offers from this dozen states that could be a fit.’ I would say we’re having a really good year if we can bat .250 to .300 on those business recruitment deals.

N&O: We were ranked number one in business, so I imagine we have a pretty successful hit rate. But when we do get dumped late in the process, and the companies do explain why, is there a common reason?

Chung: We used to lose a lot more commonly due to incentives, where another state just put a more robust incentive package on the table. But I will say, full credit to both the executive branch and the legislature for making us much more competitive over the past decade when it comes to incentives. Both our off-the-shelf tools like the JDIG program, as well as, when necessary, special legislation that’s done to (support) the really big deals. So I see (incentives) come up much less often today as a reason. (The Job Development Incentive Grant program is the state’s primary tool for attracting new businesses. It usually provides a substantial tax credit if the new company meets investment and hiring goals.)

I’d say that the number one reason still continues to be there’s a better site somewhere else. It just fits the needs (of a company) a little bit better than what we have available here in North Carolina today.

When our folks close out projects as losses, they have a dropdown menu, and they can say what reason best explains this company’s decision to forgo North Carolina. And the number one reason is usually in that real estate category.

Trump policy shifts and tariffs

N&O: You’ve talked about how federal policy helped influence the number of clean energy jobs we were getting during the Biden administration. Has that pipeline completely dried up and now it’s defense and other things? How have you seen the administrative change change the pipeline?

Chung: There are really two sectors where that kind of shift in the federal policy landscape would show up on our doorstep, and that’s the automotive sector, because so much of automotive investment in recent years has been around electrification and all the supply chain that goes into EVs.

The other sector is just clean energy, writ large, and that could be everything from solar panel assembly to hydrogen fuel cell systems or nuclear SMR component, wind turbine part manufacturing.

Right now, if I’m looking at these 243 active projects, the top sector for these deals is life sciences. That’s about 15% of our project activity is attributable to something like biotech, pharma, medical device, that sort of thing. But the next biggest category is still energy.

Energy had been the biggest sector for a while. Now it’s still second biggest, but that is one spot down from where it had probably been for most of 2024.

N&O: Do you sense any nervousness among companies that announced North Carolina projects that were inspired or propelled by Biden-era federal policy?

Chung: I think uncertainty is never good for any company. And so in that limbo period where companies aren’t sure what becomes the law and when and what doesn’t — that kind of uncertainty can actually be worse than actually just knowing, OK, there’s legislative or there’s not legislative support for these programs.

We talked with one project a little bit earlier this week, and they have not initiated construction yet on what they had announced here in the past couple of years. And it was basically a status check conversation for us to understand, where are they on their timetable. Do they still plan to move forward? And at least in this one anecdotal conversation, they still see a market in the United States long term. And while the incentives are obviously helpful at the federal level, you wouldn’t want to base a project solely on that alone.

N&O: How do you hear tariffs come up in conversations with potential companies?

Chung: I’d say the tariff news was much more salient three months ago. Now that those tariff actions have been postponed a couple different times, I’m sure most of those companies are still wondering where it’s all going to land and what it’s going to look like when it’s finalized, but it isn’t coming up with the regularity in conversation that we had first three months ago before basically just in responding to this unprecedented slew of tariff actions that we’ve never really done as a country.

Now that it’s been three months and none of them has really gone into effect — if anything, it’s been pushed back a little bit to allow more time for these bilateral negotiations — I wouldn’t expect for us to be hearing a whole lot.

N&O: Do you get a sense that tariffs have brought jobs back to the US in some capacity and if so in what types of industries?

Chung: I would say it’s probably a mixed report card so far.

We have seen companies that are exploring the possibility of a U.S. facility in case these tariffs go into effect, they at least have some of the due diligence on how to respond to that.

Then on the negative side of the report card, we’ve definitely seen some companies where the uncertainty, the ongoing uncertainty around this, has caused them to slow down or pause any investment decisions until they get greater clarity around where this is all headed and what the impact is.

How to stay ‘No. 1 for business’

N&O: CNBC has its own metrics, but why do you think we are the best state for business?

Chung: I still think it comes down to workforce and talent. Every industry still depends on having access to the best and brightest human capital, and I think we just have such a strong value proposition around the talent and workforce availability here.

Not just the folks that are coming out of our educational systems and the people who are already working in our industries of the state, but we continue to be this magnet for in-migration of people who move here from the Midwest or the Northeast or California, elsewhere in the Southeast.

N&O: What do you worry could keep us from scoring as highly next year?

Chung: CNBC keeps its methodology very guarded throughout the process, which is understandable, so we never know. If we aren’t number one or we drop for whatever reason, we’re always going to try to understand where are we getting dinged on, and are the things we are getting dinged on within the realm that can be addressed by public policy or legislation or something like that, right?

I would say that because talent is what has gotten us in the top five and top three over the years, I’m not worried about that. I hope that all of our policymakers, our legislators, our state officials, continue to focus on what are ways we can produce a workforce that’s as prepared as possible for what industry is looking for.",https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/1a16nw/picture269121962/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/RAL_111722-TTARHEEL-TEL02.JPG,N,,2025-07-21 05:59:14.454658

They banned shell dredging in that lake in the mid-1980s after a resumption of the practice in 1983 following a long hiatus.
""We are proposing to conduct very minimal improvements to the lake bottom in order to provide safe navigation into Lake Maurepas.""","A new battle is shaping up over Air Products' controversial plans for carbon injection wells beneath Lake Maurepas, with the extensive digging required now coming into focus and stirring fresh opposition to the project.

The carbon injection and storage field is expected to require enough underwater digging that the removed mud could fill LSU's Pete Maravich Assembly Center nearly twice over, company estimates show.

The digging will help make way for a network of underwater pipelines for carbon dioxide, natural gas and fiber optic cables that will form roughly the shape of two ""T's"" touching end to end, plans show.

Air Products announced its plans to build the first carbon capture and sequestration operation in Louisiana nearly four years ago, but the extent of the work has come into sharper focus with recent permit applications.

With this information in hand, longtime legislative and other opponents recently announced a new strategy to fight the project. They plan to invoke the history of damaging shell dredging in the lake to encourage closer regulatory scrutiny, they said.

This plan comes with the public comment periods having opened this month for Air Products' clean water and waterway permits with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and its coastal use permit from the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources.

Air Products disputes the comparison with shell dredging and calls the planned work on the lake bottom relatively minimal.

Its plans involve injecting up to 5.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year more than a mile deep into porous rocks millions of years old. That would allow it to produce low-carbon hydrogen and potentially ammonia at a $7 billion plant proposed in Ascension Parish that has garnered local and state backing due to the project's sizeable job and tax benefits.

'Deserve a real say'

A now banned practice that had dated back to 1914 along Louisiana's coast and its inland estuaries, oyster and clam shell dredging was the subject of a hot button environmental dispute in the 1980s until it was ended in the early 1990s.

Opponents successfully argued then that the pollutants and mud stirred up by the practice — using suction dredges to pull up shells from lake and coastal bottoms — caused long-term harm to water quality and aquatic wildlife while removing protective oyster reefs.

In the mid-1980s, the state sued in federal court to force the Corps of Engineers to do the kind of deeper analysis now sought for Air Products, known as an environmental impact statement.

State Rep. Kimberly Coates, R-Ponchatoula, recently told a crowded bingo hall in Tangipahoa Parish that the case established a precedent that she believes will help.

""This fight for Lake Maurepas is about protecting our communities, our ecosystem, and our constitutional right to public input. The people deserve transparency, and they deserve a real say in what happens to their lake,"" Coates said in a later statement after the town hall in Ponchatoula last week.

The November 1987 Corps analysis that the suit forced ended up opposing shell dredging in Lake Maurepas due to its small size, shallowness, fresh water and other factors. The practice wouldn't be halted in next-door Lake Pontchartrain and elsewhere statewide for a few more years.

The Corps' conclusion came a few years after state regulators recognized the particular sensitivity of Maurepas. They banned shell dredging in that lake in the mid-1980s after a resumption of the practice in 1983 following a long hiatus.

In internal memos, state Department of Environmental Quality officials detailed the nearly immediate and extensive impact shell dredging had on Maurepas' shallow waters in the spring of '83 and winter of '83/'84, even after they tried to reduce digging from three dredges to one dredge only for five days over a 10-day period.

Air Products officials say they remain open to an EIS, which could take up to two years, and to new public hearings that opponents are also seeking, but pointed out those decisions are up to the Corps.

""Any comparison of shell dredging to our work would be inaccurate and misleading,"" said Christina Stephens, a company spokeswoman. ""We are proposing to conduct very minimal improvements to the lake bottom in order to provide safe navigation into Lake Maurepas.""

Corps will evaluate

Air Products has already finished seismic and other testing and received its state air permit in June, but it is waiting on DENR's technical review of its underground injection plans, company officials said.

The carbon storage project is however facing renewed internal scrutiny following an investor-led leadership shakeup earlier this year.

Air Products is looking for investors to take over the carbon capture and ammonia production piece of the operation, and the completion date has been pushed back two to three years.

He said ""it’s not clear how the construction impacts from pipeline and (carbon capture and sequestration) well construction and several decades of clam shell dredging in Lake Maurepas and Lake Pontchartrain are comparable, but it is something we may consider.""

'Least disruptive paths'

Air Products says it has tried to limit the impact of temporary construction and its permanent operations.

The company plans to have surface structures contained in 17 sites, including 16 injection and monitoring wells, and has tried to locate the different facilities together to limit the visual impact.

""Once completed, Air Products’ presence on Lake Maurepas will only represent around 0.0008% of the entire surface of the lake,"" said Stephens, the company spokeswoman.

The company also will locate underwater pipelines next to one another in parallel routes of two or three channels and use a mud curtain and other practices during dredging to reduce clouding the water with dirt.

Spoil mud from the new pipeline trenches would be spread along their sides and would be no deeper than 6 inches, Air Products says.

""We have worked with regulators to find the least disruptive paths for our pipelines and at every step of the process we are implementing ways to minimize our environmental impact on Lake Maurepas,"" Stephens said.

Kristi Trail, executive director of the Pontchartrain Conservancy, said her group remains concerned about the wetlands destruction required for pipeline and other construction on land and about the impact dredging could have on the lake and parts of the food web.

""It's a very sensitive ecosystem, and it was well recognized, the benefit of halting dredging, which is why it was stopped,"" said Trail, whose nonprofit is dedicated in part to the health of the two lakes.

Provided the DEQ memos from the '80s, Trail said they show the impact dredging of just about a month caused and argued Air Products work over potentially a few years could cause ""irreversible harm to the lake.""

""Why are we repeating the mistakes of the past? Is history doomed to repeat itself because we refuse to learn? It's possible to have economic development but not at the expense of our sportsman's paradise.

It has already begun producing high-efficiency heterojunction technology (HJT) solar modules, which are among the largest-size modules for utility-scale solar applications. It is also setting up India’s largest solar glass manufacturing facility. The glass factory, spanning 1.3 kilometers in length, will support its in-house module production.

The solar production facility is part of RIL’s upcoming end-to-end clean energy ecosystem, aimed at delivering low-cost renewable power to its group companies as well as meeting third-party demand.

“We are setting up an end-to-end energy ecosystem at world leading scale with full integration, providing highest efficiency solar panels and energy storage batteries, which further reduces the costs and provides latest technology products,” said Karan Suri, Senior Vice President – New Energy, Reliance Industries Ltd. “All of this translates into attractive return on capital for both manufacturing and generation, but also reduces the power cost and the energy consumption bill for various Reliance Group captive customers by at least 25% and that is a significant saving for our group companies.”

To deliver round-the-clock renewable power, RIL is executing energy generation projects combining solar power capacity with battery energy storage systems. “Our plan is to do just intime installation of the modules straight from Jamnagar [factory] to the foundation at our generation sites [in Kutch]. Just to highlight the scale, we will be pretty much installing around 50 MW of modules each day, 175 MWh batteries each day at fully operational scale,” said Suri.

Reliance is also setting up manufacturing facility for alkaline electrolyzers to support green hydrogen production using renewable power from its captive power generation plants in Kutch.

A dedicated captive transmission system is being developed from Kutch to Jamnagar to supply RE for RIL’s Jamnagar factories as well as growth businesses.

RIL has access to 700,000 acres of land at Kutch, which can support up to 125 GW of production. The company expects its vertically integrated business — spanning PV module manufacturing to energy generation and green molecule production —to deliver cost competitiveness with attractive return at the manufacturing as well as electricity generation stage.

“All of this business is largest in scale, ever thought of, ever conceptualized and ever delivered, probably the largest outside China. This is the most integrated in value chain. In fact, this is the only end-to-end integrated business owned by a single company across the world,” said Suri. “Effectively what we call this is a Jio movement for our new energy business. Like how Jio revolutionized, democratized the data for Indian customers, we are looking to effectively provide the same solution and energy revolution for the country, for our country.”",https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2025/07/RILs-solar-cell-line-at-Jamnagar-1200x629.png,N,,2025-07-21 03:58:05.998797

Commonly known as the Roadless Rule, the U.S. Department of Agriculture regulation prohibits road construction, reconstruction, and timber harvesting on nearly 60 million acres of national forest land.

Sarah McMillan - the senior attorney and director of the Wildlands & Wildlife Program at the Western Environmental Law Center - said before it was adopted in 2001, 1.5 million people submitted comments, with the vast majority in support of the rule.

""This was a rule that was carefully, thoughtfully developed,"" said McMillan. ""There was a long process of inventorying these roadless areas and identifying these remote, often mature and old-growth trees. This didn't happen overnight.""

A rollback of the rule would allow more logging and drilling on federal lands, which McMillan said would worsen climate change, harm wildlife & vital ecosystems, jeopardize water quality, and negatively affect recreational opportunities.

The Bush administration attempted to repeal the Roadless Rule in 2005, but lost in the courts.

In announcing the proposed rollback, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins claimed more logging would improve forest management, which would in turn decrease forest fires.

But McMillan said that argument is disputed in a 2020 Wilderness Society study that found just the opposite.

""The truth is, un-roaded areas burn at a significantly lower rate than areas with roads,"" said McMillan. ""So, fires start near roads.""

McMillan said it doesn't make sense to allow private developers to log more trees when the planet is undergoing a biodiversity and climate crisis - especially because old-growth trees create a buffer against climate change.

Forests cover almost 30% of New Mexico's land area.

Environmental advocates are urging Washington state lawmakers to require cargo ships to plug in while in port.

The Port of Seattle will require all cruise ships to use shore power by 2027, but cargo ships face no such requirement. One ship idling for 40 hours emits 30 tons of carbon dioxide and sends 22 pounds of toxic soot into the air, which can harm port workers and adjacent neighborhoods.

Teresa Bui, climate policy director for the group Pacific Environment, said the sheer volume at regional ports requires action.

""The Northwest Seaport Alliance saw visits from 1,700 cargo vessels in 2023,"" Bui pointed out. ""While the port is vital to the state economy, there is both a climate and a public health imperative to transition away from diesel and require these ships to plug in.""

A 2023 study found diesel exhaust contributes more than 80% of the cancer risk from toxic air pollutants in the Seattle-Tacoma area.

Legislation to require shore power was introduced in the state House in January but did not make it out of committee. The legislation would apply to any terminal with more than 20 vessel visits per year. State lawmakers have committed more than $50 million toward port electrification.

With the third-largest container ship complex on the West Coast, Bui anticipates strong job creation.

""The additional benefit of requiring ships to plug in is there's job growth potential,"" Bui emphasized. ""The TOTE terminal created 55 local jobs. IBEW supported this measure when it was introduced in the legislature.""

A Maritime Administration estimate anticipates 100% shore power at the Port of Seattle would create hundreds of jobs over 30 years.

Environmental and wildlife conservation in Montana took hits during this year's state legislative session, including vetoes from the governor on bills that received bipartisan support.

Among bills Gov. Greg Gianforte vetoed was House Bill 477, which would have phased out some single-use Styrofoam food containers in favor of those made from Montana agricultural byproducts.

The bill's sponsor, Rep. Marilyn Marler, D-Missoula, called it ""discouraging"" when such a bipartisan effort is vetoed.

""Because it seems to me he did not listen to a wide variety of people, even in his own party,"" she said. ""I think that with this particular bill, it just didn't send the right message about what our values are.""

Tourism and recreation are important and growing industries in the state, and as Marler put it, ""People don't come here to see trash.""

Constituents can see how their lawmakers voted on conservation this session on the Montana Conservation Voters 2025 legislative scorecard.

Marler also voiced concern about weakening the Montana Environmental Policy Act, which was designed to uphold Montanans' constitutional right to a clean environment. While there was a win for habitat funding, Marler added she is seeing continued privatization of wildlife.

""It was not a great session for conservation and it was not a great session for Montana hunters,"" she explained. ""It is becoming very hard to keep commercialization of wildlife off the books.""

In renewable energy news, Gianforte vetoed the Montana Solar Shares Act, which would allow Montanans to buy shares in an energy-generating solar array. But a veto override poll for lawmakers is currently underway by mail.

Conservationists are celebrating the protection of five miles of river frontage along the White Salmon River. The 174-acre site was purchased by The Conservation Fund more than a decade after the removal of Condit Dam. The dam was breached in 2011, draining the former Northwestern Lake. The lakebed makes up much of the acquisition.

Gates Watson, vice president of The Conservation Fund, said the removal restored a 44-mile free-flowing river.

""The dam's presence had an impact on the migration route for fish, including regional salmon populations, and disrupted Yakama Nation's right to fish and gather and hunt along this land, and with this transition that will be restored,"" he explained.

The land was purchased from PacifiCorp, which operated the hydroelectric dam. The site is located in the ancestral territory of the Yakama Nation. The acquisition will be managed by The Conservation Fund temporarily, before being acquired by Yakama Nation on a permanent basis.

Planning for the long-term restoration brought together PacifiCorp, Yakama Nation, The Conservation Fund and an owners association whose cabins sat near the shores of Northwestern Lake. Cabin owners had been leasing land from PacifiCorp. Site surveys were conducted to establish individual lots so owners could acquire the land under their buildings.

Watson said site planning also included a conservation easement and more.

""The vision for the completed White Salmon Corridor project is five miles of connected riparian habitat and a foot trail along the White Salmon River that is owned and managed by Yakima Nation, restoring opportunities for tribal members to access the river and fish,"" he continued.

The river is a breeding habitat for steelhead, Chinook and coho salmon, and researchers have found juvenile fish are returning in strong numbers.

Each project will receive $175,000 in funding over the span of two years.

The Seed Fund Program supports early-stage clean energy research and encourages researchers from across the Institute to explore new energy-related ideas. Reflecting the complexity of the global energy system, the projects have addressed challenges and opportunities across a wide spectrum of sectors. This year’s winning projects address transportation, power infrastructure, recycling, and more.

Over the past four cycles, the largest concentration of projects awarded funding—just more than 30% of the 35 projects funded—have been related to batteries and energy storage. Improving energy storage capabilities is key to expanding the use of renewable energy and enabling energy system decarbonization.

Among the seen selected projects are:

Revolutionizing ammonia as a hydrogen carrier. Due to its high hydrogen storage capacity and high energy density, as well as lower costs to liquefy and transport, ammonia could be a potential liquid commodity to store and transport hydrogen, an environmentally friendly and sustainable fuel. This project aims to reduce the energy cost of the reaction needed to decompose ammonia into hydrogen and nitrogen—a cost that has slowed the large-scale application of ammonia as a hydrogen carrier. The researchers will do this by lowering the overall temperature of the reaction by providing energy mainly to where it is needed: the kinetic energy of the incident ammonia molecule.

Electric vehicle battery management. While the electric vehicle (EV) market has grown significantly over the past decade, it still faces challenges such as lengthy charging times, limited lifespans, and safety concerns. To make EVs more attractive to future customers, this project aims to develop fast-charging protocols and fault prognostic methods to ensure efficient and reliable EV management. The research team will do this by developing digital twins that accurately capture the inherent cell-to-cell variability in battery packs during EV operations and allow for their management in real-time. PI: Richard Braatz, a professor of chemical engineering

Separation and recycling of rare earth elements. Rare earth elements (REEs) are a key resource for many defense, electronic, and clean energy technologies, including electric vehicles and wind turbines. However, REEs are very challenging to separate which requires chemically and energy-intensive processing methods over multiple stages. This project aims to improve the sustainability of REEs and their end products by developing a redox-mediated electrosorption process to efficiently separate REEs. By relying on electricity to drive the separation, this process represents a key step towards enabling more sustainable manufacturing and recycling of clean energy technologies.

That’s true for not only conventional nuclear power plants but also a suite of alternative technologies known as ​“small modular reactors,” or SMRs, which proponents say could deliver nuclear energy at far lower costs and on faster timescales.

Broadly defined, SMRs include designs ranging in capacity from 1 megawatt to several hundred megawatts. They encompass reactors using the same light-water technology that’s inside most existing nuclear plants, as well as projects with gas-cooled reactors or that use emerging nuclear fuels like high-assay low-enriched uranium.

Seventy-four SMR designs are actively being developed worldwide, according to newly released data from the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA), an intergovernmental agency within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

Of that group, 51 designs are involved in pre-licensing or licensing activities with nuclear safety regulators in 15 countries — including the United States — marking a 65% increase in such efforts since 2023. The NEA said this growth reflects significant progress in bringing paper concepts closer to real-world projects, though only two commercial SMRs are actually operating today.

There’s ​“a real momentum behind this class of technologies,” William D. Magwood IV, the director-general of NEA, told reporters last week ahead of the July 22 launch of the agency’s updated SMR-tracking report.

At least $15 billion in public and private financing is now flowing into the SMR space, by the agency’s count.

The idea for small-scale reactors isn’t new: Nuclear scientists have been exploring SMRs for over half a century, ever since the first fission power plants went critical in the 1950s. Previous attempts to quickly and cheaply build smaller plants have failed, though nuclear advocates say the technology is finally ready to launch — as long as the industry can overcome the high technical and regulatory barriers that ensnared earlier generations.

“I’ve seen small reactors come and go over the years,” said Magwood. ​“The economics and other issues have always held them back. But what’s really different this time is that the need for [SMRs] is very clearly there.”

A growing list of hopeful SMR projects

Proponents envision SMRs as a more nimble alternative to the giant power plants that currently provide just over 9% of global electricity today.

Large-scale reactors can deliver gigawatts of baseload electricity, but they require a staggering amount of time and resources to build. In Georgia, Plant Vogtle’s 2.2 GW expansion took 15 years and cost $36.8 billion by the time the project was completed in April 2024. The challenging economics — plus the complications of handling radioactive waste and the risk of catastrophic accidents — help explain why nuclear power has stagnated over the years and is used in only 31 countries.

With SMRs, the thinking goes, relatively smaller plants can be plopped down wherever energy is needed in the world, with factory-fabricated components used to cut down on supply chain and construction costs. The designs being developed today aim to do everything from powering merchant ships and off-grid mining operations to supplying baseload power for data centers and producing high-temperature heat for manufacturing.

“SMR is not one thing — it’s a wide range of sizes, a wide range of temperatures,” said Diane Cameron, who leads NEA’s division of nuclear technology development and economics.

“This is both an opportunity and a challenge,” she said on the press call. ​“There’s a lot going on, and sometimes financiers or regulators and policymakers are wondering where to focus their efforts first.” That includes figuring out how to handle new types of nuclear-fuel waste streams from cutting-edge SMR designs, in addition to the mounting waste from conventional reactors.

So far, however, SMRs have yet to reach their potential.

Cameron noted that the only commercial reactors generating electricity today include a project at China’s Shidaowan Bay nuclear plant — in which two small units drive a single 210 MW steam turbine — and a 70 MW floating reactor on a barge in Russia. A test reactor in Japan is operating inside a laboratory. Meanwhile, in Argentina, the CAREM-25 reactor has been under construction for over a decade, though work was halted last year due to funding shortfalls.

In the U.S., the startup NuScale Power is the only SMR developer to have its designs approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, though plans to build a 77 MW unit in Idaho fell apart in late 2023 after NuScale nearly doubled its cost estimates because of high interest rates and inflation.

But a handful of other first-of-a-kind projects in North America have received key approvals to start laying the early groundwork.

In Ontario, Canada, regulators recently gave Ontario Power Generation the green light to begin building a four-unit SMR project at the Darlington nuclear site. The project will use the light-water BWRX-300 reactor from GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy — a design that stretches the meaning of the word ​“small.” A single reactor building will reach an estimated 220 feet above ground and nearly 112 feet below grade.

The BWRX-300 units will each be capable of generating 300 MW, or enough to power about 300,000 homes, with the first unit expected to be in service by the end of 2030. The total 1.2 GW Darlington project could cost around $15 billion to complete.

In May, the Tennessee Valley Authority became the first U.S. utility to submit a construction permit application — for the BWRX-300 — with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which accepted the application on July 10. After regulatory approval, which is expected by the end of 2026, the TVA plans to install the design at its Clinch River site near Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and to commission the plant by 2032.

The startup Kairos Power is also developing an SMR project in Oak Ridge, but at a much smaller scale and with a less conventional design: a molten fluoride salt coolant and a higher-concentration uranium fuel recipe.

The company aims to start operating a 35 MW thermal Hermes reactor as early as 2026, with a commercial version to be deployed in the 2030s. On July 16, the company said it had installed the reactor vessel for its third engineering test unit, which will inform the design of its first reactor. The Department of Energy (DOE) has agreed to provide up to $303 million for the $629 million project through its Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program.

Meanwhile, in Wyoming, Bill Gates’ startup TerraPower has begun nonnuclear construction work for a 345 MW reactor near a retiring coal plant in Kemmerer. The company’s Natrium reactor, which it aims to bring online in 2030, is a sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten-salt-based storage system and is expected to cost up to $4 billion to complete — with the DOE slated to cover half of that tab through the demonstration program.

The DOE launched the program in 2020, during the first Trump administration. Trump’s second administration is now doubling down on federal support for nuclear projects even as it slashes crucial incentives for other carbon-free power sources like wind and solar.

The administration wants to quadruple U.S. nuclear energy capacity from 100 GW to 400 GW by 2050. To get there, it has called for accelerating the licensing process for new reactors and speeding up regulatory reviews, going as far as to reportedly pressure the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission to ​“rubber stamp” new reactor designs. Earlier this month, the NRC shortened the review period for TerraPower’s construction permit application by seven months. The agency said it now plans to issue its final safety evaluation and environmental review for the Wyoming project by December 31, 2025.

“There’s tremendous activity here in the United States directed towards deploying all forms of new nuclear” to meet growing electricity demand, John Kotek, senior vice president of policy and public affairs at the Nuclear Energy Institute, a U.S. trade association, said on the press call.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-1604652145.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=4cae8293b03df9bf0467f61b6ebfc43c,N,,2025-07-21 08:02:21.469033

That equates to about $8,400 that a household can save on a typical 11-kilowatt, $28,000 rooftop solar system.
It will take the average household several years longer to break even on their rooftop solar investment without the incentive in place.
“Many residential solar companies will be able to diversify and survive,” said Wood Mackenzie solar analyst Zoë Gaston.
Despite the bad news for rooftop solar, the share price of Sunrun, the country’s top residential solar and battery installer, has not cratered over the last two weeks.","Emily Walker has been tracking the damage the Republican megabill will do to a solar industry that’s helped roughly 5.4 million households put panels on their rooftops. It isn’t pretty.

“This is a net harm for the industry, especially for the long-tail installers and the small local businesses that have built this industry from the ground up,” said Walker, the director of content and insight at EnergySage.

While big national solar installers like Sunrun get a lot of attention, the majority of the U.S. home solar market is made up of smaller companies, ranging from regional installers to mom-and-pop businesses, she said.

These regional and local companies, often referred to as the ​“long tail” of the U.S. rooftop solar business, use EnergySage’s online solar marketplace to reach prospective customers and can expect to bear the brunt of the cuts to federal incentives cuts in the law passed by Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump earlier this month.

At the end of 2025, an incentive that’s helped offset the cost of rooftop solar for two decades will disappear. For all but a brief period in 2020, the Residential Clean Energy tax credit, known as 25D for its place in the tax code, has shaved 30% off the cost of a residential solar system, whether homeowners buy it for cash or finance it via a loan. That equates to about $8,400 that a household can save on a typical 11-kilowatt, $28,000 rooftop solar system.

Losing the tax credit will erode the economic benefits of solar, putting it out of reach for many homeowners and making it less valuable to those who can still afford it. It will take the average household several years longer to break even on their rooftop solar investment without the incentive in place.

“Fewer people will be able to go solar, and they will not be able to benefit from the energy cost savings of going solar,” said Glen Brand, vice president of policy and advocacy at Solar United Neighbors, a nonprofit that has helped organize tens of thousands of households to secure lower-cost rooftop solar. ​“That’s just a fact.”

It’s yet another blow to an industry that’s already struggling with rising interest rates and some negative state-level policy developments, including the steep cuts of net-metering values in California, the country’s largest rooftop solar market. In the U.S., residential solar sales fell last year for the first time since 2017, according to analysis firm Wood Mackenzie.

The new law’s solar-incentive clawbacks will make things worse. Wood Mackenzie’s recent ​“low case” forecast indicates that the U.S. will see a 42% decline in residential solar installed between 2025 and 2029 compared with what would have been installed with the tax credits in place.

“Many residential solar companies will be able to diversify and survive,” said Wood Mackenzie solar analyst Zoë Gaston. But ​“we do expect that some residential solar companies will not be able to adapt.”

That will mean ​“massive layoffs,” EnergySage’s Walker said. The Solar Energy Industries Association estimates that the phaseout of 25D could lead to about 84,000 job losses by the end of 2026. Of the more than 150 smaller solar installers surveyed by EnergySage, 92.3% said the law’s changes will harm their businesses, and 63% said it would ​“dramatically harm” their future prospects.

The sudden loss of tax credits compounds smaller installers’ challenges, Walker said. ​“Even if they were given another six months a year, they could pivot business models,” she said. But for ​“businesses this small, their margins are not huge. They don’t have the bandwidth, while trying to serve as many customers as they can through this year to claim the tax credit, to also pivot.”

Barry Cinnamon, CEO of solar and battery installation firm Cinnamon Energy Systems, said his strategy is to do as many tax credit–backed projects as possible in 2025 and then retrench. ​“Nobody wants to admit they’re going to have to cut overhead by 30% or 40% or more,” he said. ​“But for the solar hardcore people who want to stay in the business, you’ve got to cut your costs back.”

Is third-party ownership the way forward?

Despite the bad news for rooftop solar, the share price of Sunrun, the country’s top residential solar and battery installer, has not cratered over the last two weeks. Instead, it’s rallied since the law’s passage — and that’s because the law offered a bit more runway to a separate tax credit that large companies can use to facilitate third-party ownership structures for rooftop solar.

For more than a decade, nationwide solar companies like Sunrun, Tesla Energy, Freedom Forever, Trinity Power Systems, and the now-bankrupt Sunnova, SunPower, and Titan Solar Power have offered households solar systems through leases or power purchase agreements. Under those structures, companies maintain ownership of the solar systems, which allows them to utilize tax credits designed for utility-scale solar, wind, and other clean energy projects.

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, those decades-old tax credits were replaced this year with a 30% ​“tech neutral” investment tax credit, known as 48E for its place in the tax code. Republicans initially aimed to eliminate those tax credits for solar and wind power almost immediately. But the final version of the law allows companies to continue to claim them for projects that begin construction before July 4, 2026, as long as they reach completion within four years of that start date, and for projects that are connected to the grid by the end of 2027.

This means that, starting next year, households are going to have two options, Julien Dumoulin-Smith, head of equity research for power, utilities, and clean energy at investment firm Jefferies, said during a Latitude Media podcast last week. They can spend or borrow money to purchase a system without the benefit of tax credits, or they can sign up with a third-party owner that ​“can qualify for the tax credits, and indirectly flow that back to you in the form of a lower cost arrangement or offtake price,” he said.

That’s a significant advantage for third-party-ownership solar companies, which have regained market share against competing loan-based solar business models amid the rising interest rates of the post-Covid years and now make up roughly half the U.S. residential solar market.

But the pathway for third-party solar companies to tap federal tax credits remains challenging.

In the midst of the megabill’s passage from the Senate to the House of Representatives, Trump issued an executive order calling on the Treasury Department to quickly set guidelines to ​“strictly enforce the termination” of the solar and wind tax credits, with specific instructions to examine ​“restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.”

That throws many of the assumptions on which third-party residential solar companies might build their business into uncertainty, Dumoulin-Smith said. Today, clean energy projects can secure start-of-construction dates for projects by buying at least 5% of the equipment and materials going into them under ​“safe harbor” provisions. But if the Treasury Department alters that understanding, perhaps by increasing the proportion of prepurchased equipment required, ​“that’s a big question mark here on what this means for residential solar in 2028 and 2029 and 2030,” he said.

Jenny Chase, lead solar analyst with BloombergNEF, warned of another potential trap: the law’s ​“foreign entity of concern” (FEOC) rules, which bar tax credits to companies with ties to China. It’s possible that the Treasury Department will issue guidance to ​“make it essentially impossible to prove there are no components, materials, or intellectual property from China, which would mean that anything not safe-harbored in 2025 cannot claim tax credits,” she said.

The Treasury Department is required in the law to issue its guidance by 2026, though several agency rulemakings under the Biden administration took longer than expected, and the Trump administration has since cut staff at the department.

These same risks extend to the lithium-ion batteries being added to a growing number of residential solar systems. The final version of the megabill allows projects using batteries to claim tax credits for them through the end of 2033, but only if they can meet FEOC restrictions — and most of the world’s lithium-ion batteries have materials and components made in China.

Cinnamon noted that regional installers like his company can partner with third-party solar providers, and he’s actively investigating his options. ​“But it’s also crazy, because nobody knows what the rules are, due to FEOC and changes in safe harbor.”

“It’s very hard to make specific financial and investment plans in this environment,” he said. ​“We don’t think it’s going to change — we know it’s going to change.”

Looking for the sunny side

Arrayed against all these downsides are some glimmers of hope for rooftop solar, however, including its seemingly inexorable decline in cost. That’s true even in the U.S., where solar system costs remain stubbornly higher than in the rest of the world.

According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the cost of U.S. residential solar systems fell from an average of $8.60 to $2.70 per watt from 2010 to 2023, a 69% decline.

It’s now more affordable to install rooftop solar in large part because solar panels themselves have simply gotten much cheaper. While tariffs have bumped up U.S. prices in recent years, solar equipment costs now represent only a fraction of total installation costs.

Instead, it’s the ​“soft costs” — acquiring customers, designing systems to meet households’ needs, navigating lengthy permitting processes, securing utility interconnections, and offering long-term maintenance and operations support — that dictate the price tag of a system in the U.S. It’s in those areas that the industry will need to improve in order to make solar more affordable once tax credits disappear.

As Walker noted, state and local governments can be extremely helpful in driving down those costs. States have passed laws to streamline solar project permitting, and cities and counties have installed ​“instant permitting” software platforms that can dramatically cut wait times and administrative costs. Some utilities are starting to offer incentives to customers that enlist solar and battery systems in ​“virtual power plant” programs that reduce grid stresses and utility costs.

Rising utility rates themselves are also a counterweight to losing tax credits. The megabill’s cuts to clean energy incentives are expected to force utility rates upward by increasing the cost and restricting the expansion of solar, wind, and batteries, which make up the vast majority of new generation that can be added quickly to the grid, at a time of spiking demand for power from data centers, factories, and broader economic growth.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-909390490.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=5a178f105abf06a3a45d1cfd53738e8b,N,,2025-07-21 03:58:15.223987

The figure of 22GW was a 57% jump from the 14.2GW installed during the same period last year.

The new capacity includes 18.4GW of solar, 3.5GW of wind and 250MW of bioenergy, which is generated from plant and animal waste. This marks the country’s highest-ever addition in any six-month period.

Rystad Energy said the surge was largely driven by developers moving quickly to take advantage of the government’s Interstate Transmission System (ISTS) charge waiver, which begins at 25% and increases annually until full implementation by June 2028.

India is now inching closer to its goal of sourcing 50% of its installed power capacity from clean energy sources, with a total of 234GW in place, including large hydropower projects.

However, fossil fuels continue to dominate actual energy consumption in the country, accounting for around 75% of electricity generated in the first half of the year from coal, oil and gas-fired plants.

Additionally, nuclear power is beginning to play a larger role, with the commissioning of Unit 7 of the Rajasthan Atomic Power Project – a 700MW unit connected to the northern grid – and government approval for the country’s first small modular reactor (SMR) planned in the northern state of Bihar.

Rystad Energy’s vice president of renewables and power research Sushma Jaganath said: “India installed 22GW of renewable energy capacity in the first half of 2025, a new record. However, the country is still banking heavily on coal to meet growing power demand, with plans to install an additional 80GW of new thermal projects.

“India is not yet undergoing a true energy transition; instead, it is focusing on building up installed capacity from both conventional and renewable energy sources to ensure energy security.

“Without urgent action to improve affordability and sustainability, particularly through grid upgrades and energy storage, coal will remain central to electrification efforts, jeopardising progress toward India’s net-zero goals.”

While India’s renewable energy capacity more than doubled in the first half of the year, battery energy storage systems (BESS) also saw a significant uptick, with 5.4GW of collocated solar-BESS and 2.2GW of standalone BESS awarded to developers, marking the country’s highest battery storage allocation to date.",https://renews.biz/media/17249/suzlon-wind-farm-in-sogi-in-india-credit-suzlon.jpg?width=640,N,,2025-07-21 05:59:20.918226

Blaming “climate change” for fatalities while ignoring this fundamental fact is both irresponsible and misleading.

Below is a chart of Texas flash floods from 1996 to 2024 that show a DECLINE in these extreme weather events.
The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports it has “low confidence” climate change is impacting flooding and hedges its bets, noting low confidence in any detectable link between flooding trends and manmade climate change.","In the aftermath of the tragic Texas Hill Country flooding, a barrage of mainstream media outlets, including; CBS Texas “History warned of the Central Texas flood: Why the danger on the Guadalupe River wasn’t a surprise,” CNN “How climate change made Texas flooding more violent,” and San Antonio Current “Bill Nye the Science Guy calls for fossil fuel ban as death toll from Texas flood continues to rise,” have advanced the narrative that climate change is turning extreme weather and deadly floods into a “new normal.” These claims are wrong, misleading, and, frankly, do a disservice to public understanding of Texas flood risk. The historical and scientific record shows no significant trend toward more frequent or severe heat waves or floods in this region. The evidence instead points to a simple, unchanging fact: Floods have happened here for millennia, long before SUVs and coal fired power plants, and will continue as long as the Guadalupe River flows.

Perhaps the most absurd quote comes from the San Antonio Current, in which Bill Nye declares:

Other than installing early flood warning systems in flood-prone areas, Nye said the only way prevent similar tragedies in the future is for Congress to enact a total fossil fuel ban to curb the effects of climate change. He added that humans’ alterations to the climate have been scientifically proven to exacerbate flooding events.

Calling for the elimination of fossil fuels as the only solution to flooding on a river that’s been flooding since before the invention of the steamboat is not a scientific argument, but a political one.

Let’s be clear: flooding along the Guadalupe River is neither new nor “caused” by today’s climate. The very first line in the CBS Texas report actually gets it right: “Texas hydrologists working with the National Weather Service say they recognized the conditions last Thursday that could lead to catastrophic flooding on the Guadalupe River. And they say, based on past events, this kind of outcome was a known risk.”

The area’s own official safety guide states:

If you live in the Guadalupe River Basin, you also live in one of the three most dangerous regions in the U.S.A. for flash floods! Local residents and weather experts refer to the Texas Hill Country as ‘Flash Flood Alley,’ because heavy rainfall and runoff from creeks and streams can cause rapid rises and flooding in a matter of hours… The Guadalupe River experienced major floods in 1936, 1952, 1972, 1973, 1978, 1987, 1991 and 1997. Last year’s flood of October 1998 developed in a matter of hours, broke most existing records, exceeded the 100-year flood plain, and inundated areas that had never been flooded before. But floods are not predictable. They do not follow measured cycles.

The fact that the area has been previously named as “Flash Flood Alley,” complete with it’s own Wikipedia page, which states: “Flash Flood Alley is an area of Central Texas that is considered the most flash-flood prone region in the United States,” should negate any climate change claims about the most recent flood all by itself.

This is not a fossil-fuel problem, it’s a geography problem. Texas Hill Country’s steep terrain, rocky ground, and narrow riverbeds react rapidly to intense rain, making the region prone to sudden, severe flooding. The river has repeatedly exceeded historic flood levels even when atmospheric CO2 was much lower than it is today.

Let’s review the record—because, unlike much of the modern media, data matters more than opinion:

Major floods in the Guadalupe River Basin occurred all throughout the 20th century, well before the current era of supposed “climate crisis.”

The catastrophic October 1998 flood developed in just a few hours, broke most existing records, and exceeded the so-called 100-year flood plain, flooding areas “that had never been flooded before.” The official flood guide bluntly states, “Unfortunately, an even greater flood will occur sometime in the future.”

These events took place when global temperatures and atmospheric CO2 were lower than they are today.

The CBS Texas article actually provides a rare moment of candor:

The I-Team reviewed National Weather Service and historical crest records and found that the Guadalupe River has experienced major flooding more than a dozen times in the last century… The river in that area has been even higher four other times since tracking began, and it’s reached more than 25 feet on 15 other occasions.

Camp Mystic where many people died, and other riverside camp properties are built on a flood plain. As tragic as the deaths are, the decision to continue rebuilding and vacationing in a known, historic flood zone guarantees that people will remain at risk. Blaming “climate change” for fatalities while ignoring this fundamental fact is both irresponsible and misleading.

The CBS article quotes an unnamed Texas Severe Storms Association spokesperson who said:

“Campsites and homes in high-risk areas like the Hill Country should be relocated to higher ground and properties within the flood zone should be utilized only for day use.”

In other words, the tragedy is not about fossil fuels, it’s about ignoring land use history and basic floodplain management.

Another misleading narrative being pushed by media and pundits is the idea that deaths resulted from budget cuts at NOAA or the National Weather Service. Jason Johnson, a lead hydrologist at the NOAA West Gulf River Forecast Center in Fort Worth was also quoted in the CBS article, saying, “Despite the tragedy, Johnson said his team was staffed and ready. Forecasting models were in place. More scientists were on standby. ‘We had our best people on shift… everyone was utilized,’ he said.”

Clearly, no budget cuts affected staffing during this event.

Documents show the National Weather Service issued a Flash Flood Watch up to 10 hours before water swept through the campsites, followed by a Flash Flood Warning 3 hours ahead, giving ample time for action.

By 5:34 AM, the warning turned into a Flash Flood EMERGENCY: “A LARGE AND DEADLY FLOOD WAVE IS MOVING DOWN THE GUADALUPE.” “SEEK HIGHER GROUND NOW.” shown in NWS bulletins. Campers and families were directly named in the alert:

Timely and direct warnings were issued, and it is a tragedy that people along the river either didn’t receive them, or if they did, ignored them.

The official “Staying Safe” flood guide for the Guadalupe River underscores the importance of personal responsibility:

Despite these staggering losses, more damage was prevented and lives were saved because the initial flooding occurred during daylight hours and because people listened to warnings from their local emergency management and law enforcement officials… It should also convince you that the Guadalupe Basin rivers will flood again.

Contrary to the dire claims of Bill Nye and the CNN report, data from climate agencies and historical records show no increasing trend in heat waves or flooding for Texas or the United States as a whole. NOAA’s own records indicate that the frequency of major floods nationwide peaked in the early 20th century and has not increased in recent decades. If climate change had any role in causing or exacerbating the rainfall, it should be apparent in the rainfall and flooding history of the area. Below is a chart of Texas flash floods from 1996 to 2024 that show a DECLINE in these extreme weather events.

Recent peer-reviewed studies have found no increase in the global frequency or intensity of floods, despite higher CO2 levels. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports it has “low confidence” climate change is impacting flooding and hedges its bets, noting low confidence in any detectable link between flooding trends and manmade climate change. For further reading, see comprehensive analysis at Climate At A Glance: Floods.

The real danger is that media and activist “science communicators” use every tragedy to promote costly, irrelevant policy agendas like Bill Nye’s call for a total fossil fuel ban, which would devastate the Texas economy, cripple energy reliability, and do nothing to prevent flash floods in the Hill Country. The history of the region is written in water, not carbon dioxide.

Facts say this was a natural event that has happened before and the facts remain unchanged; floods have always been part of life in Texas Hill Country and always will be. The real solution is to heed warnings, avoid rebuilding in known flood zones, and resist the urge to politicize every natural disaster as proof of “climate crisis.” If history tells us anything, it’s that ignoring the lessons of the past is a far greater danger than any supposed climate tipping point. It is shameful that Bill Nye and CNN promoted baseless and false rhetoric to gain political points.

With nitrogen-fixing roots, lupin and aardaker can reduce the need for synthetic fertilisers, further contributing to environmental sustainability.

“With REAP2SOW, we want to do more than just replace meat,” says project leader Wouter Kohlen. “We want to grow a food system that is better for people, nature and farmers – and that fits well within Dutch landscapes. The project therefore goes beyond farming alone. We also look at how consumers adopt new products and how schools and citizens can get involved through field trials, taste testing and educational programmes. In addition, we are working on policy and business models to make sustainable cultivation more attractive.”

Contribution to Climate Goals

Through the protein transition, the Netherlands aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions, restore biodiversity, and reduce reliance on imported soy. REAP2SOW advances these national and EU goals for a more sustainable food system, according to a press release.

The project involves Wageningen University & Research alongside the universities of Groningen, Leiden, Twente, Utrecht, and the Jan IngenHousz Institute. It also brings together breeding and cultivation companies like Aardaia, Radicle Crops, and Lekker Lupine, as well as the growers’ association LLTB and the Dutch national sports centre Papendal.

Funded by the Dutch Research Agenda

REAP2SOW is one of fourteen consortia awarded funding this year through the Research along Routes by Consortia (ORC) programme of the Dutch Research Agenda (NWA). Each consortium receives about €6.8 million to immediately launch research and collaboration with knowledge institutions and societal partners, aiming to generate both scientific and societal impact.",https://seedworld.com/cdn/wp-content/uploads/20250707014335/lupine-5236103_1280.jpg,N,,2025-07-21 03:58:38.161061

Across ASEAN, governments are already demonstrating that rapid clean energy deployment is possible under promising conditions.
Singapore’s growing role in catalyzing international investments for ASEAN’s energy ecosystem may help narrow this gap.
ASEAN still lacks harmonized rules for renewable energy certificates, emissions factors, and carbon accounting.","“We’re baking bread in a dirty oven inside an enclosed room,” reflected Finian Lim, who leads public affairs at Trinasolar Asia Pacific. The main ingredients for solar energy – technology and capital – are already in place, he said. But in the absence of the right policy conditions, we might suffocate before we get to eat.

Lim’s metaphor, shared this week during a PRCA Asia Pacific webinar on ASEAN’s energy transition, captures the challenge the region now faces.

Southeast Asia stands at an important point in its energy transition. Electricity demand across the ASEAN bloc is projected to grow by 30 percent by 2030, fueled by expanding urban populations, rising incomes, and increased digitalization.

Across ASEAN, governments are already demonstrating that rapid clean energy deployment is possible under promising conditions.

Take Vietnam, which in 2020 became the third-largest solar market in the world, installing more than 17GW of capacity, far surpassing its 2025 targets. The growth was based on government subsidies, supplemented by a coherent feed-in tariff policy, clear timelines, and an open posture toward private capital.

Indonesia and Vietnam have struck multibillion-dollar Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) with G-7 nations and multilateral lenders. These frameworks aim to accelerate coal phaseout and unlock renewable projects through concessional financing and capacity-building.

Even Singapore, constrained in terms of land and natural resources, has positioned itself as a green finance and technology hub, introducing regional taxonomies – official definitions of what economic activities are “green” or sustainable – and disclosure frameworks, to attract and direct both Singaporean and foreign funds into regional climate-aligned investments across ASEAN. In 2023, the region attracted just $32 to $40 billion in clean energy investment, far below the funds required (estimated at between $150 to $200 billion annually). Singapore’s growing role in catalyzing international investments for ASEAN’s energy ecosystem may help narrow this gap.

On the technology front, the tools needed to decarbonize are no longer speculative. Smart microgrids – combining solar generation, battery storage, and digital control systems – are already being deployed in off-grid communities across Indonesia and Malaysia. In parallel, Singapore-founded digital services firm Temus has co-developed an environmental intelligence platform that integrates AI, sensors, and data to enhance visibility into carbon stocks, biodiversity, and land use. These digital platforms are helping to monetize natural capital and support more sustainable investment decisions in resource-rich geographies like Indonesia.

AI-enabled energy management systems (EMS) are also increasingly critical for optimizing grid operations, allowing real-time balancing of supply and demand. Without such dynamic optimization, ASEAN could face systemic disruptions, similar to the brown-outs in Spain during its 2021 solar surge or California’s rolling blackouts in 2020, where mismatches between generation and demand overwhelmed grid stability. Thailand’s Provincial Electricity Authority, for example, has deployed EMS pilots that reportedly reduced peak loads by as much as 8 percent.

Meanwhile, modular solar and battery energy storage systems are proving their viability in archipelagic states. In the Maldives, an Asian Development Bank-backed project has delivered solar and storage systems across more than 160 islands, slashing diesel dependency and saving millions annually in fuel costs.

On top of being proven and commercially viable, the cost of solar PV and battery storage has dropped by more than 80 percent and 70 percent, respectively, over the past decade. What’s now required is the policy infrastructure to scale their deployment across the region.

In 2022, Singapore began importing renewable energy through the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS-PIP), marking the first time clean electricity generated in Laos was transmitted across three borders and consumed in Singapore.

Technically, LTMS-PIP worked. But the underlying policy architecture has not kept pace. ASEAN still lacks harmonized rules for renewable energy certificates, emissions factors, and carbon accounting. Without regulatory coherence, electricity may flow, but markets won’t move.

For instance, the ASEAN Power Grid was first conceived and formally articulated in 1997 to integrate national grids into a single regional network, enabling large-scale cross-border renewable trade. But progress has been uneven, hindered by slow policy alignment and fragmented bilateral arrangements. At its core, ASEAN’s institutional model, which is built on consensus decision-making, makes regulatory convergence a slow and complex process.

To fill the gap, some nations have turned to “minilateralism”: smaller, interest-aligned groupings aimed at specific challenges. LTMS-PIP is a prime example. This was not launched under ASEAN’s formal architecture; it was a bilateral deal (Singapore-Malaysia) with Thailand and Laos serving as transit points, which worked because it was pragmatic and narrowly scoped.

That said, even promising approaches like minilateralism have their limits. Geopolitical divisions within the region continue to complicate the broader multilateral cooperation needed to scale and replicate these solutions across ASEAN. Longstanding disputes, from Mekong River water-sharing issues to overlapping claims in the South China Sea, risk eroding trust and slowing cross-border infrastructure alignment.

Domestic obstacles remain just as pressing. Many ASEAN countries still operate with outdated grid infrastructure, ill-equipped to absorb the variability of solar and wind power at scale. More than 3.4 million households across the region remain without access to electricity, and clean cooking solutions elude nearly 167 million people, according to the International Energy Agency.

In addition to requiring technology and financing alone, energy transitions also require broad-based legitimacy. This is where public affairs plays a critical role. As Lim put it during last week’s conference, ASEAN’s clean energy future will depend on “connectors, navigators, and advocates.” Solar energy, for example, gains legitimacy not just when it delivers power, but when citizens understand how it lowers long-term energy costs, reduces emissions, and supports local employment.",https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2024-04-04-042125.jpg,N,,2025-07-21 03:00:00.917577

As he transitions into his new role as chairman of the Williams Companies, Alan Armstrong is emphasizing both the company’s deep Oklahoma roots and its growing national role in meeting future energy demands.

“We are, today, I think, the largest public company in Oklahoma,” Armstrong said in an interview with Scott Mitchell. “A lot of the culture that we have and the focus we have on making Tulsa home really started with Joe and John Williams.”

Armstrong credited John Williams with setting a long-term vision that prioritized not only business success but community impact. “He really set a culture that was focused not just on being a great company, but also being a great corporate citizen,” he said.

Pipeline politics in the Northeast create gridlock

While Williams has long been based in Oklahoma, Armstrong said the company is often better known in other parts of the country, especially in states where energy infrastructure is controversial.

“We were trying to gain support for the Constitution pipeline, which primarily would help New England states and reduce their dependence on fuel oil and imported LNG,” he said. “But the governor of Massachusetts told me, ‘We don’t really want your natural gas… we want to invest in higher technology, resources for our future.’”

RELATED: Williams Companies chairman says pipeline projects critical to lowering energy costs in U.S. markets

Armstrong said that the same region is now calling for help. “I got a call from the governor of Connecticut... and [they] wanted to know why we’re unwilling to build pipeline capacity into the New England states,” Armstrong said.

Armstrong added that trucking LNG into New York City has become the norm, which he called “pretty remarkable.” Armstrong said roughly 250 to 500 trucks operate during winter just to deliver gas across bridges into the metro area. “There’s politics, and then there’s real physics,” he said. “And the real physics are hard to hide from.”

Data centers pushing demand for faster energy solutions

Armstrong said the demand from data centers is skyrocketing and will double by 2030. “That’s the entire metro area of Philadelphia, Armstrong said. ""We're going to have multiple sites that are that scale.""

To meet that need, Williams is moving quickly to deploy Caterpillar and Siemens gas turbine units in Ohio and elsewhere.

“We're doing several, 200 to 400 megawatt facilities that were placing those kinds of turbines and gas-fired generation facilities,” Armstrong said. “If you have multiple units, you actually can improve the reliability.”

Armstrong said speed is now the most important factor, alongside reliability.

Grassroots advocacy and local impact

To combat infrastructure opposition, Armstrong said Williams has changed how it approaches community and political challenges.

“We're a company full of engineers. And so, you know, we always solve things, from a technical perspective,” Armstrong said. “We weren’t very skilled at solving political problems.”

Now, the company engages directly with unions, community members, and conservation groups.

“We've encouraged them to bring their own voice to these issues because it's jobs that they're having stolen from them,” Armstrong said. “They get that if you constrain power, the price goes up.”

Armstrong also emphasized economic development. “In Pennsylvania, this might mean your kids stay home,"" Armstrong said. ""The ad valorem taxes that we pay that the industry paid is going to go directly into your school district.”

Environmentally, Armstrong said Williams is investing in restoration efforts alongside pipeline development.

Oklahoma’s strategy and energy future

Armstrong praised Governor Kevin Stitt’s “all of the above” energy strategy and called out misinformation campaigns that pit energy sources against each other.

“Natural gas, coupled with renewables, can meet the challenge,” Armstrong said. “But poor decisions on infrastructure are what’s driving high prices, not gas costs.”

Armstrong said Oklahoma can serve as a model. “If you gave everybody all the power they needed right now, you’d still need more in 24 hours,” he said.

China currently dominates the global graphite market, especially in processing capacity, which creates a strategic vulnerability for the US, particularly as graphite is essential for EV battery production.
Tariffs impact on the EV industry The tariffs will significantly increase the cost of EV battery cells, potentially adding hundreds of dollars to the cost of an average EV battery pack.
Battery manufacturers, many of whom heavily rely on Chinese graphite, will face immediate challenges in securing alternative sources.","The United States is imposing significant tariffs on Chinese graphite, particularly anode-grade graphite used in electric vehicle (EV) batteries.

The primary reason for the latest tariffs (a preliminary 93.5% anti-dumping duty announced in July 2025) is the finding by the US Commerce Department that Chinese graphite is being sold in the US at prices below fair market value. This “dumping” is alleged to be harmful to domestic US graphite producers. Additionally, separate investigations have found that Chinese graphite producers receive unfair government subsidies, leading to countervailing duties.

The US aims to reduce its heavy dependence on China for critical minerals like graphite. China currently dominates the global graphite market, especially in processing capacity, which creates a strategic vulnerability for the US, particularly as graphite is essential for EV battery production. These tariffs are part of a broader strategy by the Biden administration (and continued under the Trump administration) to diversify critical mineral supply chains and bolster domestic manufacturing for the clean energy transition.

The tariffs are a direct response to complaints from a coalition of US manufacturers, the “American Active Anode Material Producers,” who argue that cheap Chinese imports make it difficult for American businesses to compete and grow. The goal is to level the playing field and encourage investment in US-based graphite mining and processing.

By imposing tariffs, the US is attempting to counter China’s significant influence over global EV development and pricing, which stems from its control over the graphite supply chain. This move signals a strategic intent to foster an “ex-China” supply chain for critical minerals.

Tariffs impact on the EV industry

The tariffs will significantly increase the cost of EV battery cells, potentially adding hundreds of dollars to the cost of an average EV battery pack. This could either be absorbed by manufacturers (reducing profits) or passed on to consumers (making EVs more expensive).

Battery manufacturers, many of whom heavily rely on Chinese graphite, will face immediate challenges in securing alternative sources. Qualifying new graphite suppliers can take 12-18 months of rigorous testing, making rapid shifts impractical in the short term.

While challenging in the short term, the tariffs are intended to accelerate investment and development in domestic US and allied-country graphite production. Companies in North America, Australia, and South Korea, for example, are seeing increased interest and investment as potential beneficiaries of this shift.

The tariffs are another escalation in the trade tensions between the US and China, coming amidst similar actions on other critical minerals and technologies.

In essence, the US is imposing these tariffs to address perceived unfair trade practices by China, reduce its strategic dependence on Chinese critical minerals, and foster a more resilient domestic supply chain for EV battery components.

The lender plans to provide debt and equity funding as well as risk guarantees and insurance for the $5 billion Mphanda Nkuwa plant on the Zambezi river and an associated $1.4 billion power transmission project, World Bank President Ajay Banga said in an interview in Mozambique.

“We want to be the hub of energy in our region, the Southern African Development Community,” Daniel Chapo, Mozambique’s president, told Bloomberg. He was referring to a bloc of 16 countries, many of which already import power from the southeast African country.

The 1,500 megawatt dam, which Banga said may be operational by about 2031, is one plank in a program backed by the World Bank known as Mission 300. The aim is to provide power connections to 300 million people in sub-Saharan Africa by 2030, significantly increasing access in a region where more than 80% of the world’s 680 million people without the energy source live.

Together with the African Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund and private sector investment, the program may see more than $100 billion of funding, Banga estimated.

Public, Private

Mphanda Nkuwa is being built by a consortium consisting of Electricite de France SA, TotalEnergies SE and Sumitomo Corp. The Mozambican government and its Hidroeléctrica de Cahora Bassa company will hold stakes.

The World Bank, through its International Finance Corp. unit, plans to provide some debt funding for the dam as well as take a stake in it. Its International Bank for Reconstruction and Development will likely offer risk guarantees, while its International Development Association will provide concessional financing for the 1,300 kilometers (808 miles) of transmission lines and its Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency political risk insurance.

The transmission lines will be built with credit extended to the government.

Mphanda Nkuwa lies downstream of Cahora Bassa, which at 2,075 MW, was the last comparable hydro-project built in southern Africa. It was completed in 1974 during the dying days of Portugal’s colonial rule of Mozambique, which ended the following year.

To this day about 60% of its power flows directly to South Africa, a far more industrialized nation, through purpose built lines, reflecting its colonial model.

Mphanda Nkuwa will have transmission lines connecting it to a southern grid, one of three isolated grids in Mozambique, so that it can supply the region including the capital of Maputo. It will also be able to sell excess power to nearby countries such as Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe.

A new design being finalized will reduce its reservoir size to a tiny fraction of that of Cahora Bassa, which covers almost 3,000 square kilometers (1,158 square miles) and Kariba, a reservoir further upstream on the Zambezi, located on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. At more than 5,000 square kilometers Kariba has the largest volume in the world of any man-made water-body. The intention is to reduce Mphanda Nkuwa’s impact on communities and the environment.

It’s the first step in what both Banga and Chapo described as a five-to-10 year plan to boost electricity production by adding smaller power plants of 400 MW and 200 MW upstream, expanding Cahora Bassa by more than 50% and developing a 400 megawatt solar plant close by. Support for some of that may be included in a new five-year country partnership framework that the World Bank is working on for Mozambique.

The intention, in addition to boosting power export revenue from the $240 million attained last year, is to spur local processing of minerals mined in Mozambique such as graphite and beryllium, and accelerate the rollout of electricity connections to citizens. Of the country’s 33 million people, 64% are now connected to electricity, about twice as many as in 2018.

The World Bank’s backing for the project comes as Mozambique struggles to recover from the shock to investor confidence last year after hundreds of people died in violence following disputed elections.

With a median age of about 18 the country, which has been ruled by Chapo’s Frelimo party since independence, is also struggling with youth unemployment and a separate Jihadist insurgency in the far north that has slowed $57 billion of liquefied natural gas projects. If implemented, those could transform the economy of one of the world’s poorest nations.

“Working with instability and trying to find a way to help them become stable and developed is what our task is,” Banga said. “If a country was stable, they would probably not need us.”

Conclusion L&T's strategic expansion into green hydrogen is more than a corporate initiative; it is a cornerstone of India's clean energy transition.","In the race to decarbonize global economies, India's green hydrogen revolution has emerged as a pivotal battleground. At the forefront of this transition stands Larsen & Toubro (L&T), a conglomerate leveraging its engineering prowess and strategic foresight to build an integrated green hydrogen ecosystem. With India targeting 5 million metric tons (MMT) of green hydrogen production annually by 2030, L&T's investments in infrastructure, partnerships, and innovation position it as a linchpin in the nation's energy transformation.

A Vision Aligned with National Ambitions

L&T's foray into green hydrogen began in 2024 with the establishment of dedicated subsidiaries—Panipat Green Hydrogen Pvt Ltd and L&T Green Energy Kandla Pvt Ltd—to drive green hydrogen and ammonia projects. These entities are not mere extensions of the company's traditional engineering capabilities but are designed to anchor India's transition to a low-carbon economy. The Kandla project in Gujarat, for instance, is a testament to L&T's commitment to scalable solutions. Securing land in a region with abundant renewable energy potential, the project aligns with India's National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM), which aims to make the country a global green hydrogen hub.

L&T's Hazira plant, operational since 2025, already demonstrates the company's technical acumen. Equipped with an 800 kW electrolyser (combining alkaline and PEM technologies) and a 990kW rooftop solar array, the plant produces 15 tonnes of high-purity hydrogen annually. Plans for a 400 kW PEM electrolyser expansion will double output to 30 tonnes, underscoring L&T's capacity to scale. This infrastructure not only supports internal decarbonization—such as hydrogen blending with natural gas for captive consumption—but also positions the company to supply green hydrogen to industrial clusters and export markets.

Strategic Partnerships and Policy Synergy

L&T's growth trajectory is bolstered by partnerships that amplify its technological and operational reach. In March 2025, its subsidiary L&T Energy GreenTech signed an MoU with John Cockerill to explore concentrated solar power and thermal energy storage, addressing the intermittency challenges of renewable energy. Additionally, L&T's U.S. approval for small modular reactor (SMR) technology transfer—a rare achievement for Indian firms—opens avenues for hybrid energy systems that could stabilize green hydrogen production.

India's policy framework, including the SIGHT program and ₹2.39 billion in budgetary allocations for green hydrogen, creates a fertile ground for L&T's initiatives. The government's exemption of inter-state transmission charges for green hydrogen plants and open access to the grid further reduce operational costs, enhancing the financial viability of L&T's projects. These incentives are critical, given the sector's capital-intensive nature and long gestation periods.

Competitive Landscape and Risk Mitigation

While L&T's ambitions are formidable, it faces stiff competition from industry giants like Reliance Industries, Adani Green Energy, and Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL). Reliance's 3 GW green hydrogen project in Gujarat and IOCL's 10,000-tonne-per-annum plant at Panipat highlight the scale of rival investments. However, L&T's edge lies in its integrated ecosystem: from electrolyser manufacturing to EPC execution, the company controls critical value-chain segments. This vertical integration reduces reliance on external suppliers and ensures cost efficiency—a key differentiator in a sector where electrolyser prices remain volatile.

Risks, however, are inherent. High capital expenditures, regulatory uncertainties, and technological bottlenecks could delay timelines or inflate costs. For example, the cost of renewable energy and electrolyser technology must decline further to make green hydrogen economically competitive with grey hydrogen. L&T's focus on indigenous electrolyser development, aligned with India's Make in India initiative, mitigates import dependency and could lower production costs over time.

Financial Viability and Market Projections

L&T's green hydrogen ventures are not just strategic but financially robust. The company secured a landmark ₹22.39 billion incentive under the NGHM's second tender in 2025, with a 90,000-tonne-per-annum allocation. This revenue stream, coupled with its ₹397-per-kg bid for the Panipat refinery project (outbidding NTPC and Renew E Fuels), underscores its pricing discipline and operational efficiency.

The India Green Hydrogen Market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 20.76% from 2025 to 2030, driven by rising demand from sectors like steel, cement, and transportation. L&T's alignment with these growth vectors—particularly through green ammonia exports to the EU and Japan—positions it to capitalize on global decarbonization trends.

Investment Outlook: A Long-Term Play

For investors, L&T's green hydrogen strategy represents a long-term bet on India's energy transition. While the sector is nascent, the company's first-mover advantage, government support, and integrated approach reduce execution risks. L&T's carbon neutrality target by 2040 and water neutrality by 2035 further align with ESG trends, enhancing its appeal to institutional investors.

However, patience is key. Green hydrogen projects require 3–5 years to reach commercial viability, and returns will materialize gradually. Investors should monitor L&T's project milestones, such as the Kandla plant's commissioning and electrolyser manufacturing capacity. Additionally, tracking India's policy developments—such as adjustments to the SIGHT program or global carbon pricing mechanisms—will provide insights into the sector's trajectory.

Conclusion

L&T's strategic expansion into green hydrogen is more than a corporate initiative; it is a cornerstone of India's clean energy transition. By combining technical expertise, policy agility, and financial discipline, the company is poised to lead the green hydrogen revolution. For investors seeking exposure to the decarbonization megatrend, L&T offers a compelling case—though one that demands a long-term horizon and a tolerance for sector-specific risks. As the world pivots toward hydrogen-based economies, L&T's integrated ecosystem may well define the future of sustainable energy in India.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-21 04:58:33.074972

Fraunhofer ISE stated that the researchers optimized the design and improved the quality of the solar cell absorber material to achieve high efficiencies, even in low-light conditions of 100 lux.

This result makes this technology particularly attractive for autonomous Internet of Things applications that operate indoors without an external wired power supply. The findings were published in the journal Applied Physics Letters.

The type III-V compound semiconductors possess versatile properties, including a direct bandgap, higher carrier mobility, and a smaller effective electron mass. Such attributes make them attractive for applications in solid-state lighting, wireless communication, artificial intelligence, high-speed trains, clean energy generation, and radar systems.

Henning Helmers, Head of Department at Fraunhofer ISE, said, “Solar cells based on III-V semiconductors reach the highest efficiencies; this especially applies to artificial light.”

The researchers optimized gallium-indium phosphide (GaInP) solar cells, as their band gap is almost ideal for converting visible light into electricity.

The researchers found that the n-doped GaInP cell performs significantly better than the p-doped cell. Charge carriers in n-doped GaInP cells have a longer lifetime, and thus they can produce more electricity even under weak light. This enabled them to achieve very high efficiencies in experiments when converting weak indoor light into usable power.

In May this year, scientists at Fraunhofer ISE claimed to have produced silicon heterojunction solar cells with a total silver consumption of 1.4 mg per watt of peak power.

As electricity demand surges, and older generation sources are retiring faster than new ones come online, officials are grappling with how to manage grid reliability, infrastructure needs and local and environmental concerns — while exploring policies that strike a balance between supporting smart growth and protecting consumers.

The issue has industry experts divided with some voicing concerns about family sustaining jobs and environmental impact, and others believing an affordable, safe and reliable energy future is attainable.

There are 88 data centers across the commonwealth, according to Data Center Maps, and their database does not include private, government or institutional facilities. Of those listed, 35 are located near Pittsburgh and 31 near Philadelphia.

A growing trend is co-locating data centers with onsite energy generation, thereby producing their own electricity and potentially sending surplus power back to the grid. The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, or PUC, is considering making this a requirement, along with covering the cost of infrastructure upgrades, as it develops a model tariff.

Currently, the nuclear-powered Amazon Susquehanna campus is the only operational example of this in Pennsylvania, while two others — Homer City Energy Campus (natural gas) and Beaver Valley (nuclear) — are under development.

Co-located generation is nothing new, says Lehigh Valley engineer and IEEE Standards Association member James Daley.

Daley told The Center Square that the demands of large data centers are comparable to major industrial complexes the grid has historically served — like Bethlehem Steel, for example.

Built in the late 1800s, Bethlehem Steel’s furnaces were primarily powered by steam engines fueled by coal. By the 1910s, they began drawing electricity from local utilities, but as demand increased, dedicated substations and new grid connections were added — costs that the company helped cover. To further reduce demand on the public grid, they eventually built on-site power plants.

Co-located generation is one way to resolve energy demand issues while protecting existing ratepayers, Daley said. Other options include serving the facilities from transmission or sub transmission stations, and the use of nuclear power.

Installing on-site Combined Heat and Power, or CHP systems, or combined cycle power plants can also help offset the energy needed for equipment cooling.

“Diligence and oversight of proposed projects require multiple input sources — not the least of which is the PUC,” Daley said.

Rest assured, he added, locating and powering an IT Center poses no different challenge than large-scale projects successfully handled over the past century. “The PUC makes sure rate payers are not unfairly charged for grid alterations that do not benefit them directly.”

The mix of energy sources is crucial to grid reliability, which Daley says needs to be 24/7, “and you can’t do that with renewables.”

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, or EIA, in 2023, 60% of electricity generated was from fossil fuels — natural gas, coal, and petroleum. Additionally, 19% came from nuclear, and renewable energy sources accounted for approximately 21%.

He noted the lower capacity ratings of renewable energy sources compared to those of fossil fuels, citing figures from the U.S. Department of Energy.

The capacity rating for nuclear is 92.3%, followed by geothermal (65%), natural gas combined cycle (59.9%), and coal (42.6%). Hydro and wind are rated at around 34%, while solar and natural gas simple cycle are 23.4% and 17.2% respectively.

Daley’s comments are supported by a 2024 report by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC, warning that the substitution of intermittent renewable energy for baseload 24/7 power has made the nation’s electric grids less resilient, less secure, and less reliable.

“These centers,” he said, “are a good industry for any town that wants to host them, because they’re excellent tax revenue sources with minimum impact on the community, and can be excellent corporate neighbors.”",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.altoonamirror.com/images/2016/10/18173137/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-07-21 01:19:34.473924

Key outcomes from the 2025 China-Australia Leaders’ Meeting

The Joint Outcomes Statement, issued following Prime Minister Albanese’s talks with Premier Li Qiang, reaffirmed both governments’ commitment to stable and constructive engagement. Key outcomes spanned trade, investment, people-to-people links, and multilateral cooperation. Highlights include:

Trade and economic cooperation

Economic engagement once again served as a cornerstone of bilateral relations. During the visit, both sides reached a series of new agreements and reaffirmed commitments under the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA). According to the official joint outcomes statement:

Trade access: Both governments committed to deepening cooperation in customs procedures, quarantine and inspection, and resolving trade impediments through dialogue, including via the WTO where needed.

Agriculture: Australia and China agreed to enhance market access for agricultural and seafood products, with faster risk assessments and streamlined import approvals.

Investment facilitation: The two sides welcomed increased two-way investment in renewable energy, resources, and manufacturing, and expressed interest in cooperating on industrial innovation and green technology.

Digital trade and e-commerce: China and Australia agreed to expand cooperation in cross-border e-commerce, blockchain, digital payment infrastructure, and data governance frameworks.

Green economy and ‘green iron’: Discussions also focused on new collaboration opportunities in clean energy—especially solar, wind, and green hydrogen—as well as “green iron” technologies. Australia’s Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) and other players expressed readiness to meet China’s rising demand for low-carbon iron ore products.

These developments point to a maturing economic partnership—one increasingly oriented toward emerging sectors like artificial intelligence, digital transformation, and climate-friendly industrial transition.

Strengthening people-to-people ties and tourism

In a boost to bilateral exchanges, the two countries committed to deepening cultural, education, and tourism linkages. With China now offering visa-free entry for Australian citizens and Australia providing five-year multiple-entry visas—and up to 10 years in some cases—for Chinese tourists, travel between the two countries has seen a strong rebound.

Notably, Chinese tourists spent A$9.2 billion in Australia in the 12 months ending March 2025, accounting for about one-quarter of total spending by short-term international visitors. Payment convenience has also improved, with increasing adoption of UnionPay, Alipay, and WeChat Pay among Australian merchants, further enhancing the tourist experience.

Political dialogue and multilateral cooperation

Albanese’s visit also highlighted a renewed willingness to manage differences and engage in open, regular dialogue. Both sides reaffirmed support for the rules-based international order, regional peace, and multilateral cooperation. China and Australia, as key members of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and APEC, pledged to work together to restore confidence in multilateral trade systems, promote regional integration, and address global challenges such as climate change and digital governance.

In his concluding remarks, Albanese emphasized that the two countries “may not always agree, but dialogue and engagement are vital,” reiterating Australia’s intention to work with China on the basis of mutual respect, shared interests, and practical outcomes.

Emerging business opportunities: More than traditional trade

While the Australia-China trade relationship has historically been dominated by commodities—iron ore, LNG, and agricultural products—this visit marked a pivot toward future-oriented sectors. Discussions and agreements hinted at a broadening commercial horizon.

The 2025 leaders’ meeting highlighted artificial intelligence (AI), healthcare innovation, and the digital economy as key areas for bilateral collaboration. These sectors not only align with each country’s national development priorities but also offer high-value-added, scalable opportunities for joint ventures, research, and technology transfer.

Green energy and green minerals

Clean energy and decarbonization featured prominently in bilateral discussions, with both countries expressing interest in scaling up cooperation in green hydrogen, solar, wind power, and low-emission materials. One standout area was green iron—iron ore processed with renewable energy—where Australian firms such as Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) signaled their readiness to meet China’s rising demand for low-carbon steel inputs. This creates meaningful new market segments for Australian miners and energy producers seeking to align their operations with global sustainability standards.

For Australian businesses, this cooperation presents a clear opportunity to move up the value chain, especially by integrating renewable energy into resource extraction and processing. Companies operating in clean tech, project development, or green infrastructure stand to benefit from co-investment opportunities, technology partnerships, and a broader policy alignment around net-zero targets. As China looks to diversify its sources of green materials and scale its climate transition, Australia is well-positioned to serve as a stable, transparent, and resource-rich partner.

Artificial intelligence: Joint innovation platforms

AI is emerging as a strategic priority for both countries, not just in commercial applications but also in regulation and ethics. During the visit, both sides explored establishing joint university–industry research labs, particularly in areas such as autonomous driving, predictive analytics, and intelligent resource management. Given Australia’s strengths in applied research and domain-specific expertise—especially in mining, agriculture, and logistics—there is a strong basis for complementary AI collaboration with China, which leads in platform development and digital infrastructure.

For Australian technology firms, this opens the door to accessing larger datasets, testing AI solutions at scale, and partnering with Chinese developers or investors to bring innovations to market. There is also growing value in engaging China in regulatory and standards-setting dialogues, particularly in ethical AI and data governance. Doing so not only improves compatibility with future Chinese regulations but also positions Australian businesses as trusted, globally minded innovators capable of operating in complex international environments.

Healthcare and biopharma: Joint R&D and market access

The healthcare and biopharmaceutical sectors were identified as high-potential areas for collaboration, with both sides acknowledging shared demographic challenges and growing demand for medical innovation. Opportunities highlighted included joint drug development, clinical trial cooperation, and regulatory alignment—especially in cutting-edge fields like oncology, immunotherapy, and personalized medicine. Australia’s strengths in clinical rigor, medical research, and intellectual property protection align well with China’s large patient base and manufacturing capacity.

For Australian biotech firms, this represents a chance to accelerate R&D pipelines, enter new patient markets, and scale manufacturing through Chinese partnerships. Companies can benefit from faster trial recruitment, cost-efficient production, and expanded distribution channels, especially as both countries work to harmonize regulatory processes. By localizing elements of production or forming joint ventures, Australian medical innovations can gain deeper penetration in the Chinese market while retaining global competitiveness.

Future outlook: Toward a pragmatic and resilient partnership

Prime Minister Albanese’s 2025 visit to China came at a symbolic and strategic juncture, marking the beginning of the second decade of the China–Australia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, first established in 2014. The visit built on the momentum from his historic 2023 trip, which effectively ended a seven-year diplomatic freeze and signaled a reset in bilateral relations.

The 2023 visit was widely interpreted as a course correction from the previous Morrison government’s more confrontational China policy. By re-engaging Beijing through constructive dialogue in 2025, Albanese reaffirmed Canberra’s commitment to stabilizing ties, anchored primarily in resilient economic interdependence. Trade, often described as the “ballast” of the relationship, once again proved to be a powerful stabilizer.

Albanese’s itinerary during the 2025 visit underscored a broader strategic intent. By choosing to visit Chengdu in addition to Beijing and Shanghai, he broke with the traditional mold of Australian prime ministerial visits, which typically focus on China’s political and commercial centers. This signaled Australia’s interest in tapping into China’s dynamic inland provinces and expanding engagement beyond the coastal megacities.

China has remained Australia’s largest trading partner for 16 consecutive years, accounting for nearly one-third of Australia’s total trade. According to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, two-way trade reached almost A$312 billion in 2024. Since the implementation of the ChAFTA in 2015, bilateral trade has seen remarkable growth, despite political headwinds.

Australia’s exports to China remain concentrated in iron ore, energy, and agricultural goods, including beef, wine, and seafood. In return, Chinese exports to Australia—such as electric vehicles, consumer electronics, and household goods—continue to gain popularity due to competitive pricing and quality. This complementary structure has allowed economic ties to deepen even during periods of political strain.

Looking ahead, the second decade of the China–Australia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership may be shaped not only by economic complementarity but also by both countries’ shared support for multilateralism, climate action, and regional integration. While challenges remain, the path forward appears more open and more grounded in mutual interests.

The Bolingbroke Technology Campus would span 900 acres of mostly undeveloped land near Exit 15 along I-475 and Highway 41 South. The project calls for nine buildings totaling approximately 5.4 million square feet — equivalent to 26 Walmart Supercenters, according to neighbors.

Idus Smith lives just 75 yards from the proposed site with his wife, Chery. The couple built their home in the area and said the data center would make their property uninhabitable.

""Well, the size of this thing is like five million square feet. That's equal to like 26 Walmart superstores and it's going to be 75 yards from my house,"" Idus Smith said.

The Smiths visited a similar data center in Covington and measured noise levels at 70 decibels from 200 yards away. They worry hundreds of backup generators at the Bolingbroke facility would create constant noise pollution.

""Personally, I think it's going to be something that's massive noise producing, constant noise producing,"" Chery Smith said. ""Possibly polluting our air and the water and it's mostly an industrial type thing, not for residences, and it would disrupt a lot of our lifestyle and make it unbearable with where we live now.""

Environmental Concerns

Neighbor Margo Kenirey has lived on Wadley Road for 10 years after moving to Georgia from New Jersey three decades ago. She describes her street as a tight-knit community of eight houses where neighbors help each other and runners from the community use the quiet road.

""It really ruins that bucolic rural feeling that all of us enjoy here on this road,"" Kenirey said.

Kenirey has researched the environmental impact and identified six endangered, near-endangered or protected species that would be affected by the development. She said the project conflicts with Monroe County's future land use plan, which designates the area for agricultural or forestry use rather than commercial development.

The project would require clearing 900 acres of woodland and constructing parking areas and roadways. Kenirey said construction alone would last approximately eight years across three phases, bringing bulldozers, backhoes and other heavy equipment.

""There really is truly noise that's going to be produced not just from the data center while it goes into the production stage, but the construction stage,"" she said.

Economic Benefits vs. Community Impact

Proponents argue the data center would create 200 to 250 permanent jobs and generate significant tax revenue for Monroe County. The facility would be built in three phases with completion targets of 2029, 2031 and 2033.

The project requires rezoning the property from residential to commercial use. Current landowners Ingram Timber Enterprises and Henry Davis Properties LLC would reportedly receive approximately $60 million for the land sale.

However, residents question whether the economic benefits justify the impact on their community. Both the Smiths and Kenirey say they're prepared to move if the project is approved.

""We're gonna look into other places to start a hobby farm or mini farm just like we have here,"" Kenirey said. ""We wanna choose to live in a serene place where we feel that there's peace.""

Legal Battle Ahead

Idus Smith said residents are prepared for a lengthy legal fight regardless of how officials vote.

""I've gotta go before P&Z first then it's gotta go before if they approve it, the commissioners will have the final say so,"" he said. ""And as far as we know, if it's turned down the commissioner has turned it down. Then the property owners across the road that wants this data center, which they'll get probably $60 million for. They will probably sue. And if they win. Then we'll start suing, so it's gonna be a court battle.""

Broader Regional Trend

This marks the second major data center proposed in Monroe County within one year, following approval of a separate project off Rumble Road. The proliferation of data centers has prompted several metro Atlanta counties including DeKalb, Bartow, Coweta and Douglas to institute moratoriums on new projects.

Earlier this month, DeKalb County enacted a 100-day ban on new data center projects to study their impact on power infrastructure and public welfare. The Georgia Public Service Commission has imposed new rules requiring data centers with extremely high energy usage to bear more infrastructure costs rather than shifting them to ordinary ratepayers.

The Monroe County Planning and Zoning Committee will review the rezoning request before county commissioners make the final decision. County officials declined to comment until after the planning and zoning meeting.

The data centers house rows of computer servers that power everything from artificial intelligence chatbots to future robotics applications, but residents say the industrial-scale facilities don't belong in residential areas.

""I don't even see why this thing coming up for a vote,"" Idus Smith said. ""If you read the fine print, it says everything is required for them to rezone it, and if they go by that, there's no way they could rezone it.""",https://media.13wmaz.com/assets/WMAZ/images/e7b82807-b786-4a19-b7b0-b60aa409b37e/20250720T191243/e7b82807-b786-4a19-b7b0-b60aa409b37e_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-07-21 03:00:14.455116

St. Charles Mayor Clint Hull also expects to have a vote on the pact in August.
Some residents of St. Charles and Naperville have raised concerns about IMEA’s reliance on Prairie State Energy, a coal-fired plant in southern Illinois.
The panel held a series of public workshops and recommended approval of the contract extension.","Electricity needs for Naperville and St. Charles — and the type of energy residents will use — are at the heart of a debate as both cities decide whether to sign on for another 20 years with the Illinois Municipal Electric Agency.

Both are part of the group of 32 municipalities that purchase power in bulk to distribute to their residents. The current contract expires in 2035, but IMEA has asked its members to sign a 20-year contract extension as it works to secure power to meet the future needs of its members.

With an Aug. 19 deadline looming, St. Charles and Naperville are among three member communities that have not signed on. Winnetka, the only other Chicago suburb in the IMEA, agreed to the contract extension in July.

Both Naperville and St. Charles have meetings scheduled on July 28, with the Naperville City Council discussing the contract in a workshop session and St. Charles’ government operations committee discussing the issue.

Naperville Councilman Josh McBroom has won support to have a vote on the contract placed on the Aug. 19 agenda. St. Charles Mayor Clint Hull also expects to have a vote on the pact in August.

“We’re working really hard at it,” said Hull, who convened a special committee shortly after his election in April to review energy options.

Some residents of St. Charles and Naperville have raised concerns about IMEA’s reliance on Prairie State Energy, a coal-fired plant in southern Illinois.

During a city council meeting last week in Naperville, several high school students and members of the Naperville Environment and Sustainability Task Force (NEST) voiced concern about the pollutants from coal-fired plants and their future if Naperville continues to support coal as an energy source.

“I want to be proud of not just our schools and our community but our city’s courage to lead by example … a city that chooses clean energy because it honors the values of sustainability, innovation and care for future generations to come,” said Rakshita Ruparel, a rising senior at Naperville North High School and member of Naperville District 203’s carbon action plan steering committee.

NEST members oppose the contract extension. They argue that it lacks transparency and locks Naperville into electricity rates for 20 years without competition.

Proponents of the extension, however, argue that IMEA offers the cleanest energy portfolio option for the city.

With member directives, which allow member communities to purchase up to 10% of their own power, and a new solar project coming online, IMEA can offer up to 45% of its energy from clean sources by 2027, said Louis Halkias, chairman of Naperville’s public utility advisory board.

The panel held a series of public workshops and recommended approval of the contract extension.

Halkias and others also noted that IMEA provides more reliable service at a lower cost.

Brian Groth, Naperville’s electric utility director and the city’s representative on the IMEA board, says the typical June electric bill from IMEA was roughly $115 this year. That same bill would have been about $171 from ComEd, he said.

“It is difficult to understand why we would walk away from lower-cost electricity,” Naperville resident Michael Lapinski told city council members last week.

Naperville City Councilman Ian Holzhauer has questioned the urgency of signing a deal now, considering that the existing contract does not expire until 2035. He also questions why the city has not considered other options.

“All that’s been evaluated so far is one unsolicited proposal from a coal power vendor … there has been a lack of vision,” he said. “I would never make a major purchase without considering competing bids.

“I think Naperville should make a decision on its own timeline based on when they will get the most competitive bids,” he added.

McBroom, however, argues the city needs to take IMEA’s deadline seriously.

IMEA initially requested a decision by April 30. But at its June meeting, the agency agreed to extend the option until Aug. 19.

At that June meeting, board members made it clear Aug. 19 was a firm date, said Staci Wilson, vice president of government affairs and member services for IMEA.

McBroom said recent changes in state law require energy providers to have net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. If Naperville wants to go it alone or switch providers, he said, the city will need time to navigate the new requirements and find providers.

“We are going to be entering the most treacherous energy supply market in Illinois history,” McBroom said. “The urgency is if we decide that we don’t want to be a part of IMEA, it could take a decade for Naperville to plan and build infrastructure to become a power purchaser in the market.”",https://imengine.public.prod.pdh.navigacloud.com/?uuid=0d127686-2670-5237-a34b-775532849c27&function=fit&type=preview,N,,2025-07-21 01:19:39.032826

However, in the meantime, Tesla needs to sell cars, and the recent Q2 sales numbers weren’t promising.
The Model 3 and Model Y — which are fundamentally the same car, but in sedan and crossover formats — accounted for 97% of Tesla’s sales.

At his October 2024 event, Musk previewed a ground-up Tesla Robotaxi, meant to go on sale for $30,000, and followed this with a promise to have a Tesla Robotaxi service active by this June.","Tesla has long been a problem for efficient markets theory, or the universal wisdom of value investing, or the notion that retail traders know what they’re doing. If Tesla’s sales reflected its ticker price, then it would sell more cars than Toyota and Ford combined, but that isn’t, and has never, been true. At one point, this value was suspended on the idea that Tesla would reach that scale and have unprecedented margins given their efficiency. Musk once promised that the company would sell twenty million cars a year, with the implicit promise of doing so without reducing per-car profits. With that notion long abandoned, investors try to justify its value on Tesla’s beta-testing robotaxi business, or its even more theoretical line of home robots.

However, in the meantime, Tesla needs to sell cars, and the recent Q2 sales numbers weren’t promising. Global sales are down by more than 13 percent in Q1, which itself was down eight-and-a-half percent on Q4 of 2024. This is bad news, but the more striking number is the breakdown of sales numbers. The Model 3 and Model Y — which are fundamentally the same car, but in sedan and crossover formats — accounted for 97% of Tesla’s sales. By comparison, its “other models” — the Model S premium sedan, Model X premium SUV, and famous Cybertruck — made up only three percent of sales, or 10,394 cars. That’s 3,000 fewer cars than the first quarter, and almost half of Q1 2024, despite the ancient Model S and Model X both receiving facelifts in June, and a less expensive Long Range RWD version of the CyberTruck launching in April.

Tesla Semis are not included in this number as, despite being announced in 2017, it is still in a beta program, and there are only about 200 trucks in use. Tesla promises volume production will begin this year, but they have missed repeated promises for several years in a row. This still puts it ahead of the second-generation Tesla Roadster, which Musk announced at the same event — where Tesla took $250,000 deposits for the Founder’s Series edition — but likely will never exist.

The low sales of the S and X are not a surprise, nor particularly disappointing, as Tesla doesn’t care that much about them. Yes, they had a facelift, but these were minor changes to cars that have been on sale in essentially the same form for more than a decade. If you want to buy a premium electric car, who would choose a Model S or X — which are still dogged by build quality issues — instead of newer, better reviewed, and more premium competitors from Porsche, BMW, Lucid, Rivian, or Mercedes?

The CyberTruck is an absolute failure, though. It’s been on sale for less than two years, was extremely costly to develop, and ought to have been a dominating entry to the electric truck segment, but likely sold fewer than 5,000 vehicles this quarter. This is partially due to the CyberTruck’s late arrival, underperformance, and overpricing compared to initial promises; partially due to its divisiveness, especially with its newfound political associations; and it’s also due to the EV truck segment never becoming as large as initially anticipated. I have written about this in these pages for more than two years, and until companies solve the range, towing, and temperature issues, I don’t expect the situation to change.

However, if any pickup could have been resistant to this, it ought to be the CyberTruck. It was supposed to be the truck for truck-people and non-truck-people alike. Instead, it’s the truck for almost nobody.

This leaves Tesla in a vulnerable position, producing only one model that sells: the Y and 3. It helps that these are among the best-selling cars on sale, but that mightn’t last. With their sales declining, the new Toyota RAV4 beat the Model Y to be the best-selling car of the quarter; and that’s despite both the Model 3 and Y recently receiving comprehensive chassis-up refreshes. These are brand new models, and the Q2 sales are inclusive of a theoretical post-refresh sales bump. Meanwhile, inexpensive, well-built Chinese EVs will continue to take sales in non-tariffed markets like the United Kingdom and Australia; American sales will fall with the imminent end of EV tax credits; and customers in left-leaning states will continue to replace their Teslas with models from different manufacturers. No number of Epstein conspiracy tweets will make Californian customers forget Musk’s past year of political commentary, nor will the Germans; Tesla’s two biggest markets.

So, where does Tesla go from here? At his October 2024 event, Musk previewed a ground-up Tesla Robotaxi, meant to go on sale for $30,000, and followed this with a promise to have a Tesla Robotaxi service active by this June. He came through on this, but only in the most technical definition. The taxis are all Model Ys and 3s; they only operate within a small geofenced zone in Austen; and there are only a few dozen cars in operation. Tesla is significantly behind Waymo — which operates far more cars in much larger areas across five cities, and whose LiDAR-assisted self-driving systems are far safer — and a production Robotaxi faces a lot of regulatory hurdles, even if Tesla can make it possible. The Optimus home robot is such a far-off dream that it’s hard to take seriously.

But, on news of these sales figures, Tesla’s share price bumped up, so what do I know?",https://wp.nysun.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/optimus-tesla.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=fill&fm=jpg&fl=progressive,N,,2025-07-21 01:20:19.763970

And the third startup, Green Gravity, is devising a system for storing renewable energy in disused mineshafts across the Illawarra escarpment.
BlueScope plans to use green hydrogen (made using renewable electricity) to convert iron ore into molten iron.

Novel answers The next stop on the steelworks tour is an old warehouse BlueScope has leased to local startup Green Gravity.","The Illawarra escarpment never strays far from the sea in Wollongong, an industrial port city directly south of Sydney. Save for the bulge of Lake Illawarra, rainforested cliffs threaded with rich, black metallurgical coal seams run beside a shimmering ocean dotted with cargo ships – and possibly wind turbines, if plans materialise.

Side by side, the city’s coal and steelmaking past – still key to the local economy today – butts up against visions of its clean-energy future. And squeezed in between is a community of innovators, problem-solvers and skilled workers trying to find their place.

As I chat to actor-cum-climate-campaigner Yael Stone on a baking-hot February day, a train rattles past, injecting itself into our conversation. It knocks along a railway built in the 1880s to carry coal to Port Kembla, once Wollongong’s industrial heartland and still New South Wales’ second-largest port for coal exports.

“We’ve got a really potent potential workforce here for renewables, and we can’t disregard [their] industrial knowledge,” says Yael, who created Hi Neighbour, a not-for-profit helping local workers upskill for jobs in the fast-expanding renewables sector. “We can’t forget these folks, this region, that have powered our country in traditional ways.”

It’s a familiar challenge for Australia – establishing new industries in communities built around coal – but one that’s proving more complicated in the Illawarra than in other transitioning regions.

In early 2023, the Illawarra, seen as a key site for offshore wind development, was declared NSW’s fifth renewable energy zone and one of three hydrogen technology hubs. But according to Dr Chantel Carr, a human geographer from the University of Wollongong’s (UOW) School of Social Sciences, the region risks being left out of the national conversation about Australia’s clean-energy transition because a different type of coal is mined here – one that’s used for making steel, not generating electricity.

And yet locals know the Illawarra holds huge potential. In fact, it could be the source of some of the most crucial solutions to climate change. A groundswell of community-led action has, for example, given rise to Electrify 2515 , a world-first pilot that’s testing what happens when 500 homes in one suburb go fully electric.

A trio of startups borne out of industry know-how and university research are also making strides. UOW spin-off company Hysata has developed a super-efficient device for making green hydrogen from water using renewable electricity. Wollongong-based Sicona Battery Technologies has produced battery materials that could give electric cars one-third more range. And the third startup, Green Gravity, is devising a system for storing renewable energy in disused mineshafts across the Illawarra escarpment.

Meanwhile, BlueScope Steel, the largest steel manufacturer in the country, has just launched a project to figure out how to produce iron for steelmaking without burning coal.

“All of that [has] happened within a 5-to-10km [radius] here in the Illawarra,” says Ty Christopher, an electrical engineer and director of UOW’s Energy Futures Network.

Ty was born and raised in the Illawarra’s northern suburbs. “As a region, we’re right at the core of innovation, right at the core of people taking action on climate change,” he says.

“We also have this tremendous grassroots campaign of people caring deeply about the beautiful environment in which they live, caring deeply about the future of our region, our country and our planet, and asking themselves, ‘What can I do about that?’”

On the other hand, community division around the planned offshore wind zone has seeded uncertainty. The federal government approved the zone in June 2024 – the fourth of six Australia-wide – but reduced its size by a third of what was originally proposed and moved it 10km further out to sea. Project developers have quietly dropped their plans, although they cite the region’s deep water and wind speeds as technical challenges.

In Ty’s view, it shows the energy transition now well underway in Australia – and around the world – is primarily a social transformation, not a technological one. “The reality is, all of the tech to get us to net zero is available now,” he says. “The challenge for us is: how do we engage with it as individuals, as communities, and as a nation to get us there in a way that’s inclusive, that brings everyone along on the journey?”

The Illawarra is tackling these questions and providing answers that could light the path forward for Australia.

A whole-of-community approach

Bringing the whole community along for the clean-energy transition is at the core of Hi Neighbour’s mission. “We have to imagine our future in a way that includes our past,” Yael says. “There’s this real pride [in the Illawarra] around an industry that has been deeply formative for our community. It runs very deep.”

Darryl Best speaks proudly of his career in coalmining, even though he regrets its impact on the environment. Moving from Lithgow to the Illawarra after his electrical apprenticeship as a young man, Darryl ran a crew at Dendrobium coalmine and later was appointed undermanager at Wongawilli colliery.

“I always tried to put myself in the workers’ shoes,” says the retiree and Hi Neighbour board member who advocates for renewables jobs in coal communities. “I’m working as hard as I can.”

Darryl knows firsthand what happens when coalmines shut abruptly with no transition plan for workers. When Wongawilli closed in 2014, he was the manager who had to tell more than 100 miners they were out of work. “People lost their sense of worth,” he says. “They lost their ability to be part of the community they live in.”

Another local coalmine closed in the Illawarra last year due to safety concerns. But coal workers, Darryl says, are adaptable, skilled at problem-solving, and incredibly safety-conscious because they work in hazardous environments with fast-moving machinery. With those skills and a bit of training, he says coal workers can slot into about half the jobs that make up the growing renewables workforce.

But Chantel – who began her career as an industrial electrician at the Port Kembla Steelworks and now studies the social and workforce dimensions of energy transitions – says that while some industrial skills can be easily transferred, shifting sectors isn’t always straightforward.

One coal sector worker lamented to her: “I’ve spent the last two years working towards my [engineering] degree, and unfortunately…as much as I would like to move out of the industry, this is where my experience is.”

Many coalminers, especially those nearing the end of lifelong careers, also feel attacked by accusations their industry is ruining the climate. “Everyone is saying their industry is rubbish and you’ve got to shut [the coalmines] down,” Darryl says. “So, of course they’re going to rally against this. [Coalmining] is tied up with who they are.”

However, younger workers are heralding a new generation looking to renewables. Take Josh Smede, a Hi Neighbour scholarship recipient and third-generation electrician whose grandfather worked in the coalmines, for example. He now gets 80 per cent of his work from solar and battery installations.

To keep pace with the demand for renewables, modelling suggests Australia’s electricity workforce needs to double in the next five years to meet the country’s 2030 target of 82 per cent renewables in our electricity grids.

So, Hi Neighbour is also supporting high-voltage industrial electricians such as Endeavour Energy apprentice Claire O’Shea, who maintains and upgrades substations, as well as engineers, environmental assessors and project managers who are in demand amid skills shortages. Claire’s TAFE class, she says, is full of people wanting to go into solar and wind: “It’s a very popular thing that people are wanting to do.”

Questioning the transition

The jobs boom promised by large-scale renewables projects isn’t necessarily translating into jobs on the ground in the Illawarra just yet, though. Darryl says the lack of real job opportunities – save for a handful of local startups employing fewer than 150 people – makes it hard to convince career-long coal workers to retrain. “We’ve just been forgotten down here,” Darryl says. “Coalminers will say to me, ‘Transition into what or where? There’s nothing here.’”

Chantel again points to the fact that a different type of coal is mined in the region. “The issue that we have here in the Illawarra is that we’re not really on the radar because we’re not part of the conversation around thermal coal,” she says.

Thermal coal is burnt to generate electricity, whereas the Illawarra escarpment’s metallurgical (coking) coal is used for steelmaking. In fact, for the 3.2 million tonnes of raw steel BlueScope (formerly BHP Steel) makes annually at its Port Kembla Steelworks, about 80 per cent of the metallurgical coal it requires comes from the Illawarra. Australia’s domestic demand for thermal coal is tapering off with the rise of renewables, but metallurgical coal exports are peaking. “[The Illawarra is] on an entirely different trajectory to the likes of the Hunter, Gippsland, Central Queensland,” Chantel says. “[Illawarra coal workers] have only known a rapidly expanding export sector for the last decade and a half. So this talk of energy transitions doesn’t match their experience at all, which is a real problem.”

That trajectory will shift. Demand for metallurgical coal exports will decline as global steelmakers decarbonise by shifting away from coal-fired blast furnaces and adopting low-emissions technologies instead. For now, however, renewables remain a hard sell to local coal workers.

Another factor is that the Illawarra’s economy has been forced to diversify amid industrial layoffs and rising unemployment. In 1966, one in four men in the region was employed in steel, and some 44 per cent of the region’s workforce was employed in mining or manufacturing. Today, manufacturing makes up just 7.4 per cent, and mining only 1.8 per cent. Healthcare and education are now the largest employers.

Since the 1960s, BlueScope’s Port Kembla Steelworks has been the largest in Australia. It still employs some 3500 people and is one of the Illawarra’s biggest emitters. Decarbonising the steelworks will require up to 15 times more electricity than it currently uses – equivalent to the daily usage of 900,000 households. That demand can’t be met by rooftop solar, and the region’s geography limits space for solar farms, so large industries such as steel need the scale and reliability of offshore wind.

“No one technology is going to solve our clean-energy future,” Ty says. “But the right combination of most, if not all of them, will get us the clean-energy future we need.”

His calculations show the 2.9-gigawatt offshore wind zone planned for the Illawarra could generate more than double the region’s future energy demand, with the surplus helping to decarbonise industry or make green hydrogen. Locals would also benefit from cleaner air. But opposition to offshore wind has been fierce. Illawarra’s offshore wind zone drew 14,211 submissions – 5,305 more than the other five zones combined. About 65 per cent of submissions opposed the zone, though other local and national surveys indicate support is higher than submissions suggest.

The extent of community opposition was striking. “[It] came as a surprise to a lot of people,” says Natasha Larkin, a legal geographer whose PhD thesis at UOW examined the legal frameworks for offshore wind in Australia. After poring over submissions and attending fiery public meetings, Natasha traced the opposition back to several overlooked regional factors. “People didn’t buy the narrative that this would be good for jobs,” she says. Supporters and opposers alike expressed concern that environmental assessments are deferred until after a zone is declared and placed in the hands of project developers. “If developers are just looking at their individual project,” she continues, “then we’re not looking at the cumulative impacts across an area.”

Chantel points out that the Illawarra also has more technicians and trades workers than the national average – residents with a deep understanding of what the new industry might entail, and who are scrutinising proposals closely. “They were looking to the specifics of what’s being proposed and wanting more information,” she says, adding that there’s also a wariness of large industrial players who haven’t always done right by people or the environment. “That history [of industrial relations] can drive scepticism.”

Although the Illawarra’s offshore wind future hangs in the balance, Natasha views the process so far as constructive. “It brought out a lot of important issues that needed to be aired,” she says. “The questions people were asking as a community showed a great deal of insight and knowledge, and a deep connection to this place that ought not be dismissed.”

Decarbonising steel

While debates about offshore wind roll on, BlueScope is figuring out other ways to decarbonise its steelmaking processes. Its carbon footprint per tonne of steel produced is down 12 per cent since 2018, helped largely by reductions at its steelmaking plant in Ohio, USA, which uses abundant scrap steel to lower emissions. Port Kembla, with its coking coal and traditional blast furnaces, is a different pot of steel.

Driving through the steelworks on a public tour, we pass two hot metal ladles parked up on the rail line. The heat shimmers off the molten iron contained inside these torpedo-shaped carts. Behind, the No. 5 blast furnace continues to burn super-heated coking coal to smelt iron ore and extract the molten iron, which is carted off and made into steel. It’s this molten iron that BlueScope needs to make ‘green’ if the company is going to decarbonise its steelmaking.

That’s where a newly launched pilot project comes in. Called NeoSmelt, the pilot is testing whether BlueScope can do away with coal and traditional blast furnaces, and instead make molten iron using hydrogen and an electric smelting furnace. BlueScope plans to use green hydrogen (made using renewable electricity) to convert iron ore into molten iron.

But until the economics tip in green hydrogen’s favour, the company will use natural gas, a fossil fuel that contains hydrogen locked up in methane. “This is a fairly substantial pilot,” BlueScope’s Chief Executive of Australian Steel Products, Tania Archibald, said in January when announcing the NeoSmelt plant would be located in Kwinana, Western Australia, closer to the Pilbara iron ores BlueScope plans to use.

The plant, once operational in 2028, could produce 30,000–40,000 tonnes of molten iron per year. But that’s less than 1 per cent of BlueScope’s annual iron supplies. The company uses as much molten iron as the NeoSmelt plant could produce in a year in just 4–5 days at its Port Kembla Steelworks.

However, about 70 per cent of the world’s steel is made using iron from blast furnaces, so eliminating those coal-fired processes with NeoSmelt technology could slash steelmaking emissions not just in the Illawarra but also around the world. “What we’re hoping,” Archibald said at the announcement, “is that we can then effectively skip a step and go straight [from the pilot stage] to full commercial scale so it really helps accelerate the decarbonisation of steelmaking.”

The pilot will run for 3–5 years. But first, BlueScope – in partnership with its collaborators, mining giants Rio Tinto, BHP and Woodside Energy – needs to build the NeoSmelt plant from scratch. And the processes for making so-called green iron from Pilbara iron ores using renewable electricity are yet to be developed. “The challenge is going from creating a bucket of the stuff in the lab to creating multi-hundred-tonne ladles of it in a factory,” Ty says.

Until then, BlueScope is stuck with traditional ways of making iron at its Port Kembla Steelworks and is spending $1.15 billion to replace the worn-out inner brick lining of its No. 6 blast furnace so that it can operate for another 20 years.

In the meantime, BlueScope is trialling alternative methods to cut emissions, including using more scrap and exploring new carbon sources and hydrogen technologies. It has also trialled a CSIRO electrolyser that uses industrial waste heat to make green hydrogen with less power. But BlueScope’s decarbonisation plans all depend on having a stable supply of renewable electricity.

Novel answers

The next stop on the steelworks tour is an old warehouse BlueScope has leased to local startup Green Gravity. As we pile off the bus, we hear something whirring; inside the old foundry, the startup has built a 12m-high prototype of its gravity-based energy storage system. It works by hoisting weights using excess renewable energy from the grid and lowers them to dispatch power on demand, using regenerative braking, as in an electric car, to convert the weights’ motion into electricity.

The idea is to build much bigger versions of this prototype in abandoned mineshafts that plunge several hundred metres deep into the Illawarra escarpment. “Any mine that’s no longer in use, we can turn into energy storage,” says Tania Jones, sustainable market development manager at Green Gravity. “The more systems we have, the more power we can generate.”

Made of shiny new steel, the Green Gravity structure gleams against the red-tinged frame of the old foundry. The technology, if deployed, would help the grid handle more renewables, functioning like a battery but with virtually endless ‘charge-discharge’ cycles. By Green Gravity’s calculations, installing the system in just one local mineshaft could power about 3000 homes – one suburb in the Illawarra – through the night by storing surplus solar energy from their rooftops.

With 37 old mineshafts mapped out across the Illawarra, the potential capacity is huge. These sites are already grid-connected, the land is already disturbed and needs rehabilitating, and the local workforce has the skills that Green Gravity needs to plan, design, build, wire up, monitor and maintain their systems.

“Once the system is up and running, we’ll also need a lot of data analysts and mechatronics specialists,” Tania says. “Electricity is real-time. Understanding what the grid’s requirements are, the demand and the supply, when to switch [the system] on and off – there’s a lot of data collection, simulation and computer programming associated with this. And that opens up whole new career pathways for the community that perhaps didn’t exist before.”

Green Gravity has, however, taken heed of the community division around offshore wind in the Illawarra. The startup – which Tania says is on track to build its first demonstration plant in a local mineshaft by the end of 2025 – is taking a more considered approach, inviting people to tour their warehouse to size up the prototype technology for themselves.

“What I’m seeing is that for us to make this energy transition, it needs to be very grassroots and community-driven,” says Tania, whose grandparents emigrated from Malta in the mid-1940s and were employed in the steelworks. For Green Gravity, that means building operations using the skills and experience of Wollongong locals – and getting the community onside. “You need to meet the community where they’re at and understand what’s important to them,” she says.

The solar challenge

One-third of Australian homes now have solar panels, which means some 4 million houses are feeding excess electricity into the grid (if they don’t have their own battery for storage). Collectively, solar-powered households generate more electricity for our national grid than large solar farms, wind or gas.

“Australians are leading the world in energy transformation,” Ty says. But that also means we’re navigating uncharted territory. “We don’t have somewhere else to look to say, ‘They’re ahead of us on this journey; there’s a proven pathway forward.’”

That’s why Electrify 2515, a community-led project in northern Illawarra masterminded by local engineer and innovator Dr Saul Griffith, is so exciting. “It’s a way to jump 10 years into the future and prove how to do this – not in a lab, not in a spreadsheet, but in real life,” Ty says.

The pilot project was launched late last year, backed by $5.4 million in federal funding to help 500 households in the 2515 postcode – which includes the Illawarra suburbs of Austinmer, Clifton, Coledale, Scarborough, Thirroul and Wombarra – to buy home batteries and switch from gas to all-electric appliances. The subsidies will be scaled for income, and the pilot will also measure economic benefits to the community if household savings on energy bills flow into local businesses.

More than 600 people packed Anita’s Theatre in Thirroul on a sunny Sunday afternoon in November for the pilot launch, and Saul confessed to his neighbours he was nervous. “I’m used to running experiments on the machines,” he told the crowd. “This is an experiment I’m running on my community.”

But the community is game. More than 250 households applied to be part of the pilot in its first month. On top of financial support to electrify their homes, participants will also receive a smart energy device to track and optimise their household energy use. Project partner Endeavour Energy will monitor electrical loads across the suburb, and Saul hopes the data will show electrifying most homes isn’t going to break the grid but make it more reliable.

It’s early days, but Saul – an architect of the largest piece of climate legislation in US history, the US Inflation Reduction Act – lights up when I ask him about the Electrify 2515 launch a few months after the event. “[It felt] a bit historic,” he says. “Climate action has [until recently] either been large-scale public protest or very wonky policy stuff like carbon tax debates.”

Electrify 2515, he says, is different because it’s community-led. “[We are] engaging in genuine on-the-ground climate action and figuring out how to do it together. It isn’t really happening anywhere else in the world quite like that.”

As momentum builds around the project, federal Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen, has directed the Australian Renewable Energy Agency to consider funding other community electrification pilots nationwide.

In years to come, Saul hopes we might look back and see Electrify 2515 as “the first bolthole where we proved that the future could work”. Already, as a country, we’ve crossed the electrification tipping point, according to Saul’s latest analysis with Rewiring Australia, a non-profit organisation he co-founded.

Going electric is now the cheapest way to do everything: to heat your house, to heat your hot water, to drive, and to buy electricity. Even including upfront purchasing costs, fully electric households with solar and batteries could save about $4100 per year, the modelling shows. “Economically, this is a no-brainer,” Saul says.

But even more meaningful than those numbers are the one-on-one conversations around 2515 that Saul has when he swims with septuagenarians in rock pools and is peppered with questions about hot-water systems and electric vehicles (EVs) at his local coffee shop. Those conversations build trust, which Saul says is the key ingredient needed for the energy transition. It’s how solar panels were sold so successfully in Australia. “Over the back fence,” Saul says. Neighbour to neighbour.

“I was swimming the other day,” Saul adds, “and an old guy stops me.” He was a retiree, a former fitter and turner at Port Kembla, who admitted he didn’t initially believe Saul’s assertion that it was cheaper to heat his home with solar. But the retiree had done a spreadsheet, and now declared to Saul: “It’s true: I’m gonna save $1600 this year. So I’ve decided to do the whole house now. It’s going to be all-electric. The wife loves it.”

“Here is this rust-coated-on-him, heavy-industry guy,” Saul says. “He tells his mates…” Saul trails off, pausing to take it all in. “I mean, that feels like a very positive social change you can believe in.”",https://www.australiangeographic.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/OPENER-2-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-07-21 01:58:48.319999

For Helios Energy Ltd (ASX:HE8), a once-midstream exploration company, the past 12 months have been a masterclass in strategic reinvention. By pivoting from a speculative explorer to a disciplined developer of the Presidio Project in West Texas, Helios has positioned itself to capitalize on the U.S. onshore energy renaissance. The catalyst? A leadership overhaul, technical rigor, and a laser focus on operational execution that is beginning to unlock value for shareholders.

A Leadership Overhaul: From Exploration to Execution

Helios Energy's transformation began in late 2024 with the appointment of Philipp Kin as Managing Director. Kin, a seasoned operator with a track record in North American resource plays, brought a mandate: shift from exploration to development. His team followed suit, hiring a Chief Operating Officer, Chief Geologist, and Chief Drilling Engineer—each with deep experience in the Permian Basin and other U.S. onshore plays. These appointments were not mere formality; they signaled a strategic pivot toward execution.

The new leadership's first act was securing capital through a placement and entitlement offer, raising critical funds to advance the Presidio Project. This move stabilized the balance sheet and allowed Helios to engage W.D. Von Gonten Engineering, a firm known for its expertise in unconventional resource development. The collaboration has yielded a 1C Contingent Resource estimate of 13.3 mmboe (as of January 2025), with the potential to scale to 21.7 mmboe at 3C—reflecting the project's robust upside.

Operational Execution: From Wells to Workflows

The Presidio Project is no longer a theoretical asset. Helios has begun the arduous work of restarting production, a process that demands both technical precision and cost discipline. The company's 75% net revenue interest in the project means it stands to benefit disproportionately from any success.

Key to this execution is the reactivation of existing wells and the delineation of new drilling locations. By partnering with experienced Permian Basin operators, Helios is leveraging third-party expertise to mitigate risk while optimizing capital efficiency. The company's focus on short-term liquidity—achieved through the 2024 capital raise—ensures it can fund these operations without overextending.

Moreover, Helios is aggressively re-leasing lapsed acreage, a move that expands its resource base and strengthens its position in a basin with high commodity prices. The company's estimate of a 100,000+ acre total play area underscores the potential for incremental value creation.

Strategic Moves: Acreage, Partnerships, and Vision

Helios's strategy extends beyond the Presidio Project. By engaging with major leaseholders to explore new acquisitions, the company is building a platform for scalable growth. These efforts align with broader trends in the U.S. energy sector, where companies with high-grade onshore assets are attracting renewed investor interest.

The full field development plan, informed by W.D. Von Gonten's technical analysis, is another linchpin. This plan includes seismic surveys and drilling campaigns to better define the resource base—a critical step for attracting partners and securing long-term production. The company's emphasis on cost efficiency—evident in its lean operational structure and targeted capital allocation—further enhances its appeal in a sector where profitability is often a function of execution, not just reserves.

Catalysts and Valuation: A Case for Shareholders

Helios Energy's stock (ASX:HE8) has traded in a narrow range over the past year, reflecting skepticism about its ability to execute. Yet the company's recent moves suggest otherwise. The 2025 resource estimates, combined with the leadership team's operational track record, present a compelling case for value creation.

For investors, the key metrics to watch are production restart timelines, capital efficiency, and partnership announcements. If Helios can achieve even a fraction of the 21.7 mmboe potential at economic rates, the valuation implications are significant.

Conclusion: A High-Potential Bet with Clear Catalysts

Helios Energy's strategic turnaround is a testament to the power of operational execution and leadership upgrades. The Presidio Project, once a speculative asset, is now a platform for disciplined growth. While the energy sector remains volatile, Helios's focus on cost control, technical execution, and strategic partnerships positions it to outperform in a recovering onshore environment.

For investors willing to tolerate near-term volatility, Helios offers a compelling opportunity: a high-potential U.S. onshore asset with a management team that has demonstrated the will and capability to unlock value. The question is no longer whether Helios can execute—it's how much upside remains in the Presidio Project.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-20 23:33:23.249469

A conversation over a meal at Panera Bread with one of her best friends led Mahshid Eghbali, a food and nutritional sciences master’s student at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, on an unexpected journey into the medical supply field.

Her friend, Hoda Motaghed, a doctoral student at the Joint School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering (JSNN), was talking about her project using biodegradable polymers, large molecules bound together into a plastic or resin that decompose as natural substances, like water, carbon dioxide and organic matter.

Motaghed, who became fascinated with skin products as a teen, was working to create a wound dressing that would promote healing and was environmentally friendly. Motaghed’s use of an agricultural byproduct caught Eghbali’s attention.

As a second-year master’s student studying food and nutritional sciences at the College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences, Eghbali was interested in how to improve the antimicrobial properties of the agricultural byproduct (which is not being disclosed because of its proprietary nature).

“(Motaghed) was talking about all those antimicrobial properties about this (byproduct), and I was thinking to myself that, what if you could add a little bit of details to this (byproduct), so that you would kind of reinforce this and make some improvements into the whole project?” Eghbali said.

Ultimately, Eghbali joined Motaghed’s research team at JSNN. The team focuses on using cellulose-based hydrogels. Team members include doctoral students Kayla Morgan and Vaishnavi Kandula and is mentored by Demetrius Finley, Ph.D., and Niya King, Ph.D.

“Cellulose is a very abundant, very natural polymer that that you can find anywhere in nature,” said Michael Curry, Ph.D., graduate curriculum coordinator for nanoengineering. “If you go outside and you look at the trees, you’re looking at cellulose.”

Hydrogels are a network of hydrophilic polymer chains that can absorb and retain large amounts of water or biological fluids, forming a soft, gel-like substance.

The team’s work culminated in an innovative wound dressing called Woundra, a material engineered for controlled antimicrobial release, cellular safety and environmental safety.

“It’s going to be a sustainable material that can … promote wound healing, hopefully without infections, and then also it will lessen the impact of the carbon footprint on the environment, because it’s all enewable,” Curry said.

Once perfected, it could be included in home first-aid kits and made available to injured farmers, who can’t get to a hospital immediately, and to parents, whose children might have suffered a cut or a burn, Curry said. Emergency responders in the field could also carry it, he said.

The team presented Woundra at the 2025 Innovation Venture Expo, hosted by Delaware State University, the 1890 Center of Excellence for Emerging Technologies and sponsored by Capital One. The event is designed to foster collaboration among industry leaders, researchers, entrepreneurs, and policymakers, with a focus on advancing scientific innovation and economic development.

Eghbali said the team added two other natural agricultural byproducts, both of which are normally discarded, to the first agricultural byproduct in making Woundra. Working together, those three things can boost the body’s immune system, improve skin hydration and increase the wound dressing’s antimicrobial effects, helping to combat bacteria that can cause infection.

“I was looking for agricultural products that are currently wasted that could be used to elevate the beneficial properties of the base product we’re using for Woundra,” she said.

Overall, Woundra aims to increase the speed at which the wound heals, she added.

Using materials often wasted in agriculture allows the team “to decrease the price of the product and we have the opportunity to help the planet stay more safe,” Eghbali said.

She’s grateful to be part of the interdisciplinary team and to her advisor, Jianmei Yu, Ph.D., a Google Scholar in the Department of Family and Consumer Sciences.

“I really appreciate the opportunities that my advisor has given me to be a part of this project,” Eghbali said.

Ardyaloon to become third Kimberley community to benefit from rooftop solar installations

Remote Kimberley households are saving on energy bills under a rooftop solar program jointly funded by the Cook and Albanese governments.

Rooftop solar systems have been installed in the remote communities of Warmun and Bidyadanga as part of Horizon Power's Kimberley Communities Solar Saver (KCSS) program. Work in a third community, Ardyaloon, is underway.

The program, a collaboration between Horizon Power and the Department of Communities, is delivering on a just energy transition by enabling remote communities that were locked out of the benefits of rooftop solar to access renewable energy and save on energy bills.

The program was announced in November 2023 as part of broader activities being funded by a $12.6 million investment from the State Government and $7.3 million from the Federal Government, under their Community Solar Banks program.

The program started in Warmun, with Horizon Power installing 422 kilowatts of rooftop solar, resulting in lower energy bills for all residents and reducing reliance on expensive diesel generators.

While not all homes in Warmun have been fitted with a solar system, the benefits of renewables are being shared with the 78 properties in the community.

Since August 2024, KCSS has delivered nearly $30,000 in energy saving credits to community members.

Following the Warmun success, Horizon Power has installed 356.4kW of rooftop solar across 33 properties in Bidyadanga. The 133 households received their second round of energy saving credits in late April, with the community receiving approximately $33,000 in total credit since installations were completed.

Work in the Dampier Peninsula community of Ardyaloon is underway, with approximately 21 homes to receive rooftop solar systems. About 85 households will have access to the benefits of renewables when installations are completed.

The program is expected to install up to 300 rooftop solar systems across five communities - with a combined capacity of two megawatts - delivering an average annual household savings of approximately $450 in energy costs to approximately 430 households.

Comments attributed to Federal Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen:

""The Albanese Government is partnering with the Cook Government to make sure remote communities are taking part in the clean energy transition.

""This is what a fairer energy system looks like - shared solar cutting bills, easing cost-of-living pressures and reducing reliance on expensive diesel.

""We'll keep working with communities and states like WA to deliver cleaner, cheaper energy for more Australians, no matter where they live.""

Comments attributed to Energy and Decarbonation Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson:

""This project is a wonderful example of shared assets bringing direct benefits to our remote communities.

""Instead of relying solely on diesel generators, community residents can benefit from shared solar power, resulting in a cleaner and cheaper type of energy.

""Kimberley Communities Solar Saver is like a solar farm, using residential rooftops instead of land, with the benefits being equally distributed among the community customers.

""The Cook Government continues to support bespoke programs that aim to provide benefits to our more vulnerable communities - customers with limited opportunity to seek alternative energy sources to help reduce their energy bills.""

Comments attributed to Horizon Power acting chief executive officer Krystal Skinner:

""We are proud the Kimberley Communities Solar Saver is already having an impact, delivering lower energy bills for residents in Warmun and Bidyadanga.

His children and grandchildren are facing coal’s future, an economic and environmental predicament that China’s policymakers have yet to solve.
Born in 1971 in Lüliang, a small city in western Shanxi, China’s coal heartland, Wang joined his local mine at the age of 18.
“After the disaster relief ended, when we looked back, what struck me most was climate change.
In the past, we all knew that climate change was a serious issue, right?","Gazing over the remains of his home, Wang Bingbing surveys a decades-old jujube tree flowering through the rubble, and the yard where he and his wife once raised pigs, now a pile of crumbled brick.

In the valley below, a sprawling coalmine is the source of their dislocation: years of digging heightened the risk of landslides, forcing Wang and his family out. To prevent the family from returning, local authorities later demolished their home.

“We really didn’t want to leave,” Wang’s wife, Wang Weizhen, says ruefully.

Wang’s life is the story of coal’s past, when the industry was notoriously dangerous but booming. His children and grandchildren are facing coal’s future, an economic and environmental predicament that China’s policymakers have yet to solve.

As the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter transitions to cleaner energy, families like Wang’s are on the precipice of being left behind by China’s green revolution, fearing for their economic prospects as the country charts a delicate path between its fossil fuel foundations and clean energy ambitions.

Looking older than his 55 years, Wang’s body is marked by years in the industry. Above his right eyebrow rests a faint scar from a mining accident in his 20s that killed two of his colleagues. Ten years ago, he stopped working completely due to a liver illness, and he and his wife now survive on a monthly government welfare payment of 500 yuan (£52).

Born in 1971 in Lüliang, a small city in western Shanxi, China’s coal heartland, Wang joined his local mine at the age of 18. “My family was poor and there was no work to do,” he says. “I didn’t have much education either, so I had no choice but to work in the coalmine.”

As the country grapples with its shift away from coal, it is also dealing with the increasing fallout from natural disasters, with 25 million people affected in the first half of this year, according to China’s emergency ministry.

Coal is at the heart of Shanxi’s economy. Between 2018 and 2023, more than 10% of all the coal produced globally was dug up from Shanxi’s dry, silt-covered valleys, according to analysis from Global Energy Monitor, a US-based NGO.

But the natural resource occupies an uneasy place in China’s national plans. On the one hand, the country is pursuing renewable energy at a jaw-dropping scale. In May, China installed enough wind and solar to generate the same amount of electricity as Poland. On the other, the majority of China’s power generation still comes from coal, with officials seeing it as essential for ensuring energy security and jobs.

Although China is now the dominant producer of the technology such as solar panels and electric vehicles that will underpin the world’s green transition, it is also the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, which contribute to natural disasters such as the extreme floods that hit Shanxi in 2021, displacing nearly 2 million people.

But climate change means little to Wang. “I don’t know about national policies on reducing emissions,” he says, although he hopes his grandson can avoid a life in the mines. “It’s too dangerous,” he says. But he admits there are few alternatives. About one in 10 people in Shanxi are employed in coal and related industries.

Even in Shanxi’s urban areas, researchers and activists have largely focused for years on air pollution rather than climate change, says Du Jie, the director of Jinqing, an environmental NGO based in Shanxi. It wasn’t until the catastrophic flooding of 2021 that many people’s eyes were opened to the existential risks posed by a warming planet.

“The floods were truly a once-in-a-century event for Shanxi,” Du says over coffee in the lobby of a shiny office building in Taiyuan, Shanxi’s capital, about 175km (110 miles) and decades of modernisation away from the Wangs in Lüliang.

“After the disaster relief ended, when we looked back, what struck me most was climate change. In the past, we all knew that climate change was a serious issue, right? But for us in Shanxi, life had been relatively comfortable – we had never really experienced major droughts or floods like this before.”

The floods prompted Du to start thinking about how to raise awareness about climate change and low-carbon lifestyles in a more systematic way. One project involved surveying more than 1,000 people across Shanxi about how to reduce emissions in daily life. But making the connection between the coal industry and environmental damage is tricky. A recent survey of Shanxi citizens conducted by People of Asia for Climate Solutions, an NGO, found that more than 40% opposed the closure of mines, and less than half agreed the coal industry was a major cause of climate change.

However, economic prosperity has encouraged a shift in attitudes.

“Now, as basic needs are more or less met, people do recognise that protecting the environment is important,” Du says.

In Zhuangshang, a state-backed “zero carbon village” in southern Shanxi, residents are paid to install solar panels to generate electricity for their own needs, with excess supplied to the local grid. One resident, surnamed Li, receives a subsidy of 2,000 yuan a year to rent out his rooftop in the village. That, plus reduced energy prices for solar-generated power, means electricity is basically free for him and his neighbours. “How can you not be happy?” he says.

But Zhuangshang is just one village.

“At the national level, there’s strong support and hope for Shanxi to undergo industrial transformation,” Du says. “But the question is: how do we get the public ready for this change?”

It will gather leaders across business, government, unions, research, and education to drive a revitalised vision for Australian manufacturing, with a focus on long-term growth, resilience, and sovereignty.

“Despite its proud history, once contributing 28 per cent to the national GDP, manufacturing today represents just 5.9 per cent of Australia’s economy. The challenge is clear. But so too is the opportunity,” said Weld Australia’s CEO, Geoff Crittenden. “Australia is uniquely positioned to reindustrialise and lead in sectors essential to global competitiveness and national security: renewable energy, infrastructure, defence, and critical minerals.

“Manufacturing is at a crossroads. Without a strategic shift, Australia risks becoming increasingly reliant on global supply chains. But with decisive action – stronger local content requirements, better policy frameworks, and workforce investment – we can reclaim a position of strength. This Summit is about setting that agenda.”

Key focus areas will include:

• The critical role of enforceable local content policies in strengthening sovereign capability.

• Unlocking the potential of critical minerals through onshore processing and innovation.

• Building a future-ready workforce with targeted skills development in trades and technical fields.

• Driving industrial innovation to support the clean energy transition and major infrastructure projects.

Expect a high-calibre lineup of confirmed government speakers, including the Hon Tim Ayres, federal minister for Industry and Innovation, and minister for Science; the Hon Anoulack Chanthivong, NSW minister for Better Regulation, Industry, Innovation and Building; and Rebecca McPhee, Deputy Secretary, Investment NSW.

Industry experts will also add their voice to the important discussions, including Richard Denniss, executive director, Australia Institute; Rod Henderson, CEO, AMP Control; Simon Terry, CEO, Dux Hot Water; David Shankey, CEO, Net Zero Economy Authority; and Tim Buckley founder and director, Climate Energy Finance.

The new law 'sets the scene for less or no growth in most renewables,' says commodities-economics professor

President Donald Trump's signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which became law earlier this month, is likely to change the nation's energy landscape - potentially leading to higher power costs just as the race to grow artificial intelligence heats up.

The budget megabill ""represents a dramatic shift that will fundamentally reshape U.S. energy markets,"" as it introduces new restrictions for renewable-power investments and makes upstream oil and gas a major priority, according to a recent research note from Wood Mackenzie.

Read: Tax breaks and spending cuts: Here are the winners and losers in Trump's big bill

With such ""dramatic"" uncertainty facing new power-supply investments, retirements of thermal power plants are likely to be deferred, power prices will rise and large loads - which refer to power consumption by a single user, such as a data center - will be delayed, said David Brown, director of energy-transition research for Wood Mackenzie, in the note.

Without permitting reform, domestic technology innovation and new large-load tariffs - or specialized electricity rates for large energy consumers - the U.S. will ""risk the edge it has in the global AI race,"" he said.

There is ""no AI without energy,"" according to the International Energy Agency. While a typical AI-focused data center consumes as much electricity as 100,000 households, the largest ones currently under construction will require 20 times as much, the agency has said.

In an effort to address AI's need for power, Trump announced on July 15 more than $90 billion in AI and energy investments from the likes of Google (GOOGL) (GOOG), in data centers and infrastructure, and Blackstone Inc. (BX), in data centers and natural-gas plants.

""These facilities would definitely factor into power supply and prices in the coming years, but the degree to which is quite unclear until companies commence construction and indicate the exact sources of electricity for the new centers,"" Dan O'Brien, a senior analyst at Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate-policy think tank, told MarketWatch on Friday.

Changing the energy landscape

Overall, the tax and spending law has big implications for the energy sector, particularly when it comes to rolling back the work the nation has done to make a shift toward clean energy. The law, in part, winds down many of the clean-energy tax incentives for businesses stemming from the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA.

It's ""brought a lot more uncertainty in the U.S. energy market, especially with regard to the expansion of U.S. renewables,"" said Michael Tamvakis, professor of commodity economics and finance at Bayes Business School, part of City St George's, University of London. ""There was great hope that the IRA would bring a much-delayed growth in the renewables industry to allow the U.S. to catch up with other nations, whilst making its contribution to the global effort for carbon-emissions reduction.""

The new tax and spending law 'confirms that there will be a rebalancing of energy-policy priorities back towards dispatchable sources of energy, mostly nuclear and fossil fuels.'Michael Tamvakis, Bayes Business School

Trump's tax and spending law ""confirms that there will be a rebalancing of energy-policy priorities back towards dispatchable sources of energy, mostly nuclear and fossil fuels,"" Tamvakis told MarketWatch by email. The new law ""clearly sets the scene for less or no growth in most renewables ... with more focus back on fossil fuels.""

At the heart of the new law is ""national security,"" said Tamvakis, as domestic energy resources such as oil (CL00) (CL.1) and natural gas (NG00) can be extracted with existing domestic technology, which has been ""developed and fine-tuned"" in the U.S.

Relying on ""domestically produced fossil fuels is secure, and perhaps even cheaper in the short term,"" he noted. But ""fossil fuels are exhaustible, become more expensive to explore and extract, and may ultimately force the U.S. to resort again to increased imports"" - though probably not during the current administration.

Power generation and energy costs

In a report finalized in July, Energy Innovation, the energy- and climate-policy think tank, said the tax and spending law will ""harm America by cutting new electricity capacity additions, increasing consumer power prices and reducing U.S. GDP and job growth.""

The law will make it ""more expensive to meet growing demand in the next five critical years in the global AI race, damaging U.S. industrial competitiveness,"" it added.

Energy Innovation's O'Brien, one of the authors of the report, said the think tank expects the law to ""hamstring energy companies' efforts to bring new power plants to the grid to meet rising demand.""

In the next decade, he said, that means 340 gigawatts less power-generation capacity brought online - or about one-third of what was expected to come online if not for the new law.

American households will start seeing energy price increases as soon as next year, as utilities ""hike rates to make up for the upcoming shortage of cheap new power plants"" that is expected because of the budget law, said O'Brien. Still, the increase will ""take time to accrue, and the biggest increases in bills will take place over a longer period - the next five to10 years.""

By 2030, American households are expected to see their annual energy bills increase $40 to $300, depending on where they are in the country, because of the law, he added. By 2035, the annual increase in bills would be $55 to $640.

Energy Innovation expects to see the highest increases in energy bills in the South and Midwest, with Missouri potentially seeing an annual rise of $640 by 2035, said O'Brien. The lowest increases would largely be in the Northeast and Pacific Northwest, with Washington state potentially seeing a $55 a year rise by 2035, he said.

Energy Innovation's analysis accounts for the tax and spending law's efforts to expand oil and natural-gas leasing and coal drilling and mining, as well as the new leasing subsidies offered to oil, according to O'Brien.

Including these efforts, ""we see a relatively unsubstantial reduction in prices compared with the increase in prices caused by higher demand for these same products,"" he said.

In other words, the Trump administration's efforts to boost fossil fuels likely won't be able to offset the new law's impacts on U.S. power supplies - or reduce the prospect of higher energy costs.

Some of the young activists praised Pritzker for his commitment to climate issues and said he has an opportunity to demonstrate that by standing with Illinoisans and holding corporate polluters accountable.
Passing a “Make Polluters Pay” law, they say, would make these companies responsible for the public health and climate change impacts in Illinois that are a direct result of their activities.
Later last year, New York also passed its own Climate Change Superfund Act, which would raise $75 billion over 25 years from the fossil fuel industry to fund climate change adaptation and mitigation projects in the state.
“These polluters should pay for the damage they have done to our communities,” Guiffra said.","Young climate activists from Chicago called on Gov. JB Pritzker to enact legislation that would make the fossil fuel industry — instead of taxpayers — responsible for funding green, resilient infrastructure and disaster response in the face of climate change, following similar bills recently passed in Vermont and New York.

“Illinois can and must do the same,” said Oscar Sanchez, co-executive director of the Southeast Environmental Task Force, at a Sunday rally.

“Kids get asthma before they learn to ride a bike. Cancer becomes a ZIP code issue. Our elders breathe toxic poison in their own home,” he said. “It’s not just the pollution, it’s the climate crisis bearing down on us right now. We see streets turn into rivers after storms, basements flood, families lose everything. Meanwhile, oil and gas companies — the same ones fueling this crisis — are posting record-breaking profits.”

The group, a coalition led by the local Sunrise Movement chapter, gathered across the University of Chicago’s David Rubenstein event venue in Woodlawn, where the Aspen Ideas Climate Conference officially kicked off Sunday afternoon with hundreds of leaders from business, government, academia and other fields.

Pritzker was set to discuss green tech and infrastructure investments; also invited were Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who were expected to talk about their approaches to energy and economic development.

Some of the young activists praised Pritzker for his commitment to climate issues and said he has an opportunity to demonstrate that by standing with Illinoisans and holding corporate polluters accountable. Passing a “Make Polluters Pay” law, they say, would make these companies responsible for the public health and climate change impacts in Illinois that are a direct result of their activities.

In Chicago, for instance, such legislation would help address what activists have long protested as discriminatory zoning practices, which have pushed heavy industry into poor communities of color — exposing residents to toxic chemicals and pollutants and leading to a higher prevalence of negative health effects in the population, including cardiovascular and respiratory disease.

“We know what environmental racism looks like, because we live it every single day,” Sanchez said.

Some primarily Black and Hispanic neighborhoods and suburbs, like Chatham, Austin, Cicero and Berwyn, also experience severe flooding during heavy rains.

“If I’m going to be honest with everyone, I don’t like being here. Because this shouldn’t have to be our reality — that polluters are polluting Black, Latino, working-class communities across Chicago and Illinois,” said Gianna Guiffra, a Sunrise Movement volunteer. “We shouldn’t have to be protesting simply to tell them that we are human beings too. These big oil and gas companies make it very clear to everyone that they are choosing profit over life, that they are choosing profit over human beings, that they are choosing profit over our planet.”

In 2024, Vermont became the first state to require oil companies to pay for damages from extreme weather driven by climate change, after catastrophic flooding that summer. Later last year, New York also passed its own Climate Change Superfund Act, which would raise $75 billion over 25 years from the fossil fuel industry to fund climate change adaptation and mitigation projects in the state.

“These polluters should pay for the damage they have done to our communities,” Guiffra said.

Following suit, the activists say, means Pritzker would be standing up to the Trump administration, which has made 250 million acres of federal public land eligible for sale to the highest bidder, led regulatory rollbacks on polluters, and cut tax incentive programs for renewable energy projects.

“This could be the ground zero of a mass movement that puts the billionaires in check, takes power back for the people and guarantees hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of good, clean energy jobs,” said Sage Hanson, a Sunrise Movement volunteer.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CTC-L-make-polluters-pay-0720-04_231560482_21ba4f.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-07-20 21:59:47.703047

Once calm, natural beauty- and culture-filled locales, they are now dealing with what is essentially a threat of rough overtourism: overcrowding. Millions of tourists who visit these places every year are overloading local infrastructure and the environment. The results are plain to see: parks are being destroyed, ecosystems are suffering, and residents’ quality of life has dropped as their neighborhoods are overwhelmed. With these US treasures fighting the effects of unchecked tourism, the need for sustainable solutions has never been greater.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee & North Carolina

The Great Smoky Mountains National Park attracts millions annually, with 13.3 million visitors in 2023 alone, making it the most visited national park in the US. Unfortunately, this popularity has led to a range of environmental issues, from erosion to damage to delicate plant life. The nearby towns of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, famous for Dollywood, have also been heavily impacted by the surge in tourism, resulting in long waits and constant traffic congestion.

Hawaii

In 2023, Hawaii welcomed 9.7 million visitors, a number that has put immense pressure on the islands’ environment and infrastructure. The tourism boom has contributed to rising housing costs, cultural tension, and the depletion of natural resources like water. Local leaders have expressed frustration with the overwhelming impact of tourism on the state’s environment and residents’ quality of life.

Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona

A natural wonder, the Grand Canyon drew 4.7 million visitors in 2023. Unfortunately, overcrowding during peak seasons has become a persistent problem, particularly at the South Rim. The heavy traffic is contributing to the erosion of the canyon, prompting the park to implement a \$100 million plan to manage the environmental impact. Limitations on camping and other measures have been introduced to help mitigate these issues.

New York City, New York

New York City, with 62.2 million visitors in 2023, continues to be a global hotspot for travelers. However, the increasing number of tourists has driven up housing costs, with locals struggling to afford rent. The proliferation of short-term vacation rentals has exacerbated this issue, and the city has responded by implementing stricter regulations to prevent further displacement of residents and curb the effects of overtourism on local communities.

Niagara Falls, New York

Niagara Falls, one of the most iconic natural landmarks in the US, draws around 14 million visitors annually. While the American side retains its natural appeal, both sides of the Falls are plagued by overcrowding, particularly during peak tourist seasons. The environmental impact, along with strained infrastructure, is becoming increasingly evident as more people flock to see this breathtaking spectacle.

Miami, Florida

Miami saw 27.2 million visitors in 2023, and it remains a top destination for tourists from around the world. However, the influx of visitors, particularly during Spring Break, has created chaos in the city. Local authorities have been forced to impose curfews and alcohol restrictions to curb disruptive behavior. The crowded beaches, combined with a rise in crime, have made Miami a challenging place to live for its residents.

Aspen, Colorado

Aspen, known for its luxurious charm, is feeling the pressures of increased tourism. The influx of wealthy visitors has driven up property prices, resulting in gentrification that has displaced many long-time residents. The area’s wilderness is also under threat from the growing number of tourists, with increased land use putting stress on the local ecosystem.

Jackson, Wyoming

Jackson, Wyoming, a haven for outdoor enthusiasts, is grappling with similar issues. The town is experiencing an influx of tourists that is driving up housing costs and straining local infrastructure. In a 2022 survey, 80% of residents stated a preference for managing existing tourism rather than attracting more visitors, highlighting concerns over the town’s long-term sustainability.

Sedona, Arizona

Sedona, famous for its red rock formations and spiritual ambiance, attracts over 3 million visitors annually. While the tourism industry supports the local economy, the town is struggling with overcrowding, traffic congestion, and damage to its environment. The town is now advocating for state-level regulation on short-term rentals to preserve its character and limit the negative impacts of overtourism.

Charleston, South Carolina

Charleston, known for its historic architecture and charm, welcomed 7.8 million visitors in 2023. While tourism has boosted the economy, it has also led to rising housing costs and overcrowded streets. Local businesses catering to tourists have displaced longstanding shops, and residents are finding it harder to navigate the city during peak tourist seasons.

New Orleans, Louisiana

New Orleans, with 43 million visitors in 2023, has become a major destination for travelers, particularly in the French Quarter. However, the sheer volume of tourists has led to significant overcrowding, noise pollution, and the displacement of local businesses. While tourism is vital to the city’s economy, its negative impact on the local population is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore.

Zion National Park, Utah

Zion National Park has become a victim of its popularity, with the park’s narrow trails and limited parking causing frequent bottlenecks. The Angels Landing hike, one of the park’s most popular attractions, has become so overcrowded that the park implemented a permit system to manage the flow of visitors. Despite these measures, littering and vandalism remain ongoing concerns.

Bar Harbor, Maine

Bar Harbor, located near Acadia National Park, has seen a significant increase in cruise ship visitors, straining its infrastructure. While the surge in tourism has boosted the local economy, residents are concerned about overcrowding and the loss of the town’s small-town charm. To protect its character, Bar Harbor has introduced limits on the number of cruise ship visitors allowed daily.

Savannah, Georgia

Savannah, with its cobblestone streets and antebellum architecture, drew 10 million overnight visitors in 2023. The growing number of tourists has resulted in noise pollution and overcrowded streets, especially in the historic district. In response, the city has enacted measures to limit the noise created by trolley tours and maintain the peaceful atmosphere that makes Savannah unique.

Lake Tahoe, California

Lake Tahoe, a prime destination for outdoor recreation, faces overcrowding and environmental degradation due to increased tourism. The rise in visitor numbers has caused pollution, traffic congestion, and harm to the lake’s ecosystem. Local authorities are trying to mitigate the damage by implementing conservation measures and banning single-use plastics to protect the area’s natural beauty.

Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho

Yellowstone National Park, with 4.7 million visitors in 2023, is experiencing severe overcrowding, particularly during peak seasons. The park is also grappling with visitor misconduct, including littering and dangerous interactions with wildlife. In response, Yellowstone has implemented the Visitor Access Management Plan to better manage the flow of tourists and reduce environmental damage.

Mount Rushmore, South Dakota

Despite being a symbol of American history, Mount Rushmore’s popularity has led to overcrowding and complaints about long waits and disruptive behavior. In an effort to preserve the monument’s solemnity, a ban on tour flights within half a mile of the site has been enacted, aiming to reduce disturbances and restore some tranquility to this iconic landmark.

Big Sur, California

Big Sur, a stunning stretch of coastline, is grappling with the effects of overtourism. The region’s economy relies heavily on tourism, but the surge in visitors has led to overcrowding, traffic congestion, and environmental damage. Local authorities are working to find a balance between maintaining the economic benefits of tourism and protecting the region’s fragile ecosystem.

Nashville, Tennessee

Nashville’s burgeoning tourism industry, driven by the city’s country music scene, has led to rising crime rates, noise pollution, and increased living costs. The city has responded by implementing regulations on short-term rentals, but the ever-growing number of tourists continues to strain local resources and infrastructure.

Mackinac Island, Michigan

Mackinac Island, a car-free haven, draws over a million visitors each year, leading to overcrowding during peak seasons. The town, with a population of just 500, faces challenges with littering and increased traffic, and businesses struggle with staffing shortages. Despite these issues, the island’s charm continues to draw visitors, but maintaining its peaceful atmosphere is becoming increasingly difficult.

Florida Keys, Florida

The Florida Keys welcomed 4.5 million visitors in 2023, and while tourism supports the local economy, it has created a range of problems, including traffic congestion, pollution, and a lack of affordable housing. Overdevelopment has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of the region, especially in the face of hurricane evacuation challenges.

Hawaii, New York, California, Florida, Arizona, Maine, Louisiana, Wyoming, Montana, and other US icons are struggling to manage the overwhelming surge of overtourism, with crushing crowds and environmental damage threatening their sustainability. As visitor numbers rise, these destinations are facing significant challenges to protect their infrastructure and ecosystems.

Finally, tourism continues to be a critical economic engine for many US destinations, but overtourism is putting these iconic places at a breaking point. Struggling with congested streets, limited resources and enviro-urban degradation, these destinations need to strike a balance between inviting visitors and spoiling that which makes them unique. Sustainable tourism strategies and best practices are key to preserving these popular sites dynamic and strong for the generations to come.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/freepik__the-style-is-candid-image-photography-with-natural__79737-1.jpeg,N,,2025-07-20 20:03:29.572733

Since last year, 5,395 megawatts of solar capacity, 253 megawatts of wind power, and 3,821 megawatts of energy storage have been added to the Texas grid.

Solar power is a vital part of a greener future.","Renewable energy sources have stabilized the Texas power grid for peak summer demand, according to Inside Climate News.

The state's grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, reported a less than 1% chance of an emergency this summer. In 2024, the risk of grid failure was 16%.

The improvement is thanks to new energy storage and solar capacity. Since last year, 5,395 megawatts of solar capacity, 253 megawatts of wind power, and 3,821 megawatts of energy storage have been added to the Texas grid. This is slightly offset by a dip in 366 megawatts of gas power, but it's also good news for pollution.

Solar power is a vital part of a greener future. By weaning off gas power on the grid, we can diminish destructive weather patterns such as the floods that have been battering Texas. Those grid emissions also contribute to polar ice cap melt, which is raising sea levels.

Texas has had to deal with numerous outages due to its isolated grid. The state operates its own interconnection. Other states connect to wider regions, offering more access to supply when needed. That said, this isolation has allowed Texas utilities to avoid federal oversight.

Solar is a great choice for rugged individualists. In a sunny state such as Texas, one could easily bring their utility costs down to zero. Homeowners interested in generating their own power can connect with vetted local solar installers through EnergySage. It offers a free online tool that can help you get a quote and save up to $10,000 on installation costs thanks to rebates and credits.

ERCOT remains optimistic about energy distribution in Texas.

""The state of the grid is strong, it is reliable—it is as reliable as it has ever been and it is as ready for the challenges of extreme weather,"" said ERCOT CEO Pablo Vegas, per Inside Climate News. ""I feel confident that we are ready for this upcoming summer season.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Texas-power-gridimage-recweffwtZawM5XDB-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-20 21:59:56.524347

The bill terminates tax credits for Tesla EVs on September 30, making them less affordable. Additionally, rival EV companies like Rivian and Lucid may gain an advantage as their customers can still receive tax credits. The bill could further decline Tesla's EV sales, which have already seen a significant slump this year.

Tesla investors have faced significant challenges in 2025, with the stock price down by more than one-fifth year-to-date and a major slump in global electric vehicle (EV) sales. The situation has become more precarious with the passage of President Donald Trump's ""Big Beautiful"" spending bill, which was signed into law on July 4th. This bill will bring an end to federal tax credits on certain EVs, potentially impacting Tesla investors.

End of Federal Tax Credits

Federal tax incentives played a crucial role in boosting Tesla's EV sales in recent years. The bill terminates these incentives, with buyers eligible until September 30th. The federal tax credit for new EVs was $7,500, while used EVs could receive up to $4,000. This tax credit made EVs more affordable, especially given the higher purchase prices compared to gas-powered cars. The average new EV costs about $9,000 more than a new gas-powered car, while used EVs cost roughly $2,000 more [1].

Rival EV Companies Gain an Edge

One key provision in the new bill is that cars made by companies that sold more than 200,000 ""accepted"" EVs between December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2025, do not qualify for the tax credit. Tesla, which sells a significant number of cars, will be affected by this provision. In contrast, rivals such as Rivian and Lucid, which have not reached the 200,000 milestone, can still offer tax credits to their customers. This could give them a temporary edge over Tesla [2].

Potential Decline in Sales

Tesla's EV sales have already slumped in 2025, with the company posting second-quarter car sales of 384,122, a 13.5% decline from the previous year. The loss of the tax credit will likely further reduce sales, as buyers will have to pay more for Teslas without the same incentives. ""It's on Tesla to make the case for consumers to even slightly pay up today versus some other EVs,"" said Seth Goldstein, an equity strategist at Morningstar [1].

Market Implications

The expiration of the EV tax credit could significantly impact Tesla's market position. Analysts predict that the loss of this incentive could decrease sales volume, which Tesla has been struggling with. Ross Gerber, a bearish investor on Tesla, predicts the stock could fall to around $200 per share by year-end, citing the tax credit expiration as a major factor [2].

Conclusion

President Trump's ""Big Beautiful"" spending bill introduces several challenges for Tesla investors. The termination of federal tax credits for Tesla EVs, coupled with the potential boost for rival companies like Rivian and Lucid, could further decline Tesla's sales. Investors should closely monitor the situation and consider the potential impact on Tesla's stock price.

In addition, the agency is moving ahead with a plan to create a new ""Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions,"" the EPA says.
""The Trump Administration is firing hardworking scientists while employing political appointees whose job it is to lie incessantly to Congress and to the American people.
In January, the agency had 16,155 employees, but has reduced that number to 12,448, the EPA says.
The agency has also eliminated the EPA's Environmental Justice and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion arms among other cuts.","Updated July 20, 2025 at 6:15 PM CDT

The Environmental Protection Agency is planning to shutter the agency's scientific research arm that provides expertise for environmental policies and regulations, as part of the Trump administration's continuing downsizing of the federal government.

The agency is closing the Office of Research and Development, which analyzes dangers posed by a variety of hazards, including toxic chemicals, climate change, smog, wildfires, indoor air contaminants, water pollution, watershed destruction and drinking water pollutants. The office also manages grant programs that fund universities and private companies.

""Under President Trump's leadership, EPA has taken a close look at our operations to ensure the agency is better equipped than ever to deliver on our core mission of protecting human health and the environment while powering the great American comeback,"" said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in a statement announcing the plan Friday. ""This reduction in force will ensure we can better fulfill that mission while being responsible stewards of your hard-earned tax dollars.""

The cut, part of a plan to cut 23% of the EPA's staff, will save $748.8 million, according to the agency. It said the EPA would at the same time add ""laboratory functions and hundreds of scientific, technical, bioinformatic, and information technology experts to EPA's air, water, and chemical offices on top of the thousands of scientists and engineers employed by EPA within those program offices.""

In addition, the agency is moving ahead with a plan to create a new ""Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions,"" the EPA says. That new office ""will allow EPA to prioritize research and science more than ever before and put it at the forefront of rulemakings and technical assistance to states,"" according to the agency.

The EPA said in a statement to NPR that some employees were being reassigned and that no employees have been laid off yet, but 'that is the next step in the process.'""

Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, the ranking member on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, condemned the cuts.

""Administrator Zeldin has finally confirmed what he has denied for months and months — the destruction of the Office of Research and Development,"" she said in a statement. ""The Trump Administration is firing hardworking scientists while employing political appointees whose job it is to lie incessantly to Congress and to the American people. The obliteration of ORD will have generational impacts on Americans' health and safety. This is a travesty.""

Kyla Bennett, director of science policy for the nonprofit Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER), said eliminating the ORD ""will not only cripple EPA's ability to do its own research, but also to apply the research of other scientists. This [reduction in force], together with the slashing of travel and training budgets, will leave EPA flying blind and unable to use the best available science. These short-sighted cuts will ultimately affect every American, and it is despicable.""

The American Chemistry Council, which represents chemical manufacturers, said the organization ""supports EPA evaluating its resources to ensure American taxpayer dollars are being used efficiently and effectively to meet the Agency's statutory requirements. If necessary, that includes shifting resources from certain offices.""

In January, the agency had 16,155 employees, but has reduced that number to 12,448, the EPA says. The agency has also eliminated the EPA's Environmental Justice and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion arms among other cuts.

IF YOU WERE TO TALK TO VOTERS IN IOWA’S FOURTH DISTRICT, WHAT’S YOUR MESSAGE TO THEM ON WHY THEY SHOULD VOTE FOR YOU?
Your Email Address Privacy Notice Advertisement Close Up: Focusing on Iowa's 4th Congressional District On this week's episode of KCCI Close Up, we're focusing on Iowa's Fourth Congressional District, which covers much of western Iowa, along with Boone, Story and Marshall counties, and has been reliably Republican.Republican incumbent Randy Feenstra was first elected in 2020.","CLOSE UP WITH THE 2026 RACE FOR IOWA’S FOURTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IS HEATING UP. WHAT NAMES TO EXPECT ON THE BALLOT IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY AND WHY? ONE DEMOCRAT HOPES TO RAMP UP THE MOMENTUM FOR HER PARTY IN THIS HISTORICALLY REPUBLICAN DISTRICT. THIS IS IOWA’S NEWS LEADER. THIS IS KCCI EIGHT NEWS. CLOSE UP. GOOD MORNING. THANKS FOR JOINING US FOR KCCI EIGHT NEWS CLOSE UP. I’M CHIEF POLITICAL REPORTER AMANDA ROOKER. TODAY WE’RE FOCUSING ON IOWA’S FOURTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, WHICH HAS BEEN RELIABLY REPUBLICAN. IT COVERS MUCH OF WESTERN IOWA, AND IT ALSO INCLUDES BOONE, STORY AND MARSHALL COUNTIES. REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT RANDY FEENSTRA WAS FIRST ELECTED IN 2020. BEFORE THAT, REPUBLICAN STEVE KING WAS ELECTED IN 2002 TO THE AREA, WHICH WAS IOWA’S FIFTH DISTRICT THAT BECAME OBSOLETE AFTER IOWA LOST A SEAT IN THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. KING WAS REDISTRICTED AND REELECTED TO LEAD DISTRICT FOUR. IN 2012. A DEMOCRAT HASN’T HELD THE OFFICE SINCE NEIL SMITH LOST REELECTION BACK IN 1994. NOW, FEENSTRA IS WEIGHING A RUN FOR GOVERNOR INSTEAD. THAT WOULD TRIGGER A WIDE OPEN RACE FOR HIS CONGRESSIONAL SEAT. HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER MATT WINDSCHITL LAUNCHED HIS CAMPAIGN. HE HAS A LONG TRACK RECORD AT THE IOWA STATE AND SIOUXLAND CHAMBER. PRESIDENT CHRIS MCGOWAN HAS A DEEP BUSINESS BACKGROUND. KYLE LARSON DOES NOT HAVE EXPERIENCE IN PUBLIC OFFICE, BUT SAYS HE’S ENTERING THE RACE TO BE THE LEADING VOICE FOR IOWA AGRICULTURE. LARSON IS A FARMER AND A LAND APPRAISER. ASHLEY WOLF TORNABENE IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY DEMOCRAT IN THE RACE AFTER RYAN MELTON SUSPENDED HIS CAMPAIGN. SHE DOESN’T HAVE EXPERIENCE IN GOVERNMENT AND DESCRIBES HERSELF AS A STAY AT HOME MOM IN EVERYDAY IOWAN. KYLE LARSON JUST LAUNCHED HIS CAMPAIGN LAST WEEK. I TRAVELED TO HIS THIRD GENERATION FARM IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY TO HEAR ABOUT WHY HE WANTS TO GO FROM THE FARM TO WASHINGTON TO REPRESENT IOWA’S FOURTH DISTRICT. WELL, THANKS SO MUCH FOR MAKING TIME TO CHAT. WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. WHY DID YOU DECIDE THAT RIGHT NOW IS THE TIME FOR YOU TO RUN FOR CONGRESS? I STEPPED INTO THE RACE BECAUSE RURAL IOWA AND THE DISTRICT FOUR NEEDS AN HONEST VOICE THAT CARES ABOUT IOWA AGRICULTURE AND RURAL IOWA EVERY DAY AND EVERY NIGHT, NOT JUST SOMEONE THAT THINKS ABOUT IT OR SAYS IT TO GET THE VOTE. SO THAT HAS LIVED THE LIFE, LIVED IN RURAL IOWA. WATCH BESIDE THEM, WORKED IN THE BLUE ENVIRONMENT FARMS EVERY DAY. CARES ABOUT THE FAMILY FARM EVERY DAY AND DOESN’T JUST SAY IT. AND ANOTHER REASON WHY I’M GETTING IN IS BECAUSE RURAL IOWA AND DISTRICT FOUR IS SICK AND TIRED OF LIFELONG POLITICIANS AND INSIDERS SAYING WHAT, WHAT, WHAT WE NEED AND HOW WE SHOULD FARM, HOW WE SHOULD DO IT AND WHAT IS BEST FOR US. AND THIS PIPELINE ISSUE IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF INSIDERS AND LIFELONG POLITICIANS TRYING TO TELL DISTRICT FOUR WHAT’S BEST FOR THEM. AND RURAL DISTRICT FOUR IS SICK AND TIRED OF IT. COULD YOU SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND, BOTH PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY? PERSONALLY, I GREW UP RIGHT HERE IN THE HUMBOLDT COUNTY AREA, GREW UP AS A LITTLE KID ON THIS FARM. THIS FARM RIGHT HERE IS A THIRD GENERATION FARM. IT’S NOT THE BIGGEST, NOT THE FLASHIEST, BUT IT’S REAL. AND THAT’S DEAR TO ME AND DEAR TO MY FAMILY. I’M THANKFUL THAT AFTER COLLEGE, WHERE I MET MY WIFE, WE MOVED BACK RIGHT HERE, AND I’M THANKFUL THAT MY TWO LITTLE GIRLS GET TO LIVE IN RURAL IOWA, JUST LIKE I DID GO TO THE SAME CHURCH. I DID HAVE THE SAME SUNDAY SCHOOL PROGRAM I DID, AND EVENTUALLY THE SAME CONFIRMATION PROGRAM I HAD. BECAUSE CHURCH AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS IS SO IMPORTANT IN THIS DISTRICT, AND I CAN RELATE SO DEEPLY TO THAT. SOME SIMPLE THINGS WE NEED TO REMEMBER AND THINK ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO IOWA AND IOWA. DISTRICT FOUR IS WE ARE NUMBER ONE IN FARMERS IN THE DISTRICT, IN THE WHOLE US AND ALL CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS. WE PRODUCE THE MOST CORN, THE MOST SOYBEANS, THE MOST PIGS, THE MOST EGGS. AND THAT IS WHY IT’S SO IMPORTANT THAT SOMEONE FROM DISTRICT FOUR HAS A LOUD VOICE FOR AGRICULTURE, LIVES IT, AND THINKS THAT EVERY DAY AND DOESN’T JUST SAY IT TO GET THE EASY VOTE. AS A FARMER AND SOMEONE WHO HAS EXPERIENCE IN THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY, IF YOU WERE IN CONGRESS, WHAT WOULD YOU DO DIFFERENTLY THAN SOMEONE WHO IS A POLITICIAN WHO SAYS THEY REPRESENT AGRICULTURE BUT DOESN’T HAVE THAT FARMING BACKGROUND? SO FOR ME, THIS IS EASY AND STRAIGHTFORWARD. WE HAVE TO BE ON THE US HOUSE COMMITTEE AS REPRESENTATIVES OF IOWA. THE OTHER ONES ARE ON IT, BUT WE HAVE TO FIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN SHARE A SUBCOMMITTEE. AND MAYBE IF WE PLAY OUR CARDS RIGHT, ACTUALLY CHAIR THE COMMITTEE AND I GET ON DAY ONE AS A FRESHMAN, I WON’T GET THAT OPPORTUNITY, BUT I WILL FIGHT TO MAKE SURE OUR VOICE IS HEARD. IF YOU WERE ELECTED, WHAT ARE THE TOP PRIORITIES THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO ACCOMPLISH IN CONGRESS? SO AS WE TALKED ABOUT, THE FARM BILL IS SO IMPORTANT. THE FARM BILL I GET IS AN ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. IT’S A VERY TOUGH THING TO TACKLE AS A FRESHMAN CONGRESSMAN, I GET THAT. BUT ONE THING I CAN EXPRESS AND TALK FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IS THAT THERE’S THE DEATH TAX. WE HAVE TO REMOVE THE DEATH TAX COMPLETELY, ESPECIALLY FOR RURAL IOWA AND RURAL AMERICA, BECAUSE THE DEATH TAX IS A HINDRANCE ON HARDWORKING, MULTIGENERATIONAL FAMILIES. SO THERE’S MULTIPLE THINGS WE NEED TO ACCOMPLISH, AND WE NEED TO WORK WITH DONALD TRUMP AND HELP CHAMPION HIS HIS BILL AND HELP CHAMPION HIS AGENDA. I SUPPORT THE BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL, AND I AGREE, MAYBE ISN’T PERFECT, BUT IT DID SO MANY THINGS FOR RURAL IOWA AND THE IOWA ECONOMY AS A WHOLE. SOMETHING I WANT TO ACCOMPLISH THAT WE COULD WORK TOGETHER AND GET A BILL PUSHED IN TO HELP. AS DONALD TRUMP AGREES, WE NEED TO BRING MANUFACTURING BACK TO IOWA. SO THE IOWA ECONOMY DOES HAVE A BASE. THE AG ECONOMY IS WHAT MAKES OUR ECONOMY RAW. BUT WHEN THAT ROARS, WE THEN HAVE MANUFACTURING. AND I AGREE WITH THE AMERICA FIRST AGENDA. WE NEED TO GET MANUFACTURING BACK INTO IOWA AND GET MORE IN IOWA. PERFECT EXAMPLE IS WE HAVE JETCO RIGHT HERE IN HUMBOLDT WHERE THEY MAKE SIDE DUMPS AND GRAIN HOPPERS THAT HOLD OUR GRAIN TO MARKET. ITS PRODUCTS MADE RIGHT HERE. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THOSE LOCAL COMPANIES THAT ARE WORKING HARD TO THRIVE IN RURAL IOWA CAN KEEP THRIVING. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE MANUFACTURERS BRING IS THEY BRING MORE JOBS TO RURAL IOWA. RURAL IOWA IS MORE THAN JUST FARMERS. THERE’S PEOPLE THAT WORK GOOD BLUE COLLAR JOBS, AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THOSE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO THRIVE. WHAT’S YOUR MESSAGE? IF YOU WERE TO TALK TO THE VOTERS OF IOWA’S FOURTH DISTRICT, WHAT DO YOU WANT THEM TO KNOW ABOUT YOU AND WHY YOU FEEL THAT YOU’RE THE BEST CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE? I’M HONEST. I’M REAL. I WATCH SIDE BY SIDE WITH YOU. I’M HAPPY TO COME LISTEN TO YOUR COFFEE SHOP, CONVERSATIONS, TOWN HALLS. I LOVE LISTENING, LISTENING, YOUR CONCERNS GOING. I UNDERSTAND HAVING THE THE FAR LEFT TRY TO COME BACK AT ME AND I WILL LISTEN. BUT I WILL ALWAYS STAND WITH YOU AND STAND FOR YOU. BECAUSE I LIVED YOUR LIFE AND I CARE ABOUT YOUR LIFE EVERY DAY. KYLE LARSON, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING TIME TO CHAT. WE APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. WHEN WE COME BACK, THE EXPERIENCE ANOTHER CANDIDATE, CHRIS MCGOWAN, BRINGS TO THE TABLE AND HOW HIS BACKGROUND IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS SHAPING HIS CAMPAIGN PRIORITIES. WELCOME BACK TO CLOSE UP. SIOUX CITY NATIVE CHRIS MCGOWAN HAS SPENT 22 YEARS DOING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WORK IN HIS COMMUNITY. HE SAYS THAT STRONG BUSINESS BACKGROUND AND GENERATIONAL TIES TO NORTHWEST IOWA HAVE EQUIPPED HIM TO REPRESENT DISTRICT FOUR IN WASHINGTON. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. I’M VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE. WELL, YOU’RE RUNNING FOR CONGRESS. WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE THAT THIS IS THE MOMENT FOR YOU TO RUN, TO REPRESENT IOWANS IN WASHINGTON? WELL, AMANDA, I’VE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT THE FOUNDERS HAD A VISION. AND THAT VISION CALLED FOR INDIVIDUALS TO COMPLETE CAREERS OR HAVE LENGTHY CAREERS, HAVE A VOCATION, AND DEVELOP SOME EXPERIENCE AND SOME EXPERTISE, AND THEN COME AND CONTRIBUTE TO A LEGISLATIVE BODY. AT 58 YEARS OLD, I’M NEARING THE END OF MY PROFESSIONAL CAREER, AND THERE WAS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THE SERVICE. I’VE BEEN PERFORMING IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TO FOCUS ON PERHAPS REPRESENTING THE CONSTITUENTS IN IOWA, FOR THE VOTERS IN IOWA, FOR IN WASHINGTON, D.C. SO I’M EXCITED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TELL ME A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT YOURSELF, YOUR PROFESSIONAL AND YOUR PERSONAL BACKGROUND. SO I’M FROM SIOUX CITY. I GRADUATED FROM HEELAN HIGH SCHOOL IN 1985. I WRESTLED AT SAINT JOHN’S UNIVERSITY, AND I KNOW THAT THE STATE OF IOWA IS PASSIONATE ABOUT WRESTLING, AND I SHARE THAT PASSION. AFTER COLLEGE, I ENLISTED IN THE IOWA AIR NATIONAL GUARD, AND I SPENT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME IN OFFICER CANDIDATE SCHOOL AND FLIGHT SCHOOL. I THEN WENT INTO FORTUNE 500 SALES FOR A PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE MATRICULATING IN LAW SCHOOL. AND AT 32 YEARS OLD, I BECAME A NONTRADITIONAL STUDENT, EARNED A LAW DEGREE, GOING TO SCHOOL FULL TIME FOR THREE YEARS. AND I DECIDED, ALTHOUGH I HAD SAT FOR THE BAR EXAM AND PASSED THE BAR EXAM, AND I MAINTAINED A LAW LICENSE FOR 20 YEARS, I DECIDED THAT I WAS GOING TO GO INTO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND TRY AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN IN SIOUX CITY AND IN THE SIOUXLAND METRO AREA. AND THAT’S WHAT I’VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST TWO DECADES. WHAT MAKES YOU NOW WANT TO MAKE THE TRANSITION TO PUBLIC OFFICE? THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE MY COMMUNITY AND NORTHWEST IOWA, CENTRAL IOWA, IN A NEW WAY. AND AFTER 22 YEARS DOING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WORK, I’VE SPENT AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME IN WASHINGTON LOBBYING FOR ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR COMMUNITY. AND I BELIEVE THAT I CAN BE A VERY STRONG ALLY AND ADVOCATE FOR THE VOTERS IN NORTHWEST IOWA BY SERVING IN WASHINGTON, DC. IF YOU WERE ELECTED, WHAT WOULD YOUR TOP THREE PRIORITIES BE? WELL, I THINK THAT FIRST AND FOREMOST, WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON NATIONAL DEFENSE. THE FIRST AND FOREMOST RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENT, AND ESPECIALLY OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THE PROTECTION OF CITIZENS. SO NATIONAL SECURITY IS FIRST AND FOREMOST. SECONDLY, A ROBUST NATIONAL ECONOMY. I’VE SPENT MY CAREER FOCUSED ON TAX, CLIMATE, REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT, DOING EVERYTHING THAT I CAN TO PROMOTE CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN MY COMMUNITY. WE’VE RANKED OVER A DOZEN NUMBER ONE IN THE NATION OVER A DOZEN TIMES IN THE SIOUXLAND METRO. I’M VERY, VERY PROUD OF THAT. I DO BELIEVE I HAVE A LOT TO CONTRIBUTE AS IT RELATES TO RECRUITING BUSINESS AND SUPPORTING BUSINESS. AND THEN FINALLY AGRICULTURE AND SMALL BUSINESS. AS A CHAMBER EXECUTIVE, I’VE BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON VALUE ADDED AGRICULTURE, DOING WHAT WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BUSINESS CLIMATE WILL SUPPORT OUR PRODUCTS, AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY CAN GET INTO MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD FOR GOOD PRICES. FOR THOSE WHO PRODUCE PRODUCTS AND AGRICULTURAL GOODS. HOW WOULD YOUR APPROACH TO REPRESENTING IOWA’S FOURTH DISTRICT BE SIMILAR OR BE DIFFERENT TO THE LEADERSHIP OF RANDY FEENSTRA? I THINK EVERY ELECTED OFFICIAL BRINGS UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS AND SKILLS TO THE OFFICE. IN MY CASE, WE’RE GOING TO FOCUS ON MY BACKGROUND AND EDUCATION. AS I SAID, I’M AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROFESSIONAL. I’M A LAWYER BY EDUCATION, BUT I’VE NEVER PRACTICED LAW. I’VE MAINTAINED A LICENSE IN THIS STATE FOR OVER 20 YEARS, AND I’M A MILITARY VETERAN. I’M GOING TO FOCUS ON THOSE AREAS WHERE I HAVE GREAT EXPERIENCE AND HOPEFULLY A LITTLE BIT OF EXPERTISE, AND I’D LIKE TO BRING THAT EXPERIENCE TO WASHINGTON, D.C. AND MAKE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS ON BEHALF OF IOWANS. WHAT IS YOUR PITCH TO THE IOWANS OF THE FOURTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT ON WHY YOU’RE THE BEST CANDIDATE IN THE RACE? I THINK THAT IOWANS UNDERSTAND THAT THEY NEED A STRONG VOICE IN WASHINGTON, D.C., SOMEONE WHO’S NOT AFRAID TO STAND UP AND FIGHT SOME OF THE RADICAL ELEMENTS THAT ARE EMERGING IN OUR COUNTRY AT THIS TIME. I’VE SPENT 20 YEARS STANDING UP FOR IOWANS. I HAVE THE BACKGROUND, I HAVE THE EDUCATION, AND I HAVE THE EXPERIENCE TO BE THAT VOICE. AND I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT THEY WILL SUPPORT ME IN THE PRIMARY NEXT JUNE. WELL, THANKS FOR JOINING US. WE APPRECIATE IT. WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME. IT’S BEEN A PLEASURE. ANOTHER CANDIDATE WHO WANTS THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION HAS DECADES OF EXPERIENCE IN STATE GOVERNMENT. NEXT, HOW MATT WINDSCHITL SAYS THAT KNOWLEDGE WILL BENEFIT IOWANS ON CAPITOL HILL. WELCOME BACK, MATT. SAYS HIS LEGISLATIVE EXPERIENCE SETS HIM APART IN A GROWING FIELD OF REPUBLICANS WHO ALL WANT TO SERVE IOWA’S FOURTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. WINDSCHITL WAS FIRST ELECTED TO THE IOWA HOUSE AT THE AGE OF 22, 22, AND HE’S QUICKLY ROSE THROUGH THE RANKS TO HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER. I TALKED TO HIM ABOUT WHY HE WANTS TO BRING THAT EXPERIENCE TO CONGRESS. THANKS FOR MAKING TIME TO CHAT WITH US. WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. HAPPY TO AMANDA. THANK YOU. WHY ARE YOU RUNNING FOR CONGRESS AND WHY RIGHT NOW? YOU KNOW, RUNNING FOR CONGRESS WAS NEVER ON MY BINGO CARD. I’VE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE APPROACH ME OVER MY 19 GOING ON 20 YEARS IN SERVICE IN THE STATEHOUSE AND SAY, HEY, WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO DC? AND I’VE ALWAYS JUST BEEN LIKE, NO, NOT MY, NOT MY GAME. RIGHT. BUT AS THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE IN IOWA IS SHIFTING, A LOT OF PEOPLE REACHED OUT TO ME AFTER CONGRESSMAN FEENSTRA, WHO’S DONE A FANTASTIC JOB, HAS STARTED HIS ENDEAVOR TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE FOURTH WHO I’VE KNOWN, WHO I’VE REPRESENTED THREE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS, BUT I’VE KNOWN SO MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE, HAD SO MANY DIFFERENT CONSTITUENTS JUST REACH OUT AND SAY, WOULD YOU AT LEAST CONSIDER IT? AND I KNOW THAT THE CONSTITUENTS OF IOWA FOUR NEED A PROVEN LEADER, SOMEBODY THAT HAS BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ON DIFFERENT CHALLENGES, HAS A TRACK RECORD OF SUCCESS. AND I CAN POINT TO ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT I’VE DONE OVER 19 YEARS. NOT EVERYBODY’S GOING TO AGREE WITH ME 100%, BUT LIKE I’VE BEEN THERE, I’VE BEEN IN THE TRENCHES. AND SO WHAT GOD LAID ON MY HEART WAS, YOU’VE GOT A HEART OF SERVICE. CONTINUE TO PUT YOURSELF OUT THERE, AND THEN IT’S GOING TO BE UP TO THE VOTERS OF IOWA FOR FOR VOTERS WHO MAY NOT KNOW YOU YET. WHAT DO YOU WANT VOTERS TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND AND WHAT DRIVES YOU? IT GOES BACK TO MY HEART OF SERVICE. I’VE BEEN SWORN AN OATH TO THE CONSTITUTION SINCE I WAS 17 YEARS OLD, WHEN I FIRST JOINED THE MARINE CORPS, RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. RIGHT. AND IT’S ABOUT PUTTING YOURSELF OUT THERE WHEN GOD IMBUES YOU WITH TALENTS. AND I’M NOT SAYING I’M PERFECT. I’M NOT. BUT WHEN GOD IMBUES YOU WITH CERTAIN TALENTS, YOU NEED TO EXERCISE THOSE TALENTS. AND SO I WANT TO CONTINUE TO SERVE IOWANS IN THIS CAPACITY, BUT ALSO ALL AMERICANS. IF YOU WERE ELECTED, WHAT WOULD YOUR TOP PRIORITIES BE IN CONGRESS? WELL, THERE’S QUITE A FEW DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW, RIGHT? ONE OF THEM IS GOING TO BE NATIONAL SECURITY. AND THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS HAVE DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB IN TRYING TO SECURE OUR BORDERS NATIONALLY, BUT IT’S ALSO A GLOBAL PICTURE, LIKE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE CONTINUING TO BE THE DOMINANT FORCE ON THE GLOBE. WE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT STAND UP FOR OUR ALLIES. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY IS TAKEN CARE OF. AND I’M NOT A FARMER, BUT I’VE GOT A LOT OF CONSTITUENTS THAT ARE FARMERS. I’VE TALKED WITH THEM, I’VE DONE FARM TOURS. I’M GOING TO BE DOING SOME MORE. JUST TRYING TO HELP UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE ISSUES ARE AND HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO BE THE BEST AGRICULTURAL STATE AND FEED THE WORLD. AND THEN, YOU KNOW, AS A VETERAN MYSELF, I UNDERSTAND THE VETERANS ISSUES, AND I’VE GONE THROUGH MY OWN BATTLES WITH THE VA BEFORE. AND TRUST ME, IT’S NOT GOING TO TELL YOU ALL THE HORROR STORIES, BUT IT’S NOT EASY. AND OUR VETERANS NEED TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. AND I’M NOT SAYING THAT THEY’RE BEING FAILED RIGHT NOW, BUT JUST MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCES AND TALKING WITH OTHER VETERANS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE IMPROVEMENTS THAT NEED TO BE MADE. AND THEN ANOTHER COMPONENT IS THE NATIONAL DEBT. I GOT TWO DAUGHTERS, 18 AND 20, AND YOU LOOK AT 36, $37 TRILLION IN DEBT. WE’RE SADDLING THE NEXT GENERATIONS WITH SO MUCH BURDEN. WE HAVE TO TACKLE THAT ISSUE. AND I KNOW IT’S DIFFICULT, AND I DON’T HAVE A SILVER BULLET SOLUTION, BUT I WANT TO GO OUT AND I WANT TO DO WHAT I’VE ALWAYS DONE. I WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. I WANT TO HELP MOVE THOSE THINGS FORWARD. WHAT ARE YOU THE PROUDEST OF? OF WHAT YOU’VE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE IOWA HOUSE? WELL, I’VE BEEN DOING THIS SO LONG. THERE’S SO MANY THINGS THAT I’M PROUD OF. PROTECTING THE UNBORN. WE’VE MADE MASSIVE STRIDES FROM THE FIRST TIME THAT I STARTED IN OFFICE TO WHERE WE’RE AT NOW TO PROTECT THE UNBORN. WE HAVE MADE MASSIVE STRIDES TO RESTORE SECOND AMENDMENT FREEDOMS TO IOWANS. CUTTING TAXES IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER ONE. I MEAN, PEOPLE SAID, YOU GUYS CAN’T CUT TAXES THE WAY THAT YOU’RE DOING. IT’S TOO AGGRESSIVE. THE BUDGET WILL NEVER STAND UP FOR THAT. WELL GUESS WHAT? IT’S WORKING. WE’RE DOWN TO A 3.8% FLAT TAX HERE IN IOWA, AND OUR BUDGET IS WORKING JUST FINE. WE’RE FUNDING THE PRIORITIES OF IOWANS. WE’RE HELPING MAKE SURE THEY’VE GOT GOOD INFRASTRUCTURE, GOOD SCHOOLS, GOOD HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS, GOOD LAW ENFORCEMENT, ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT YES, I AM PROUD OF, BUT IT IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT. I CAN’T TAKE CREDIT FOR ANY SINGULAR ISSUE BECAUSE I’M JUST ONE VOTE OUT OF 150. IF YOU WERE TO TALK TO THE VOTERS OF IOWA’S FOURTH DISTRICT, WHAT MESSAGE DO YOU WANT THEM TO HEAR ON WHY YOU THINK YOU’RE THE BEST CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE. I’VE GOT A HEART OF SERVICE. I’VE GOT A TRACK RECORD OF PROVEN LEADERSHIP. I’M A CONSERVATIVE. THEY KNOW ME, THEY’VE SEEN ME. AND I WILL POINT TO MY RECORD AND STAND ON MY RECORD EVERY DAY. WELL, MATT WINDSCHITL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING TIME TO CHAT. WE APPRECIATE IT. MY PLEASURE, I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. FILLING THE GAP. WHY THE ONLY DEMOCRAT IN THE RACE FOR DISTRICT FOUR SAYS SHE’S UP FOR THE CHALLENGE NEXT. HOW ASHLEY WOLFE IS FOCUSING HER CAMPAIGN ON SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE GROUPS OF IOWANS. WELCOME BACK TO CLOSE UP. TODAY, WE’RE FOCUSING IN ON IOWA’S FOURTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT RANDY FEENSTRA IS CONSIDERING A RUN FOR GOVERNOR INSTEAD OF REELECTION IN 2026. THREE OTHER REPUBLICANS HAVE LAUNCHED CAMPAIGNS, SETTING UP A REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. NOW, THE DISTRICT HAS HAD A REPUBLICAN LEADER FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. FEENSTRA BEAT DEMOCRAT RYAN MELTON IN A REMATCH OF 2022 BY ABOUT 34 POINTS. MELTON LAUNCHED AND THEN SUSPENDED HIS CAMPAIGN FOR 2026. THAT ENCOURAGED STAY AT HOME MOM ASHLEY TORNABENE TO LAUNCH HER OWN CAMPAIGN LAST WEEK. WHY ARE YOU RUNNING FOR CONGRESS RIGHT NOW? WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE TO GET INTO THE RACE? WE ALL LOOK AROUND AND WE SEE IOWANS AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY HURTING, WHILE THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE REST OF US JUST GET LEFT BEHIND. AND I’VE BEEN TAUGHT MY WHOLE LIFE BY MY PARENTS AND BY SUNDAY SCHOOL THAT WE HELP PEOPLE IN NEED. AND FOR A LONG TIME I’VE THOUGHT, I’VE FELT CALLED TO HELP PEOPLE IN NEED BY SERVING IN PUBLIC OFFICE. BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO HAVE TO BE MUCH LATER IN LIFE SINCE I’M A MOM. BUT WHEN RYAN MELTON HAD TO UNFORTUNATELY SUSPEND HIS CAMPAIGN, I FELT THAT IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET A CANDIDATE TO PICK UP A PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATE, TO PICK UP WHERE HE LEFT OFF. SO WE DON’T LOSE OUR MOMENTUM THAT HE HAS WORKED SO HARD TO ATTAIN. AND SO IT FELT LIKE GOD WAS TELLING ME THE TIME IS NOW TO HELP PEOPLE IN THIS WAY. WHAT DO YOU WANT VOTERS TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND AND WHAT DRIVES YOU? RIGHT? WELL, RIGHT NOW I AM A STAY AT HOME MOM. DUE TO SOME VERY TIGHT BUDGETING. BUT BEFORE THAT I WAS AN INSTRUCTIONAL ASSISTANT AT MY PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT, AND THAT TAUGHT ME ABOUT A LOT ABOUT THE NEEDS OF THE EDUCATE THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. AND BEFORE THAT, I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF HELPING GUIDE PEOPLE, YOUNG PEOPLE, THROUGH THEIR FAITH JOURNEY, THE BEGINNING OF THEIR FAITH JOURNEY AS THE DIRECTOR OF CHRISTIAN EDUCATION AT THE CHURCH I GREW UP IN AND STILL BELONG TO. AND SO NO, I DON’T HAVE THE EXPERIENCE THAT SOME OF MY SOME OF THE PEOPLE CURRENTLY IN CONGRESS HAVE. BUT A LOT OF THAT EXPERIENCE THEY HAVE IS IN SERVING SPECIAL INTERESTS. AND SO I’M AN EVERYDAY PERSON. I’M REALLY GOING TO LISTEN TO EVERYDAY PEOPLE, AND I’M NOT GOING TO SERVE THE SPECIAL INTERESTS. I’M GOING TO SERVE YOU. WHAT ARE YOUR TOP PRIORITIES THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO ACCOMPLISH IN CONGRESS IF YOU WERE ELECTED? WE NEED TO REBUILD PUBLIC EDUCATION, WHICH IS UNDER ATTACK RIGHT NOW. WE NEED TO REBUILD SMALL TOWNS, AND WE NEED TO PROVIDE RURAL HEALTH CARE AND PROTECT THE VULNERABLE, SUCH AS THOSE IN THE LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY WHO ARE UNDER ATTACK. AND WE NEED TO CREATE A FEASIBLE PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP, WHICH WE’VE BEEN CLOSE TO IN THE PAST. BUT IT SEEMS THAT SOME PEOPLE WANT TO KEEP THAT AS AN ISSUE TO RUN ON. BUT MY BIGGEST PRIORITY IS THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO ALL IN AMERICA. ALL OF THE US CITIZENS, LIKE THE HAPPIEST COUNTRIES ON EARTH, HAVE ANYONE WHO TRIES TO MAKE US AFRAID OF THAT TYPE OF HEALTH CARE, SAYING THAT THE TAXES ARE TOO HIGH OR THE WAIT TIMES ARE TOO LONG. WE KNOW THAT THESE HAPPY COUNTRIES HAVE IT, AND THEY’RE STILL THE HAPPIEST. AND THE UNITED STATES ISN’T EVEN IN THE TOP 20. AND SO WE KNOW THAT THE THAT, THAT THAT THOSE FEAR TACTICS ABOUT PUBLICLY FUNDED UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE ARE JUST THAT THEY’RE FEAR TACTICS AND THEY MUST BE SPEAKING IF THESE PEOPLE ARE IN PUBLIC OFFICE, THEY’RE SPEAKING FOR THE PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES RATHER THAN FOR THE EVERYDAY PEOPLE. THEY’RE SUPPOSED TO BE REPRESENTING. YOU’RE RUNNING IN IOWA’S MOST REPUBLICAN DISTRICT. HOW DO YOU PLAN TO WIN OVER NOT ONLY DEMOCRATIC VOTERS, BUT ALSO REPUBLICAN AND INDEPENDENT VOTERS? THE LAST TWO DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE RUN IN THIS DISTRICT HAVE RECEIVED 30 TO 37% OF THE VOTE. SO ABOUT 1 IN 3 VOTERS AND THOSE 1 IN 3 VOTERS MATTER TO ME AND I, I’M HAPPY TO BE GIVING THEM A VOICE. THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE. THEY’LL HOPEFULLY FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH VOTING FOR. BUT I ALSO DO WANT TO SPEAK WITH PEOPLE FROM RURAL IOWA, PEOPLE WHO MAY BE REPUBLICAN, PEOPLE WHO MAY BE INDEPENDENT, PEOPLE WHO MAYBE ONLY VOTE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND LET THEM KNOW THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP OURSELVES TO CREATE A HAPPIER, HEALTHIER IOWA BY ELECTING SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO REPRESENT THEM INSTEAD OF THE SPECIAL INTERESTS AND THE BILLIONAIRES. IF YOU WERE TO TALK TO VOTERS IN IOWA’S FOURTH DISTRICT, WHAT’S YOUR MESSAGE TO THEM ON WHY THEY SHOULD VOTE FOR YOU? I AM GOING TO LISTEN TO YOU, AND I’M GOING TO BRING YOU ALONG ON THIS JOURNEY TO HELP MAKE IOWA A HAPPIER, HEALTHIER PLACE. WE CAN MAKE IT BETTER TOGETHER. AND I’LL DO THAT BY LISTENING TO YOU AND WORKING FOR YOU INSTEAD OF WORKING FOR THE BILLIONAIRES. LIKE SO MANY IN CONGRESS ALREADY ARE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN FOR MAKING TIME TO CHAT. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING. WE’LL SEE YOU BACK HERE NEXT SUNDAY. HAVE A GREAT DAY.

The Environmental Protection Agency is planning to shutter the agency's scientific research arm that provides expertise for environmental policies and regulations, as part of the Trump administration's continuing downsizing of the federal government.

The agency is closing the Office of Research and Development, which analyzes dangers posed by a variety of hazards, including toxic chemicals, climate change, smog, wildfires, indoor air contaminants, water pollution, watershed destruction and drinking water pollutants. The office also manages grant programs that fund universities and private companies.

""Under President Trump's leadership, EPA has taken a close look at our operations to ensure the agency is better equipped than ever to deliver on our core mission of protecting human health and the environment while powering the great American comeback,"" said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in a statement announcing the plan Friday. ""This reduction in force will ensure we can better fulfill that mission while being responsible stewards of your hard-earned tax dollars.""

The cut, part of a plan to cut 23% of the EPA's staff, will save $748.8 million, according to the agency. It said the EPA would at the same time add ""laboratory functions and hundreds of scientific, technical, bioinformatic, and information technology experts to EPA's air, water, and chemical offices on top of the thousands of scientists and engineers employed by EPA within those program offices.""

In addition, the agency is moving ahead with a plan to create a new ""Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions,"" the EPA says. That new office ""will allow EPA to prioritize research and science more than ever before and put it at the forefront of rulemakings and technical assistance to states,"" according to the agency.

The EPA said in a statement to NPR that some employees were being reassigned and that no employees have been laid off yet, but 'that is the next step in the process.'""

Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, the ranking member on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, condemned the cuts.

""Administrator Zeldin has finally confirmed what he has denied for months and months — the destruction of the Office of Research and Development,"" she said in a statement. ""The Trump Administration is firing hardworking scientists while employing political appointees whose job it is to lie incessantly to Congress and to the American people. The obliteration of ORD will have generational impacts on Americans' health and safety. This is a travesty.""

Kyla Bennett, director of science policy for the nonprofit Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER), said eliminating the ORD ""will not only cripple EPA's ability to do its own research, but also to apply the research of other scientists. This [reduction in force], together with the slashing of travel and training budgets, will leave EPA flying blind and unable to use the best available science. These short-sighted cuts will ultimately affect every American, and it is despicable.""

Traditionally, its production requires large amounts of purified water, which poses a significant challenge in regions facing water scarcity. However, a pioneering team of researchers from RMIT University has developed an innovative approach that utilizes wastewater instead of freshwater, transforming a global environmental issue into a valuable resource. By leveraging the metals present in wastewater, this experimental technology not only creates green hydrogen but also offers a potential solution to the problem of untreated wastewater being released into the environment.

Metal-rich Waste Becomes Resource

In an inspiring breakthrough, researchers have found a way to use metals like platinum, chromium, and nickel found in wastewater to enhance the hydrogen production process. These metals, instead of being filtered out, are captured and utilized as catalysts. Associate Professor Nasir Mahmood from RMIT’s School of Science explains that their innovation taps into wastewater’s inherent materials, eliminating the need for purified water or additional processing steps.

The team developed special electrodes with an absorbent carbon surface, which draws metals from the wastewater. These metals then form stable catalysts, aiding in the conduction of electricity and accelerating the water-splitting process. By interacting with other elements in the wastewater, these metals boost the electrochemical reactions necessary for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. The carbon material for these electrodes is derived from agricultural waste, adding another layer of sustainability to the system.

A Hidden Ocean of Hydrogen Found in Siberia Could Fuel the Planet for Generations and Disrupt the Entire Fossil Fuel Economy

Green Fuel, Cleaner Water

During laboratory tests, researchers inserted two electrodes into a container of partially treated wastewater and powered the system with renewable energy. At the cathode, water molecules gained electrons, releasing hydrogen gas; at the anode, they lost electrons, producing oxygen. The oxygen produced can be reintegrated into wastewater treatment plants to enhance their efficiency by reducing organic content, according to Mahmood.

The system showed robustness, operating continuously for 18 days with minimal performance decline. The wastewater used was pre-treated to remove solids, organic matter, and nutrients, making the experiment representative of real-world applications. This innovation is part of a broader initiative to develop catalytic systems that utilize challenging water sources such as wastewater and seawater for clean hydrogen production.

Addressing Pollution and Water Scarcity

RMIT’s cutting-edge technology offers dual benefits by tackling both pollution and water scarcity issues. By using wastewater, the process not only reduces pollution but also makes use of materials that are often considered waste. Professor Nicky Eshtiaghi from RMIT’s School of Engineering highlights that this innovation benefits both the energy and water sectors.

The research team is now seeking industry and government partners to scale up the technology. Co-researcher Dr. Muhammad Haris emphasizes the need for further research to test the method across various types of wastewater, ensuring its universal applicability. The study, published in ACS Electrochemistry, opens a new chapter in sustainable fuel production, turning a global environmental liability into a productive asset.

Future Prospects and Challenges

While this innovation holds immense potential, challenges remain in scaling the technology for widespread use. Partnerships with industry and government will be crucial for commercializing the technology. The team is optimistic about the future, but acknowledges that extensive testing with different wastewater types is essential to confirm the method’s versatility. As the world grapples with increasing energy demands and environmental concerns, this approach could become a vital tool in the transition to sustainable energy sources.

The quest for sustainability often presents complex challenges, yet solutions like this one provide hope for a cleaner, more efficient future. As we look toward the widespread adoption of green hydrogen technology, we must ask ourselves: How can we best support innovations that promise to transform our environmental challenges into opportunities?

BRASÍLIA (DF) – Of the 91 federal deputies that make up the Amazon bloc in Brazil’s Chamber of Deputies, 67 voted in favor of Bill 2159/2021, which establishes the General Environmental Licensing Law in Brazil — dubbed by environmentalists as the “Devastation Bill.” This represents nearly 75% of the Amazon region’s representatives in the Lower House. The remaining 24 were split between 18 who abstained and only six who voted against the bill.

The proposal was approved early on Thursday morning, July 17, with 267 votes in favor and 116 against. Originating in the Chamber of Deputies, the bill was sent to the Senate, where it underwent 32 changes. According to environmental caucuses in Congress, these amendments made the bill — already considered harmful since 2021 — even worse.

Of the nine Amazon-region state caucuses in the Chamber, only that of Tocantins — with eight deputies — voted unanimously in favor of the bill. It was followed by Mato Grosso and Rondônia, which each had seven supporters. Two deputies were absent: Emanuel Pinheiro (MDB-MT) and Lúcio Mosquini (MDB-RO).

The vote on the Licensing Bill concluded at 3:40 a.m. on Thursday, the 17th (Bruno Spada/Chamber of Deputies)

The Acre and Amazonas caucuses each contributed six votes in favor. Only deputies Socorro Neri (PP-AC) and Amom Mandel (Cidadania-AM) voted against, while Meire Serafim (União-AC) and Pauderney Avelino (União-AM) did not vote.

Of Pará’s 17 deputies, 12 supported the “Devastation Bill.” The opposition came from PT representatives Airton Faleiro and Dilvanda Faro, in line with their party’s orientation against the proposal. Elcione Barbalho, Renilce Nicodemos, and José Priante, all from MDB, did not vote.

Maranhão, a state with part of its territory in the Amazon and the largest regional caucus in the Chamber, gave 12 of its 18 votes in favor. Only deputy Márcio Jerry (PCdoB) voted against, while Hildo Rocha (MDB), Junior Lourenço (PL), Marreca Filho (PRD), Pedro Lucas (União), and Rubens Pereira Jr. (PT) did not vote.

Of the eight Roraima deputies, five voted in favor and three abstained: Albuquerque (REP), Defensor Stélio Dener (REP), and Helena Lima (MDB). The Amapá caucus contributed the fewest votes proportionally — four in favor. Deputy Dorinaldo Malafaia (PDT) was the only one to vote against. Professora Goreth (PDE), Silvia Waiãpi (PL), and Sonize Barbosa (PL) did not vote.

There had been expectations that the vote would be postponed until after the legislative recess in August. However, a decision by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes to strike down a congressional decree on the IOF tax, combined with President Lula’s move to veto the bill that would increase the number of deputies, left no room for negotiation. The vote on the Licensing Bill was thus concluded at 3:40 a.m. on Thursday.

Upon closing the session, Chamber President Hugo Motta (Republicanos-PB) stated that the text meets “nearly 70%” of the government’s demands. Furthermore, once a bill returns from the Senate, the Chamber can only approve or reject amendments — no further changes are allowed.

“Until the last moment, before bringing the bill to the floor, we tried to negotiate with the government, with leader José Guimarães, with the Chief of Staff, to build consensus on a bill that would be good for the country. We respected all differing positions,” said Motta.

With the approval of Bill 2159/2023, the measure now awaits either sanction or veto from President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who has 15 days to decide. If Lula vetoes the bill in whole or in part, Congress can still override the decision.

Proposed changes

According to the Agência Câmara, the bill’s rapporteur, deputy Zé Vitor (PL-MG), incorporated 29 of the 32 amendments made by the Senate. Among the most controversial changes are the License by Adhesion and Commitment (LAC) and the Special Environmental License (LAE), both introduced in the Senate plenary by Senate President Davi Alcolumbre (União-AP). Another new license, the Unified Environmental License (LAU), combines all existing licenses into a single one.

Currently, Brazil lacks a General Environmental Licensing Law. The process is governed at the federal level by Resolution 237/1997 of the National Environmental Council (Conama), a collegiate body of the National Environmental System (Sisnama), created by Law 6.938 of 1981. States and municipalities also have their own regulations, as does the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama).

The current licensing model is known as the three-phase system, involving the Preliminary License (LP), Installation License (LI), and Operation License (LO). The bill approved by Congress expands this to seven types of licenses, with defined deadlines for issuance, validity, and renewal. In addition to the three existing ones, it introduces the LAC, LAE, LAU, and the Corrective Operation License (LOC).

Under the License by Adhesion and Commitment (LAC), developers must complete a form pledging to comply with regulations — with no requirement for technical review. Critics argue this is risky, as the mechanism will now apply to projects with medium environmental impact, not just minor ones as before.

The LAE, presented by Alcolumbre, would apply to strategic projects — to be defined by presidential decree — and could exempt them from licensing altogether. This amendment comes amid ongoing debate over oil exploration in the Equatorial Margin, 500 kilometers off the Amapá coast.

Some exempt activities

The new bill also defines various activities exempt from licensing, including: cultivation of agricultural species and extensive/semi-intensive livestock farming; small-scale intensive livestock farming; agro-research activities without biological risk; military projects; low-impact developments; emergency interventions; public electricity distribution works up to 69 kV; sorting and recycling plants for solid and construction waste; composting yards and structures.

An amendment by Senator Eduardo Braga (MDB), introduced in the Senate and upheld in the Chamber, waives licensing for previously paved roads — including BR-319, which connects Manaus (AM) to Porto Velho (RO). This is seen as a way to bypass longstanding licensing obstacles from Ibama.

Another provision that has sparked outrage among social movements requires public consultations only for projects that impact recognized Indigenous and quilombola lands — leaving unregularized areas unprotected.

As the world pivots towards sustainable energy solutions, traditional methods of lithium extraction are proving inadequate both economically and environmentally. The University of Connecticut is at the forefront of developing innovative methods to sustainably extract lithium from geothermal brines found in domestic regions. This revolutionary approach not only promises to meet the growing demand but also drastically reduces environmental impacts associated with lithium production.

Addressing Growing Lithium Demand for EVs

The explosive growth of the electric vehicle market has placed unprecedented pressure on lithium supplies, a vital component of EV batteries. According to Burcu Beykal, a lead researcher from the University of Connecticut, the current global supply chain is insufficient to meet this surge in demand. Most lithium today is sourced from limited regions, creating significant supply chain vulnerabilities. The team’s research is focused on tapping into domestic geothermal brines, particularly in areas like California’s Salton Sea, which could provide a more stable supply.

These geothermal brines, when pumped to the surface, not only generate electricity but also offer a rich source of minerals, including lithium. By integrating mineral extraction with geothermal energy production, the researchers aim to create a dual-purpose system that boosts resource efficiency. This novel approach could significantly lower the carbon footprint of lithium production, aligning with global sustainability goals and reducing dependency on foreign lithium sources.

Mathematical Models to Determine Optimal Locations

To ensure the economic viability of this new extraction method, the research team has developed comprehensive mathematical models. Led by graduate student Hasan Nikkhah, these models analyze optimal sites for extraction, battery manufacturing, and EV production across the United States. By simulating the entire supply chain, the team aims to minimize costs and decrease reliance on imports, which are often burdened by high transportation costs.

An essential component of this initiative is the creation of an “end-to-end digital twin” of the production process. This virtual model allows the team to conduct techno-economic assessments and lifecycle analyses, evaluating both the feasibility and environmental impact of their methods. Their approach stands in contrast to traditional extraction methods, which are typically resource-intensive, highlighting the innovative and sustainable nature of their work.

Evaluating Other Unconventional Sources

In addition to geothermal brines, the researchers are investigating other unconventional lithium sources, such as seawater, clays, and recycled batteries. Collaborators from the Université de Liège and KU Leuven are working alongside UConn to expand the computational models to these new sources. Highlighting the strategic importance of lithium, Nikkhah notes that a robust domestic supply chain could bolster national security and economic resilience.

This initiative could potentially create over 100,000 direct jobs in the U.S., fostering a self-sufficient and resilient lithium supply chain. By embracing a comprehensive approach to lithium extraction and supply chain optimization, the research team is paving the way for a future where the U.S. can independently meet its lithium needs, supporting the booming EV market and beyond.

The Future of Lithium Extraction

The UConn research team’s efforts to develop a sustainable lithium extraction method signify a transformative shift in how we approach critical mineral procurement. By leveraging domestic geothermal resources and integrating advanced computational models, the team is not only addressing immediate supply chain challenges but also setting a precedent for future resource management strategies.

As technology continues to evolve, the potential applications for such innovative extraction methods are vast. The successful implementation of these strategies could see the U.S. emerging as a leader in sustainable lithium production, significantly impacting the global market. This raises the question: As we continue to innovate and adapt, how will these advancements redefine our approach to resource sustainability and energy independence?

While the Trump administration has taken action to eliminate environmental justice (EJ) programs at the federal level, state programs with EJ laws and policies remain in place and apply to regulated entities.

These state EJ programs remain fully applicable, and as often occurs in the absence of federal actions in a given area, states may increase their EJ activities. Some states have already signaled interest in expanding their EJ activities.

However, the regulated community should be aware of potential tensions between federal law and policy, and state programs. State programs could ultimately be subject to future scrutiny by the Trump administration as has occurred in other areas.

As businesses continue to navigate this dynamic, EJ and other effective means of community engagement remain valuable opportunities to mitigate risks of challenges to project development and build meaningful relationships in the communities in which they operate.

Background and Recent Actions on EJ By the Trump Administration

EJ, historically defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the “fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations and policies,” experienced an unprecedented renaissance under the Biden administration. Bipartisan legislation such as the Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) allocation of billions of dollars to advance environmental health in historically overburdened communities compounded this paradigm shift.

However, federal EJ policy—which has never been enshrined in any binding federal authority—is uniquely susceptible to shifting political winds. As demonstrated by the Trump administration’s slew of executive orders (EOs) issued almost immediately upon assuming office, the era of federal prioritization of EJ has been replaced by one in which the federal government has become actively antagonistic to its previous EJ initiatives—and, at times, antagonistic to the regulated community’s approach to EJ. The Trump administration has reversed many prior federal actions on EJ, including through the following actions:

EO 14148, Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions, which revoked Biden-era EJ EOs expanding the federal government’s commitment to addressing EJ in the context of revoking prior diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives;

EO 14173, Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity, went a step further, withdrawing the 1994 EO 12898, the first federal action requiring agencies to systematically consider EJ as a part of their respective activities, and, until a few years ago, represented the only express federal EJ authority;

EO 14151, Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing, directed agencies to “terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law,” all EJ offices and positions; and,

EO 14154, Unleashing American Energy, instructed agencies to immediately pause disbursement of funds appropriated under the IRA or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

More recently, the administration released EO 14281, Restoring Equality of Opportunity and Meritocracy, which instructs DOJ to repeal or amend all disparate impact regulations derived from Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that prohibits acts that have an unjustified disparate impact on the basis of race, color, or national origin, even without evidence of discriminatory intent. In the context of EJ, claims of “disparate impact” have been used to challenge federal actions such as permitting decisions and uses of federal funding that allegedly have an adverse and disproportionate impact based on race, color, or national origin.

Agencies have moved quickly to implement the EOs. For example, EPA has eliminated its Office of Environmental Justice and Civil Rights, placed 168 employees involved with EJ work on leave (then subsequently reinstated some of them), canceled hundreds of grants designed to fund EJ projects, and removed EJScreen—its hallmark EJ mapping and screening tool that has existed for almost a decade—from its website. In late January, the Department of Energy (DOE) directed the suspension of all initiatives requiring, using, or enforcing community benefits plans designed to direct the benefits from federal investments to workers and communities, including in binding contracts the previous DOE administration had entered into with grantees.

In February, the Department of Justice (DOJ) terminated its Office of Environmental Justice. In one of her first actions as U.S. Attorney General, Pam Bondi ordered each component of DOJ to confirm the termination of all EJ programs, offices, and jobs by March 15, and rescind all prior EJ policies, directives, and guidance within two days. In April, DOJ terminated its first EJ-focused settlement agreement with the Alabama Department of Public Health and Lowndes County under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 addressing alleged inequities in access to basic sanitation services. The agreement required the state to, among other things, conduct a comprehensive assessment of appropriate septic and wastewater management systems and suspend the criminal enforcement of sanitation laws where violations were based on a failure to afford basic septic systems. At the same time, the fate of all DOJ and EPA disparate impact regulations under Title VI hang in the balance as the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana—after enjoining EPA and DOJ from these regulations in the state of Louisiana—considers whether or not to vacate the regulations in their entirety.

Implications for the Regulated Community

The reversal of EJ policies, even if somewhat anticipated, nonetheless puts the regulated community—particularly companies operating in states with standalone EJ laws on the books and companies that recently ramped up their EJ efforts in response to Biden-era policies—in a precarious position. States have continued implementing and enforcing their EJ laws and policies. We may see an increase in state EJ activity, NGO advocacy, and litigation in an attempt to fill the void created by the new administration. At the same time, the administration has warned state agencies not to use federal dollars to advance EJ programs. The administration has also set a precedent of threatening to pull—and actually withholding—federal funds from entities that do not comply with its anti-DEI policies—and could do the same with EJ. The administration could also target EJ laws in a similar fashion to its recently-filed challenges to laws in New York and Vermont relating to climate change.

This landscape affords little predictability, certainty, or clarity regarding how the regulated community should act when facing conflicts between state and federal directives on EJ. Ultimately, how the federal government engages with independent state EJ laws remains to be seen. Early signs, however, suggest that the federal government may not impede states from implementing their own independent EJ laws and policies—as long as federal funding is not involved. For example, EPA Region 2 recently upheld a Clean Air Act Title V major source permit issued by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection that contains EJ requirements stemming from New Jersey’s 2020-era landmark EJ law. At the same time, failure to comply with applicable state or local laws and regulations could result in immediate adverse consequences, such as an enforcement response or permit-denial—even as the federal government continues to dismantle EJ programs and policies.

Some situations may present novel questions for businesses operating consistent with state EJ programs. For instance, EO 14173 requires federal contractors to certify that they do not have DEI programs, and DOJ recently launched an enforcement initiative targeting recipients of federal funding that have DEI policies. Could abiding by state EJ mandates implicate this requirement? Or could federal funding, or some other link to federal law (such as a joint federal-state enforcement action) change the applicable legal analysis? The possibility that the federal government may take further steps with respect to state EJ programs may also raise concerns for those participating in such programs.

Although companies should be aware of these issues, they should continue to stay engaged in community relations efforts to mitigate oppositional risks, smooth the way for project development, and cultivate meaningful relationships with communities. At its core, EJ is fundamentally about being a good neighbor—something that can only be good for business.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-07/Environmental%20Justice%20Leafy%20Scales%20Green%20Plants_0.jpg.webp?itok=cnh9g_px,N,,2025-07-20 16:59:40.852246

The passage of President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” in July 2025 has dramatically altered the national energy landscape by repealing key tax incentives for wind and solar projects after 2027, while preserving longer-lasting subsidies for fossil fuels, nuclear power, and select dispatchable sources.

For Texas, the stakes are enormous. The state leads the nation in wind power and is rapidly expanding solar and battery storage. Yet, analysts warn that without federal tax credits, more than 77 gigawatts of planned clean energy projects—enough to power roughly 19 million homes—may be abandoned over the next decade. The resulting shift could raise average household electricity bills in Texas by over $220 per year by 2030 and by nearly $500 by 2035. An estimated 94,000 clean energy jobs are at risk, and Texas’s economy could suffer a staggering $87 billion loss in GDP by 2034.

Despite federal rollbacks, Texas electricity prices remain about 24% below the national average, thanks largely to the success of renewables and battery storage in stabilizing the ERCOT grid. Blackout risk during summer peaks has plummeted—from a 12% chance in 2024 to just 0.3% in 2025—due to the growing role of batteries and solar smoothing out demand.

At the state level, Texas lawmakers proposed a flurry of anti-renewable bills in 2025, including mandates that would have imposed heavy costs on solar and wind developers. These measures passed the state Senate but failed in the House, amid backlash from businesses and grid experts warning that punishing renewables would increase consumer costs and reduce reliability.

Instead, the legislature passed more moderate reforms. These included stronger oversight of ERCOT, new rules for transmission inspections, and support for new dispatchable generation, particularly nuclear. While these changes aim to ensure long-term grid reliability, the future of renewables in Texas remains uncertain.

The combined effect of federal and state actions threatens to undermine the very mix of resources that made Texas’s grid cleaner, cheaper, and more resilient. Without renewed support for clean energy, the state may revert to costlier, less reliable fossil-fuel-heavy generation—undoing a decade of progress just as electricity demand surges from population growth and industrial expansion.

Meanwhile, Texas is facing a rapid surge in electricity demand driven by the explosive growth of artificial intelligence and data centers. The state’s grid operator, ERCOT, forecasts peak demand could nearly double by 2030—from 85 gigawatts to as much as 150–218 GW—largely due to power-hungry AI infrastructure. Hundreds of new data centers are being developed across the state, many with their own on-site natural gas generators to ensure reliable power.

In response, more than 100 new gas-fired power plants are in the permit pipeline, shifting the state's energy mix further toward fossil fuels. While this buildout bolsters short-term grid reliability, it also raises electricity costs and carbon emissions. Analysts warn Texas’s reliance on gas, especially amid the rollback of federal renewable energy incentives, could push consumer bills higher and increase long-term environmental impacts.

To manage the load, Texas is investing in billions of dollars of transmission upgrades and passing legislation to regulate large users like AI centers. Yet, without stronger support for renewables and battery storage, the state risks trading clean energy progress for short-term stability—straining the grid and consumers’ wallets in the process. The AI revolution may redefine Texas’s power future—for better or worse.

ASHEVILLE, N.C. (WLOS) — A series of ""Good Trouble Lives On"" protests in memory of a prominent civil rights leader is set to occur across Western North Carolina on Thursday, July 17.

These rallies are part of a National Day of Action that advocates for social justice and honors John Lewis, an influential Democratic congressman and civil rights activist, five years after his death. The ""Good Trouble Lives On"" website says this series of rallies aims to ""carry forward [Lewis's] fight for justice, voting rights, and dignity for all.""

After Chantal flooding, Governor Stein surveys damage in Chapel Hill, urges federal relief

Stein took aim at the Trump administration for withholding disaster resilience funds and said he was working to secure aid at the state level.

A day after declaring a state of emergency in the region, Governor Josh Stein toured flood-stricken Chapel Hill and spoke with residents and local business owners still reeling from recent damage.

A Chapel Hill native, Stein returned to his hometown Friday to console residents who lost their homes to flooding from Tropical Storm Chantal and pledged to seek relief for the region as well as work toward resilience against future disasters. Chantal, which brought as much as 12 inches of rain to some areas, killed at least six people in North Carolina.

At a press conference in Kipos Greek Taverna, among the businesses in Chapel Hill’s Eastgate Crossing closed indefinitely due to flood repairs, Stein said the recovery process is still in the “damage assessment phase” but he hopes that the disaster declaration will help yield federal assistance. Eastgate Crossing is less than three miles from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s main campus.",https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1436688/story_image/IMG_0467.jpeg?1748192650,N,,2025-07-20 17:00:09.364388

“All the time I’ve been working in Tennessee there’s only been a couple of mines permitted to begin with because production has been on the downswing there,” Hepler added.

It looked for a while like the coal mining era was over in the Clearfork Valley of East Tennessee, a pocket of mountainous land on the Kentucky border. A permit for a new mine hasn’t been issued since 2020, and the last mine in the region shuttered two years ago. One company after another has filed for bankruptcy, with many of them simply walking away from the ecological damage they’d wrought without remediating the land as the law requires.

But there’s going to be a new mine in East Tennessee — one of a few slated across the country, their permits expedited by President Donald Trump’s declaration of an “energy emergency” and his designating coal a critical mineral.

Trump was only hours into his second term when he signed an executive order declaring a national energy emergency that directed federal agencies to “identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them” to identify and exploit domestic energy resources. The administration also scrapped Biden-era rules that made it easier to bring mining-related complaints to the federal government.

The emergency designation compresses the typically yearslong environmental review required for a new mine to just weeks. These assessments are to be compiled within 14 days of receiving a permit application, limiting comment periods to 10 days. The process of compiling an environmental impact statement — a time-intensive procedure involving scientists from many disciplines and assessments of wildlife populations, water quality, and other factors — is reduced to less than a month. The government insists this eliminates burdensome red tape.

“We’re not just issuing permits — we’re supporting communities, securing supply chains for critical industries, and making sure the U.S. stays competitive in a changing global energy landscape,” Adam Suess, the acting assistant secretary for land and minerals management at the Interior Department, said in a statement. A representative of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement told Grist that community safety is top of mind, pointing to the administration’s $725 million investment in abandoned mineland reclamation.

The Department of Interior ruled that a new mine slated for Bryson Mountain in Claiborne County, Tennessee, would have “no significant impact” and approved it. It will provide about two dozen jobs. The strip mine will cover 635 acres of previously mined land that has reverted to forest. Hurricane Creek Mining plans to pry 1.8 million tons of coal from the earth over 10 years.

The Clearfork Valley, which straddles two rural counties and has long struggled economically, bears the scars of more than a century of underground and surface mining. Local residents and scientists regularly test the creeks for signs of bright-orange mine drainage and other toxins.

The land is part of a tract the Nature Conservancy bought in 2019 for conservation purposes, but because of ownership structures in the coalfields, it owns only the land, not the minerals within it. “We have concerns about the potential environmental impacts of the operation,” the organization said in a statement. “We seek assurance that there will be adequate bonding, consistent and transparent environmental monitoring, and good reclamation practices.”

Matt Hepler, an environmental scientist with the environmental advocacy group Appalachian Voices, has been following the mine’s public review process since the company applied for a permit in 2023. He remains skeptical that things will work out well for Hurricane Creek Mining. Despite Trump’s promise that he is “bringing back an industry that’s been abandoned,” coal has seen a steady decline, driven in no small part by the plummeting price of natural gas. The number of people working in the nation’s coal mines has steadily declined from 89,000 or so in 2012 to about 41,300 today. Production fell 31 percent during Trump’s first and has continued that slide.

“What is this company doing differently that’s going to allow them to profitably succeed while so many other mines have not been able to make that work?” he said. “All the time I’ve been working in Tennessee there’s only been a couple of mines permitted to begin with because production has been on the downswing there,” Hepler added.

Economists say opening more mines may not reverse the global downward trend. Plentiful, cheap natural gas, along with increasingly affordable wind and solar, are displacing coal as an energy source. The situation is so dire that one Stanford University study argued that gas would continue its climb even with the elimination of coal-related regulations. Metallurgical coal used to make steel — and which Hurricane Creek hopes to excavate — fares no better. It has seen flat or declining demand amid innovation in steel production.

Expedited permits are leading to new mines in the West as well. The Department of the Interior just approved a land lease for Wyoming’s first new coal mine in 50 years. Ramaco Resources will extract and process the material to retrieve the rare earth and other critical minerals found alongside it. The Trump administration also is selling coal leases on previously protected federal land. Shiloh Hernandez, a senior attorney at the Northern Rockies office of the environmental nonprofit Earthjustice, thinks it is a fool’s errand.

“I don’t see them changing the fundamental dynamics of coal,” he said. “That’s not to say that the Trump administration won’t cause lots of harm in the process by both making the public pay more money for energy than they should and by keeping some of these coal plants and coal mines that really are zombies.”

Still, Hernandez said he isn’t seeing many new permits, just quicker approval of those already in the pipeline. That said, the Trump administration’s moves to streamline environmental review will reduce oversight and the time the public has to scrutinize coal projects.

“The result is there’s just going to be it’s going to be more difficult for the public to participate, and more harm is going to occur,” Hernandez said. “There’s going to be less attention to the harm that’s caused by these operations.”

How Much Does it Cost to Charge an Electric Car?","(iSeeCars) – What is the battery replacement cost for today’s electric vehicles? That depends…

Electric cars are continuing their climb toward mainstream adoption. EV sales are steadily increasing, supported by improved charging infrastructure, growing model variety, and government incentives. Yet many buyers still hesitate due to concerns about upfront costs and long-term maintenance—especially battery replacement.

While EVs are becoming more affordable overall, the battery pack remains the single most expensive part of the vehicle. Fortunately, all new electric cars sold in the U.S. include a battery warranty of at least eight years or 100,000 miles, with some automakers offering even more coverage. This means most owners will never need to worry about paying out of pocket for a battery replacement during typical ownership.

Battery degradation has also become less of a concern. Most EV batteries retain over 90% of their capacity even after 8–10 years of use. But eventually, every EV battery will degrade beyond practical use. If that happens outside of warranty, the cost of replacement will fall to the owner.

So what does that look like in 2025?

Plug-in hybrid vehicles—such as the Toyota Prius Prime, Chevrolet Volt, and Hyundai Ioniq—use relatively small battery packs, typically between 10 and 20 kilowatt hours. Replacement costs for these batteries range from $4,500 to $9,000, including labor, according to recent repair estimates.

Fully electric vehicles, which use much larger battery packs, have significantly higher replacement costs. The Chevrolet Bolt, for example, uses a 60 kWh battery with an estimated replacement cost of $12,000 to $16,000. The Nissan Leaf, which uses a slightly smaller battery, costs about $9,500 to $12,000 for a full battery replacement. Tesla does not publicly release battery pricing, but independent reports and owner invoices suggest that a Model 3 battery (75–82 kWh) costs between $13,000 and $17,000, depending on the configuration and labor costs.

Battery prices are influenced by global material costs, manufacturing scale, and repair labor rates. While raw materials like lithium and nickel surged in price a few years ago, they have since stabilized. That said, battery production still represents a large portion of total EV costs, and a new battery remains a significant expense once the vehicle is out of warranty.

There is some good news on the horizon. Automakers are increasingly using less expensive battery chemistries, such as lithium iron phosphate (LFP), to drive down costs. Others are investing in new technologies, including solid-state batteries, which could improve energy density, longevity, and charging times. These advancements are expected to reduce battery prices significantly over the next several years.

Until then, the high cost of battery replacement remains one of the key challenges in the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. While battery life and warranties provide peace of mind for most EV owners, out-of-pocket replacements are still costly—and worth factoring into long-term ownership considerations.

At the heart of this transformation lies a deep ideological divergence between China and the United States, two nations whose energy policies encapsulate competing visions of power, development, and sovereignty.

While the US clings to a fossil-energy legacy underscored by political populism, China has redefined its energy strategy as a multidimensional exercise in security, innovation, and global leadership. This divergence is not merely technical. It embodies two civilizational responses to the question of how nations should power their futures. The implications are profound for economies that model themselves on either structure, particularly for Hong Kong, whose service-based economy bears a closer resemblance to the US than to the industrial core of the Chinese mainland. The path Hong Kong chooses will determine whether it becomes a marginal observer of history or a central participant in the next chapter of global energy.

The American energy posture, particularly under the influence of the current political leadership, reveals an ideological rigidity that prioritizes the expansion of fossil fuels as a means of national resurgence. This is not a matter of economic pragmatism but of political theater. The most emblematic manifestation of this ideology came with the recent passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. This legislation dismantled critical environmental regulations, opening vast new tracts of land and coastal waters to oil and gas exploitation. Rather than acknowledging the mounting scientific and economic evidence pointing toward renewable energy as the future of global power systems, this legislative agenda sought to reassert fossil fuels as the cornerstone of American greatness. It was a decision obviously not grounded in foresight. The act’s celebration of deregulation and domestic extraction reveals a worldview fixated on short-term gains and political optics at the expense of systemic adaptation and global responsibility.

China, by contrast, has positioned itself as the architect of a new energy paradigm. This is not a claim based on rhetoric, but on demonstrable outcomes. China has already secured an overwhelming lead in solar panel production, battery storage technology, and wind turbine manufacturing, which are not isolated industrial achievements; they are the result of a coordinated national strategy that integrates State planning, private sector innovation, and international diplomacy. The ability to marshal resources efficiently toward long-term strategic goals has enabled China to construct the physical and technological foundations of a clean energy superpower. This model is more than adequate; it is exemplary. It demonstrates that State capacity, when aligned with scientific clarity and technological ambition, can outpace the market-driven hesitations of Western economies. The Chinese approach sees environmental stewardship not as a burden but as an opportunity to shape the next century’s dominant industries.

The rationale for China’s energy transformation extends beyond environmental motivations. It is anchored in a sophisticated understanding of geopolitical vulnerability as well. With over 80 percent of its imported oil passing through maritime routes susceptible to foreign naval control, China views energy independence as a matter of national security. Every solar panel deployed and every gigawatt of wind capacity added is a step away from strategic exposure. This framing of clean energy as a vehicle for sovereignty elevates the conversation from one of policy preferences to one of existential necessities. It is a recognition that in a world of shifting alliances and unpredictable trade dynamics, energy security must be built upon the stable foundation of domestic resilience. China has not only acknowledged this reality but has also acted decisively upon it.

This strategic clarity stands in stark contrast to the fragmented and often contradictory energy landscape of the US. While the US federal government, under fossil-fuel-friendly leadership, accelerates the expansion of petroleum infrastructure, individual states such as California and New York pursue aggressive clean energy targets, aiming for fully decarbonized electricity grids by midcentury. This internal dissonance reveals a structural incoherence that undermines national competitiveness. A country that lacks consensus on its energy future is not well-positioned to lead a global transformation. Moreover, the emphasis on fossil exports as a tool of foreign policy has created a dangerous dependency on external demand. As more countries shift toward renewables, American hydrocarbons may find themselves increasingly unwelcome in a world that is moving beyond combustion.

China’s clean energy footprint is already significantly redefining global trade patterns. In a single month, China’s solar panel installations can rival the annual output of entire continents. Chinese companies are building solar farms in Latin America, wind farms in Central Asia, and battery plants across Europe. Even in oil-rich regions such as the Middle East, Chinese engineering and capital are being enlisted to construct the infrastructure of a postpetroleum age. This is not merely economic expansion; it is a quiet reordering of global influence. By making itself indispensable to the world’s clean energy transition, China has positioned itself at the forefront of the future of every nation seeking to decarbonize. This is the essence of soft power in the 21st century —an ability to lead not through coercion but through persuasion.

For Hong Kong, these developments demand a profound rethinking of its trajectory. The city’s economy, heavily reliant on finance, logistics, and professional services, is vulnerable to the same energy fragilities that haunt the American model. As data centers and digital infrastructure become major energy consumers, the need for a resilient, clean energy backbone becomes not only an environmental concern but also a commercial imperative. Hong Kong cannot afford to regard energy policy as the domain of mainland provinces alone. It must recognize that its relevance in the coming decades will depend on its ability to align with and contribute to the national energy strategy.

This alignment is not a matter of political loyalty, but rather a matter of rational self-interest. By integrating more deeply into the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and leveraging its unique legal and financial systems, Hong Kong is well-positioned to become the green finance capital of Asia. It can facilitate international investment in renewable infrastructure, structure carbon markets with global credibility, and serve as a conduit for sustainability-oriented capital flows. This is not a retreat from globalization but a reconfiguration of it — one in which Hong Kong plays a critical role in connecting Chinese mainland innovation with global demand. However, to seize this opportunity, Hong Kong must abandon false neutrality and embrace a proactive role in national development.

Those who argue that China’s leadership in clean energy may provoke resistance or decoupling from other countries fail to grasp the depth of global interdependence. The production chains for renewable energy technologies are already centered in China. Efforts by Western nations to re-create these supply chains domestically are fraught with inefficiencies and technological gaps. The simple reality is that the climate crisis cannot be solved without the participation of China. Attempts to sideline China in the name of diversification are not only unrealistic but also counterproductive. China’s dominance in clean energy is not a threat to global progress; it is a precondition for it.

The energy strategies adopted by China and the US represent more than divergent policy paths. They are declarations of intent about the kind of world each nation seeks to shape. The US has chosen to entrench itself in a vanishing era, in which fossil fuels are treated as permanent instruments of power. China has chosen to lead the emergence of a new era, where energy is clean, sovereign, and strategically indispensable. For Hong Kong, the decision is not between East and West, but between inertia and innovation. The current of history is unmistakable. When the grid defines power, those who build it will write the rules.

Established under Biden’s signature 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the multi-billion-dollar program budget far exceeded any previous EPA budget.
An appeals court intervened to stay an earlier ruling that would have forced the EPA to free the frozen funds.","The Biden Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hastily shoveled billions in taxpayer dollars to Democrat-aligned green groups without having concrete agreements in place, according to documents obtained by watchdog group Protect the Public’s Trust (PPT).

The documents indicate that the Biden EPA awarded grants under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) — a program that shelled out $20 billion to nonprofits linked to Democrat donors and insiders — on a timeline that allowed changes to the terms even after the money was awarded. The Biden EPA had until September 2024 to award the taxpayer funds, and staff were advised to delay outstanding questions and issues in order to meet the looming award deadline, the documents indicate.

“The more information that is revealed about the GGRF, the shadier the entire scheme looks,” Michael Chamberlain, director of PPT, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “The irony is that when federal employees finally start cutting red tape and expediting a process, it’s to make sure taxpayer money is irrecoverable to taxpayers. It’s clear from these documents that Biden’s EPA cut corners to get the money ‘obligated’ before the funds expired on September 30, 2024, even if it meant ‘finalizing’ agreements with grantees they fully intended to re-negotiate later. In the private sector, this is the kind of thing that sometimes lands people in jail.” (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Biden’s ‘Gold Bars’ Went To Politically-Connected Orgs Over Internal Red Flags, Watchdog Finds)

Although the money was legally committed in August 2024, the Biden EPA mapped out a timeline that extended revising terms and conditions past the September 2024 deadline to “resolve outstanding issues through December 31, 2024.” Another slide notes the looming deadline and argues that EPA staff needs to “accept that not all questions will be resolved prior to award.”

E&E News reporter Jean Chemnick asked in May 2024 about GGRF’s “transparency and accountability guardrails,” and in response, a Biden official argued that the program had strong oversight when it planned to change the terms after the funding deadline, the documents indicate. The Biden official pointed to other similar EPA programs as examples of the agency’s experience, though the programs listed were either brand new or less than one-thousandth of the size of GGRF, the PPT notes and the documents show.

“Now we really know what throwing gold bars off the Titanic looks like,” Chamberlain said, referencing a video covertly recorded by conservative activist group Project Veritas in which a Biden EPA official likened the rush to fund green groups before Trump’s arrival to hurling money off a sinking ship. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has also repeatedly cited the Project Veritas video in comments about the GGRF.

Several of the GGRF grantees are laden with Democrat donors and former high-level Obama and Biden administration officials. Established under Biden’s signature 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the multi-billion-dollar program budget far exceeded any previous EPA budget. Federal reviewers flagged “excessive” executive pay and questionable financial statements ahead of the final GGRF grantee selections, the DCNF previously reported.

Coalition for Green Capital (CGC), Power Forward Communities (PFC) and Climate United Fund (CUF) are among the three grantees loaded with Democrat donors and insiders that federal reviewers flagged for seemingly unjustified high executive salaries.

CGC declined to comment and PFC did not respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment.

CU pointed to appeals court filings which confirm that the terms and conditions were changed in December 2024, though it argued that these changes were not substantive.

“Changes to terms were administrative in nature and provided more clarity around reporting requirements and account controls, as detailed in court filings,” a CU spokesperson told the DCNF. “EPA has not used the changes to terms and conditions as a part of their legal arguments since they were addressed in court earlier in the case.”

Additionally, the CU spokesperson said that adjusting federal grant terms is not out of the ordinary and that the Biden EPA was transparent about the GGRF throughout the program.

“The more you look at this, the worse it gets. Not only was the Biden EPA tossing billions of taxpayer dollars ‘off the Titanic,’ to borrow their language, but under every stone you find more well documented incidents of self-dealing and conflicts of interest, unqualified recipients, and intentionally reduced agency oversight,” Zeldin told the DCNF. “These grants were rightfully terminated months ago, and Congress just fully repealed the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund program in the One Big Beautiful Bill.”

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act repealed the GGRF program and rescinded remaining unobligated program funds.

The agency’s inspector general, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the FBI are investigating the GGRF for potential fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars, and Zeldin has highlighted the program as a key example of Biden-era corruption on numerous occasions.

EPA froze 129 Citibank accounts holding the funds in February, and in response, several grantees sued the agency and Citibank, arguing that the freeze lacked legal justification and that the EPA had acted properly in distributing the money. An appeals court intervened to stay an earlier ruling that would have forced the EPA to free the frozen funds.","https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-1425619154-scaled-e1752252153980.jpg",N,,2025-07-20 15:00:54.327839

How Much Does it Cost to Charge an Electric Car?","(iSeeCars) – What is the battery replacement cost for today’s electric vehicles? That depends…

Electric cars are continuing their climb toward mainstream adoption. EV sales are steadily increasing, supported by improved charging infrastructure, growing model variety, and government incentives. Yet many buyers still hesitate due to concerns about upfront costs and long-term maintenance—especially battery replacement.

While EVs are becoming more affordable overall, the battery pack remains the single most expensive part of the vehicle. Fortunately, all new electric cars sold in the U.S. include a battery warranty of at least eight years or 100,000 miles, with some automakers offering even more coverage. This means most owners will never need to worry about paying out of pocket for a battery replacement during typical ownership.

Battery degradation has also become less of a concern. Most EV batteries retain over 90% of their capacity even after 8–10 years of use. But eventually, every EV battery will degrade beyond practical use. If that happens outside of warranty, the cost of replacement will fall to the owner.

So what does that look like in 2025?

Plug-in hybrid vehicles—such as the Toyota Prius Prime, Chevrolet Volt, and Hyundai Ioniq—use relatively small battery packs, typically between 10 and 20 kilowatt hours. Replacement costs for these batteries range from $4,500 to $9,000, including labor, according to recent repair estimates.

Fully electric vehicles, which use much larger battery packs, have significantly higher replacement costs. The Chevrolet Bolt, for example, uses a 60 kWh battery with an estimated replacement cost of $12,000 to $16,000. The Nissan Leaf, which uses a slightly smaller battery, costs about $9,500 to $12,000 for a full battery replacement. Tesla does not publicly release battery pricing, but independent reports and owner invoices suggest that a Model 3 battery (75–82 kWh) costs between $13,000 and $17,000, depending on the configuration and labor costs.

Battery prices are influenced by global material costs, manufacturing scale, and repair labor rates. While raw materials like lithium and nickel surged in price a few years ago, they have since stabilized. That said, battery production still represents a large portion of total EV costs, and a new battery remains a significant expense once the vehicle is out of warranty.

There is some good news on the horizon. Automakers are increasingly using less expensive battery chemistries, such as lithium iron phosphate (LFP), to drive down costs. Others are investing in new technologies, including solid-state batteries, which could improve energy density, longevity, and charging times. These advancements are expected to reduce battery prices significantly over the next several years.

Until then, the high cost of battery replacement remains one of the key challenges in the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. While battery life and warranties provide peace of mind for most EV owners, out-of-pocket replacements are still costly—and worth factoring into long-term ownership considerations.

Revenue fell to $22.75 billion, a 11.2% decline year-over-year, while vehicle deliveries dropped 13.5% to 384,122 units. These figures reflect a combination of pricing pressures, regulatory shifts, and intensifying competition. For investors, the report raises critical questions: Is Tesla's market leadership under threat? Can its strategic pivot to software monetization and energy storage offset hardware margin erosion? And how will macroeconomic headwinds, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's recent commentary, shape the EV sector's trajectory?

Earnings Performance and Margin Pressures

Tesla's Q2 2025 revenue decline was driven by softer average selling prices (ASPs), logistics costs, and the absence of U.S. federal EV tax credits under the ""Big Beautiful Bill."" Automotive gross margin fell to 19.6% from 22.3% in Q2 2024, a trend exacerbated by temporary price cuts of up to $7,500 on the Model 3 and Model Y. While the energy and services segment showed resilience ($1.8 billion in revenue), the automotive segment's struggles dominate the narrative.

The margin compression is not unique to Tesla. The broader U.S. EV market saw a 6.3% year-over-year decline in new EV sales in Q2 2025, with 310,839 units sold. However, Tesla's market share in the U.S. fell from 75% in 2024 to 62% in 2025, as rivals like General Motors and Chinese EV manufacturers (e.g., BYD) gained traction. This erosion highlights the fragility of Tesla's pricing power in a market now characterized by aggressive price competition.

Production Trends and Market Position

Production output in Q2 2025 reached 410,244 vehicles, a 2% increase quarter-over-quarter but an 8% decline year-over-year. The Model Y Highland mid-cycle refresh (95,000 units delivered) and Cybertruck launch (4,200 units) provided temporary relief, but these gains were offset by a 17% decline in China deliveries and a 10% drop in Europe.

The data underscores Tesla's reliance on product innovation to sustain growth. The company's ability to scale Cybertruck production and roll out Full Self-Driving (FSD) subscriptions will be pivotal. FSD revenue grew 35% quarter-over-quarter, with 20,000 new subscribers, signaling a shift toward software monetization. However, regulatory hurdles in Europe and safety concerns around robotaxi trials remain unresolved risks.

Macroeconomic Headwinds and Policy Shifts

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's recent comments on maintaining restrictive monetary policy through 2025 have added another layer of uncertainty. Higher interest rates are dampening consumer demand for high-ticket items like EVs, with global real GDP growth projected to slow to 2.4% in 2025. For Tesla, this means navigating a dual challenge: maintaining unit sales in a cost-conscious environment while defending margins against price wars.

The phase-out of U.S. EV tax credits by September 2025 further complicates Tesla's strategy. While the company has offset some of these costs through localized sourcing and logistics efficiencies, the long-term impact on profitability remains unclear. In contrast, the used EV market is growing, with retail sales surpassing 100,000 units in Q2—a potential tailwind for Tesla if it can leverage its Supercharger network to enhance used vehicle desirability.

Investment Implications and Strategic Outlook

For investors, Tesla's Q2 2025 results suggest a stock at a crossroads. The delivery beat and energy segment growth provided short-term relief, but the broader trends—declining margins, political risks, and competitive pressures—demand caution. Here's a framework for evaluating entry or exit points:

Entry Points:

Long-Term Growth Levers: Tesla's energy storage and FSD initiatives remain high-conviction plays. Energy deployments grew 25% year-over-year, and FSD's 35% revenue growth highlights a path to recurring software income. Investors who believe in these segments might consider entry at current levels, especially if the stock corrects further on macroeconomic concerns.

Valuation Metrics: Tesla trades at ~18x forward EPS, a premium to traditional automakers but a discount to high-growth tech peers. This suggests a market that values Tesla's innovation but is skeptical about near-term execution risks.

Exit Points:

Margin Risks: If automotive gross margins fall below 16% in Q3 2025, it could signal a deeper structural issue. Investors should monitor production efficiency at Giga Texas and Berlin, as well as pricing dynamics in China and Europe.

Political Exposure: Elon Musk's political activities have already dented Tesla's brand equity in key markets. A further decline in consumer sentiment or regulatory scrutiny could justify an exit.

Hedging Strategies:

Sector Diversification: Given the EV sector's cyclicality, investors might pair Tesla with more defensive names like GM, which grew its EV market share to 12.9% in 2025.

Options Play: Buying put options to hedge against a potential sell-off in Q3, particularly if Powell signals prolonged rate hikes.

Conclusion: Navigating the EV Transition

Tesla's Q2 2025 earnings underscore the challenges of leading a disruptive market in a period of macroeconomic and regulatory flux. While the company's operational resilience and innovation in software and energy storage are commendable, its ability to maintain market leadership hinges on executing its strategic priorities. For investors, the key is balancing optimism about Tesla's long-term vision with pragmatism about short-term risks. The EV sector is at an inflection point, and Tesla's next moves—whether in robotaxis, battery production, or global expansion—will determine whether it remains the gold standard or cedes ground to a new wave of competitors.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-20 16:59:13.673327

While the programs wouldn't be eliminated entirely, critics argue that folding Native-specific funding into state-controlled block grants would effectively end dedicated tribal workforce services and remove culturally competent support.
Broader state programs are not always prepared to handle those issues, and complete tribal-centered career training at “significantly lower” rates than tribe-run programs, Brown said.
“This proposal disregards decades of work by tribes, subject matter experts including educators, tribal business experts, and others,” Brown said.
“Consolidating Native workforce funding under state systems erases decades of hard-won progress and ignores the unique needs of tribal nations,” Quintana said.","Cherokee Nation citizen Lauren Smith worked two minimum wage jobs in her early adulthood, just to afford a small apartment in Owasso, Okla. She realized she needed a change when she had her son — spending so much time at work meant he would end up “raising himself,” Smith said.

Career development services from Cherokee Nation, including career counseling and help getting her GED, allowed Smith to land a steady job as a receptionist at an Owasso clinic. The work is stable and she enjoys it. She would never have gotten it without that support, she told Tribal Business News.

‘They walked me through everything, and that meant I didn't have to struggle with it on my own while working two jobs and trying to raise a kid,” Smith said. “I didn't have to pay for it, I had good guidance and advice, and now I'm doing work I never thought I'd be able to do.”

But future Native jobseekers could find that kind of support harder to access under the Trump administration’s proposed budget that Congress will be debating this week. Cherokee Nation, like many tribes and Native-serving organizations, depends on funding from the Department of Labor's Division of Indian and Native American Programs (DINAP), which administers the native American Employment and Training Program under Section 166 of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA).

The administration’s budget calls for eliminating Section 166 and folding its funding into a new “Make America Skilled Again” (MASA) block grant. The proposal would consolidate 11 federal workforce programs — including those targeted to youth, dislocated workers, and Native Americans — into a single pool of funds controlled by the states.

While the programs wouldn't be eliminated entirely, critics argue that folding Native-specific funding into state-controlled block grants would effectively end dedicated tribal workforce services and remove culturally competent support.

Over the past five years, DINAP has funded roughly 40,000 to 50,000 participants annually, with combined adult and youth awards rising from approximately $58 million in 2020 to over $73 million in 2025, according to the program’s website. Under the MASA proposal, total WIOA funding would shrink from $3.9 billion to $2.97 billion, slashing nearly $1 billion in workforce investments, according to the National Association of Workforce Boards.

The shift would place Native American, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian jobseekers into the same state-run programs as all other workers — a move that could sideline tribal perspectives and strip away culturally responsive support, according to Joseph Quintana (Kewa Pueblo), executive director of California-based workforce nonprofit Native Development Network.

“This pulls our chair away from the table,” Quintana told Tribal Business News. “Having a direct voice, like DINAP in the Department of Labor, gives us access to people who can address our concerns.”

The Native Professional Advancement Center in New Mexico is another organization fighting the proposal.

“This isn't just policy — it's an attack on tribal sovereignty and Native self-determination,” Darius Lee Smith, executive director of NPAC, said in a statement. “For over 60 years, we've built culturally grounded pathways to education and employment. Losing these programs puts everything we've worked for at risk.”

Section 166’s core strength lies in its flexibility and cultural competence, according to former DINAP Division Chief Athena Brown. Division staff understand specific barriers that face Native jobseekers, such as extremely rural reservations, limited access to off-reservation resources like job centers and effects from poverty, such as lack of transportation. Broader state programs are not always prepared to handle those issues, and complete tribal-centered career training at “significantly lower” rates than tribe-run programs, Brown said.

“Tribes can tailor the services they're providing to the needs of the people they're serving,” Brown said. “Grants are administered in a way that not only meets regulatory requirements under WIOA, but are provided in ways that are consistent with the cultural values and beliefs of the people they are designed to serve.”

Trump’s federal workforce cuts have left DINAP with just three employees. The budget proposal, if enacted, would eliminate the division entirely, and take “years of experience, trust, and understanding” with it, Brown said.

Without a dedicated federal unit, tribes may also lose the consultation channels provided by the Native American Employment and Training Council (NAETC), which advises the secretary on the program’s operation and performance measures.

“This proposal disregards decades of work by tribes, subject matter experts including educators, tribal business experts, and others,” Brown said. “This proposal is also an affront to tribes and circumvents the U.S. Constitution, treaties, statutes, executive orders, and judicial decisions that have long held that the United States shall maintain a government-to-government relationship with federally recognized tribes.”

If the funding disappears, Brown recommends proactive steps for tribes: “I would encourage the tribes and nonprofit Native organizations to continue to work closely with the tribal business communities and to ensure that partnerships are continued, to include the states in these endeavors,” Brown said. ""Make sure that you have a seat at the table with the state-funded entities so that the tribal communities have a voice in how their communities are served.”

Establishing or reinforcing memoranda of understanding with one-stop centers could help safeguard access, but won’t replace the cultural expertise lost when DINAP’s central office is dissolved, Brown said.

The changes would affect a population already facing high unemployment. For Native Americans living in the Southern California urban areas that Quintana's Native Development Network serves, unemployment stands between 9% and 11% — roughly three times the wider unemployment in the same areas. Unemployment is worse on reservations, which average 10.5% but can reach up to 80%, according to a 2024 report by the Ballard School for Social Impact.

States must consider everyone when developing their programs and that could mean specific Native needs being glossed over, Quintana said. Many Natives entering the workforce at later ages may rely on high school degrees, since rates of higher education attendance and graduation are lower than other demographics. Many may need more practical support, such as getting a suit for a job interview.

“We don't want to create another access obstacle to dollars for these workers,” Quintana said. “When addressing these challenges, having the state step in poses another risk to our community members who lack education or opportunities and training.”

The Trump administration’s fiscal 2026 budget proposal is scheduled to go before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education for markup on Monday, July 21 at 5 p.m. The full House Appropriations Committee is expected to take up the bill on Thursday, July 24 at 10 a.m.

Quintana, Brown, and others hope lawmakers will push back against the proposal and preserve DINAP’s dedicated funding and infrastructure — especially as economic uncertainty looms.

Legislators and tribal leaders need to weigh whether those direct allocations — and DINAP’s dedicated staff — can be replicated through state infrastructure without compromising the program’s reach or cultural relevance, Quintana said.

“Consolidating Native workforce funding under state systems erases decades of hard-won progress and ignores the unique needs of tribal nations,” Quintana said. “We don’t just want jobs, we need stable careers, rooted in education, self-determination, and cultural relevance.”

Smith, when told of the potential threat to the career support that helped her get her current job, expressed a similar concern.

“You can't live on minimum wage, and I think if any of these go away or have less resources, you're going to see a lot more Natives trying to do so anyway,” Smith said. “They need to have people out there who can talk to tribal folks and know what they're dealing with who can provide this support. I think we're in a lot of trouble without it.”

Wind and solar energy projects – with batteries to store excess power until it’s needed – offer the fastest way to satisfy growing demand for power.
However, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act rescinds billions of dollars that the Inflation Reduction Act, enacted in 2022, devoted to boosting domestic manufacturing and deployments of renewable energy and batteries.
That’s why BloombergNEF, an energy research firm, called the bill a “nightmare scenario” for clean energy proponents.
The bill also rescinds funding that would have helped cut diesel emissions and finance clean energy projects in underserved communities.","When congressional Republicans decided to cut some Biden-era energy subsidies to help fund their One Big Beautiful Bill Act, they could have pruned wasteful subsidies while sparing the rest. Instead, they did the reverse. Americans will pay the price with higher costs for dirtier energy.

The nearly 900-page bill that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 slashes incentives for wind and solar energy, batteries, electric cars and home efficiency while expanding subsidies for fossil fuels and biofuels. That will leave Americans burning more fossil fuels despite strong public and scientific support for shifting to renewable energy.

As an environmental engineering professor who studies ways to confront climate change, I think it is important to distinguish which energy technologies could rapidly cut emissions or need a financial boost to become viable from those that are already profitable but harm the environment. Unfortunately, the Republican bill favors the latter while stifling the former.

Cuts to renewable electricity

Wind and solar power, often paired with batteries, provide over 90% of the new electricity added nationally and around the world in recent years. Natural gas turbines are in short supply, and there are long lead times to build nuclear power plants. Wind and solar energy projects – with batteries to store excess power until it’s needed – offer the fastest way to satisfy growing demand for power. Recent technological breakthroughs put geothermal power on the verge of rapid growth.

However, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act rescinds billions of dollars that the Inflation Reduction Act, enacted in 2022, devoted to boosting domestic manufacturing and deployments of renewable energy and batteries.

It accelerates the phaseout of tax credits for factories that manufacture equipment needed for renewable energy and electric vehicles. That would disrupt the boom in domestic manufacturing projects that had been stimulated by the Inflation Reduction Act.

Efforts to build new wind and solar farms will be hit even harder. To receive any tax credits, those projects will need to commence construction by mid-2026 or come online by the end of 2027. The act preserves a slower timeline for phasing out subsidies for nuclear, geothermal and hydrogen projects, which take far longer to build than wind and solar farms.

However, even projects that could be built soon enough will struggle to comply with the bill’s restrictions on using Chinese-made components. Tax law experts have called those provisions “unworkable,” since some Chinese materials may be necessary even for projects built with as much domestic content as possible. For example, even American-made solar panels may rely on components sourced from China or Chinese-owned companies.

Princeton University professor Jesse Jenkins estimates that the bill will mean wind and solar power generate 820 fewer terawatt-hours in 2035 than under previous policies. That’s more power than all U.S. coal-fired power plants generated in 2023.

That’s why BloombergNEF, an energy research firm, called the bill a “nightmare scenario” for clean energy proponents.

However, one person’s nightmare may be another man’s dream. “We’re constraining the hell out of wind and solar, which is good,” said U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican who is backed by the oil and gas industry.

Electric cars and efficiency

Cuts fall even harder on Americans who are trying to reduce their carbon footprints and energy costs. The quickest phaseout comes for tax credits for electric vehicles, which will end on Sept. 30, 2025. And since the bill eliminates fines on car companies that fail to meet fuel economy standards, other new cars are likely to guzzle more gas.

Tax credits for home efficiency improvements such as heat pumps, efficient windows and energy audits will end at the end of 2025. Homeowners will also lose tax credits for installing solar panels at the end of the year, seven years earlier than under the previous law.

The bill also rescinds funding that would have helped cut diesel emissions and finance clean energy projects in underserved communities.

Support for biofuels and fossil fuels

Biofuels and fossil fuels fared far better under the bill. Tens of billions of dollars will be spent to extend tax credits for biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel.

Food-based biofuels do little good for the climate because growing, harvesting and processing crops requires fertilizers, pesticides and fuel. The bill would allow forests to be cut to make room for crops because it directs agencies to ignore the effects of biofuels on land use.

Meanwhile, the bill opens more federal lands and waters to leasing for oil and gas drilling and coal mining. It also slashes the royalties that companies pay to the federal government for fuels extracted from publicly owned land. And a new tax credit will subsidize metallurgical coal, which is mainly exported to steelmakers overseas.

The bill also increases subsidies for using captured carbon dioxide to extract more oil and gas from the ground. That makes it less likely that captured emissions will only be sequestered to combat climate change.

Summing it up

With fewer efficiency improvements, fewer electric vehicles and less clean power on the grid, Princeton’s Jenkins projects that the law will increase household energy costs by over $280 per year by 2035 above what they would have been without the bill. The extra fossil fuel-burning will negate 470 million tons of anticipated emissions reductions that year, a 7% bump.

The bill will also leave America’s clean energy transition further behind China, which is deploying more solar and wind power and electric vehicles than the rest of the world combined.

No one expected President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act to escape unscathed with Republicans in the White House and dominating both houses of Congress, even though many of its projects were in Republican-voting districts. Still, pairing cuts to clean energy with support for fossil fuels makes Trump’s bill uniquely harmful to the world’s climate and to Americans’ wallets.

Conclusion: The Road Ahead The EV market is evolving rapidly, and both Tesla and BYD are adapting to stay ahead.","The electric vehicle (EV) market has entered a pivotal phase, with two titans—Tesla and BYD—competing for dominance. While both companies have reshaped the automotive landscape, their contrasting approaches to valuation, fundamentals, and innovation reveal divergent paths for long-term investors. This analysis delves into their near-term performance, valuation metrics, and innovation pipelines to determine which EV leader aligns better with sustainable growth and investor returns.

Valuation: BYD's Conservative Pricing vs. Tesla's Speculative Premium

BYD's stock has long been a value play. As of Q2 2025, its P/E ratio stands at 17.8–22x, significantly lower than Tesla's 70x forward P/E. BYD's EV/EBITDA of 7.7x is also a fraction of Tesla's 40x multiple, reflecting a valuation anchored to tangible earnings rather than speculative growth bets. Meanwhile, BYD's price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.22862 underscores a market that values its assets conservatively, while Tesla's 14.22 P/B highlights a premium placed on its intangible assets and brand strength.

BYD's valuation metrics suggest it is undervalued relative to its earnings and profitability. The company's dividend yield of 1.54% further appeals to income-focused investors, a stark contrast to Tesla's reinvestment-driven strategy. Tesla's premium valuation hinges on the success of its AI and robotaxi initiatives, which remain unproven at scale. For investors seeking a margin of safety, BYD's lower multiples and consistent cash flow generation present a more compelling case.

Fundamentals: BYD's Revenue Growth vs. Tesla's Marginal Pressures

BYD's financial performance in 2024 and 2025 has been nothing short of remarkable. The company's trailing twelve months (TTM) revenue reached $464.99 billion in 2024, dwarfing Tesla's $95.32 billion. In 2025, BYD's revenue surged 29% year-over-year to $107 billion, driven by aggressive international expansion and a 42.5% increase in battery EV sales. Analysts project another 24% revenue growth in 2025, fueled by new assembly plants in Thailand, Uzbekistan, and planned facilities in Brazil and Hungary.

Tesla, by contrast, faces a more challenging landscape. Q2 2025 revenue fell 11.2% year-over-year to $22.75 billion, with automotive gross margins contracting to 19.6%. The company's energy generation and storage segment showed resilience (25% YoY growth), but its core automotive business is under pressure from price wars, fading EV tax credits, and a saturated market. Tesla's market cap ($635.35 billion) remains large, but its earnings per share (EPS) growth has slowed compared to BYD's consistent profitability.

Innovation: Software-Driven Ambition vs. Hardware Mastery

Tesla's innovation pipeline has shifted toward software and AI. The company's Full Self-Driving (FSD) v13 and the Cybercab robotaxi prototype signal a pivot to autonomous mobility. However, these initiatives are still in beta and face regulatory hurdles. Tesla's 4680 battery technology, intended to boost energy density and reduce costs, has encountered production bottlenecks, and its “dry cathode” process remains unproven at scale.

BYD, meanwhile, has leveraged its vertical integration to dominate battery technology. Its Blade Battery, a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) innovation, offers safety, fast charging, and cost efficiency. BYD is also developing solid-state batteries for high-end models by 2027, with broader adoption by 2030–2032. The company's fifth-generation hybrid system (2,100 km range) and DiPilot 300 autonomous driving suite further cement its technological edge.

BYD's innovation strategy prioritizes hardware and cost optimization, allowing it to undercut competitors on price while maintaining margins. Tesla's focus on software and AI is visionary but carries execution risks. For investors, BYD's tangible, scalable innovations may offer a more reliable foundation for long-term value creation.

Strategic Partnerships and Global Expansion

BYD's vertical integration—producing batteries, chips, and components in-house—gives it a cost advantage over Tesla, which relies on external partners like Panasonic and CATL for battery production. BYD's global expansion strategy is equally aggressive, with full-assembly plants in Thailand, Brazil, and Hungary, and plans to enter markets like Mexico and Pakistan. The company even supplies batteries to Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory, a testament to its supply chain dominance.

Tesla, while expanding its Supercharger network and securing access agreements with other automakers, faces headwinds from trade policies and geopolitical risks. The loss of U.S. federal EV tax credits and potential retaliatory tariffs in Europe and China could further strain its profitability.

Investment Thesis: Balancing Risk and Reward

For long-term investors, the choice between Tesla and BYD hinges on risk tolerance and growth expectations. Tesla's stock is a high-volatility play, priced for moonshot potential in AI and autonomous driving. Its market cap of $635 billion reflects optimism about future monetization of FSD and robotaxi, but execution risks remain high.

BYD, with a market cap of $89.5 billion, offers a more grounded opportunity. Its undervalued multiples, robust revenue growth, and technological leadership in batteries position it as a safer bet in a maturing EV market. The company's global expansion and vertical integration provide a durable competitive edge, making it a compelling choice for investors prioritizing sustainable growth over speculative bets.

Conclusion: The Road Ahead

The EV market is evolving rapidly, and both Tesla and BYD are adapting to stay ahead. Tesla's vision for software-driven mobility is ambitious, but its near-term fundamentals and valuation suggest a company navigating turbulence. BYD, on the other hand, combines disciplined execution, cost advantages, and cutting-edge innovation to capture market share in both domestic and international markets.

For investors seeking a balance of growth and value, BYD's attractive valuation, consistent profitability, and technological depth make it the stronger long-term buy. Tesla remains a high-growth stock, but its premium pricing and execution risks demand a higher tolerance for volatility. In the race for EV dominance, BYD's fundamentals and innovation pipeline currently edge out Tesla as the more sustainable choice.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-20 16:00:48.365672

The fair has partnered with state environmental agencies to implement changes ranging from new water infrastructure to expanded recycling programs.

Working alongside the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, Ohio Department of Agriculture and Ohio Department of Natural Resources, fair organizers have developed programs designed to reduce waste and educate attendees about environmental conservation. These efforts represent a significant shift in how large-scale public events approach sustainability challenges.

Eight key changes coming to the 2025 fair

New water bottle refilling stations – Eight state-of-the-art refilling stations will be installed across the fairgrounds, funded by a $15,000 Ohio EPA grant. These stations complement existing water fountains and aim to dramatically reduce single-use plastic bottle consumption during the 12-day event.

Expanded recycling infrastructure – A pilot recycling program will debut with clearly marked bins and educational signage placed in high-traffic areas throughout the grounds. The program represents the fair’s first coordinated effort to divert recyclable materials from landfills.

Enhanced cardboard collection – Additional collection points for cardboard have been established specifically for vendors and exhibitors. All collected cardboard will be processed at the Rumpke Recycling and Resource Center in Columbus, creating a closed-loop recycling system.

H2Ohio interactive exhibit – This new educational display will be positioned between Central Park and Kiddieland, offering hands-on learning experiences about water conservation and quality. The exhibit connects to Governor Mike DeWine’s statewide water quality initiative.

Natural Resources Park sustainability hub – The park will feature structures constructed from recycled materials and host the ConServe Ohio sustainability program. This dedicated space will serve as the central location for environmental education during the fair.

Sustainable Campsite Challenge – On August 1, teams will compete to create the most eco-friendly campsites, demonstrating practical sustainability techniques that visitors can implement at home. The competition highlights creative approaches to reducing environmental impact while camping.

Local product promotion – The Ohio Proud General Store will expand its offerings of locally grown and produced items, reducing transportation emissions and supporting regional agriculture. Ohio Wines will feature products from the state’s 420 licensed wineries.

Vendor sustainability requirements – Food and merchandise vendors are now encouraged to use recyclable materials for packaging and service items. This policy shift affects hundreds of businesses operating at the fair.

Adam Heffron, Executive Director of the Ohio Expo Center & State Fairgrounds, notes that these initiatives serve multiple purposes beyond waste reduction. The programs aim to boost local economic activity while creating healthier environments for fair attendees and the surrounding community.

The fair’s sustainability efforts extend beyond infrastructure improvements. Organizers are actively encouraging visitors to participate by bringing reusable bags for purchases, carrying refillable water bottles, and using reusable utensils when possible. These simple actions, multiplied across the fair’s typical attendance of nearly one million visitors, could significantly reduce waste generation.

Educational components woven throughout the sustainability initiatives ensure that environmental lessons extend beyond the fairgrounds. Interactive exhibits and demonstrations provide practical knowledge that families can apply in their daily lives, potentially multiplying the positive environmental impact.

The timing of these initiatives coincides with growing public awareness about environmental issues and increased demand for sustainable options at public events. By implementing these changes, the Ohio State Fair positions itself as a leader among state fairs nationwide in addressing environmental concerns.

Fair organizers anticipate that these initial sustainability efforts will expand in future years based on visitor feedback and measurable environmental impact data. The 2025 fair serves as a testing ground for practices that could become standard at large public gatherings throughout Ohio and beyond.",https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_462452233-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-20 14:00:18.979135

Government response:

We will not issue licences to explore new fields, whilst managing existing fields for the entirety of their lifespan. We will boost Britain’s energy security and ensure good, long-term jobs.

The UK oil and gas sector has long provided secure energy and skilled employment, and it will continue to be an integral part of our economy for decades to come.

Irrespective of the position on licences, however, there is an urgent need to plan for the future of the North Sea. North Sea oil and gas production is in natural decline, with a 72% reduction in production occurring between 1999 and 2023. The oil and gas industry has lost around a third of its direct workforce in the last decade.

Britain is well-placed to mobilise its natural advantage, using the skills and expertise of our offshore workforce and supply chain to get ahead in the global race for new jobs and industries. This opportunity is essential for our North Sea communities; embracing clean energy is the route to the jobs and investment of the future. That is why the government is speeding ahead with investing in clean energy jobs and industries.

The government is determined to coordinate the scale-up of the industries which will shape the future of the North Sea (including offshore wind, carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and decommissioning) as oil and gas extraction in the North Sea declines. This is vital for delivering the best outcomes for workers and communities, energy security, and sustainable economic growth.

We are committed to delivering on the UK’s legally binding commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The scientific evidence is clear that to meet this goal and limit the worst effects of climate change, we must reduce our reliance on fossil fuels use over time. The transition to low carbon energy will help cut energy bills, improve our energy security, boost innovation and create high quality jobs across the UK. The alternative - failing to act on climate change – would expose the UK to more extreme weather and severe economic risks.

New licences to explore new fields would not lower prices for UK consumers. Oil and gas are traded on international markets, therefore domestically produced oil and gas does not mean cheaper prices. As long as consumers remain exposed to international energy markets through dependency on oil and gas, wherever it is produced, they will be vulnerable to shocks impacting energy costs which drove the cost-of-living crisis. While the UK’s energy system demonstrated its reliability, despite Russia cutting off most pipeline gas supplies to Europe, households and businesses across the UK felt the impact of rocketing international gas prices, wherever our gas was sourced from.

New licences to explore new fields would not meaningfully increase UK production levels, nor would they change the UK’s status as a net importer.

Increasing home grown, clean energy capacity is critical to improving long term security and affordability. That is why the Government is investing in energy efficiency, renewables and emerging technologies like hydrogen and carbon capture usage and storage (CCUS). These steps are designed not only to reduce emissions but to provide long term energy security and lower household bills. Our ambition is for the UK to become a global leader in clean energy innovation, creating new high-quality jobs and revitalising North Sea communities through investment in the green economy.

We have already announced that Great British Energy will be headquartered in Aberdeen, reflecting our commitment that the communities that powered our country’s energy past will continue to power its clean energy future. In addition, we have delivered a record-breaking renewables auction; worked with industry and unions to move forward on a ‘skills passport’ for offshore workers; and put clean energy at the heart of our modern industrial strategy.

This needs to be a fair, orderly and prosperous transition. We set out our detailed proposals in a recent consultation on ‘Building the North Sea’s energy future (https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/building-the-north-seas-energy-future).

The newly minted OBBB Act leaves businesses and policymakers trying to determine its potential impact on jobs, investment, and the nation’s position in the global energy race.

The OBBB, especially “Title 5-Ending Green New Deal Spending, Promoting America-first Energy, and Other Reforms,” introduces significant reductions to clean energy tax credits, and reduces the eligibility timeline for credits and accessibility to them, while extending these for fossil fuels such as the coal used in steelmaking.

The Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act overemphasized renewable energy over oil and gas. Both of these are energy sources that the U.S. has a significant opportunity to leverage for growth and security. It makes sense to play to America’s strengths. However, some experts warn that the OBBB risks creating an overcorrection. Zigzagging in the race for energy dominance may wind up costing the U.S. the geo-economic race against China.

Charting a course that allows the country to excel on all energy fronts might work better in the medium and long term. While insisting on renewables instead of hydrocarbons, and even vilifying fossil fuels and nuclear, was questionable for a country rich in oil and gas, continued American presence in the renewable energy sector is critical to the future of the U.S. and America’s ability to compete with foreign powers, especially China.

What’s New in the OBBB?

The sweeping, nearly 1,000-page OBBB brings significant changes to IRA provisions that prioritized clean energy investments and manufacturing in the U.S. over other options. The OBBB sets a placed-in-service deadline for wind and solar projects, making any project that started a year after the IRA became law ineligible for tax unless it is placed in service before the end of 2027. This will create additional risks for projects grappling with supply chain delays and complex permitting and construction timelines. Many developers may decide to turn down new projects rather than trying to race against the regulatory clock.

On the other hand, metallurgical coal, which is used in steelmaking, will now qualify for tax credits. Besides this being contradictory to the OBBB’s goal of making needed budget cuts, it also works against innovation, providing credits to coal at the expense of developing a green steel industry. The U.S. was an early leader in this field, but now Europe leads globally, and China is working to catch up quickly through low-carbon policies, R&D, and incentives for innovation.

The OBBB also tightens Foreign Entity of Concern rules with more clear and explicit designations. As we explained earlier, the IRA’s rather broad treatment of this issue tended to deter investment in companies “with even a tiny stake of Chinese ownership, or doing business in Russia” and to discourage U.S. partners in resource-rich areas such as Central Asia. The new definitions per the OBBB will limit tax credit eligibility for producers using inputs coming mainly from Chinese companies.

Although this aims to reduce supply chain dependence on China and prevent Chinese companies from benefiting from subsidies, the complexity and uncertainty around how to actually apply these provisions for clean energy projects means these rules can backfire, reducing domestic clean energy production and innovation and sharpening the competitive edge of Chinese alternatives, helping Beijing to become even more dominant in the global market.

Can the OBBB Help American Manufacturing?

Policy uncertainty has chilling effects on investment, and as far as the OBBB, this is already happening. According to E2, since January 2025, over $14 billion in clean energy projects and more than 10,000 announced jobs had been cancelled before the Senate even passed the bill. The proposed timeline for building and operationalizing wind and solar projects is significantly affected by the new law, which creates obstacles for manufacturers in the clean energy space and, consequently, for proposed new projects, no matter how innovative. Speeding up America’s slow and overly bureaucratic review process is admirable, but deadlines need to be realistic.

Lawmakers were able to secure a one-year extension of existing wind and solar tax breaks. However, renewable energy industry leaders and advocates argue that this short-term extension is insufficient to encourage the kind of long-term, large-scale investments needed for projects like billion-dollar battery plants or large solar farms.

For the U.S. to truly revive domestic manufacturing and lead in global energy, it must encourage the industries of the future (without breaking the bank), quickly innovate in sectors like steel, and scale up solar and battery production alongside a renewed focus on America’s existing core competencies in oil, gas, and nuclear. This is not a zero-sum game. It is vital to an “all of the above” energy strategy.

The Trump Administration has already indicated an appetite for “energy abundance”, encouraging LNG exports, grid modernization, and nuclear energy development. An energy policy prioritizing abundant, affordable, cutting-edge energy must keep renewable advancements on the table, even though they are not yet suitable to fully replace other forms of generation. China is forging ahead aggressively, aiming to dominate the clean energy space of tomorrow, and seeking to push the U.S. down the global energy sector totem pole.

While the OBBB is focused on rolling back IRA measures that put the green transition ahead of America’s advantages and interests in the energy space, its provisions risk making the U.S. less competitive as China and other powers strive to advance renewables and their associated technologies.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/687c4279dc9b0da280264c74/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-07-20 13:01:41.358407

The Bigger Picture: Energy Market Dynamics in 2025 The U.S. energy market is bifurcating.","The recent U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report revealing an 846,000-barrel draw in heating oil stockpiles has sent shockwaves through energy markets. This third consecutive weekly decline—far below expectations—has rewritten the narrative for investors. While the broader market fixates on AI-driven tech stocks or geopolitical tensions, the energy sector is undergoing a subtle but powerful realignment. Let's dissect the implications.

The Mechanics of the Draw: Why This Matters

The -846,000 barrel decline is not just a number—it's a signal of structural imbalances. Key drivers include:

1. Unplanned Gulf Coast refinery outages: Disruptions in production have reduced distillate output by 450,000 barrels per day.

2. Record distillate exports: June's 4.5 million barrels per day of exports have drained domestic supplies.

3. Unseasonable demand spikes: The Northeast's summer cold snap drove heating oil consumption 12% above five-year averages.

These factors have created a refining premium, where refiners and midstream operators now command higher margins. Heating oil futures have surged 1.8% to $2.25 per gallon, outpacing WTI crude's 0.9% gain. This divergence reflects a critical shift: supply tightness is now pricing in faster than demand growth.

Sector Implications: Energy vs. Consumer Staples

Energy Equipment & Services: The Winners

The energy equipment and services sector has surged 2.1% in early trading, led by midstream and refining giants. Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and Phillips 66 (PSX) are prime beneficiaries of the refining premium, with their refining margins expanding 22% year-to-date. Valero Energy (VLO) and Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) are also positioned to capitalize on export infrastructure and storage arbitrage.

Historical data from 2015 and 2024 reveals a consistent pattern: energy sectors outperform the S&P 500 by +3.2% in the three weeks following inventory surprises. This is not mere correlation—it reflects the sector's role in capitalizing on supply-demand imbalances.

Consumer Staples: The Risks

Meanwhile, consumer staples face headwinds. Retailers like Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) are seeing margin compression due to rising transportation and logistics costs. A 1.5% decline in consumer staples ETFs (e.g., XLP) since the EIA report underscores this vulnerability. Energy prices account for 12% of the CPI basket, and a sustained heating oil shortage could delay Fed rate cuts, prolonging higher borrowing costs for retailers.

Actionable Investment Strategies

Overweight Energy Infrastructure:

Midstream plays: Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) and Magellan Midstream Partners (MMP) offer exposure to export infrastructure and storage.

Refiners: Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and Valero Energy (VLO) benefit from refining margins and export demand.

Energy ETFs: Consider XLB (Materials) or XLE (Energy Select Sector SPDR) for broad exposure.

Underweight Consumer Staples:

Avoid overexposure to retailers (WMT, TGT) and packaged goods companies (PG, KO).

Reallocate to energy-linked sectors that benefit from higher commodity prices.

Monitor Key Indicators:

July 10 crude inventory report: A follow-up draw could validate the refining premium.

July 17 refinery utilization data: A decline below 90% would signal production constraints.

Heating oil futures vs. WTI spreads: A widening gap indicates deepening refining margins.

The Bigger Picture: Energy Market Dynamics in 2025

The U.S. energy market is bifurcating. Refiners and midstream operators are thriving in a tight supply environment, while crude-heavy producers (e.g., E&P firms) face pressure from global oversupply. This divergence mirrors the 2014-2015 heating season, when strong production and a contango market incentivized storage. However, today's context is different: geopolitical risks and a weaker global demand outlook complicate long-term projections.

For investors, the key takeaway is clear: position for sectoral asymmetry. Energy infrastructure and refining stocks are set to outperform in the near term, while consumer staples face margin pressures. As the EIA's July 17 refinery utilization data approaches, now is the time to rebalance portfolios toward energy-linked assets.

The result: More taxes will be collected than in the original House bill, lowering the final legislation’s price tag.
Senate Republicans, led by Majority Leader John Thune and Finance Chair Mike Crapo, made it a priority to make the business tax cuts permanent, too.
Three big business tax changes ballooned the cost of the entire bill: bonus depreciation, research and development expensing and the business interest deduction.
A variety of other business tax cuts were also made permanent by the Senate, increasing the overall cost of the legislation.","The House GOP focused on making the individual income tax changes permanent instead of sunsetting this year. That decision alone made up the bulk of the overall price tag.

Senate Republicans had to negotiate with the House on a specific item, SALT — which we’ll get to in a moment — but they easily agreed to most of the individual tax provisions, making relatively small changes.

Blue-state House Republicans pushed to repeal the cap on the state and local tax deduction that was part of the 2017 tax cuts. They quadrupled the cap to $40,000 in the House-passed bill, with some limits for higher-income filers.

The GOP Senate initially sought to kill that altogether. Eventually, it negotiated a middle ground — a victory for the six Republican members of the bipartisan SALT Caucus, composed of lawmakers representing high-income suburbs. The result: More taxes will be collected than in the original House bill, lowering the final legislation’s price tag.

House Republicans had proposed making the individual income tax provisions permanent but only extending the corporate ones. Senate Republicans, led by Majority Leader John Thune and Finance Chair Mike Crapo, made it a priority to make the business tax cuts permanent, too.

Three big business tax changes ballooned the cost of the entire bill: bonus depreciation, research and development expensing and the business interest deduction. That influenced some of the Senate’s most politically fraught decisions, as Republicans then tried to offset that cost by making other cuts, including to Trump’s campaign promises to eliminate taxes on tipped wages and overtime work.

A variety of other business tax cuts were also made permanent by the Senate, increasing the overall cost of the legislation.

For example, the Senate added significantly more regulation and changes to international tax provisions.

The fight over Medicaid was one of the biggest battles, with House Republicans casting their changes as necessary for fighting fraud and abuse while the CBO said millions of people would lose coverage as a result. Senate Republicans sought to deepen Medicaid cuts even further, alarming GOP moderates in both chambers who worried about the impact on rural health.

Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley led the opposition and ultimately lost, though he still voted for the bill because of other provisions. The opposition eked out a slight victory, however: A $50 billion fund for rural hospitals to offset the expected reduction in federal funds. Two key Republican senators — Maine’s Susan Collins and North Carolina’s Thom Tillis — urged their colleagues to keep the House proposal and ultimately voted against the bill. (Tillis, attacked by Trump over his resistance, announced his retirement and slammed the bill before it passed.)

With less spending on Medicaid, the megabill’s cost was lowered.

Republicans had initially planned to include a so-called revenge tax in the bill, which would be used to retaliate against other countries that impose “discriminatory” taxes on U.S. companies. Some in the business community had pushed to ease that tax over fears it would dampen foreign investment.

Republicans quickly agreed to drop the tax after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it was no longer necessary due to the progress of negotiations with other countries.

Long decried by Trump as the “Green New Scam,” the clean energy tax credits from Democrats’ 2022 Inflation Reduction Act represented a ripe target for Republicans seeking savings. But the incentives have helped spark massive investment and job growth, largely in GOP districts — igniting a fierce debate among Republicans over how deeply to gut the credits that wasn’t resolved until the final hours.

After the House passed rollbacks that developers said would devastate the wind and solar industries, the Senate Finance committee moderated some of those reforms. But that angered far-right conservatives and Trump himself intervened to push for deeper cuts — with support from fossil fuel advocate Alex Epstein.

Some Senate Republicans pushed back, ultimately crafting a compromise that phased out the credits more quickly than the House but provided a carve-out for projects that begin construction in the next year. It also loosened onerous restrictions passed by the House to bar China-linked companies from claiming the credits, and ditched a punitive excise tax on wind and solar projects briefly floated in the Senate.

There were myriad other changes to the megabill. As lawmakers moved the legislation through Congress, Republicans seeking enough compromise to hold party unity added a cut here, removed a provision there.

On net, those changes also increased the price tag by nearly another half-trillion dollars.",https://www.politico.com/interactives/2025/megabill-cost-trump-2017-tax-cuts/share.jpg,N,,2025-07-20 13:02:09.491275

The lawsuit against Hawaiian Electric, the state’s largest power supplier, claims the company has created a monopoly that has resulted in the renewable energy plant being unable to operate. The next hearing on the matter is scheduled for Aug. 12.

It is unclear how these negotiations will affect the impending lawsuit.

Honua Ola Bioenergy is a new 30 megawatt firm, renewable biomass facility located in Pepe‘ekeo. When operating, it would generate renewable and sustainable energy by using locally produced biomass feedstock from eucalyptus crops and invasive species. The plant would also create more than 220 direct and ancillary jobs in the greater Hilo community, the company said.

The June 3 letter indicates the facility is already constructed, essentially complete and ready for commissioning in short order.

According to a fact sheet from Hu Honua, enough renewable energy would be produced to power more than 19,500 homes, which also supports wind and solar by stabilizing the grid, delivering nearly 20% of Hawai‘i Island’s power.

Documents filed with the state’s Public Utilities Commission indicate the two companies have made substantial progress and have reached a power purchasing agreement in principle on the major terms. The parties are now working on completing all of the components to implement the agreement.

The documents don’t outline the terms of this agreement.

The commission responded to the letter on June 23 stating that “given the current uncertainty around global supply chain- and tariff-related issues, as well as the age of the original IRS (Interconnection Requirements Study) for this project,” the Commission advises the two parties to file the power purchasing agreement and any associated waiver request with the Commission when the study update is complete and final.

The parties are in the process of conducting an updated study, which was originally done in 2010.

“Honua Ola continues to pursue all available paths to starting operations at its renewable energy facility, which will provide reliable and affordable energy for Hawaiʻi Island’s ratepayers,” said Warren Lee, president of Hu Honua.

He said starting operations at the plant will reduce Hawaiʻi Island’s reliance on imported fossil fuels and help shield residents and businesses from spikes in oil prices that drive volatility in monthly energy bills.

“Adding a new source of always-available, reliable energy will bolster the grid and help avoid rolling power blackouts, while affordably achieving the state’s clean energy goals,” Lee said.

Honua Ola’s facility also will reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to the island’s fossil fuel-powered facilities, he said.

The company also is committed to growing and planting trees and other crops that sequester greenhouse gas.

Hawaiian Electric declined to provide further comment on the matter, citing its policy not to discuss ongoing negotiations.

Hawaiian Electric first entered into an agreement with Hu Honua in May 2012 for the generation and sale of electricity from the power plant.

Application for the agreement was initially approved by the state with Hawaiian Electric emphasizing that Hu Honua would help “reduce HECO’s reliance on fossil fuels” and “increase its overall renewable energy portfolio.”

Hawaiian Electric ultimately terminated the agreement because Hu Honua missed certain contractual milestones, according to the May lawsuit documents.",https://cdn.bigislandnow.com/file/bigislandnow/2025/07/Hu-Honua-Bioenergy-plant-featured-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-07-20 15:00:46.869047

In 2023, hydropower contributed 89 percent of Norway’s power generation, followed by wind power at 9 percent, according to the International Energy Agency.
In February, the Norwegian parliament voted to open up protected rivers to hydropower plants, which spurred significant opposition from environmental groups concerned about wildlife and ecosystems.
The bill permits the construction of hydropower plants larger than 1 MW in protected waterways if the societal benefit is “significant” and the environmental consequences are deemed “acceptable”.
And, in May this year, the firm applied for a license to construct a $590 million hydropower plant in Sunndal.","Norway has major plans to expand its hydropower capacity through expansion projects and new developments. The Scandinavian country, which is well-known for its strong and diverse energy sector, recently announced plans to collaborate with the United States Department of Energy (DoE) to support research and development into hydropower in the two countries. In addition, Norway aims to ramp up its hydropower production in the coming years to supply clean power as the domestic energy demand continues to rise.

In July, the DoE said that it had extended its collaboration with the Norwegian Ministry of Energy on hydropower research and development, building on an existing memorandum of understanding between the two powers. Norway and the U.S. will share key information, tools, and technologies related to marine energy and new hydropower solutions. The partnership is expected to help reduce energy costs and strengthen grid reliability and security.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated, “Strong partnerships drive innovation, and innovation strengthens America’s energy future… Hydropower is a tremendous resource - one that supports reliable, affordable power across the country and holds vast potential to bolster America’s grid.” Wright added, “By signing this Memorandum of Understanding with Norway, we are building upon our two nations' shared expertise and advanced marine energy technologies.”

Norway has invested heavily in its hydropower sector in recent years, in research and development, as well as plant expansions and new developments. In 2023, hydropower contributed 89 percent of Norway’s power generation, followed by wind power at 9 percent, according to the International Energy Agency. In May, Norway was named the second most energy-resilient country in the world, after Iceland, by TRG Datacenters, thanks to its strong hydropower sector and diverse energy mix.

In February, the Norwegian parliament voted to open up protected rivers to hydropower plants, which spurred significant opposition from environmental groups concerned about wildlife and ecosystems. The bill permits the construction of hydropower plants larger than 1 MW in protected waterways if the societal benefit is “significant” and the environmental consequences are deemed “acceptable”. Norway has almost 400 protected waterways. Some groups have accused the government of rushing the bill through parliament without conducting adequate public consultation or environmental impact assessments.

In April, SEB Nordic Energy’s portfolio company Locus Energy acquired a 158 GWh hydropower portfolio consisting of operational assets and assets under construction. This will bring Locus’s hydropower assets to 410 GWh per year in total once completely operational.

Richard Gavel, the Portfolio Manager at SEB Nordic Energy, stated, “The addition of reliable hydropower generation reinforces Locus Energy’s long-term strategy with a solid cash flow profile.” Gavel added, “By expanding strategically within the Nordics and leveraging synergies across technologies and geographies, the company is building a scalable, resilient platform with long-term value potential. We are excited to support the next growth phase.”

In May, the Norwegian state-owned utility Statkraft submitted a license application to upgrade its hydropower plants on the Numedalslågen river in Buskerud at a projected cost of $390 million. Statkraft aims to increase electricity production and reduce consumer utility bills. The firm’s Nore I plant has been operational since 1928, and its Nore II plant began operations in 1946. It expects to commence work on five major upgrades by 2030 if the licenses are approved.

Statkraft must decide between two options for the upgrade. The firm hopes to merge the existing two plants into a single new facility constructed inside the mountain, to increase capacity from 274MW to 500MW and raise annual production from around 1,500 GWh to 1,700GWh. Alternatively, Statkraft could move the two plants into the mountain independently, which would boost capacity by 65 MW and annual production by around 150 GWh.

Statkraft also applied for a license for the expansion of its Mauranger hydropower plant in western Norway from 250 MW to 880 MW in 2022. And, in May this year, the firm applied for a license to construct a $590 million hydropower plant in Sunndal. If approved, the new Aura facility will be constructed deep in a mountain to replace two existing stations – Aura and Osbu. This would also be one of Statkraft’s largest hydropower investments in decades.

The CEO of Statkraft, Birgitte Ringstad Vartdal, stated, “Electricity is the backbone of our society and the foundation for value creation across the country. Many hydropower plants now require modernisation.” Vartdal added, “At the same time, growing demand and increased production from intermittent energy sources mean we need to be able to generate more electricity exactly when it is needed. By building a new Aura power plant, we can deliver more capacity and slightly more energy without adding more water. That’s what the future renewable energy system needs.”

Norway plans to continue investing heavily in hydropower in the coming years to support the country’s growing electricity demand, as well as cross-border power sharing efforts. It will collaborate with the U.S. on research and development to drive down production costs and improve technology. In addition, it plans to significantly expand existing plants as well as encourage the development of new facilities across the country.

A new political order requires a much more expansive understanding of the depth of the United States’ political crises.","Abundance by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson . Avid Reader Press , 2025. 304 pages.

TO UNDERSTAND WHAT Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson think is wrong with the United States, you need look no further than California’s failed attempts to build high-speed rail. Since 1982, the state has been trying to connect Los Angeles to San Francisco with trains capable of traveling more than 200 miles per hour. Despite broad public support, decades of planning, countless studies, and tens of billions of dollars spent, hardly any tracks have been laid and the project may never come to fruition. How can the wealthiest and most technologically advanced state in the world’s leading superpower nation be so utterly inept? Why can it not do what China, Japan, and many European countries do—and do it better, faster, and more cheaply?

In their new book Abundance, Klein and Thompson argue that this failure illustrates a fundamental problem with the US: it has lost its ability to build. The nation once regarded as the global leader in railroads, highways, homes, and scientific breakthroughs has, according to the authors, struggled in the last half century to build necessary infrastructure. Urban housing is being developed at a fraction of the rate of population growth; the pace of new green energy projects is too slow to address climate change. Scientific discoveries are not delivering enough value.

Why is it so hard to build in the United States? Over the last 50 years, a set of regulations and procedural obstacles pioneered primarily by those on the left have, in Klein and Thompson’s view, gone from asset to liability. Environmental review processes cost millions of dollars and slow projects by years. Requirements to use union workers on public projects decrease the number of bids and increase costs. Urban zoning policies give almost anyone the right to challenge a project, empowering NIMBY groups to thwart developments, even when their interests run counter to the common good. Would-be builders spend too much time writing reports and attending meetings and too little getting things done. “Laws meant to ensure that government considers the consequences of its actions,” they conclude, “have made it too difficult for government to act consequentially.”

The contrasts between the United States and other countries—and between red states with fewer regulations and blue states with more stringent ones—point to just how much government policy matters. It costs more than $600 million per kilometer of rail in the US versus under $400 million in Germany and less than $300 million in Japan and Canada, even though those nations have robust environmental policies. Despite acute housing shortages in San Francisco and Los Angeles, these cities in California only permitted 2.5 homes per 1,000 residents in 2022, whereas Austin, Texas, granted 18. Such facts lead the authors to conclude that progress is crippled by friction: projects require far too many layers of review, which in turn require umpteen permits and reports.

For Klein and Thompson, it follows that the government needs to figure out how to accelerate projects rather than stymie them. Neither liberals nor conservatives are on board with this view at present, which is why the authors see their book as offering a new path forward and a challenge to both parties. Conservatives are apt to focus almost exclusively on the failures of government, and thus not on the state as a custodian of the future. Liberals, by contrast, too zealously embrace the procedural aspects of state bureaucracy such as federal review, citizen oversight, and legal challenges, which creates bottlenecks, which at least in part account for what the authors call “the pathologies of the broad left.” Klein and Thompson want to replace such pathologies with “a liberalism that builds.” Only a nimble and proactive government, they say, can deliver on the “abundance” of their title: affordable housing, clean energy, and innovative science.

¤

There is much to admire in this book. Klein and Thompson have decades of combined experience in observing and reporting on the nation’s politics. Their aims and concerns are also laudable: they are worried about climate change and believe that it is impossible under the current regulatory regime to build enough clean energy infrastructure to avert catastrophe. They lament the oversupply of cheap consumer goods and undersupply of public goods needed for a good future. They are sympathetic to the hardworking people who are trying to build public housing and clean energy infrastructure or who are making scientific discoveries but are forced to spend more time writing reports and addressing red tape than making the world a better place. Surely, they argue, a better system is possible.

These are reasonable points that deserve further discussion. The greatest strength of Klein and Thompson’s book is in how clearly they bring these issues to the reader’s attention. But what about their solution? Is “abundance” the answer to what ails America?

The verdict is mixed—in part because a new vision of governance is not the same thing as a set of policy tweaks. On one level, abundance policies can be understood as technocratic fixes to overcome public-sector inefficiencies. This is the type of in-the-weeds policymaking work that trims red tape and gives state agencies more authority to build things in the public interest. However, Klein and Thompson are not particularly interested in policy specifics. Their much broader hope is that an abundance agenda can be an overarching framework for a new political order. But their abundance agenda includes too little and leaves out too much to be the basis of a broad political coalition.

Let’s start with a limited view of abundance as a policy agenda to build better by avoiding layers of review, overly long permitting processes, burdensome reporting requirements, and so on. That these inefficiencies should be corrected is all well and good in theory, but what would corrections look like in practice? The reader does not really know, because Klein and Thompson explicitly avoid getting into the weeds by claiming that they are offering “a lens” to think about problems rather than “a list” of recommendations.

Consider railroads. They cite Americans’ construction of a transcontinental railroad in less than a decade during the 1860s as an instance of how the nation used to be able to build. But what they don’t say: This technological progress came at immense cost by way of hundreds of dead workers, tens of thousands of exploited Chinese laborers, wide swaths of lands stolen from Native Americans, and staggering amounts of financial manipulation that enriched robber barons while leaving others destitute. How do we recreate the benefits of railroads while avoiding such harm?

Another rub: their environmental assumptions. Klein and Thompson echo the claims of ecomodernists who believe that we can solve all our environmental problems through technological innovation and economic growth. Dubbed solutionists, ecomodernists assume a world of infinite renewable energy, which means we can have it all—abundant food, medicine, travel, and wildlife. This Pollyannaish vision ignores the messy realities on the ground, such as the massive environmental costs that accrue from mining, manufacturing, and disposing of the materials necessary for generating so-called clean energy. It’s an unrealistic vision that fails to engage with hard choices.

Klein and Thompson don’t want to dwell on such uncomfortable details. Again, they are after the Big Picture crises of American politics, not the nuts and bolts of bureaucracy. They want to fix American democracy with a vision of government as a builder par excellence. This vision, they believe, would constitute nothing less than a platform for a new political order.

A “political order” is a long-term alignment of the political system around an agenda that draws cross-partisan support. It operates on the order of decades, not election cycles. The historian Gary Gerstle developed this idea over the last few decades by analyzing the two orders that dominated the last century. From the 1930s to the 1970s, Americans lived in the New Deal order, which was characterized by widespread belief in the pivotal role of government in securing a good life for average citizens. Forged from the depths of the Great Depression, this order was strengthened during the Cold War and the fight with communism: the United States needed to show on a world stage that capitalism improved the lives of its citizens. This mandate was so compelling that Democrats and Republicans worked together to implement and expand a social safety net for vulnerable citizens. In the 1970s, however, stagflation and dissatisfaction with the Vietnam War helped bring that order to an end and ushered in its stead a neoliberal political order. Most famously associated with Reagan’s attack on government and regulation, it promulgated individual freedom and economic growth—not state intervention—as the avenue to better lives.

The power of a political order can be discerned when political figures espouse policies typically associated with their opponents. The New Deal order’s commitment to protecting citizens was so widely shared that both Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon significantly increased the power of the federal government: the former expanded welfare programs, and the latter signed into law the nation’s strongest environmental laws. The commitment to trimming government intervention and incentivizing individuals was sufficiently powerful in the neoliberal order that Bill Clinton enacted welfare reform and Barack Obama implemented free trade policies.

Klein and Thompson are correct that the neoliberal political order is now fracturing under pressure from both the Left and the Right. What will replace it is one of the most important questions of our time. Trump’s popularity stems from offering a clear answer: America First and exclusionary nationalist policies. The Democratic Party and American Left have, by contrast, struggled to offer anything as coherent or compelling to voters. An abundance agenda, the authors hope, can fill this void. They tout it as having a “bigness” that will deliver “more of what matters,” and as being capable of changing “not just our politics, but our national character.”

Unfortunately, the abundance agenda is unlikely to achieve such an ambitious goal. It offers a vision of the public good that may excite Washington insiders and progressive elites, which is why Klein and Thompson have been invited to meet with Democratic representatives to discuss their ideas, but it fails to recognize the deep dissatisfactions of millions of Americans. The scarce resource in their book is imagination about what a better life looks like for people outside their technocratic orbit.

A core limitation of this book is that it expects too much of technology. “[T]echnology is at the heart of progress, and always has been,” they confidently assert, which is why they see a tight link between building more and having better lives. “We want more homes and more energy, more cures and more construction,” they declare in a manner that evokes the idealistic refrain in the 1989 film Field of Dreams: “If you build it, he will come.”

But what does the abundance agenda look like in the Iowa cornfields where Kevin Costner’s character built a baseball field? Uninspiring and alienating. In Klein and Thompson’s dream future, vertical urban farm towers and lab-manufactured meat will free cities from needing anything from the countryside, allowing farmland to be rewilded. “Cities are where wealth is created,” they assert, citing statistics that residents of cities with more than a million people are 50 percent more productive than those in smaller cities. Moreover, they note that children raised in large cities have a greater shot at upward mobility than those in smaller cities or the countryside. Convinced that urban centers are the best place to live, they ask how we can build enough housing to make it affordable for rural citizens, whom they assume will flock there once they can afford it.

The implicit message to those outside cities is clear: rural areas are to be abandoned, not invested in. But the fact is that many people prefer rural life and do not want to move to cities. Some want to live near family members who share roots in locations that stretch back across generations. They may want to be closer to nature and live a less hectic pace of life. Others wish to keep farming. Many hope for economic opportunities within rural areas that might extend beyond covering their fields in solar panels and wind farms. These are legitimate ambitions. Yet little in the abundance agenda recognizes such aspirations, which is surely connected to why the Democratic Party is hemorrhaging support in rural areas. You cannot build a broad political coalition that ignores rural America, and you cannot rely on building things as the primary approach to rural revival.

Just as Klein and Thompson have little to say about rural areas, they are remarkably mum about income inequality and the shrinking of the American middle class. For the last 50 years, and the past 20 years in particular, the American economy has been characterized by stagnation and decline for 80 percent of the population and enormous gains for the top quintile and for the top one perecent in particular. Fewer and fewer Americans are sharing in the country’s economic bounty. Many citizens feel the system is not working for them, and so they are moving away from the mainstream of both political parties. It should be no surprise that Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders draw much larger crowds than Mitch McConnell or Chuck Schumer. While Trump and Sanders offer different answers (immigrants and government corruption versus wealthy exploiters), they both speak to the prevailing zeitgeist (i.e., the system is rigged against the ordinary citizen).

The abundance agenda has too little to say about how to redress these realities. Sure, building more urban homes may give a segment of the American population better access to upward mobility, but even an ambitious plan of building three million homes will provide that opportunity to no more than seven or eight million people—little more than two percent of the population. Sponsoring more building projects may create good jobs, but, as Klein and Thompson note, requirements to use union labor will increase costs and lower the number of potential bids. Thus, we can’t be sure these new projects would actually bolster the middle class. And what about the power of wealthy oligarchs? Klein and Thompson spend almost no time discussing redistribution. Instead, they simply wave it away as insufficient. Nor do they analyze how the vast gaps between the haves and have-nots undermine the social fabric. We cannot build our way out of such problems with technology. A new political order requires a much more expansive understanding of the depth of the United States’ political crises. It also requires an appeal to a much broader segment of the population.

¤

“Can we solve our problems with supply?” Klein and Thompson ask in their conclusion. Their answer is yes. But this is because they believe that “our problems” can be solved with a relatively narrow set of technocratic tweaks to government systems. Would the world be a better place if zoning laws, clean energy permitting, and scientific funding were improved? I expect so. And if Klein and Thompson’s aim is to force liberals to accept their portion of responsibility for the challenges facing the nation, then this book is a useful provocation, even if it lacks details about how to reconcile the public good with reduced red tape.

But to expect these changes to be the basis of a new political order is to overstate what technology can accomplish and to ignore the fundamental political divides fracturing the US today. “Building better” does not address skyrocketing income inequality. It ignores rural America. It says almost nothing about immigration or education, and not enough about the healthcare costs that overwhelm many families. Ultimately, Klein and Thompson offer a vision of the United States’ problems that speaks mostly to the political concerns of urban elites and political donors—and not to the vast majority of American citizens.",https://cdn.lareviewofbooks.org/unsafe/994x0/filters:format(jpeg):quality(75)/https%3A%2F%2Fassets.lareviewofbooks.org%2Fuploads%2Fabundance.jpg,N,,2025-07-20 13:01:52.453362

The Valuing Opportunity, Inclusion, and Community Equity order serves to foster a whole-of-government approach working with communities that historically have borne the burden of environmental pollution, according to the governor's office.

According to Moore, the executive order establishes the following:

Requires state agencies to identify and implement mechanisms to increase resources and opportunities for historically underrepresented farmers by reducing barriers for entry, such as land access, and financing;

Reinforces the roles that state agencies have in advancing environmental justice—from urban agriculture programs at the Maryland Department of Agriculture to community health initiatives led by the Department of Health;

Mandates that each agency designate an environmental justice officer and make available to the public, online, a biennial environmental justice strategic plan with metrics to promote environmental justice in ways tailored to the specific agency and its authority, mission, and programs; and

Creates the Interagency Environmental Justice and Equity Advisory Council to coordinate efforts, support local governments, and maximize funding opportunities in coordination with the Commission on Environmental Justice and Sustainable Communities.

""Every Marylander deserves access to clean air, clean water, and resilient communities. That's what environmental justice is all about,"" said Gov. Moore. ""The order marks the next chapter in our work to cut exposure to pollution, improve access to clean public transit, reduce urban heat islands, and uplift neighborhoods that have been left behind. And for our entire state, this action marks a step toward a more competitive economy and healthier communities for all.""

The order also mandates state agencies to use the Maryland Department of the Environment's MDEnviroScreen mapping tool.

According to Moore's release, the tool provides detailed demographic information through interactive maps and tracks disparities related to environmental hazards, exposures, risks, and health outcomes, generating a score that combines pollution levels with population vulnerability.

Now, the Elon Musk-led company faces more grim news in the form of President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful” spending bill, which was signed into law on July 4th. Among other things, the bill will bring an end to federal tax credits on certain EVs.

Here are three ways the bill could hit Tesla investors.

Tax Credits Will End

Federal tax incentives played a big role in boosting Tesla’s EV sales in recent years, but those incentives will soon come to an end. Because of Trump’s bill, buyers have until Sept. 30 to qualify for the federal tax credits on Tesla EVs before they’re terminated, CBS News reported.

Before the bill passed, new EVs came with a $7,500 federal tax credit, while used EVs came with credits of up to $4,000. The idea behind the credits was to make EVs more affordable.

That’s important, because the average purchase price of a new EV is about $9,000 higher in the U.S. than the average new gas-powered car, according to Kelley Blue Book data cited by CBS News. Used EVs cost roughly $2,000 more than comparable gas cars, on average.

An end to the tax credit will hurt Tesla — and Tesla shareholders — because it narrows the number of potential EV buyers.

I Sold My Tesla: Here’s How Much I Got for It and What I’m Driving Instead

Rival EV Companies Will Get a Boost

As Business Insider reported, one key provision in the new bill is that cars made by companies that sold more than 200,000 “accepted” EVs between December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2025 do not qualify for the tax credit. This provision will mainly impact Tesla, which sells a lot more cars than that in a single quarter.

In contrast, rivals Rivian and Lucid have not reached the 200,000 milestone, meaning their customers can still get tax credits. This could give them an edge against Tesla, at least over the short term.

Sales Could Decline Further

Tesla’s EV sales have already slumped badly this year. The company recently posted second-quarter car sales of 384,122 — down 13.5% from the previous year, CNN reported. It was the biggest year-over-year decline in Tesla history, and followed a similarly dismal first quarter.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/esF_BEgyyuJux2hFSN.v_A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/gobankingrates_644/e392bb5c5e7cd330de525a3e0de32146,N,,2025-07-20 11:00:49.789386

Now We Must Build Infrastructure - Forbes,Ken Silverstein,,,,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2025/07/20/the-market-has-chosen-renewables-now-we-must-build-infrastructure/,"Without basic energy infrastructure, these countries are unable to develop or provide universal electricity.
Still, Africa receives only about 2% of global renewable energy investment—a glaring disparity between the need and the support.
Multilateral financial institutions—like the World Bank, African Development Bank, and Asian Development Bank—must shift their focus to long-term infrastructure investment, concessional loans, and risk guarantees.
Indeed, the international community must commit to serious financing and infrastructure development that makes it possible.
Building and financing resilient, interconnected energy systems is the defining challenge of our time—and the key to bridging the global energy divide.","In a remote village in Sierra Leone, the sun dips below the horizon—but this time, the lights stay on. A solar-powered mini grid, supported by the African Development Bank, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), and local stakeholders, delivers clean electricity to homes and businesses around the clock.

Once dependent on kerosene lamps and diesel generators, many villages now run on clean energy. Electricity powers schools and clinics, and small businesses have expanded—improving safety, education, and economic prospects in the process.

Yet 2,000 miles away, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and nearby countries in Central Africa, the situation is quite different. These areas also receive plenty of sunshine, but much of it goes untapped. Why? Because investors are cautious. The electric grids are fragile or non-existent. Governments often lack the creditworthiness to support large-scale green energy projects, and the cost of financing is prohibitive. Without basic energy infrastructure, these countries are unable to develop or provide universal electricity.

The contrast between Sierra Leone and the DRC isn’t a question of technology or political will. It’s a crisis of infrastructure—and of a global financial system that has failed to prioritize it. Bridging the energy access gap will require hundreds of billions of dollars in additional investment by 2030, primarily in transmission and distribution systems across low-income countries.

According to the International Energy Agency, global spending on clean-energy networks must increase from approximately $270 billion in 2023 to $870 billion per year by the early 2030s to meet climate and energy goals. Consider this: 570 million people in Africa and 750 million people worldwide still lack access to electricity.

Francesco La Camera, Director-General of IRENA, argues that incremental project finance won’t narrow this gulf. Instead, he calls for a paradigm shift: long-term infrastructure deals backed by multilateral institutions, aimed at building resilient energy systems from the ground up.

“This is not charity,” La Camera told me. “It’s development. We must rethink how cooperation between the North and South works—and connect that development to infrastructure that supports new energy.”

The Climate Clock Is Ticking

Scientists warn that the window for action is closing. NASA confirmed in 2024 that the world has already crossed the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold—the level at which irreversible climate damage becomes increasingly likely. According to IRENA, the world must triple renewable energy capacity by 2030. To stay on course, global CO2 levels must fall 43% by 2030 and 60% by 2035.

But this transition can’t happen without climate finance. In Africa, multilateral financial institutions have coordinated project pipelines totaling $2 billion in just one year, helping countries like Sierra Leone build capacity and attract long-term investment. Still, Africa receives only about 2% of global renewable energy investment—a glaring disparity between the need and the support.

In truth, energy infrastructure is the 21st century’s Marshall Plan—a systems-level investment that could transform economies, reduce emissions, and bring electricity to hundreds of millions.

Africa has enormous potential for clean energy. On average, renewables—mostly hydropower—account for about 22% of the continent's electricity generation. Nigeria, for example, aims to achieve 50% renewable electricity through localized microgrids, with support from the World Bank and the African Development Bank.

Meanwhile, the global energy shift has reached a critical juncture. In 2023, 92% of new electricity capacity added worldwide came from renewable sources—a trend that appears likely to continue. This occurs despite geopolitical instability, the Trump administration’s support of fossil fuels, and its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement.

“We’ve passed the tipping point,” La Camera says. “The market has made its choice. But unless multilateral lenders rewrite the rules of development, much of the Global South will be left in the dark.”

It’s not enough to install solar panels or wind farms. Electricity needs a flexible and interconnected grid to manage variable supply and growing demand. Many low-income countries lack that backbone.

Time to Rethink Development Finance

This “infrastructure gap” also inflates borrowing costs, creating a vicious cycle: the perceived risk keeps investors away, which further erodes infrastructure and deters more capital. Poor countries spend most of their money repaying debt—not building distribution networks.

In many African nations, the cost of capital for infrastructure projects can range from 12% to 20%, compared to 4% to 6% in developed markets, according to estimates from the African Development Bank and the International Energy Agency. That difference alone can double project costs.

“Without reliable infrastructure, investors won’t risk their capital,” La Camera says. “You can’t put electrons into a grid that doesn’t exist. And if people can’t afford to pay for electricity, the projects aren’t bankable.”

The director-general doesn’t mince words: the current project-by-project aid model isn’t effective. What’s needed now is a structural response.

Multilateral financial institutions—like the World Bank, African Development Bank, and Asian Development Bank—must shift their focus to long-term infrastructure investment, concessional loans, and risk guarantees. These tools can unlock funding and make otherwise unbankable renewable projects feasible.

In 2022, multilateral development banks provided approximately $65 billion in climate finance, with a significant portion directed at energy infrastructure and policy support in low- and middle-income countries, according to the MDB Joint Report on Climate Finance. But that still falls far short. The African Development Bank estimates the continent needs $130 billion per year in energy investment to meet demand and achieve much broader electricity access by 2030.

This isn’t just good policy—it’s good economics. Infrastructure investment drives growth, creates jobs, and lays the foundation for long-term development.

Take Uzbekistan: IRENA, working with the European Investment Bank, helped facilitate funding for 900 megawatts of utility-scale solar energy, including a 400 MW project that will power approximately one million households and reduce the country’s reliance on natural gas.

“These are not isolated cases,” La Camera said. “They show how infrastructure-led development and multilateral support can unlock the transition.”

Why Not Leave To The Private Sector?

Some critics argue that development should be left to private markets, warning that favorable financing can distort competition or create dependency. Others question whether fledgling governments can effectively manage infrastructure investments.

While those concerns are real, they miss the point. Without infrastructure, markets can’t function. Investors won’t commit to regions where offtake is uncertain and power grids are unreliable. Multilateral banks don’t replace the private sector—they enable it.

La Camera is cautiously optimistic that we can solve the crisis dilemma while bringing clean energy to millions globally. “It’s becoming harder to meet the Paris goals—but we must not stop. The transition is unstoppable—always up, up, and up.”

Still, hope alone won’t power homes or stabilize grids. Indeed, the international community must commit to serious financing and infrastructure development that makes it possible. Half-hearted efforts prolong the imbalance.

Building and financing resilient, interconnected energy systems is the defining challenge of our time—and the key to bridging the global energy divide. It means rethinking development, rewriting the rules, and ensuring that everyone, everywhere, has access to clean electricity—not just to raise living standards, but to confront climate change on a large scale.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68792f57b61a0844081105ad/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-07-20 11:01:18.540971

Kinetic Green founder emphasised that it could take at least two to three years for the players in the automobile sector to localise the supply chain or adopt alternative technologies.

'It will impact the industry if it's not solved because it's not easy to change your product design and supply chain. The EV sector is scrambling somehow to manage for the short run. But I think there has to be a government-to-government solution very soon in the medium term. Because it will take two to three years to try to localise the supply chain or change the technology altogether. So I think it's important that this is resolved,' Sulajja Firodia Motwani said during the unveiling event of the company's electric Luxury Golf & Lifestyle Cart in partnership with Tonino Lamborghini SpA of Italy.

She further added, 'We faced a similar situation in COVID on semiconductors; if you remember, the government did follow through and resolve it. I'm hopeful that something will emerge from this.'

She added that until the issue is solved, the company is working on developing alternative technologies to mitigate the adverse impact of such restrictions arising from global geopolitical moves.

'But in the meantime, we are finding alternatives so that the business can continue, but it's not ideal to do that, and also maybe not everybody can. So it (restrictions on rare-earth material by China) will impact the sector,' she added.

The central government has earmarked Rs 1,345 crore to incentivise rare earth magnets production in India.

For context, early this April, China announced a decision to implement export controls on certain rare earth-related items, pushing a supply shortage across the world, including India.

Meanwhile, India is in touch with the Chinese side, seeking predictability in the supply of rare earth metals -- which had been put under the export controls regime by the Xi administration.

China's overwhelming control of global rare earth processing - commanding over 90 per cent of the world's magnet production capacity - has created significant vulnerabilities for industries worldwide. These materials are critical across multiple sectors, including automobiles, home appliances, and clean energy systems.Beyond China, there are only a few alternative suppliers of critical minerals.

The Union Cabinet in January 2025 approved the launch of the National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM) with an expenditure of Rs 16,300 crore and an expected investment of Rs 18,000 crore by Public Sector Undertakings.

Recently, Union Minister for Coal and Mines G Kishan Reddy said the central government is actively encouraging private companies to mine and explore critical minerals overseas and bring them back into the country to serve the needs of the domestic industry.

Speaking on the incentives to the industry, Motwani said, 'The government has to continue supporting the adoption of EVs. Once we come to, today we are at about 7-8 per cent EV. Once we come to 25-30 per cent EV, then we'll have critical mass on supply chain, on scale, and on ecosystem.

'We have begun well, but we are far from done. The government must continue supporting the adoption of electric vehicles,' she added.

She further noted the resistance from traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) players who have vested interests in maintaining the status quo. 'There is a large counterforce from existing ICE manufacturers who naturally want to protect their investments and may not wish to see EVs succeed. However, it's encouraging that the government remains focused. Schemes like EMPS and the PM-eBus Sewa, lower GST rates, ecosystem support, and a strong Make-in-India push should continue to drive demand and adoption,' Kinetic Green founder asserted.(ANI)

At the center of this transformation is Canaan Inc., a Chinese-born but increasingly U.S.-focused player in the Bitcoin mining hardware ecosystem. The company's recent strategic pivot—discontinuing its non-core AI semiconductor business to double down on U.S. manufacturing and self-mining operations—has significant implications for the sector's future. As localized production and supply chain resilience emerge as critical factors in crypto mining, Canaan's moves offer a blueprint for how companies can navigate a landscape rife with tariffs, energy volatility, and regulatory uncertainty.

The Rationale Behind Canaan's Realignment

Canaan's decision to exit the AI semiconductor market, which generated just $0.9 million in revenue in 2024, is emblematic of a broader industry trend: the consolidation of resources into core competencies. By eliminating this underperforming unit, the company is reallocating capital to its Bitcoin mining hardware and self-mining operations, which have demonstrated stronger growth potential. This shift is not merely a defensive tactic but a calculated move to capitalize on the U.S. market's growing appetite for secure, domestically produced mining infrastructure.

The U.S. has become a linchpin for Bitcoin mining due to its access to low-cost energy, favorable regulatory environments in states like Texas and Wyoming, and a desire to insulate operations from global supply chain shocks. Canaan's $30 million stock repurchase program, coupled with its Q1 2025 revenue surge of 136% year-over-year to $82.8 million, underscores its confidence in this strategy. The company's recent contract to supply 6,840 Avalon A15Pro miners to Cipher Mining Inc. for deployment in the Black Pearl facility is a testament to the demand for U.S.-manufactured hardware. These machines, with their 221 terahashes-per-second hash rate and 16.6 joules-per-terahash efficiency, position Canaan as a competitive force in a market where energy efficiency is a make-or-break metric.

Localized Manufacturing: A Sector-Wide Imperative

Canaan's U.S. expansion aligns with a broader industry push toward localized production. The JPMorgan report on U.S. Bitcoin miners in Q1 2025 highlighted a sector in the throes of transformation, with four out of five tracked companies reporting record profits. This surge in profitability is partly attributed to strategic proximity to low-cost energy sources and the ability to bypass global supply chain bottlenecks. For instance, IREN (IREN) and CleanSpark (CLSK) have leveraged their U.S. operations to achieve all-in cash costs as low as $36,400 per Bitcoin—a stark contrast to the $72,600 per coin for MARA Holdings (MARA).

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that cryptocurrency mining accounts for 0.6% to 2.3% of national electricity consumption, with mining facilities often co-located near underutilized hydroelectric plants or natural gas wells. This geographic arbitrage not only reduces energy costs but also enhances resilience against geopolitical disruptions, such as China's 2021 regulatory crackdown or Russia's recent energy export constraints. Canaan's investment in U.S. and Malaysian facilities reflects a similar logic, ensuring that its hardware is produced closer to markets where demand is surging and energy costs are favorable.

Supply Chain Resilience and Investment Opportunities

The crypto mining hardware sector is no stranger to volatility, but localized manufacturing is mitigating some of the most pressing risks. Tariffs on Chinese imports, for example, have made U.S. operators increasingly wary of relying on cross-border logistics. Canaan's U.S. production of the Avalon A15Pro—a machine already deployed in the U.S. and Malaysia—demonstrates how companies can hedge against these risks while meeting customer demand for “Made in America” solutions.

Moreover, the integration of AI-driven analytics into mining operations is creating new value propositions. Advanced software now enables real-time energy consumption tracking, fault prediction, and dynamic load adjustments, all of which enhance the profitability of hardware investments. Canaan's focus on self-mining and its next-generation Avalon A16 miner, expected to debut in late 2025, suggests the company is positioning itself at the intersection of hardware innovation and operational intelligence.

Risks and Rewards for Investors

While Canaan's strategy is compelling, investors must weigh the risks. The company's decision to terminate the second tranche of a $100 million preferred share financing due to adverse market conditions highlights its vulnerability to capital constraints. Additionally, its reliance on North American operations—where it maintains a 62.3% revenue share from mining arrangements—exposes it to margin pressures compared to fully owned assets.

However, the sector's growth trajectory remains robust. The global crypto mining hardware market is projected to grow at a 13.9% CAGR through 2030, with the ASIC segment expected to reach $33.1 billion by then. For companies like Canaan, which already boasts a strong balance sheet (more cash than debt) and a $0.044/kWh power cost advantage, the long-term outlook is promising.

A Strategic Play for the Future

Canaan's strategic shift to U.S. manufacturing is more than a tactical move—it's a response to the structural realities of the crypto mining industry. As the sector grapples with energy costs, regulatory scrutiny, and the need for rapid scalability, localized production and supply chain resilience will be the cornerstones of competitive advantage. For investors, this presents an opportunity to bet on companies that can navigate these challenges while delivering innovation.

Canaan's partnership with Cipher Mining, its aggressive cost-cutting, and its geographic diversification make it a compelling case study. However, success will depend on its ability to sustain its financial discipline, advance its next-generation hardware, and maintain its foothold in the U.S. market. For those willing to stomach the sector's inherent volatility, the rewards could be substantial—as Bitcoin's price trends and institutional adoption continue to drive demand for mining infrastructure.

For Prince George entrepreneur Simon Angus, mistakes made trying to build the world’s first fully sustainable electric-powered sailing catamaran became the blueprint for his latest innovation: virtually indestructible solar panels.

In November 2019, Angus quit his job as project manager at the Husky Energy oil refinery in Prince George (now Tidewater) and started Open Waters Design and Manufacturing. He spent the next two and a half years building a prototype for a lightweight carbon-fibre composite yacht that uses no fossil fuels and is compact enough to be shipped disassembled in a 40-foot rail car.

The catamaran relied on solar panels to power lights, refrigeration and other creature comforts, while the kinetic energy of the boat in motion turned propellers to store electricity through a hydro-regenerative system used to power twin 10-kilowatt electric motors.

The ship proved seaworthy in tests in Florida, but the project ultimately failed because the after-market solar panels cracked and didn’t generate enough electricity. Another issue was that the panels came only in rectangular shapes, limiting where they could be applied. That ruled out using solar in small or irregularly shaped areas.

“Those solar panels we bought — if you held them wrong, they would crack. And if you do that to all the panels, you end up with a very poor, inefficient solar array that isn’t going to generate the power you need,” said Angus.

Angus has since developed a way to produce panels with solar cells built into the laminate, which can then be cut into virtually any size or shape. The vacuum process starts with layers of composite fibre and solar cells laid over a recycled foam core material. Air is then sucked out between the layers to form ultra-tight bonds as they cure in a mould. Once cured, the panels are injected with resin to give them strength.

Just three millimetres thick, the finished panel is incredibly strong and durable, and can be used on boat decks or other surfaces.

“I said to myself, if we can encapsulate solar panels into a fibreglass laminate, then maybe we can protect the cells really well and do any sort of shape—and that’s what we’ve done,” said Angus.

“It’s got a non-slip coating on it, so when you glue this down to the boat you can walk on it. So basically it becomes a decking material, and we can do any size, any shape. You can take one of these panels and beat it with a stick and it basically won’t break. We’ve figured out how to make solar part of the boat.”

Word is getting out internationally to boat manufacturers looking for robust panels that offer a clean-energy alternative to noisy generators. The panels can also be used on building facades and other construction applications.

“We spent two years in (research and development) to try to figure out how to build it, and now we have so many orders that we’re automating the manufacturing process,” Angus said.

“It’s an expensive process right now. We can compete with diesel fuel, but we can’t compete with electricity, and we need to reduce the manufacturing costs.”

With Canada committed to increasing military spending — driven by Prime Minister Mark Carney’s pledge to allocate up to five per cent of the country’s GDP to defence by 2035 — Angus hopes to position his fibreglass panels for military use.

“There are military applications,” he said. “We’ve actually got people here with guns and we’ll shoot some of them to prove how durable they are. Obviously, you’ll blow a hole in it, but the idea is we don’t get short circuits and we don’t destroy them. We’ve already drilled holes in them and it hasn’t affected performance too much.”

Later this fall, Angus plans to install the panels on the exterior walls and roof of a 53-foot refrigerated trailer, typically used to haul perishables over long distances. The panels will be connected to a series of 60 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion batteries hooked to a phase inverter to maximize efficiency.

Once the trailer conversion is complete, Angus will have it towed to Golden, BC, where it will pair with a diesel-electric hybrid logging truck built by Edison Motors to demonstrate that green transportation is possible.

“We’re going to be able to charge the truck and do 100 kilometres on the charge,” said Angus. “We can really only afford to do those trailers when we’re fully automated.”

The current 6,000-square-foot shop will eventually produce panels with a daily electrical output of 12 kilowatts. Angus is also planning a 20,000-square-foot automated production facility that would boost output to 50 kW per day.

Open Waters, with a team of seven employees based in downtown Prince George, already has enough orders to stay busy through the summer. The company plans to expand its workforce to 18 by fall.

The Open Waters project is one of 12 selected as semi-finalists in the Northern Angel Summit. Angus is competing for a $100,000 prize, raised privately by 20 local investors in the Northern Innovation Network (formerly Hubspace). Six finalists will be chosen later this summer to pitch their projects Sept. 25 in a Dragon’s Den-style event at the Prince George Civic and Conference Centre.

The Northern Innovation Network provides business coaching, mentorship, training, networking and access to potential funding. The Sept. 25 event is sponsored by the Northern Development Initiative Trust, Innovate BC and Pacific Economic Development Canada.

Angus has already secured about $1.5 million in non-dilutive funding and loans, but says he needs to raise at least another $1 million in capital to unlock all available grant programs. He’s already received grants from the National Research Council, the BC Manufacturing Jobs Fund and BC Clean.

He hasn’t scrapped his boat-building ambitions, either. Angus still plans to give the sailing catamaran another go, this time using double the number of solar panels over the same space to generate more power.",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/princegeorgematters/pgc-images/business/pgc-2025-07-14-open-waters-solar-panels-robo-arm-simon-angus.jpg;w=1200;h=800;mode=crop,N,,2025-07-20 12:01:08.288886

As Republican leaders push to roll back key climate and energy provisions under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), new data shows that many of the states set to suffer the most job losses are red states that have reaped major economic benefits from the very programs now under threat.

The proposed legislation, currently under debate in the House, aims to phase out clean-energy tax incentives for domestic manufacturing, solar, wind, electric vehicles, and battery production. These subsidies—championed by the Biden administration and passed in 2022—have helped attract billions in private investment to regions traditionally dependent on fossil fuels or struggling with industrial decline.

Ironically, a large share of these investments has flowed into conservative-leaning states such as Georgia, South Carolina, Texas, Kentucky, and Oklahoma—states represented by members of Congress who now support repealing the same subsidies.

A Job Engine That May Be Derailed

According to the Department of Energy, the IRA has already contributed to over 270,000 new clean-energy jobs since its passage, with more than half located in states that voted Republican in the 2024 presidential election. These include factory construction jobs, EV supply chain roles, and skilled labor in renewable infrastructure.

If the rollback proposal advances, analysts warn that thousands of jobs could be lost or never materialize, especially in regions where clean-energy development is just beginning to take off.

A report by the BlueGreen Alliance estimates that repealing IRA subsidies could cancel or stall over $90 billion in active private investment, disproportionately affecting red-state communities that had only recently started to see economic revitalization through clean tech.

Industry Voices Raise Alarm

Business leaders and trade associations have started pushing back. Executives in the solar and EV manufacturing sectors have publicly warned that rolling back federal support could disrupt hiring, raise costs, and even push some firms to move operations abroad.

“The IRA incentives gave us the certainty to expand in places like rural Georgia and Kentucky,” said one senior official at a battery production company. “Without those commitments, we can’t guarantee the scale or timeline we promised.”

The American Clean Power Association also issued a statement urging lawmakers to recognize that clean-energy growth is no longer a partisan issue, pointing to job creation numbers in Republican districts as proof of broad economic value.

Political Tensions on the Rise

The situation has created quiet discomfort among some Republican governors and mayors, who privately acknowledge the risk to local economies. However, few have broken ranks publicly, likely due to pressure from national party leaders and conservative interest groups.

In a report by The Washington Post, internal memos show that local officials in Texas and Oklahoma are asking congressional offices for clarity on how a repeal would impact federally-backed projects in progress.

Looking Ahead

While the bill still faces a challenging path in the Senate, where Democrats hold enough seats to block a full repeal, parts of the rollback could be passed through budget negotiations later this year.

As the 2026 midterm elections approach, the economic fallout of energy policy decisions will likely become a key issue—particularly in regions that now rely on clean-energy investment for job creation and growth.

The centerpiece of President Joe Biden’s climate and economic strategy—the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)—is now facing a serious challenge as House Republicans introduce sweeping proposals to reduce or eliminate key funding provisions within the law.

Passed in 2022, the IRA was celebrated as the most ambitious climate investment in U.S. history, allocating over $369 billion toward clean energy, emissions reductions, and domestic manufacturing incentives. Now, amid broader efforts to cut federal spending, Republican lawmakers have introduced a bill that would target many of the law’s energy-related tax credits and funding programs.

The proposed cuts could reverse much of the progress made in clean-energy job creation, emissions control, and green infrastructure expansion over the last two years.

What the GOP Proposal Seeks to Eliminate

The rollback plan includes:

Phasing out tax credits for solar, wind, and battery production

Eliminating EV subsidies and consumer rebates

Reducing grants for green manufacturing and low-income energy programs

Cutting climate-resilience funds for rural and coastal communities

Proponents of the GOP proposal argue that the IRA represents unchecked spending and say the rollback is necessary to control inflation, despite evidence that the law has actually helped reduce energy costs for consumers in several regions.

Economic and Climate Impact

According to the Department of Energy, the IRA has supported more than $270 billion in private-sector investment since 2022 and has helped launch dozens of new manufacturing facilities across the country.

Independent analysts estimate that the full rollback of IRA provisions could:

Cancel or delay over 130 clean-tech projects currently under construction

Eliminate up to 170,000 jobs over the next three years

Raise long-term energy costs in areas transitioning away from fossil fuels

Increase U.S. carbon emissions by 6–10% over the next decade

Business and labor groups have expressed alarm, warning that the repeal could damage American competitiveness in clean technology, particularly as China and the EU ramp up their own climate investments.

Political Divide and Regional Fallout

While the Republican proposal enjoys strong support among fiscal conservatives, it has also drawn criticism from governors and business leaders in red states who have benefited from IRA-driven investments.

Many Southern and Midwestern states have seen rapid job growth and infrastructure upgrades tied to the IRA—especially in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing and battery production.

“The IRA brought our region back to life,” said a mayor in rural Tennessee whose town is home to a new EV parts plant. “Rolling it back would hit us harder than it would Washington.”

A detailed report by the Washington Post highlights the tension, with some Republican lawmakers torn between party pressure and local economic interests.

What Comes Next

The bill is expected to be reviewed in committee later this month. While a full repeal is unlikely in the Democratic-controlled Senate, the proposal could reshape budget negotiations this fall and serve as a campaign issue heading into the 2026 midterm elections.

The White House has vowed to defend the law, calling it “a vital foundation for a secure energy future and a thriving green economy.” Advocacy groups, meanwhile, are ramping up pressure on lawmakers to protect the programs they credit with reducing emissions, lowering utility bills, and creating long-term economic opportunity.

As a climate advocate with Citizens’ Climate Lobby in Tacoma, I was disappointed to see the budget reconciliation bill recently signed by President Donald Trump once again sideline critical climate investments.

Climate change isn’t a distant threat — it’s here. From smoky summers in the Pacific Northwest to erratic weather, the evidence is clear. Yet this budget prioritizes short-term interests over long-term sustainability, ignoring clean energy innovation, disaster preparedness and efforts to cut carbon pollution.

Washingtonians understand the stakes. We see salmon runs dwindling, forests burning and coastal communities threatened by sea-level rise. Our national budget should reflect those realities — not ignore them.

We need Congress to look beyond short-term politics and invest in a livable future. That means putting climate solutions — like carbon pricing, clean energy tax credits and support for workers — at the center of budget policy.

Our children and grandchildren deserve better than a budget that pretends climate change isn’t real.

Jason Berkowitz, Tacoma

Should have backed Palmer

The TNT missed the mark by not endorsing Latasha Palmer for City Council Position 6. She’s the only candidate in that race ready to govern on day one. The endorsement of another candidate ignores her extensive community work and detailed policy ideas.

Palmer spent 100+ hours on the 2024 Charter Review Committee. She knows how the council works and doesn’t work. She has offered numerous, specific policy proposals, both on the CRC and during her campaign. Check out both websites. She also engaged in ongoing public outreach during the review process and after it concluded in May of last year. She has testified at council meetings.

Palmer’s the only candidate who has championed strengthening Neighborhood Councils, promoted innovative approaches to affordable housing by co-founding Aya Community Land Trust, and pursued grassroots policy-making through a coalition she founded last fall, which urged the council to pass a long-overdue surveillance-technology ordinance, something now being considered.

Latasha Palmer has done more than enough to earn your endorsement. Former Mayor Bill Baarsma, Senator Yasmin Trudeau, Councilmember Jamika Scott, several unions, Indivisible Tacoma, and many other organizations and community members agree.

Delusions about Trump

A recent letter writer is obviously suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome, and his assertion that the “so called Christian Republicans” — especially the MAGA crowd — “worship” President Donald Trump is sheer lunacy.

Christian Republicans don’t hate anybody and they worship God.

The writer repeatedly smears Trump when in fact, voters knew Trump was no choir boy. Democrats knew Bill Clinton was a sexual predator and an admitted draft dodger and Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden were both corrupt, but never mind.

Trump ran for President for the right reason — he loves America. He wasn’t in politics for the money. Tax cuts for rich people are not “at the expense of the middle class or poor people.” The bottom 50% of tax payers contribute only 3% of federal tax revenue, while the top 10% contribute 72%, and it increases over time.

The administration has also systematically deleted mentions of climate change from federal websites while cutting back funds for global warming research.
He added it was “especially so since climate change is intensifying extreme weather events, and Trump’s attacks on green energy and support of fossil fuels will make those worse”.
“But if you want to deny the true costs of climate change, then you may be motivated to destroy the agency that documents these costs [Noaa].","Ever since Donald Trump began his second presidency, he has used an “invented” national energy emergency to help justify expanding oil, gas and coal while slashing green energy – despite years of scientific evidence that burning fossil fuels has contributed significantly to climate change, say scholars and watchdogs.

It’s an agenda that in only its first six months, has put back environmental progress by decades, they say.

Trump’s skewed and unscientific energy priorities have come even as climate-change related weather disasters from huge floods in Texas to giant California fires have increased, and as Trump regulators are clamping down on spending for alternative fuels and weather research.

As the death toll from the Texas floods rose to over 100 on 7 July, Trump signed an executive order that added new treasury department restrictions on tax subsidies for wind and solar projects.

That order came days after Trump signed his One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which included provisions to gut big tax credits for green energy contained in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act legislation Congress passed during Joe Biden’s presidency

In another oddly timed move, underscoring the administration’s war on science, its proposed budget for the coming fiscal year would shutter 10 labs that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration runs – specifically ones that conduct key research on ways weather changes are affected by a warming earth.

Trump also signed four executive orders in April to help revive the beleaguered and polluting coal industry, which he and key cabinet members touted more at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh as they promoted plans by private companies to spend $92bn on AI projects and expand coal and natural gas in Pennsylvania.

The blinkered focus that Trump and his key regulators place on their energy policies reflect the administration’s denigration of science, while posing dangers to public health and scientific progress. And, critics say, this is all happening as university research and government labs face big cutbacks in funding and staff.

Trump has pushed for more fossil-fuel production, rhapsodized about “beautiful coal”, dubbed climate change a “hoax” and invoked his “drill, baby, drill” mantra to promote more oil and gas projects after receiving $75m in campaign donations in 2024 from fossil-fuel interests.

Scholars have hit out at the administration for firing hundreds of scientists and experts working on a major federal report detailing how climate change is impacting the country. The administration has also systematically deleted mentions of climate change from federal websites while cutting back funds for global warming research.

“Trump’s actions are a patent attempt to roll back decades of environmental progress, not because it makes any sense, economically, but because it does two things that Trump wants,” Naomi Oreskes, a Harvard historian of science, told the Guardian

“First, it helps his cronies in the oil, gas and coal industries, who we know he met with a Mar-a-Lago before the election, and who gave substantial sums to his election campaign.”

Oreskes said it’s also “part of a larger attempt to deny the credibility of environmental protection, tout court”.

“Look at Trump trying to force uneconomic coal fired power plants to stay open,” she continued. “That makes no economic sense, and defies the principles of free market economics that Republicans claim to support. But like the guys who jack up their trucks to make more pollution, Trump is trying to deny the necessity and credibility of environmental concerns.”

Oreskes stressed that much of the science Trump “is in the process of destroying forms the basis for environmental and public health protection in this country: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the US Geological Survey and the EPA, plus all the federally funded science at universities across the country, including my home institution, Harvard. None of this makes economic sense.”

Many scientists echo Oreskes’s concerns as do Democratic attorneys general, who filed a lawsuit in May challenging the legality of the Trump administration’s declaration of a national “energy emergency” to justify its radical policies.

Meanwhile, regulatory and spending shifts at the Environmental Protection Agency, including staff and research cuts, have revealed the administration’s disregard for scientific evidence – particularly about climate change and its adverse economic effects.

In response to the cuts and policy shifts, a total of 278 EPA employees signed a letter in July denouncing the agency’s politicization and decrying policies that “undermine the EPA mission of protecting human health and the environment”. The EPA then put 144 of the employees who signed their names to the letter on leave for two weeks while an “administrative investigation” was conducted.

“This isn’t quite at the level of the 17th-century church’s persecution of Galileo for saying the Earth goes around the Sun, but it’s in a similar spirit of ideology trying to squelch science,” Michael Gerrard, who heads the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, told the Guardian.

“Trump’s use of an invented ‘energy emergency’ to justify more fossil-fuel production defies not only physics but arithmetic. The numbers show that the US is producing more oil and gas than any other country, and that Trump’s actions in knifing the wind and solar industries will raise the energy prices paid by US consumers.”

Gerrard stressed too that, on the Texas flooding, “the lack of sufficient warnings highlight how short-sighted are Trump’s drastic cuts to the National Weather Service and other federal scientific work”. He added it was “especially so since climate change is intensifying extreme weather events, and Trump’s attacks on green energy and support of fossil fuels will make those worse”.

Such criticism has not seemed to faze Trump or top agency appointees like EPA administrator Lee Zeldin.

Last month, 1,500 staffers who work in EPA’s office of research and development (ORD) were told in a staff meeting that they would have to apply for about 400 new posts in other EPA offices. What will happen to employees who don’t land new positions is unclear.

“Gutting the … [ORD] is a loss for health,” warned Laura Kate Bender, assistant vice-president of nationwide healthy air at the American Lung Association.

Further experts and watchdogs have stressed that the health of millions of Americans was threatened by Zeldin’s May announcement of plans to cut its budget by $300m in fiscal year 2026 – a move that’s part of a makeover to reduce spending levels to those of the 1980s under Ronald Reagan.

In response to the cuts and policy shifts, 278 EPA employees signed a letter in July denouncing the agency’s politicization and decrying policies that “undermine the EPA mission of protecting human health and the environment”. The EPA then put 144 of the employees who signed their names to the letter on leave for two weeks while an “administrative investigation” was conducted.

On Friday, the EPA doubled down on the cuts and say it would be reducing its entire workforce by at least 23% through voluntary retirements and layoffs.

Gerrard noted that the administration’s misguided energy moves and rejection of science are having enormous societal costs: “Laboratories are being shut down around the country, experiments that might be on the cusp of great discoveries are being halted, and young aspiring scientists are rethinking their career paths. Other countries are recruiting US scientists and offering them friendlier environments.”

Looking ahead, Oreskes, too, warns that the Trump administration’s denigration of science will do long term damage to public health, the environment and scientific progress

“The scientific agencies that Trump is destroying, such as the National Weather Service, save the American people and American business billions of dollars in avoided property damage and health costs,” she said.

“But if you want to deny the true costs of climate change, then you may be motivated to destroy the agency that documents these costs [Noaa]. And if you want to deny the need for environmental and public health protection, then an effective way to do that is to destroy the scientific agencies and academic research that for decades have proven that need.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96aec834ad4aaf82b1d34c25a00dcb32aa881297/472_0_5338_4272/master/5338.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=54ea2401d12b092885a6ba47cba61264",N,,2025-07-20 09:02:02.611463

In 2023, in a case titled Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency, the Supreme Court curtailed which wetlands are covered by the Clean Water Act, eliminating federal protections for millions of acres of wetlands across the country.
In states without significant protection laws, including Illinois, those wetlands may be at risk of being filled in or paved over without mitigation.
Over the past few decades, the Clean Water Act has helped protect wetlands across the country.
State Senator Laura Ellman, who initially introduced the bill in the state senate last year, said wetlands deserve protection.","On a warm day in late May, Paul Botts stood on a tall observation tower at the Dixon Waterfowl Refuge in Hennepin, Illinois.

“That’s the levee, where that tree line is,” he said, gesturing out past a large expanse of fresh water and a sea of grassy plants, toward a row of trees along the nearby Illinois River. “This was a natural backwater wetland for, probably since the last ice age,” Botts, the executive director of the Wetlands Initiative, noted.

Once, much of Illinois was covered with prairie, oak savanna, and forests. Here, water had free rein, pooling wherever it saw fit and forming wetlands large and small among the grasslands and trees. But as settlers expanded westward and agriculture began to take over the Midwest, this ebb and flow of water was tamed. At the Dixon site, local farmers built the levee to separate the flat riverbank from the Illinois River, and they drained the land to farm. This process played out across the state, as drainage, development, and conversion to agriculture razed the prairies and eliminated wetlands. Now, around 10 percent of Illinois’s original wetlands remain.

About 25 years ago, the Wetlands Initiative purchased the Dixon property to restore 3,000 acres of the former wetlands. Today, birds such as ducks, American white pelicans, and eastern kingbirds live among tall grass and freshwater lakes in the protected refuge. But some of Illinois’s other remaining wetlands sit on private lands, unprotected by nonprofits or the government. Those wetlands now face an uncertain future.

In 2023, in a case titled Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency, the Supreme Court curtailed which wetlands are covered by the Clean Water Act, eliminating federal protections for millions of acres of wetlands across the country. In some states, those wetlands are still protected under state-level protection laws. In states without significant protection laws, including Illinois, those wetlands may be at risk of being filled in or paved over without mitigation.

A coalition of Illinois environmental groups is pushing for a bill that would essentially return the state’s wetlands to a pre-Sackett level of protection. Advocates hope the proposed law will protect the few wetlands still left in the Prairie State.

“We can’t afford to lose any more of them,” said Emily Kowalski from Environment Illinois, one of the groups advocating for the bill. “And the immense value that they bring to us and the health and future of our water, our wildlife, our environment, and the state of Illinois.”

There are many different kinds of wetlands in Illinois, from cypress swamps to wet meadows to marshes, home to a vast array of wildlife, including threatened species such as Blanding’s turtles. These areas can capture water as it runs off on the landscape, helping to prevent floods, and filter out nutrient pollution from agricultural areas, helping to prevent harmful algal blooms in rivers and lakes. Wetlands can also store a lot of carbon, slowing the pace of climate change.

Over the past few decades, the Clean Water Act has helped protect wetlands across the country. Under the law, anyone who wants to fill in a body of water—for example, to build a new home on that land—needs to apply for a permit before doing so (with some exceptions). That person also has to mitigate any unavoidable impacts to that body of water, such as by restoring or creating new habitat on their property or elsewhere.

But in the Sackett decision, the court said the Clean Water Act only applies to “relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water” commonly referred to as “streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes.” For wetlands to be covered under the law, they need a “continuous surface connection” to other, covered bodies of water, ""so that there is no clear demarcation between ‘waters’ and wetlands.’” Or, as Botts put it, you now need water “sloshing back and forth all the time” between the wetland and another body of water for the wetland to be protected under the Clean Water Act.

This means that more isolated wetlands—such as a seasonal pool in the middle of a forest, or a swamp separated from a lake by a housing development—may no longer be protected. To some, this new dividing line can seem arbitrary. For one, even wetlands without a surface-level connection to another body of water are often connected to the larger groundwater system. Botts also pointed out that the idea of an “isolated wetland” doesn’t really depict how wetlands work as ecosystems, with wildlife moving seamlessly between wetlands and the surrounding landscape.

“We don't use that term ‘isolated,’” Botts said. “It's not really accurate.”

An analysis from the National Resources Defense Council estimated that the Sackett decision may eliminate Clean Water Act protections from around 130,000 to 970,000 acres of wetlands in Illinois, depending on how the court’s ruling is interpreted. Some of these wetlands may have already been impacted by the Supreme Court’s ruling. Becky Hammer, an attorney with the NRDC, has estimated that between March 2022 and March 2023, about 30 percent of the time someone requested to know if a wetland in Illinois was protected by the Clean Water Act, the government would find that the wetland was protected by the law. But between September 2023 and September 2024, after Sackett, that number dropped to just under 21 percent, nearly a third less.

The bill circulating through the Illinois legislature would, in essence, restore the whole state to a pre-Sackett level of wetland protection. When landowners wanted to fill in a wetland protected by the law, they would need to apply for a permit with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. They’d also need to pay for wetland restoration or protection somewhere else.

State Senator Laura Ellman, who initially introduced the bill in the state senate last year, said wetlands deserve protection. “It's good for communities, it's good for the environment, it's good for flora and fauna,” Ellman said. “And then with the Sackett decision carving out protections, we need to do something at the state [level]—so I'm thrilled to be part of trying to do this.”

Yet so far, the wetlands legislation hasn’t quite made it over the finish line in the Democrat-controlled Illinois state legislature. Concerns about the state budget made it difficult to get the legislation off the ground this year. And the bill has faced some opposition, including from the Illinois Farm Bureau, despite the fact that “normal farming, silviculture, and ranching activities” are exempted from the proposed regulations. (The Illinois Farm Bureau could not be reached for comment.)

Ashley Maybanks, from the Nature Conservancy in Illinois, also said that advocates didn’t have enough time to have conversations with relevant stakeholders, including county officials and agricultural groups. “We want to make sure that we're not unintentionally creating a burdensome program for people,” Maybanks said. “We also don't want it to be a hugely burdensome program for the Department of Natural Resources to administer.”

In other states, wetlands have been subject to a variety of state-level protections, or lack thereof, in the wake of the Sackett decision. In Michigan and Wisconsin, for example, existing state-level wetlands laws meant that very little changed after the Supreme Court’s ruling. In Colorado, the state legislature actually succeeded in passing a new wetlands protection bill in 2024, helping to fill “a regulatory gap created by” the Sackett decision, per the state. On the other hand, some state lawmakers, including in neighboring Indiana, have worked to loosen wetlands protections in recent years.

In Illinois, wetland conservation may be politically popular. In a poll of likely Illinois voters commissioned by the Nature Conservancy, 72 percent of respondents expressed support for the idea of a state wetlands protection program, including 92 percent of Democrats, 51 percent of Independents, and 59 percent of Republicans. The idea had high levels of support in Chicago, suburban areas, and rural parts of the state. Now, to drum up even more support for the bill, Environment Illinois has started sending people out to knock on doors and talk with Illinoisans about wetlands.

“When you actually share the science, share the information about what the value these wetlands bring to our water and us,” Kowalski said, “people understand and can see that these places are important and should be protected.”

On that warm day at the Dixon Waterfowl Refuge, red-winged blackbirds belted out their boisterous conkareeee! calls in all directions. A pair of towering sandhill cranes touched down at the water’s edge. At the edge of the wetland, wood ducks flew out of the row of trees that lined the Illinois River, swung across the levee, and fluttered into the tall grass.

Today, this landscape is maintained by people who are trying to protect this habitat after years of restoration. But once, this place was governed only by water, which pulsed across the land, trickled through rivulets, and percolated in the warm mud. Water nurtured the reeds and grasses and shaped depressions into pools, where ducks gathered and swallows dipped and dived in the breeze—all of it creating the vast, unified ecosystem that was the Midwest.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-20 13:01:56.627490
,EPA,2025-07-20 11:47:59+00:00,Baltimore Sun,Maryland fires back against EPA claims about its offshore wind permit - Baltimore Sun,Christine Condon,,,,,https://www.baltimoresun.com/2025/07/19/maryland-fires-back-against-epa-claims/,"The EPA had contended that when Maryland issued the permit to Baltimore-based company US Wind, it identified the wrong process for citizens to file appeals.
It was set for July 14 — about a month after MDE issued the permit, according to MDE’s website.
An EPA spokesperson said the agency had notified MDE that the final permit decision “contains an error, with clear guidance on next steps.
The US Wind project, which is planned about 10 miles from Ocean City’s shoreline, is the wind project that is closest to construction in this region.
Since President Donald Trump (R) took office for his second term, offshore wind projects have landed in his crosshairs.","The Maryland Department of the Environment is defending the permit it issued to a wind farm proposed off the coast of Ocean City, after a challenge from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The Thursday letter from Maryland Secretary of the Environment Serena McIlwain also said the state would not be reissuing the permit, as the EPA requested, because the state had not made a mistake that needed correcting.

The EPA had contended that when Maryland issued the permit to Baltimore-based company US Wind, it identified the wrong process for citizens to file appeals.

Amy Van Blarcom-Lackey, EPA administrator for Region 3, which includes Maryland and other mid-Atlantic states, contended in a July 7 letter that any appeals challenging the air pollution permit issued to US Wind should be filed to the clerk of the EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board.

But Maryland argues that its permit would need to be appealed through the state courts, which would involve filing a challenge at the appropriate circuit court — in this case in Worcester County.

Notably, the due date for a state court challenge has already passed. It was set for July 14 — about a month after MDE issued the permit, according to MDE’s website.

“Long-settled procedure dictates that state-issued permits are appealed under State law, not Federal law,” McIlwain’s letter says.

That letter also cites written decisions issued by the EPA’s appeals board, including one that stated that the board “lacked jurisdiction” to evaluate this type of permit.

“MDE will not re-issue the permit and will continue to follow the proper state procedures to consider appeals,” McIlwain concluded, near the end of the roughly two-page letter.

In an emailed response, the EPA stuck to its guns. An EPA spokesperson said the agency had notified MDE that the final permit decision “contains an error, with clear guidance on next steps. But they don’t seem to care about complying with legal requirements.”

The MDE website for the US Wind project originally referenced both the state appeals procedure and the EPA process, but McIlwain said that information had been “included at EPA’s request. It has been removed, and language has been added clarifying that the Federal appeals process does not apply.”

Authority to issue Clean Air Act permits like the one for US Wind is delegated to the state from the EPA — the basis of the federal agency’s claim for jurisdiction for appeals. That authority, specifically for permits on the outer continental shelf, was re-certified in early 2024 under the Biden administration.

The US Wind project, which is planned about 10 miles from Ocean City’s shoreline, is the wind project that is closest to construction in this region. The company, which leased the area in 2014, received a key permit from President Joe Biden’s (D) Department of the Interior at the end of 2024.

Final buildout of the project is still years away, but it calls for construction of 121 wind turbines, up to four offshore substations and one meteorological tower, according to the state’s website. When complete, the project could generate 2,200 megawatts of energy, enough to power up to 718,000 homes, according to the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.

Practically since its inception, the project has faced fierce opposition from local officials in the resort town, who cite concerns that beachgoers would lose a pristine ocean view if the turbines were visible from shore. Since President Donald Trump (R) took office for his second term, offshore wind projects have landed in his crosshairs. Earlier this week, Trump announced that wind and solar projects would undergo increased scrutiny under his administration. Trump’s “big beautiful bill” also rescinds tax credits for renewable energy projects that do not begin construction by next July.

In April, Trump appointed Blarcom-Lackey to lead the EPA’s Mid-Atlantic office. She succeeded Marylander Adam Ortiz, who moved to a deputy secretary role at MDE.

Two other companies have offshore leases in the vicinity of Ocean City and the Delaware beaches — Ørsted and Equinor. While Ørsted received its first lease area around the same time as US Wind, Equinor won its auction last year. Neither project has received its federal permits from the Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.",https://www.baltimoresun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/TBS-L-SPOTLIGHTENERGY-0709.jpg?w=1024&h=576,N,,2025-07-20 09:02:49.949846

Many LCTCS credential, degree and certification programs are focused on five core sectors – construction, manufacturing, transportation and logistics, information technology and healthcare.
To provide a more comprehensive framework for those students, LCTCS is in the process of implementing a new “one-door” integrated service model.
“I believe we are on target to get there, but we want to get there strategically,” he said.
“We remain heavily focused on industry sectors that are high-wage, high-demand and align with economic development.” LCTCS includes Baton Rouge Community College, Bossier Parish Community College, Central Louisiana Technical Community College, Delgado Community College, Louisiana Delta Community College, Fletcher Technical Community College, Northshore Technical Community College, Northwest Louisiana Technical Community College, Nunez Community College, River Parishes Community College, South Louisiana Community College, and SOWELA Technical Community College.","As the state continues to build a stronger and more diverse economy, the Louisiana Community and Technical College System (LCTCS) is serving as a powerful engine of progress as its institutions provide high-quality education and an increasingly large range of services to help residents overcome barriers to success.

“At a time when so many states are trying to figure out how to close workforce gaps, increase participation rates and support economic growth, we’re fortunate here in Louisiana to have a network of colleges that are built to do just that. They help connect people to purpose,” said Osmar Padilla, Assistant Secretary for Workforce Development at the Louisiana Workforce Commission.

So far this year, more than 38,000 people have completed an educational program at an LCTCS institution, an increase of more than 3,000 over the prior year. With 12 institutions and 56 total locations across the state, LCTCS offers access to residents from all walks of life, in large cities and rural communities. Many LCTCS credential, degree and certification programs are focused on five core sectors – construction, manufacturing, transportation and logistics, information technology and healthcare.

“We are in a skills-first labor market,” Padilla said. “There’s been a significant willingness among a lot of employers to understand that people are learning in different ways. LCTCS has been at the forefront of those conversations with employers and showcasing that we can train really good people and have really good outcomes with new ways of validating skills. LCTCS has proven that folks who earn those credentials and go into the workforce are just as strong of an employee as people who take a traditional pathway.”

LCTCS Vice President of Education Dr. Chandler LeBoeuf said much of that success comes from meeting people where they are and helping them succeed. While some LCTCS students enroll immediately after graduating high school, others are non-traditional students who are working towards completing an education while facing daily hurdles such as transportation and childcare needs, food insecurity, language barriers or balancing the need for full-time work with the desire to improve life for their families.

To provide a more comprehensive framework for those students, LCTCS is in the process of implementing a new “one-door” integrated service model. Rather than having students navigate a fragmented system of services on their own, LCTCS institutions are working with other agencies to bring those resources under one roof and provide guidance to help students find assistance.

“We know that a lot of times, the main barrier to students getting a credential or a degree is not about the learning. It’s about the resources outside of the classroom,” Dr. LeBoeuf said. “Those are the realities that many of our students deal with. Having those offices in one location will help us to triage those needs and get them addressed. The goal of the model is for students to exit out of one door with a credential in hand and a path toward long-term stability.”

Padilla said that with more than 108,000 job openings in Louisiana, LCTCS is well-positioned to connect people with those opportunities.

“We talk to employers every day, and they want good people with foundational skills who are eager to learn more,” he said. “It’s a real positive to see us moving to a model that is more person-centered and can provide the right resources, training and labor market awareness.”

Dr. LeBoeuf said he is confident that LCTCS is well on its way to achieving its goal of awarding at least 50,000 industry-based credentials by 2030. That goal is part of the state’s overall master plan for higher education, which calls for 85,000 such credentials to be awarded.

“I believe we are on target to get there, but we want to get there strategically,” he said. “We remain heavily focused on industry sectors that are high-wage, high-demand and align with economic development.”

Each case is slightly different, of course. The Dutch are recognising they may be generating more power than they actually need. The New Zealanders want to restore what could have been a major industry. Macron is rightly worried about whether it can be afforded given the perilous state of his country’s finances. Meanwhile, the Canadians want to ensure they are robustly independent from a predatory Trump administration that has openly discussed annexing the country.

And yet in each case the outcome is the same. Green targets are being scaled back. True, China is going in the other direction, but it has the raw materials and manufacturing expertise to make wind and especially solar power cost-effective. Almost every other country in the developed world is reconsidering the whole project and, where necessary, changing course.

There is just one country sticking to the green transition as if it were still 2020: Britain.

Under Ed Miliband, the Energy Secretary, and the green commissars who surround him, we are doubling down on renewables. We are stepping up wind farm subsidies, even after the Danish giant Ørsted pulled out of the massive Hornsea Four project in the North Sea after concluding that it wouldn’t be able to make any money from it.

Farmland is being ripped up to make way for state-supported solar panels. GB Energy will be tasked with putting solar panels on the roofs of schools, even though it is hard to see how that will make much difference to anything.

The National Wealth Fund is investing taxpayers’ money, on which it is meant to make a return, in carbon capture projects even though no one has any idea whether they will work or not.

Even fusion power is now expected to be part of the mix, with the Energy Secretary making it easier for developers to build new reactors with minimal planning restrictions.

Sure, it is the right decision to push forward with a technology in which the UK has some world-beating science. But it is still far from proven, while even committed free-market liberals (among whom I count myself) might wonder if a nuclear fusion plant wasn’t the kind of thing that needed to be checked over by the planning department before pressing the start button.

Anyone who even questions the costs or practicality of the plan is “betraying future generations”, as Miliband put it in a histrionic statement to Parliament earlier this month. The UK is pressing ahead as if nothing has changed.

And yet that is despite the fact that Britain needs to re-think its approach to green energy more urgently than any other country. We now have the highest industrial electricity prices in the developed world. Prices in the UK are almost 50pc more than in France and Germany, our two closest competitors according to figures from the Office for National Statistics.

They are now four times more expensive than in the United States and Canada.

The price has risen by an eye-watering 90pc since 2021 and by far more since the start of the century. There are worries about the reliability of supply. On top of all that, there are green levies added on top and planning restrictions on any form of expansion.

We can see the results in the wave of factory closures and the collapse in production. The chemical industry has witnessed a 40pc fall in output since 2021 alone, while overall output in energy intensive industries has fallen by 35pc over that time, and is now at a 35-year low. With every week that passes more and more factories are closing and most of them will never re-open.

As Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the founder of the Ineos industrial empire, has complained, we are pursuing “decarbonisation by deindustrialisation”.

That is crazy. In reality, the rest of the world has started to notice that the green transition is not living up to the hype and it is imposing huge costs on households and most of all industry. It is perfectly possible to keep the commitment to a net zero economy, while adjusting how we get there – and it is turning into a tragedy that the UK still doesn’t get it.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2025/07/18/TELEMMGLPICT000432496442_17528651232010_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bql0ESzSgmr2JmlmzSGWdBfoX55UGE1-QmdhXTcMmlCx4.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Comment,N,,2025-07-20 12:01:17.387287

Changes enacted July 4 under President Donald Trump’s domestic policy bill threaten to imperil several planned utility-scale solar farms and thousands of additional residential rooftop solar systems across the state by eliminating a 30% federal tax credit for such project costs much sooner than previously slated.

Potentially affected projects include one on Oahu that would be the biggest solar farm in the state and two on Maui that are on or near a bubble for starting construction by July 5, 2026, in order to qualify for credits under the new law.

Other planned solar farm projects, including two on Kauai projected to save ratepayers $800 million over 25 years and one slated to provide 20% of electricity needs on Hawaii island, are not expected to qualify for credits, putting their prospects in doubt or making them more costly for ratepayers.

For residential rooftop solar, credits will end for systems not placed in service by the end of this year, which is expected to result in a steep drop in what had been several thousand new systems added statewide annually in recent years.

“This new federal law is a gut punch to Hawaii’s rooftop solar market,” Rocky Mould, executive director of the Hawaii Solar Energy Association, said in an email.

Mould expects industry job losses plus future price increases for system components because of anticipated cutbacks in manufacturing and demand nationally.

“The sudden elimination of the federal residential tax credit after this year throws the market into disarray,” he said.

Hawaii, largely because of its geographic isolation, has the highest electricity prices in the nation and is subject to unique consequences of the new renewable energy policy changes.

Both rooftop and utility-scale solar systems have been the main driver in replacing imported foreign oil and diesel fuel-burning combustion turbine power plants that cost Hawaii ratepayers more for electricity while also emitting higher amounts of greenhouse gases contributing to climate change.

Previously, federal tax credits were available for residential projects that went into service before 2034 and for utility-scale projects that began construction before 2034.

Longer-term impacts

The effects on Hawaii ratepayers from the accelerated elimination of tax credits for utility-scale solar projects are expected to be longer-term, and could include higher prices from fossil fuel-­fired power plants running longer and higher prices for power generated by solar farms developed without tax credit subsidies.

Hawaiian Electric, which provides power to Oahu, Maui County and Hawaii island as the state’s largest utility, said there’s no question the new federal law will make it more difficult and potentially more costly to reach the state’s goal to have 100% of electricity generated by renewable sources by 2045.

“Any loss in renewable energy tax credits will likely result in higher prices for new renewable projects, which rely on such incentives to provide clean, affordable energy,” Rebecca Dayhuff-­Matsushima, Hawaiian Electric vice president for resource procurement, said in a statement.

In 2024 new utility-scale and rooftop solar power systems boosted the share of electricity generated by renewable sources for Hawaiian Electric to 36% from 33% a year earlier.

Those additions included the 60-megawatt AES Kuihelani Solar farm on Maui and three projects on Oahu: Hoohana Solar I (52 megawatts), Kupono Solar (42 megawatts) and AES West Oahu Solar (12.5 megawatts).

Several thousand new private rooftop solar system installations with a combined 61 megawatts of capacity also expanded use of renewable energy that generally costs less than power produced from fossil fuel.

Now with new federal tax credit deadlines, rooftop solar installations are expected to drop next year while utility-scale projects face major challenges to obtain tax credits if “substantial” construction does not begin by July 5, 2026.

Mould expects a near-term rush of homeowners trying to beat the Dec. 31 deadline, but also said permitting backlogs and interconnection delays make this challenging.

Some solar system loan companies and installers are considering cutoff dates as soon as September or October to avoid risk of missing the deadline, according to Mould, who also said there are efforts to expedite permitting and interconnections given the federal law change.

Marco Mangelsdorf, a ProVision Solar executive who has been in the business locally for 25 years, said a “shock wave” is about to hit the industry, resulting in a drop-off in business, job cuts and even some company closures.

A decade ago, after the state Public Utilities Commission ended a popular incentive program in October 2015 for rooftop solar installations that allowed system owners to sell excess electricity to utilities at the retail rate, the number of building permits issued for new systems fell from 14,249 in 2015 to 8,509 in 2016 and then to about 5,000 in each of the next two years.

There was a moderate rebound in subsequent years that reached 10,848 permits in 2023, according to data from Mangelsdorf, so there is some optimism that the anticipated falloff in rooftop solar system additions won’t be permanent.

Mould noted the state has a renewable energy income tax credit ranging from 22.5% to 35% that is capped at $5,000 per residential system.

“Given Hawaii’s high electricity prices, solar and energy storage still make a ton of sense,” he said.

Still, other factors including stiff tariffs being imposed by Trump on goods imported from foreign countries could make systems even more expensive.

Project pipeline

For utility-scale projects, a more complicated landscape lies ahead.

Under the new law, such projects that start construction by July 5, 2026, and go into service within four years from then can obtain federal tax credits.

Dayhuff-Matsushima said an upcoming request for renewable energy project proposals sought by Hawaiian Electric likely will result in projects that aren’t eligible for federal tax credits.

More immediately, four solar farm projects where renewable energy developers are negotiating contracts with Hawaiian Electric have projected construction schedules close to the tax credit deadline.

Of the four, two anticipate starting construction after the deadline, and two expect to start construction three to six months before the deadline.

The two projects in the worst spot are Keamuku Solar planned for Hawaii island, where construction of the 86-megawatt facility is projected to begin in 2027, and a 40-megawatt expansion of Kuihelani Solar on Maui, where construction is projected to begin between July and September of 2026.

In a better position are the 120-megawatt Mahi Solar project on Oahu and the 20-megawatt Pulehu Solar project on Maui, with construction anticipated to start in the first quarter of 2026, making any potential delays in regulatory and permitting approvals a critical issue.

Two developers pursuing the four projects, AES Corp. and Longroad Energy, did not respond to requests for comment.

AES also plans two solar farms on Kauai, where ratepayers own the utility company.

Kaua‘i Island Utility Cooperative announced in March that the two projects — Mana Solar and Kaawanui Solar with a combined capacity of 78 megawatts — were expected to displace the use of 13 million gallons of diesel annually while saving ratepayers $800 million over 25 years, generating enough power for over 30,000 homes and bringing the utility’s share of renewable energy to nearly 80% by 2028.

Construction, however, isn’t projected to begin until 2027, according to a PUC filing.

It’s possible that development can be accelerated for one or more Hawaii solar farm projects. However, Trump administration officials also aim to redefine what constitutes beginning construction, possibly requiring that a “substantial portion of a subject facility has been built,” according to an executive order Trump issued Monday.

“For too long, the Federal Government has forced American taxpayers to subsidize expensive and unreliable energy sources like wind and solar,” the order states. “The proliferation of these projects displaces affordable, reliable, dispatchable domestic energy sources, compromises our electric grid, and denigrates the beauty of our Nation’s natural landscape.”

Planned Hawaii solar farm projects also may have to contend with tariffs and further restrictions on tax credits depending on where components are made.

2045 outlook

Mark Glick, director of the Hawaii State Energy Office, said federal tax credit law changes will result in higher electricity prices but won’t block the state from achieving its 2045 clean energy goal.

“Neither the U.S. Congress nor federal tax credits are driving Hawaii’s commitment to be more energy self-sufficient,” he said in an email.

The state’s strategy to achieve the 2045 goal involves a mix of renewable energy sources, including biofuel, hydrogen, geothermal, wind and liquefied natural gas.

New federal tax credit deadlines also apply to wind farms but aren’t expected to upset one near-term project on Maui representing extended operation of an existing project at a lower cost. There is a more ambitious plan to develop a 400- to 450-­megawatt offshore wind farm to supply about 25% of Oahu’s electricity need, though this project has a longer-term horizon and faces other challenges.

Glick expressed confidence that regulators, utilities and energy producers in Hawaii will, in the long term, devise ways to maintain economic feasibility for new utility-scale solar farms while rooftop solar systems continue to offer savings even without federal tax credits.

“Congress removing the tax credits doesn’t change the fact that in Hawaii, electricity produced by solar is cheaper than electricity produced by oil,” he said. “People and businesses in Hawaii are smarter than the short-sighted Congress because we understand that our economy will remain vulnerable to the devastating effects of oil price volatility as long as diesel and low sulfur oil are the majority fuel for generating electricity.”

Anthony J. Sadar is a Certified Consulting Meteorologist and a former air quality administrator for a large public health department.","Public health concerns are not ignored, as both sides of the political aisle have claimed that we can have both good-paying industrial jobs and a clean environment.

Last month, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, and Energy Secretary Chris Wright were at the North Slope of Alaska touting the release of the private-sector economy to harvest America’s abundant natural resources. Furthermore, the National Energy Dominance Council was formed to energize deregulation and boost business and industry.

Under the leadership of Mr. Zeldin, the EPA has renewed efforts on conservation, energy resilience, and increased manufacturing. The theme of EPA’s “Powering the Great American Comeback” is an initiative focused on working “to protect public health and the environment while restoring the greatness of the American economy.”

The Comeback plan has five major pillars: “Clean Air, Land, and Water for Every American,” “Restore American Energy Dominance,” “Permitting Reform, Cooperative Federalism, and Cross-Agency Partnership” (read: reduction in red tape), “Make the United States the Artificial Intelligence Capital of the World,” and “Protecting and Bringing Back American Auto Jobs.”

These ecologically protective and economically beneficial aspects work together to help ensure rigorous air, water, and waste evaluations of industrial projects while making the securing of environmental permits more consistent, reliable, and timely.

Since 1970, when the Clean Air Act and the EPA were inaugurated, the nation’s air has been successfully cleaned. We have seen dramatic declines in concentrations of the so-called criteria pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, and lead. Hundreds of other contaminants deemed “hazardous air pollutants” have also been successfully tackled at the federal, state, and local levels.

Measurable improvements in the nation’s air quality have continued even with the expansion of business and industry and the growing population, as well as its energy requirements and attendant motor vehicle use.

Americans have supported reasonable measures to clean up and enhance environmental quality, and this support extends to the industrial community as well.

During my decades of regulatory and consulting work with heavy and light industries, I found that operations from expansive steel plants to confined chemical companies were concerned about maintaining environmental standards while running a profitable business. Focused pollution prevention and energy efficiency practices were typical.

FARMING LOBBYISTS FIGHT TO KEEP PESTICIDES IN FOOD AMID MAHA PUSH

One of the most important issues regarding government oversight of business activities was understanding and properly complying with government regulations. The tightening of air quality standards enforced continuous reductions in air pollution emissions, which industry frequently met with engineering ingenuity, including sophisticated control equipment. Construction and operating permit conditions were a particular challenge; however, as long as permit requirements were clear and doable, industries found ways to comply that benefited the public and the environment.

Overall, the new administration’s concentrated backing of manufacturing bodes well for the energy sector and capacious industries, including American auto jobs and the burgeoning AI sector. Generally, a broad swath of business and industry is well-positioned to prosper under the refocused EPA. And, as America makes a rebound in energy and production, we must also ensure that the U.S. will continue to be a leader in maintaining high environmental standards.

In some ways, it looked like a normal convention. The makers of everything from carbon brushes to boat propellers milled around a large hall, looking at a flying boat, a customizable electric truck, an air taxi and a humanoid robot. But at times, it turned into an urgent and literal call to arms as discussions moved from manufacturing to national security.

“You will help us forge a future where we can build and sustain an industrial base that can deliver the critical weapons we need, fast and at scale,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told the participants in a video message. “Time is short.”

About 1,200 people attended the conference, about twice the number who attended the first gathering last year, said Falon Donohue, an Atomic board member who is also a founder of the conference. Thousands were on the waiting list, she said. More than 16,000 watched the speeches, round tables and fireside chats online.

Titans of industry have been pledging to reindustrialize the United States for decades, but the idea is particularly potent at this moment, when more Americans recognize the nation’s dependence on other countries for everything from electronics to batteries to medicines.

The goal of reviving American manufacturing has been a rare point of agreement between President Trump and former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., although they differed strongly on the strategy to bring it about. Mr. Biden successfully pushed for laws that gave subsidies and tax credits to companies that were building factories to make semiconductors, batteries and electric vehicles in the United States, whereas Mr. Trump has threatened to impose large tariffs on foreign nations to boost domestic production.

The conference attracted a large cohort of like-minded tech enthusiasts who spoke of boosting American manufacturing as a solemn patriotic duty, even if they had British or Australian accents. It also managed to make factories glamorous to a jet-setting crowd that to many might seem more at home in Davos than in Detroit.

“It has become high status to invest in manufacturing,” Christian Garrett, a partner on the investment team at 137 Ventures, noted at a fried-chicken-filled after-party downtown. Mr. Garrett said the factories that deals coming out of the conference would build would also create high-tech, “high status” jobs for blue-collar workers.

Speaker after speaker emphasized that military power flows from industrial power, which they said had been eroded by the offshoring of factories and an overemphasis on software, apps and financial products.

Nearly every session waxed nostalgic for World War II, when Detroit’s car plants were quickly converted into munitions factories that helped achieve victory. But today, Americans have fallen behind China in the mass-production of things that would matter in a war, senior administration officials warned.

“In a world where Russia has raw materials, and China dominates manufacturing, an economy centered around McKinsey and DoorDash will not cut it,” Mike Needham, counselor and chief of staff to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, told the crowd from the main stage. “We turn to China, the rival that too often no one wants to name, even as they surpass us in industry after industry: shipbuilding, steel, electric vehicles, critical metals.”

Mr. Needham urged his audience of venture capitalists, angel investors and inventors to rekindle “that swashbuckling American spirit that does what must be done and will not take no for an answer” in the race to secure the resources to rebuild the country’s industrial base.

Other Trump administration officials who attended included Kelly Loeffler, administrator of the Small Business Administration; Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative; John Phelan, the Navy secretary; and unnamed representatives of the Central Intelligence Agency, who held a private round table with industry people.

In his speech, Mr. Phelan spoke bluntly about the dire state of affairs and proposed combining commercial and military shipbuilding abilities to address the shortfall of shipbuilders.

Conference participants from Silicon Valley included Shyam Sankar, the chief technology officer of Palantir, the data analysis and technology firm, who said the United States was “actually the underdog” when competing with China.

Palmer Luckey, the founder of Anduril, a defense contractor, spoke to the crowd remotely through a stiff, humanoid robot dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and mullet wig.

The idea for a Reindustrialize conference sprang from a factory tour of Atomic in March 2024, said Ms. Donohue, the board member. In addition to the tour, Atomic held a discussion with policymakers and investors about how to revitalize manufacturing with tech and new government policies. Ms. Donohue is also a partner at Narya, an investment firm that Vice President JD Vance co-founded in 2019.

Another founder of the conference, Gregory Bernstein, who was a board observer at Atomic in 2024, said some embraced the idea of reindustrialization because of national security, while others saw it as a way to address economic inequality or the climate crisis.

Mr. Bernstein, the chief executive of the New Industrial Corporation, an investment company, said he found the idea of an economy based on building things more compelling than one based on intangible products.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/20/multimedia/20biz-reindustrialize-01-mhfz/20biz-reindustrialize-01-mhfz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-07-20 07:00:51.594349

The author argues Zeldin's actions contradict his role of protecting natural resources and endangered species.

The letter urges Zeldin to resign and advocates for clean, sustainable energy.

I was absolutely horrified to read of administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Lee Zeldin’s plan to pollute and destroy the very wilderness he was hired to protect (“I saw a golden future for American manufacturing during Komatsu tour,” July 13).

Because of his detrimental actions against the environment, he is not doing his job. His job is to protect our environment and natural resources — clean air and water — not poison them with toxic chemicals. His job is to strengthen and enforce protection for endangered species, not weaken or dismantle laws, thus threatening hundreds of species with extinction.

His job is to enforce strict laws and regulations that protect vital marine ecosystems, preserve our national parks and public lands and conserve the Arctic wildlife refuge, not develop, drill or mine these wilderness areas. He was hired to protect our environment, not destroy it!

Zeldin is correct on one issue, the US has a growing demand for more energy — but his job is to promote and support clean, sustainable energy, not toxic fossil fuels. He actually used the words “clean coal” when nothing could be further from the truth. Coal creates toxic poisons that are emitted into our air and water, causing irreparable harm to the environment and cardio-respiratory illness in us.

Zeldin needs to step down from his position before he decimates the very environment he was hired to protect. We will all suffer the consequences of this administration’s war on the natural world.

So while green jobs still make up a modest share of the total, their growth is anything but small.
The energy efficiency industry followed, with just over 145,000 full-time positions, while renewables contributed more than 71,000 full-time positions.
But green jobs aren’t just about the industry you work in; they’re also about the role you perform.
With the proper policy support, green industries are poised for even faster growth.","Businesses in sectors such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, and recycling are steadily transforming the UK’s workforce. According to new data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), these industries employed 690,900 full-time equivalent workers in 2023. That’s a 34.6% increase compared to 2015 when the total stood at just over half a million.

To put that into perspective, the UK had 12.5 million full-time equivalent roles across all sectors last year. So while green jobs still make up a modest share of the total, their growth is anything but small.

The ONS classifies the green economy under three main pillars: waste, energy-efficient products, and renewable energy. In 2023, the waste sector led the way, supporting over 158,000 roles. The energy efficiency industry followed, with just over 145,000 full-time positions, while renewables contributed more than 71,000 full-time positions. Each of these categories has seen consistent job growth year after year.

Beyond the core sectors, the ONS also tracks employment in related low-carbon areas, such as transport, equipment repair, and environmental charities. Notably, almost half of the UK’s workforce, around 46%, was employed by companies in the ten industries with the lowest greenhouse gas emissions.

On the other end of the spectrum, only a fraction of UK workers are in the highest-emission industries. Electricity and gas companies make up less than half a per cent of the total workforce. Roles in mining, quarrying, agriculture, forestry, and fishing combined for just 0.9% of jobs in 2023.

Transport and manufacturing, however, stand out as both carbon-intensive and job-heavy. The ONS highlighted that regions like the East Midlands, West Midlands, and Yorkshire and the Humber have particularly high concentrations of staff in these high-emission sectors. The need for a fair and inclusive transition in these areas is evident.

But green jobs aren’t just about the industry you work in; they’re also about the role you perform. The ONS takes this into account, tracking green occupations across all sectors. For example, an energy manager at a logistics firm or a sustainability expert at a bank would still count as part of the green economy. This broader definition also includes professionals working in green finance, climate adaptation, and nature restoration.

These roles are clustered in London and the South East. That’s no coincidence. Analysis by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has shown that green economy jobs tend to be both productive and well-paid.

As of December 2024, the surveyed businesses employed approximately 951,000 people, a 10.2% increase from the previous year.

Reform UK’s deputy leader, Richard Tice, has urged energy firms to steer clear of the government’s latest round of green energy contracts, known as Allocation Round 7 (AR7). In a move that’s sparked sharp backlash, Tice’s message to investors was clear: walk away from net zero.

Mr Tice said he had put the companies on “formal notice” that their investments were “politically and commercially unsafe” as a future Reform government would seek to “strike down all contracts signed under AR7”.

Michael Shanks said Reform’s opposition to net zero amounted to a “war on jobs”, saying working people “would lose jobs and opportunities if Farage’s party was ever allowed to impose its anti-jobs, anti-growth ideology on the country”.

Mr Shanks called the letter an “energy surrender plan that would leave bills high for families and businesses, keeping the UK stuck on the rollercoaster of fossil fuel markets”.

But that call to retreat hasn’t gone unanswered. Labour has launched a scathing counterattack, warning that Reform’s hardline stance could jeopardise nearly one million jobs tied to the UK’s growing green economy. According to estimates from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), the net-zero sector currently supports around 951,000 jobs nationwide. That includes roughly 138,000 roles in the East Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber, both key battlegrounds where Reform has recently seen gains, including in the Greater Lincolnshire mayoral contest and Tice’s constituency of Boston and Skegness.

Mr Tice said: “Labour’s reckless net zero fantasies are destroying hundreds of thousands of industrial jobs, costing taxpayers £12 billion a year in renewable subsidies, and leaving us with some of the highest energy bills in the world.

“The OBR (Office for Budget Responsibility) confirms that £30 billion of taxpayer money is being poured into net-zero projects. These policies are crippling our economy and driving people out of this country.”

Labour’s energy minister, Alan Shanks, didn’t mince words. “This reckless approach is a direct threat to British jobs, British industry, and Britain’s climate commitments,” he said, describing Reform’s strategy as a political stunt with severe economic consequences.

Adding to the urgency, a recent report from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimated the annual cost of addressing climate change at £30 billion, primarily due to the loss of revenue from taxes such as fuel duty. But the watchdog made it clear: the price of inaction would be even steeper. Climate damage, rising disaster recovery costs, and long-term economic disruption would pose a far greater fiscal burden in the future.

However, it also warned that failing to act would present a “more significant fiscal cost” due to the damage caused by climate change.

Reform UK, meanwhile, has doubled down on its anti-net-zero rhetoric. Earlier this year, Tice declared he would ""wage war"" on the policy altogether. His ally, Greater Lincolnshire mayor Dame Andrea Jenkyns, went even further, telling Times Radio she doesn’t believe climate change is real. That kind of climate denial, Labour believes, could become Reform’s Achilles’ heel.

Polling suggests that despite heated political rhetoric, net zero still commands broad public support. A survey commissioned by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit ahead of the May local elections found that 54% of Reform voters themselves supported “policies to stop climate change.”

With Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer increasingly positioning Reform as Labour’s actual opponent, particularly in key working-class regions, the net-zero debate is no longer just about energy. It’s about jobs, trust, and the kind of future Britain is willing to fight for.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/becc64_007de3718c1648d79fdc004c0cc3960d~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_578,h_1000,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/becc64_007de3718c1648d79fdc004c0cc3960d~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-07-20 07:00:28.373515

Delivery of the project, which would be the largest power station in the world if completed, was accelerated after officials convened in Zimbabwe on July 3.

Newsweek contacted the organization responsible for the delivery, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), for more information on the progress via email.

Why It Matters

The Grand Inga Hydropower Project, with a potential capacity of up to 70 gigawatts, is designed as the centerpiece of Africa's Mission 300 initiative, which seeks to connect 300 million Africans to clean energy by 2030. The average household in the U.S. uses just under 11,000 kilowatt-hours a year, meaning that if Grand Inga reaches its projected scale, it could generate enough electricity to power nearly half of all homes in the U.S., though it will be used solely for homes in Africa.

What To Know

The Grand Inga Dam in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) would be a series of seven hydroelectric power stations at Inga Falls in the Congo River.

SADC ministers responsible for energy and water agreed to push forward with the Grand Inga Hydropower Plan and the Congo River Water Transfer Concept at a meeting in Harare, Zimbabwe, on July 3.

On June 3, the World Bank Board of Executive Directors approved a $250 million creditas the first phase of a previously announced $1 billion long-term commitment to support preparation and local development efforts for Inga 3, DRC's largest power project to date.

Constructed in the 1970s and 1980s, the Inga I and II provided a foundation, yet both function at about 80 percent capacity. Grand Inga, which would be the third structure at the site, has attracted multiple rounds of international interest, but progress has repeatedly stalled because of high costs, governance concerns and the withdrawal of major partners, such as China's state-owned Three Gorges Corporation.

The projected $80 billion cost of completing the Grand Inga plan remains a huge barrier for the DRC, which is one of the world's poorest countries.

South Africa, Nigeria, Guinea and Angola have expressed formal interest in purchasing power from Grand Inga, tying the project to transnational energy security.

The Grand Inga initiative is part of the Mission 300 program, which aims to supply electricity to 300 million Africans by 2030. World Bank President Ajay Banga called the wider project ""a crucial component"" for economic growth and development across the continent and predicted that it could draw as much as $85 billion in private investment.

What People Are Saying

Bob Mabiala, head of the ADPI-DRC, told the World Bank on June 3: ""The electricity generation potential at the Inga site is one of the largest in the world. The development of Inga 3's hydropower will be transformative for DRC. By increasing access to clean, renewable, and affordable energy for Congolese households and industries, it will serve as a motor for inclusive growth and jobs.""

Albert Zeufack, World Bank division director, in a press release on June 3: ""By supporting DRC's vision for Inga through this program and complementary investments in governance, education, and infrastructure, the World Bank Group, together with partners, can significantly contribute to converting DRC's natural resources into economic growth, jobs, and human development for the Congolese people.""

The Future of Earth’s Rotational Energy For now, the concept of harnessing Earth’s rotation for electricity remains a tantalizing possibility rather than a practical solution.
Could the energy of Earth’s rotation become a cornerstone of future sustainable energy strategies?","In a groundbreaking development, American researchers have detected a minuscule electrical voltage by harnessing Earth’s magnetic field in its rotational movement. This surprising discovery, although modest in its current form, has reignited a scientific debate that has been ongoing for nearly two centuries. The idea of generating electricity using Earth’s rotation is not new. However, a team led by Christopher Chyba from Princeton University has published astonishing results in Physical Review Research. Their precisely designed experimental setup produced a continuous current of a few microvolts, opening up fascinating new possibilities.

Theoretical Principles Under Scrutiny

Back in the 19th century, Michael Faraday pondered whether Earth’s magnetic field could be used to produce energy. His experiments, grounded in the principle of electromagnetic induction, did not yield any significant results due to the uniform properties of Earth’s magnetic field. In such an environment, the electric forces induced by a conductor’s movement tend to cancel each other out, preventing the generation of continuous current. This theoretical limitation was long seen as an insurmountable barrier.

In 2016, Christopher Chyba and his team reinforced this conclusion by publishing a mathematical proof demonstrating the impossibility of the process. However, upon reexamining their assumptions, they identified an exception: using a specific magnetic material shaped into a hollow cylinder could locally disrupt the magnetic field’s configuration. This peculiarity could prevent the cancellation of electrical charges, allowing a measurable voltage to persist.

Their experiment utilized a tube made from manganese-zinc ferrite, a material chosen for its ability to facilitate magnetic diffusion. Positioned at a precise angle relative to Earth’s magnetic field, the device was placed in a darkened room to eliminate any photovoltaic interference. After ruling out other voltage sources, such as thermoelectric effects, the researchers recorded a signal of 17 microvolts, which they attribute to Earth’s rotation. Although this value is extremely low, it aligns with the theoretical predictions of their revised model.

Results Awaiting Confirmation

While the experiment conducted by Christopher Chyba’s team seems promising from a theoretical standpoint, its practical implications remain largely unproven. The measured voltage of 17 microvolts, although in line with predictions, represents an infinitesimal amount of energy—equivalent to less than one-thousandth of the voltage produced by a button cell battery. This makes it particularly challenging to distinguish between a genuine physical effect and potential experimental artifacts, like stray currents or residual thermal variations.

Several scientists have already expressed doubts about the interpretation of these results. Rinke Wijngaarden, a physicist at the Free University of Amsterdam, notes that his own attempts to replicate the phenomenon in 2018 yielded no conclusive results. To resolve these uncertainties, researchers will need to conduct numerous experimental verifications, including varying test conditions such as latitude, altitude, and time of day, and enhancing the sensitivity of measuring instruments. The scientific community emphasizes the need for independent reproduction by other laboratories, the only guarantee of reliability for such a controversial discovery.

Practical Challenges and Implications

Even assuming the underlying physical principle is valid, its practical application would be far from straightforward. Researchers estimate that the efficiency of the device would need to be drastically increased to produce usable power. However, current equations do not guarantee that this is possible with existing materials. Furthermore, large-scale exploitation raises ethical and environmental concerns: the energy produced would come directly from Earth’s rotation. If we aimed to generate enough electricity to meet global demands, this method could potentially slow Earth’s rotation by approximately 7 milliseconds per century, according to initial calculations.

Given the current state of knowledge, this research direction remains largely theoretical. As Christopher Chyba cautiously acknowledges, “our equations show how such an evolution could be realized, but that is very different from demonstrating its feasibility.” The coming years will determine whether this innovative approach can move beyond scientific curiosity to become a viable alternative energy source, or if it will join the catalog of physically possible but technologically unexploitable ideas.

The Future of Earth’s Rotational Energy

For now, the concept of harnessing Earth’s rotation for electricity remains a tantalizing possibility rather than a practical solution. The potential for a new green energy source is intriguing, but significant hurdles must be overcome to turn theory into reality. Enhanced experimental setups, confirmed independent findings, and groundbreaking material developments are crucial steps in this journey.

As we stand on the brink of a potential energy revolution, questions linger: Can we find a way to make this theoretical energy source practical? Could the energy of Earth’s rotation become a cornerstone of future sustainable energy strategies? The answers may redefine the boundaries of human ingenuity and scientific exploration.

Solar power, coupled with battery storage, offers a solution by providing continuous power during outages, as demonstrated by Babcock Ranch during Hurricane Ian.

Expanding solar energy in Florida through policies like net metering, statewide PACE financing, and mandatory solar on new homes can enhance energy security and create jobs.

We are blessed to live in the Sunshine State, but extreme weather events can leave us without power for days, costing our economy billions and tragically claiming the lives of those dependent on electricity for medical equipment. For elderly residents on oxygen, families with special needs children, or anyone needing refrigerated medications, outages can be fatal.

That's why I'm concerned about losing the 30% federal solar tax credit expiring Dec. 31, 2025, coupled with Florida eliminating renewable energy targets from state law. Solar plus storage is more than sustainability, it's about durability, our economy, and Floridians' safety.

Recent hurricanes prove that centralized power systems can fail when needed most. While hundreds of thousands lost power during Hurricane Ian—with outages alone costing Florida's economy an estimated $5 billion—those with solar panels and battery storage kept lights on, refrigerators running, and medical devices functioning.

The most compelling example is Babcock Ranch, Florida's first solar-powered town. When Ian's 150-mph winds devastated Fort Myers 12 miles away, Babcock's 5,000 residents never lost power. Their 700,000-panel solar array and underground power lines proved that renewable energy hardens infrastructure when centralized systems fail.

This durability creates economic benefits. Florida's solar industry employs approximately 14,000 workers with strong recent growth. Every installation creates local jobs. When power stays on during storms, businesses avoid losses, hospitals maintain operations, and families avoid hotel costs. The economic case for solar durability equals the environmental one.

Smart reliability strategies recognize that distributed energy systems strengthen the entire grid. When homes generate and store power, they reduce strain on infrastructure during peak demand. Solar plus storage homes are lifeboats, keeping families safe while making everyone more secure.

The good news: Florida's Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing program allows property owners to finance solar panels, battery backup, and hurricane-resistant improvements with no upfront costs, repaid via property taxes. Funded by private capital, not taxpayer dollars, PACE enables complete durability solutions providing automatic power during outages.

However, PACE operates locally, requiring county-by-county approval, creating uneven availability. Critics worry about costs, but PACE spreads expenses over time while community solar ensures equitable benefits.

Utilities face legitimate challenges adapting to distributed generation. These challenges could be eased by partnering with solar producers through time-of-use rates or virtual power plants, ensuring stability while rewarding homeowners. This is a win-win because National Renewable Energy Laboratory studies show that distributed solar reduces infrastructure costs by decreasing peak demand.

This represents a fundamental choice: Do we want energy security and extreme weather durability, or continued dependence on centralized systems that may fail when families need power most?

Florida lawmakers should:

• Champion solar as essential infrastructure. Protect net metering—which credits solar owners for excess power—streamline permitting and ensure statewide PACE availability.

• Follow California's lead mandating solar on new homes. When builders integrate solar from the beginning, costs drop dramatically, and every house becomes a resilience hub.

With the federal tax credit expiring on Dec. 31, 2025, and disjointed PACE financing availability for solar and battery storage. We need political will to make programs universally accessible.

Florida’s energy security requires leadership embracing our natural advantages. As the Sunshine State, we were born to lead in solar. With proper planning and fair policies balancing utility needs with consumer benefits, we can harvest sunshine to power prosperity and build a stronger, safer future for all Floridians.

With lights coming on and air conditioners still running at full bore from the sweltering heat, solar power completely disappeared in the evening.","The recent heatwave that blanketed the Midwest and much of the East Coast pushed America’s electricity supply to its limit. Grid operators declared max generation events, calling on every available power plant to crank out supply. It was all hands on deck. Now, after a near-collapse of America’s power grid, it should provide a critical teaching moment.

During the peak electricity demand of brutal summer heat or bitter winter cold, we’re able to cut through the political noise and clearly understand what keeps America’s lights on, the gears of industry churning, and our homes comfortable.

The data is clear. For reliable power when we need it most, the nation’s coal and natural gas power plants remain our workhorses. They rise to the occasion, going above and beyond to meet soaring demand. Unfortunately, that cannot be said for the billions of dollars in renewable energy investments.

Consider what happened to the Midcontinent Independent System Operator grid that covers parts of 15 states stretching up from Louisiana through Minnesota. This vast stretch of America includes some of the very best wind-generating real estate in the country. On June 24, just as power demand neared its peak, wind generation was all but a no-show. Of MISO’s 30 gigawatts of nameplate wind capacity — the amount of power that wind generation can provide during ideal conditions — wind provided just 2.8 GW. And of the 111 GW of demand on the MISO grid, wind power met just 2.5 percent of it.

While helpful, solar power also showed its limitations. In the New England grid on the same day, when power demand was peaking at 6 p.m., solar output was less than half of what it had been at midday. With lights coming on and air conditioners still running at full bore from the sweltering heat, solar power completely disappeared in the evening.

During a TV appearance, Energy Secretary Doug Burgum pointed out that, at 6 a.m., the nation’s largest electricity grid, PJM Interconnection serving 67 million customers, was getting only 2 percent of its power from wind and solar.

This inability of wind and solar power to match peak power demand — or the possibility of them disappearing when needed most — is a crippling limitation. How can the United States build a reliable power system around resources that, by their very nature, are as unreliable as the weather? The short answer is, we can’t.

Consider that Germany has already invested an extraordinary amount of money attempting a rapid transition to renewable energy. And now, they’ve coined a new word, dunkelflaute, which means “dark doldrums.” It aptly describes the windless and cloudy moments that can bring a renewable energy system to its knees.

Last fall, northwestern Europe experienced multiple episodes of the dark doldrums. The first, in early November, lasted 12 days. On the third day, German wind power output plunged to less than 0.2 GW, compared to an installed capacity of 70 GW. Coal and natural gas were used to hold off rolling blackouts.

We should be paying close attention. Whether in the United States or abroad, the limitations of weather-dependent solar and wind power have come into alarming focus. While these sources of power can be fuel savers, they are not grid reliability providers.

With power demand now surging from electric vehicles and data centers — and with our grid operators and reliability regulators warning of mounting reliability concerns — we must not overlook the irreplaceable importance of coal and natural gas power plants. As the recent heatwave underscored, without a balanced electricity mix, we could be left sweltering in the dark.

In last week’s column about that huge tax and spending package, I detailed the “no tax on tips” and “no tax on overtime” provisions (which reduce but do not eliminate taxes on tips or overtime), a new deduction for those 65 and older and the expiration of tax credits for electric vehicles coming Sept. 30.

This week, let’s take a look at the “no tax on car loan interest” provision. You may have already guessed that it does not, in fact, eliminate the tax.

Of course, car loan interest wasn’t taxed to begin with. The issue has been whether people should have to pay tax on income that’s spent on the interest, or if that should be potentially deductible, like mortgage loan interest.

The new law allows for car loan interest to be deducted on some purchases, but there are some big and important caveats. Here are the main points:

Up to $10,000 in loan interest can be deducted by taxpayers with modified adjusted gross incomes of $100,000 or less, or twice that for joint filers. The deduction is reduced and eventually eliminated for higher incomes.

Only loans originated in 2025 or later count, and the tax break only exists through 2028.

Only new vehicle purchases count. None of this applies to used vehicles. The original, personal use of the vehicle must start with the taxpayer claiming the deduction.

Vehicles must have undergone final assembly in the United States.

Cars, SUVs, pickup trucks, other passenger autos and motorcycles are eligible so long at they have a gross weight below 14,000 pounds.

Qualifying loans must be secured by a lien on the vehicle, as they typically are, and if a qualifying loan is refinanced then interest on the refinanced amount “is generally eligible for the deduction,” according to the Internal Revenue Service.

For buyers who happened to purchase a U.S.-assembled vehicle earlier this year, and financed the purchase with a loan, this all adds up to an unexpected bonus.

Future vehicle buyers will need to decide if what they want, and can afford, meets the eligibility requirements for the deduction. The U.S.-assembly rule is crucial, and will be documented by vehicle identification numbers provided to the IRS, but remember that some Fords are built in Mexico, some Hondas are made in Ohio, and so on.

A tax deduction isn’t a tax credit, which reduces tax bills dollar for dollar, but a reduction in the amount of income that’s taxable.

So what’s it worth? Let’s say a person bought a qualifying vehicle on Jan. 1 this year and borrowed $30,000 to pay for it, at 6.75 percent interest.

Following through could be the hard part for companies that pledged more than $90 billion in investments across the state Tuesday during the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit at Carnegie Mellon University, organized by U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick, R-Pittsburgh.

At least a quarter of that money is expected to flow into Southwestern Pennsylvania.

From up to $100 million in upgrades at a Charleroi plant that makes power-grid equipment to a $15 billion pledge to buy Pennsylvania natural gas to fire a new power plant in Homer City, turning these lofty plans into reality will take careful coordination of labor, energy and funding needs.

“It’s one thing to announce your intention to do something,” said Jeff Nobers, executive director of the business and labor alliance Pittsburgh Works Together. “It’s another thing to get it funded and then actually move forward with everything you have to do to execute it.”

Pittsburgh Works Together and similar groups are generally bullish on the state’s ability to meet these challenges, as long as permitting doesn’t become too arduous.

They say the payoff could be huge, with Pennsylvania’s vast energy reserves shaping it into a hub for artificial intelligence companies and their power-hungry models.

“Energy is what’s needed to power everything,” said Audrey Russo, president and CEO of the Pittsburgh Technology Council. “When we have that and people know that there’s access … that’s attractive to build businesses.”

Getting the green lights

Business interests are acutely aware that most aspects of these projects can’t go forward without the green light from regulators.

“I think the biggest thing in the bottlenecks right now would be certainly our permitting,” Russo said. “Can we be nimble enough?”

The state Department of Environmental Protection reviews all projects that disturb a significant amount of earth or might pose risks to air or water quality. Anything from a large home to a sprawling power plant falls under at least one of these categories.

Gov. Josh Shapiro has gotten kudos from the business community for his efforts to fast-track environmental approvals, even as the overall view on the state’s permitting process remains mixed.

DEP officials say their permit backlog is down 98% since November 2023.

“Nobody is going to turn around a permit on a power plant or data campus in 30 days,” Nobers said. “But it shouldn’t take three years, either.”

Powering up

The data centers that make artificial intelligence models work eat up tons of electricity by running and cooling servers. These facilities consumed about 4% of U.S. power in 2023, and are projected to reach up to 12% by 2028.

Industry boosters claim natural gas is well-suited to meet rising demand.

Pennsylvania is already the second-largest natural gas producing state, and Jim Welty, president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition, said that supply isn’t running out any time soon.

Fracking to extract natural gas only started in the Marcellus Shale Formation in the mid-2000s. The formation, which covers a majority of Pennsylvania, is one of the largest shale deposits in the world.

More wells can and may need to be drilled.

But the “permitting process,” Welty said, “I think that’s what’s key.”

A tax credit program backed by the governor and under consideration in the state Senate would further incentivize drilling by offering breaks to producers of hydrogen and certain fertilizers, which are both made using natural gas.

EQT and CNX, the two major natural gas players in Southwestern Pennsylvania, did not return requests for comment.

EQT acquired local competitor Olympus Energy earlier this month for $1.8 billion, suggesting the firm sees strong times ahead for the industry.

‘We’re ready to go’

Incoming energy and tech investments promise to bring tens of thousands of jobs to the state, many of them in the skilled trades.

Building the Homer City plant, in the works prior to the summit, is expected to create 10,000 construction jobs alone.

Darrin Kelly, president of the Allegheny-Fayette Central Labor Council, expects the projects announced at the summit to keep the roughly 30,000 tradespeople he oversees busy for the next 15 to 20 years. He’s confident in the skill and supply of electricians, welders, heating and cooling specialists, and others.

In fact, he anticipates Southwestern Pennsylvania workers will get pulled onto projects across the state.

“We have the most seasoned energy workforce in the country,” Kelly said. “We’re ready to go for anything that comes our way, and everybody is actively recruiting.”

It wasn’t too long ago that Boilermakers Local 154 was turning away the few recruits that walked through its door. It historically sourced much of its work from a dwindling number of coal-fired power plants, but over the past decade saw its ranks plummet from more than 1,500 members to around 700.

“How was I going to take new apprentices?” said Shawn Steffee, business agent for the local. “I can’t put them to work.”

New work has emerged in recent years, a trend that will be turbocharged once the projects announced Tuesday get underway.

The union is in the process of taking on 100 new apprentices.

“It’s just going to be the timing on a lot of these projects,” Steffee said. “If everyone wants to do these major projects at one time, of course it’s going to be a problem on the manpower.”

Funding puzzle

Major energy and tech infrastructure projects rarely have full funding when they’re announced — especially one like Blackstone’s proposed $25 billion data center and energy infrastructure project in Northeast Pennsylvania.

Allegheny Conference on Community Development CEO Stefani Pashman said the further out a groundbreaking is scheduled, the more likely it is that significant financing gaps remain.

Few firm dates were offered at the summit. Westinghouse was one of the only companies to set a timeline, saying it will have 10 new, large nuclear power plant reactors under construction by 2030.

While all of the projects announced at last week’s summit were likely in the works before the event was publicly announced in June, companies may have closed deals more quickly than they would have otherwise to capitalize on summit’s fanfare, Pashman said.

To that point, the value of the deals set to be unveiled jumped about $20 billion in the hours preceding the summit.

“If something had occurred that day … I’d imagine the timing is going to take a little longer,” Pashman said.

Amid all the excitement surrounding the announcements, Sean O’Leary, a senior researcher at the Ohio River Valley Institute, offered a sobering reminder that capital can be hard to find.

He pointed to the struggling Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub concept, which would concentrate hydrogen production, storage and use in the Appalachian region, as an example of how hype can give way to fiscal reality.

Since the federal government announced funding for the hydrogen hub in 2023, more than a third of related projects have been canceled — in part due to undercapitalization.

“The two problems that have haunted many, many projects in these industries, and this is going to be especially true of data centers, is that many of them won’t be able to find capital to go forward,” O’Leary said. “And the other one is that many of them, if they do go forward, will struggle to find markets.”",https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2025/07/8691810_web1_ptr-summitpitfalls100-072025.jpg,N,,2025-07-20 05:57:49.380335

Epsilon Advanced Materials aims to partner with companies seeking graphite anode and cathode materials beyond China. This move addresses concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities in the EV sector. Epsilon is investing heavily in manufacturing plants across India, the USA and Finland. The company focuses on R&D and proprietary technology for lithium iron phosphate cathode production.

Battery materials manufacturer Epsilon Advanced Materials is prepared to enter into long-term strategic partnerships with the companies looking to source high-quality graphite anode and cathode materials outside China, a company official said.

EV batteries are made of components like anode, cathode, electrolyte and separator. As of now China commands over 90 per cent of this graphite anode and cathode processing capacity which is used in electric vehicles.

The recent curbs by China on the export of key battery-grade materials and technologies for both graphite anode and cathode (lithium iron phosphate-based) has intensified global concerns over supply chain vulnerabilities in the electric vehicle (EV) sector including in India.

This development comes as India ramps up efforts to build a resilient, localised battery supply chain in the wake of China's tightening export restrictions on critical battery technologies.

""Epsilon is ready to partner with cell manufacturers and Auto OEMs who are eyeing ex-China sourcing to secure long-term supply chain of high-quality anode materials and LFP (lithium iron phosphate) cathode while supporting their localization and sustainability objectives,"" company's Managing Director Vikram Handa said in an interview.

Live Events

China has a good early mover advantage and hence has been dominating the global battery materials supply chain for decades, but the recent export restrictions has shown how critical it is for battery manufacturers and auto OEMs to diversify their sourcing, outside of China, he explained.

""To begin with, our integrated and proprietary synthetic and natural graphite anode materials allow us to provide a secure and consistent supply chain to our customers across geographies. We have strategically invested in R&D facility and commercial plant to ensure customer qualification samples to our customers for sample testing and qualifying them,"" he said.

The company has its own proprietary technology for manufacturing lithium iron phosphate cathode with an R&D facility in Germany which makes them unaffected from the recent Chinese curbs.

Many companies who were dependent on the Chinese LFP cathode technology to manufacture in India are stuck as they will have to now invest in their own R&D which takes 5-6 years to mature.

""We have manufacturing plants in India, USA, and Finland with total capacity of 60,000 tonne by 2027 and 220,000 tonne by 2030 which make us the largest anode material producer outside China and will strengthen the resilience of our supply network.

""The cathode material plant of 100,000 tonne by 2030 in India will make us Atmanirbhar in electric vehicle battery material supply chain. This multi-continent presence gives our international clients more flexibility, localised supply options, and a reduced risk of disruption,"" he explained.

The company is investing Rs 15,350 crore in Karnataka to develop state-of-the-art manufacturing and research facility for electric vehicle battery materials, battery testing and advanced materials R&D.

Since Blum opened its apprenticeship program in 1995, more than one hundred companies across North Carolina have adopted similar ones.","VIENNA, AUSTRIA — On a recent trip to Vienna, while wandering the pristine cobblestone streets and weaving between horse-drawn carriages, this correspondent stumbled upon a refreshing observation: while much of Europe feels as though it’s decaying into a museum — a shell of its long-lost imperial glory — this city, even in the swelter of July and swarmed with tourists, felt strikingly alive. Young people were everywhere.

Crafting pralines at the century-old chocolaterie Altmann & Kühne. Serving schnitzels at the storied restaurant Zum Schwarzen Kameel. Managing the hotel concierge in the heat of high season. Leading tours through baroque landmarks like the Belvedere. Training as early as age 16 to perform atop white stallions at the famed Spanish Riding School.

It seemed everywhere I went, there was more energy, more youth — not just lounging at bars, but working, and working hard. Vienna may no longer be the cultural capital it was in the age of Klimt and Freud, before war fractured its Empire and crushed its appetite for decadence. But today, its vibrancy comes from its youth. A third of the city’s residents are under age 30, much like in New York City. Yet in Austria, the youth unemployment rate hovers below 6 percent — less than half the rate for American teenagers.

A key reason is Austria’s trade school system — a centuries-old partnership between education and industry that helps set its young people on a path to stable careers and fulfilling lives. It’s a model Americans would do well to study — and under the current administration, may finally be ready to.

After completing compulsory education at age 15, about 70 percent of Austrian students enter vocational education and training, rather than an academic high school (Gymnasium). They are trained directly for careers in technical fields such as mechanical engineering and IT support, skilled trades like carpentry and plumbing, and traditional crafts ranging from instrument building to hairdressing. Roughly 40 percent of students choose to pursue a dual-track apprenticeship, in which they spend one day a week in vocational school (Berufsschulen), and four days working — and getting paid — in a company.

“Not everybody finds education suitable at university,” the director of the Institute for Research on Qualifications and Training of the Austrian Economy, Thomas Mayr, tells the Sun. “Some people are inductive learners. They learn by doing.”

President Trump seems to agree. In May, he posted on Truth Social that he was considering taking three billion dollars worth of grants allocated to Harvard and giving it to trade schools. He signed an executive order in April directing officials “to identify alternative credentials and assessments to the 4-year college degree that can be mapped to the specific skill needs of prospective employers.” The goal, he said, is to “fully equip the American worker to produce world-class products and implement world-leading technologies.”

Indeed, as the costs of traditional college soar, many 18-year-olds in America are opting for trade schools. Vocational-focused community colleges are seeing a boom in enrollment. Yet the “college-for-all” mentality runs deep, and university degrees are still the default aspiration. The U.S. job market tends to reward credentials over practical experience, and anything other than a 4-year degree is often seen as second-tier or a fallback.

In Austria, however, apprenticeships are treated with greater prestige and professionalism. The European Qualifications Framework, developed by the European Union, promotes the idea of a “parity of esteem” among all educational pathways. This means that in countries with strong vocational systems like Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, Mr. Mayr says, “a master craftsman qualification is equal—not the same, but equal—to a bachelor’s degree.”

Take the word of the head pastry chef at Demel — one of Vienna’s famous coffee houses, renowned for its Sacher-Torte — Dietmar F. Muthenthaler. “I really made a career with my apprenticeship,” Chef Muthenthaler said in a video by Advantage Austria, the trade promotion organisation of the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber. “I was one of the youngest master pastry chefs in Austria, and was just over twenty when I completed my master craftsperson examination.”

The apprenticeship tradition traces back to Medieval Vienna, when learning a trade in crafts like carpentry, shoemaking, and baking was regulated by guilds (Zünfte). A master craftsman (Meister) trained young people through a formal apprenticeship, and a “masterpiece” (Meisterstück) allowed them entrance into the guild.

As the Industrial Revolution swept through Europe, most countries including the United Kingdom and France replaced apprenticeship training with school-based education. However, in the German-speaking countries of Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, apprenticeship training was integrated into the formal education structure and ultimately standardized through national law.

In Austria today, the system succeeds with the help of the tens of thousands of employers who work closely with trade schools to recruit students, not only to preserve traditional crafts, but to meet modern demands like sustainable design and green technology. Those employers depend on strong state support, including tax incentives and subsidies that help offset training costs.

This standardized system might be difficult to replicate in America, where education policy is largely set at the state and local level and funding for vocational training remains limited. American employers might balk at the idea of spending €25,000 to train a teenager, the average cost in Austria, especially since that investment only pays off if the apprentice stays on after completing the program.

Yet apprenticeship training isn’t seen as charity; it’s strategy. “Most companies don’t train apprentices for corporate social responsibility reasons,” Mr. Mayr says. “Companies do it as an investment.”

That’s the spirit of one company that is spearheading the Austrian apprenticeship model in the United States. Blum, Inc., the North American subsidiary of an Austrian-based manufacturer of furniture hardware, partners with a community college near its facility in North Carolina to train local high school students into technical roles. They get paid for their time, earn bonuses based on performance, and after graduation, they have a guaranteed job and four years of seniority within the company.

“When you train a young person from day one to do the correct thing, guess what you get later?” says the apprenticeship manager at Blum, Andreas Thurner. The answer is high quality, committed employees — who help bolster the workforce needed to sustain manufacturing. Since Blum opened its apprenticeship program in 1995, more than one hundred companies across North Carolina have adopted similar ones.

Back on those cobblestone streets of Vienna, the working youth are buzzing. In a city often defined by its past, they are the ones pointing its culture and economy toward the future. If the United States seeks to expand opportunity for a generation of young people burdened by student debt, it might be a good time to book a flight to Vienna for some inspiration.",https://wp.nysun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/vienna-scaled.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=fill&fm=jpg&fl=progressive,N,,2025-07-20 11:02:23.483398

Those with the greatest future potential for clean energy development will be hardest hit.","American households are bracing for a notable increase in their electricity bills over the next decade. A recent analysis from Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate think tank, projects that electricity prices will skyrocket as a direct result of energy policy changes introduced by President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful law.”

This legislation, signed on July 4, not only introduces new tax breaks and increases some deductions, but also ends certain green energy provisions. According to Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling and analysis at Energy Innovation, the law mandates the expansion of oil and gas leases, limits clean energy subsidies, and eliminates tax credits that had made wind, solar, and other clean energy sources cheaper for manufacturers and more affordable for consumers.

Why will costs go up? The main reason for this projected increase in electricity bills is the phasing out of clean energy tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of 2025. This move, according to Orvis, will raise electricity costs for the average citizen. Rising clean energy development costs will slow the pace of new supply, just at a time when energy demand in the United States is reaching record levels.

This situation will result in:

Higher electricity bills.

Greater dependence on natural gas, which will also become more expensive due to increased demand.

The Energy Innovation report compares projected energy costs for 2035 under two scenarios: one with the passage of President Donald Trump's law and one without it. The data considers spending changes for all types of fuel for homes and vehicles, although most of the cost increases are related to electricity and natural gas.

Researchers estimate that average household energy costs will increase by $170 per year by 2035. However, this estimate could be conservative, as a report from Princeton University's Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit estimates an average increase of $280 per year by 2035.

The impact of the law's provisions will vary among states. Those with the greatest future potential for clean energy development will be hardest hit. For example, in Oklahoma, where windy conditions make it ideal for wind turbines, the average household electricity bill could increase by $540 by 2035 without the tax benefit for new wind energy infrastructure.

According to research from Energy Innovation, as reported by CNBC, here's how much more households could pay annually, on average, by 2035 due to energy policy changes under the ""big, beautiful law"":",https://www.mibolsillo.co/__export/1733951029092/sites/debate/img/2023/06/27/bombillas-luz-foco.jpg_673822677.jpg,N,,2025-07-20 13:02:13.112232

Meanwhile, although Trump has a habit of citing fantasy sub-$2 gasoline prices, that inflation component just registered its 13th straight month of year-over-year declines.

Hyperscalers are also signing long-term contracts to underwrite new power plants and making preliminary moves to encourage new nuclear power development.","President Donald Trump, like many Americans, has something of an obsession with gasoline prices. He might be better off focusing on another cost with which Americans are regularly confronted: electricity bills.

The electricity component of the Consumer Price Index was up 5.8% in June, year over year. This was the third month in a row when electricity came in above the broad inflation rate and marked an acceleration in that trend, rising to more than double the CPI’s 2.7%. Meanwhile, although Trump has a habit of citing fantasy sub-$2 gasoline prices, that inflation component just registered its 13th straight month of year-over-year declines. Looking at energy costs as a share of disposable personal income, gasoline took 1.59% compared with 1.15% for electricity in May (the latest month of available data), the narrowest spread in more than four years. Rather than pump prices, plug prices look more ominous.

In part, this reflects an unusually warm June keeping air conditioners cranked up, plus higher fuel costs. Natural gas-fired generation tends to set the wholesale electricity price, and both gas futures and power plant fuel costs have bounced back from low levels a year ago.

But the big driver of the utility costs that feed into bills is spending on the grid, which tends to be stickier, too. This is all the more salient given Trump’s recent visit to Pennsylvania to tout multibillion-dollar investments in datacenters there. Winning the race for artificial intelligence is a core element of the administration’s focus on “energy dominance.” U.S. power demand is expected to rise quickly after lying flat for most of the past two decades, with datacenters playing a leading role.

Building the necessary generating capacity, and associated grid infrastructure, is expensive. Grids are quasi-socialist, spreading charges more or less evenly across customers with sometimes very different costs of service. Understandably, your average householder is wary of subsidizing the gigawatt-sized ambitions of the likes of Mark Zuckerberg. The AI hype phase we are in recalls the early 2000s internet bubble, with its highly inaccurate associated energy projections. (Guess who gets stuck with stranded costs for grid capacity that’s built and not used.) Andy DeVries, an analyst at CreditSights, notes that projections of power demand in 2030 have stopped growing since the DeepSeek shock in late January reminded everyone about the role of efficiency.

In response, a number of state regulators and utilities have proposed special tariffs for datacenter operators to ensure their deep pockets absorb the costs of hooking up large loads to the grid, including any stranded costs. Hyperscalers are also signing long-term contracts to underwrite new power plants and making preliminary moves to encourage new nuclear power development.

Yet these efforts won’t be sufficient to tamp down costs entirely. The datacenter shock is hitting a grid that was already under strain, in part because of the sort of extreme weather events that climate change will exacerbate, regardless of Republican ambivalence on the topic. Hugh Wynne, an analyst at Sector and Sovereign Research LLC, points out that the North American Electric Reliability Corporation assesses six out of the 13 U.S. regions it tracks as facing reliability risks linked to potential gas outages in severe winter weather. These include large grids like the main one in Texas, which failed for that reason in 2021, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator network covering much of the Midwest, and the huge PJM grid, which includes Pennsylvania.

The structural requirement for grid renewal burst into the open in PJM last summer, when a capacity auction – designed to incentivize power plants to remain open or get built – returned an 833% price increase. These charges, insurance against blackouts essentially, get spread across bills. The latest auction concluded the same day Trump was talking gigawatts in Pennsylvania, with results due next week.

Meanwhile, the anti-renewables bent of Republicans’ recently enacted budget will begin to seriously impact the fastest-growing source of new generation within a few years. (Remember when ‘all-of-the-above’ energy was supposedly a thing?) The beneficiaries will be existing coal plants avoiding retirement as well as new gas plants taking more market share. The losers will be ordinary consumers facing rising bills given existing strains in turbine supply chains (plus higher emissions) as well as the hyperscalers, who value renewables’ speed of deployment for meeting at least some of their energy needs. Skewing investment toward older technologies to power futuristic ones will exacerbate the existing challenge of balancing reliability, affordability and sustainability. While Trump talks up drill-baby-drill, trouble is brewing in the wires that snake through nearly every home in the land.

The Case for Disruption

Tesla's 2024–2025 initiatives demonstrate a clear commitment to innovation and long-term vision. The company has expanded its product lineup to target mass-market affordability, refined its battery technology to extend vehicle ranges, and aggressively built out its global Supercharger network. These efforts align with a broader mission to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. For example, the expansion of Gigafactories in Shanghai and Texas has reduced production costs and improved supply chain efficiency, enabling Tesla to scale production in key markets.

Moreover, Tesla's foray into autonomous driving and artificial intelligence (AI) represents a strategic pivot beyond traditional automotive manufacturing. Projects like robotaxis and humanoid robots (dubbed ""Optimus"") signal a long-term bet on AI-driven mobility and automation. While these ventures are capital-intensive, they position Tesla to diversify its revenue streams and compete in emerging tech sectors.

The Shadow of Desperation

However, the financial realities of 2025 tell a more complicated story. Tesla's net income plummeted by 52% in 2024, and its gross profit margin contracted to 17.86%, reflecting margin compression and pricing pressures. The expiration of U.S. EV tax credits in September 2025 further exacerbated this decline, as did intensifying competition from rivals like BYD and General Motors. In Europe, Tesla's market share dropped by 53%, while in China—a once-dominant growth market—it fell to 4.3% from 16% in 2022.

These challenges are compounded by operational delays, such as the prolonged wait for the lower-cost Model 2, which has allowed competitors to capture market share. Meanwhile, Elon Musk's growing political engagements and public controversies have raised concerns about corporate governance and brand alignment with its sustainability ethos. Analysts at HSBC and Wells Fargo have even issued ""Sell"" ratings, citing weak core automotive performance and investor uncertainty.

Balancing Risks and Rewards

The tension between Tesla's bold vision and its financial vulnerabilities raises critical questions for investors. On one hand, the company's investments in AI and autonomous driving could unlock new revenue streams and redefine mobility. On the other, its reliance on Musk's leadership and the risks of market saturation in the EV sector present significant headwinds.

For long-term investors, Tesla's strategic bets on AI and energy storage remain compelling. The company's expertise in software development and data-driven innovation could give it an edge in the autonomous vehicle race, a market projected to grow exponentially in the next decade. However, short-term investors may find the stock's volatility and declining margins more concerning.

Investment Advice: Proceed with Caution

Tesla's strategic dilemma underscores the importance of a balanced approach. While the company's long-term potential in AI and energy solutions is undeniable, its near-term challenges—declining profitability, market saturation, and governance risks—demand careful scrutiny. Investors should monitor key metrics such as production efficiency, the success of the Model 2 launch, and the performance of its AI ventures.

For those willing to take a contrarian stance, Tesla's stock appears undervalued relative to its historical highs, but patience will be key. Diversification across the EV and AI sectors, rather than overexposure to a single company, may offer a more resilient strategy. In the end, Tesla's ability to navigate this crossroads will determine whether it remains a disruptor—or becomes a cautionary tale.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-20 11:01:09.096933

Director Diana Furchtgott-Roth told The Center Square that solar and wind are more costly forms of energy due to the need for backups.
“Solar and wind are reliable when the sun shines and the wind blows, but this does not happen all the time,” Furchtgott-Roth said.
“Solar and wind energy take more land to produce a unit of energy than does natural gas, and so land cannot be used for other purposes,” Furchtgott-Roth said.
Furchtgott-Roth additionally mentioned to The Center Square that “components for wind turbines and solar panels are produced in China using coal-fired power plants and often forced labor.” Furchtgott-Roth was responding to the Department of the Interior announcing Thursday that preferential treatment for solar and wind energy will be ending.","The Trump administration is ending preferential treatment for “unreliable” solar and wind energy, and the director of the Center for Energy, Climate and Environment at The Heritage Foundation is welcoming the move.

Director Diana Furchtgott-Roth told The Center Square that solar and wind are more costly forms of energy due to the need for backups.

“Solar and wind are reliable when the sun shines and the wind blows, but this does not happen all the time,” Furchtgott-Roth said. This makes backups necessary, “which adds to the cost of providing electricity from these sources.”

These backups as well as the fact that “connecting solar and wind to the grid is costly,” means “states that require solar and wind in their energy mix have higher electricity prices,” Furchtgott-Roth said.

“Higher electricity costs add to inflation and discourage manufacturing,” Furchtgott-Roth said.

As an example of higher electricity prices, Furchtgott-Roth told The Center Square that in 2024, “the cost of electricity in California was 32 cents per kilowatt hour, but it was 11 cents an hour in Utah, which does not require renewables.”

Furchtgott-Roth also told The Center Square about the impact solar and wind energy have on the environment.

“Solar and wind energy take more land to produce a unit of energy than does natural gas, and so land cannot be used for other purposes,” Furchtgott-Roth said. “Wind turbines kill birds.”

These reasons are “why communities across the country are voicing concerns, objecting to large-scale wind and solar developments that disrupt local land use, strain water resources, and alter rural landscapes,” Furchtgott-Roth said.

Furchtgott-Roth additionally mentioned to The Center Square that “components for wind turbines and solar panels are produced in China using coal-fired power plants and often forced labor.”

Furchtgott-Roth was responding to the Department of the Interior announcing Thursday that preferential treatment for solar and wind energy will be ending.

“By removing these artificial advantages, the Department is levelling the playing field for dispatchable, cost-effective and secure energy sources, such as clean coal and domestic natural gas, after years of assault under the previous administration,” a news release from Interior said.

“These actions mark a return to common-sense permitting standards that support national security, grid stability and American job creation.”

The Department of the Interior’s actions are in line with Trump’s Energy Dominance agenda and follows the signing of the executive order “Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign-Controlled Energy Sources” as well as the passing of the “big beautiful bill,” the release said.

“As part of this effort, the Department will address provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to eliminate longstanding right-of-way and capacity fee discounts for existing and future wind and solar projects, bringing an end to years of subsidies for economically unviable energy development,” the release said.

Acting Assistant Secretary for Lands and Minerals Management Adam Suess said in the release that the department’s actions “further deliver on President Trump’s promise to tackle the Green New Scam and protect the American taxpayers’ dollars.”

“American Energy Dominance is driven by U.S.-based production of reliable baseload energy, not regulatory favoritism towards unreliable energy projects that are solely dependent on taxpayer subsidies and foreign-sourced equipment,” Suess said.

The department explained that “all Department-related decisions and actions concerning wind and solar energy facilities will undergo elevated review by the Office of the Secretary, including leases, rights-of-way, construction and operation plans, grants, consultations and biological opinions.”

“This enhanced oversight will ensure all evaluations are thorough and deliberative,” according to the release.

Those displeased with the Department of the Interior’s actions to end preferential treatment of wind and solar energy include the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), a group dedicated to “clean energy.”

When reached, ACORE referred The Center Square to a news release in which its president and CEO, Ray Long, said that “the only viable way to meet” the energy demand “reliably and affordably is by building all technologies, including wind and solar.”

“Moves like this inject new uncertainty throughout the entire energy sector, driving up costs for American homes and businesses, and leading to energy shortages, all within the next few years,” Long said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/c2/7c26ecc2-6c91-4247-8c23-25b2575a7ce1/67ec1af16f13d.image.jpg,N,,2025-07-20 11:01:48.314014

This controversial action, spearheaded by Governor Jeff Landry, comes amid long-standing discussions, evaluations, and studies that had established the project as a vital component in combating the state's severe coastal erosion and land loss crisis.

The project was designed to address the alarming loss of Gulf Coast land, which has seen more than 2,000 square miles vanish in the last century. It proposed the diversion of sediment-rich water from the Mississippi River to rehabilitate degraded wetlands and combat sea-level rise. Despite being pitched as a data-driven, large-scale ecological solution, the project has faced mounting opposition for the potential impact on Louisiana's cultural and economic fabric, including its vital seafood industry.

Governor Landry expressed significant concerns about the financial and ecological ramifications of the project, highlighting the doubled cost estimate, which had surged past $2 billion since 2016. He emphasized that the project jeopardized Louisiana's shrimp and oyster industries and did not present a viable long-term benefit proportional to its cost. In light of these financial and ecological assessments, the state government is now considering a shift towards a smaller-scale initiative that aims to balance environmental goals with community needs.

While proponents of the original project viewed it as essential for mitigating the catastrophic land loss Louisiana faces, critics pointed to the unsustainable financial burden and potential harms to fisheries. Gov. Landry has maintained that alternative coastal restoration strategies could provide more immediate and cost-effective solutions to protecting Louisiana's coastal communities.

The decision has generated notable backlash from environmental coalitions, such as Restore the Mississippi River Delta and the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana. They argue this cancellation abandons evidence-based environmental strategies that had undergone extensive vetting and public engagement. Coastal advocates stress that sediment diversion remains instrumental in the long-term strategy for land restoration on a scale necessary to tackle the continued and accelerated land loss.

With the state redirecting efforts toward the alternative Myrtle Grove project, questions remain about the path forward in addressing Louisiana's land loss crisis, the redistribution of over $1.5 billion in unspent settlement funds, and the accountability for the $618 million already allocated to the now-defunct project. The environmental and public policy communities continue to urge that future projects be firmly rooted in scientific data and involve transparent public discourse to enhance both ecological and community resilience.

As Louisiana navigates these complexities, the overarching challenge remains: to forge a path that addresses the imminent environmental threats with sustainable, scientifically sound solutions that also protect the cultural and economic lifeblood of its communities. The state's leadership, environmental agencies, and affected communities will need to collaborate closely to sustain the momentum needed to safeguard Louisiana’s unique coastal environment and heritage for future generations.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-20 03:57:57.656309

It fuels power plants, heats homes, drives industry, and—through liquefied natural gas (LNG)—connects continents. The newly released 2025 Statistical Review of World Energy highlights just how indispensable natural gas has become, despite mounting pressure to decarbonize.

Following the previous article on global oil production and consumption trends, let’s dig into the numbers behind the global gas market, with a focus on production, consumption, and the increasingly critical role of LNG exports.

U.S. Still Leads the Pack in Production

In 2024, global natural gas production reached a record-breaking 398.0 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d). The United States alone accounted for 25% of that, producing just under 100 Bcf/d. That marked a slight decline from the record output in 2023, but still more than five times Canada’s output, its closest North American peer. Much of this strength comes from the shale gas revolution that began about 20 years ago, turning the U.S. into both the world’s largest natural gas producer and ultimately the world’s top LNG exporter.

Russia, which the U.S. overtook for first place among gas producers in 2011, remains the world’s second-largest producer, with 60.8 Bcf/d of output in 2024. But that figure remains below its pre-sanction highs as exports to Europe dried up and pipeline projects faced delays. Moscow has attempted to pivot to Asian markets, but logistical and political hurdles have slowed progress.

Other top producers include:

Iran and Qatar, which remain vital players in the Middle East, producing around 25 and 17 Bcf/d, respectively.

China, whose domestic gas output has doubled over the past decade, now stands at 23 Bcf/d—an impressive feat as the country pushes to displace coal with cleaner-burning alternatives.

Australia, at 14 Bcf/d, has carved out a global leadership role in LNG, although future growth may be constrained by aging fields and regulatory pressure.

Africa’s contributions are modest in comparison. Algeria leads the continent with 9.1 Bcf/d, followed by Egypt and Nigeria. Infrastructure bottlenecks and underinvestment have limited the continent’s broader potential.

Notably, over the past decade, more than half of global natural gas production growth has come from OECD countries, albeit production in the EU has declined by two-thirds. This underscores that despite a global push toward renewables, countries continue to seek flexible energy supplies that balance affordability with lower carbon intensity.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/oilprice.com/2dd46bed35288b496e5486b5912501ee,N,,2025-07-20 01:59:30.816289

Conclusion: A Cornerstone for Future-Proof Portfolios In an era of macroeconomic uncertainty, private infrastructure stands out as a strategic allocation.","The global economic landscape in 2025 is defined by two persistent headwinds: stubbornly high inflation and the lingering effects of rising interest rates. Traditional assets like equities and fixed income have struggled to adapt, with the S&P 500 posting a -10% return in 2025 alone. In this environment, private infrastructure has emerged as a compelling alternative, offering investors a unique combination of inflation protection, stable income, and diversification benefits.

The Inflation-Resilient Nature of Private Infrastructure

Private infrastructure assets—spanning energy grids, transportation networks, and digital infrastructure—have historically outperformed during stagflationary periods. This resilience stems from their operational models. For example, toll roads like the Indiana Toll Road feature contractual rate adjustments tied to inflation indices, ensuring cash flows keep pace with rising costs. Similarly, regulated utilities and power generation facilities often operate under long-term agreements that allow for periodic price adjustments, aligning revenue with inflationary trends.

Data from the KKR 2024 study underscores this point: over 20 years, private infrastructure demonstrated a mere 0.58% correlation with global equities, outperforming traditional inflation hedges like gold and TIPS. In 2025, the StepStone Private Infrastructure Fund (STRUX) delivered a 6.75% return, while the iShares Global Infrastructure ETF (IGF) gained 4.92%—a stark contrast to the S&P 500's performance.

Diversification in a Volatile World

Private infrastructure's low correlation with traditional assets makes it a powerful diversifier. Unlike public equities, which are often tied to cyclical industries, infrastructure assets provide essential services with inelastic demand. Whether it's electricity, water, or transportation, these services remain critical regardless of economic conditions. This stability is reinforced by long-term contracts, which provide predictable cash flows even as other asset classes falter.

The energy transition and AI-driven demand for power further amplify infrastructure's diversification benefits. For instance, renewable energy projects and data centers are now integral to global economic activity. The rise of AI has already pushed North American data center capacity demand to 15–20% annual growth, creating a tailwind for infrastructure investors.

Income Generation in a High-Cost Environment

Rising interest rates have made income-focused assets more attractive, and private infrastructure excels in this arena. Many infrastructure assets generate cash flows through user fees, regulated rates, or long-term service agreements. These cash flows are often tax-efficient, with depreciation shields reducing taxable income while maintaining cash flow. For example, a solar farm operator might lock in long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) that adjust for inflation, ensuring steady returns even as borrowing costs rise.

Moreover, infrastructure's alignment with long-term trends like the energy transition ensures income streams remain relevant. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has unlocked tax credits for clean energy projects, incentivizing investment in renewables and grid upgrades. This policy tailwind, combined with AI's insatiable appetite for power, positions infrastructure as a durable source of income.

Strategic Allocation in a Shifting Macro Landscape

For investors navigating 2025's economic uncertainties, private infrastructure offers a dual benefit: protection against inflation and a buffer against market volatility. While core infrastructure (e.g., regulated utilities) provides stable income, core-plus and value-add opportunities offer higher growth potential through operational improvements or sector-specific tailwinds.

The asset class's resilience is further supported by its low volatility. Over the past decade, private infrastructure has outperformed all major asset classes except private equity, with annualized returns averaging 8.0% since 2023. As central banks pivot toward rate cuts in 2025, infrastructure's cost of capital is expected to decline, unlocking new investment opportunities.

Conclusion: A Cornerstone for Future-Proof Portfolios

In an era of macroeconomic uncertainty, private infrastructure stands out as a strategic allocation. Its ability to hedge against inflation, generate stable income, and diversify portfolios makes it a cornerstone for investors seeking resilience. With global infrastructure gaps estimated to exceed $150 trillion by 2040, the sector's long-term growth potential is undeniable. For those willing to embrace this asset class, the rewards could be substantial—both in terms of risk mitigation and returns.

As the economic landscape evolves, infrastructure's role as a strategic inflation hedge will only grow. Investors who act now may find themselves positioned to capitalize on one of the most compelling opportunities of the decade.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-20 01:59:42.910267

In addition to slashing federal funding, the nearly 900-page bill eliminated the solar tax credit that homeowners could claim for installing solar panels on their properties.

Here’s what you need to know about the changes to the solar tax credit and how it’ll likely affect everyone — including those without solar panels.

What is the solar tax credit?

The solar tax credit, also known as the residential clean energy credit, reduces homeowners’ taxes if they install qualifying solar equipment. It essentially lets homeowners use money they would have paid in taxes to install solar energy systems. Taxpayers can claim up to 30% of the installation costs for new clean energy systems on their properties.

The incentive often makes the upfront costs of switching to renewable energy more affordable for homeowners, and it has saved Americans a lot of money. In fact, more than 1.2 million taxpayers claimed $6.3 billion with the residential energy tax credit during the 2023 tax year, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. Rooftop solar electricity systems represented 60% of those claims.

What’s changed for the solar tax credit?

The current version of the solar tax credit was introduced as part of former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which continued a tax break for homeowners who installed solar panels through 2034. The IRS planned to phase out the credit starting in 2033 rather than end it abruptly.

However, Trump’s bill ends the solar tax credit on December 31, 2025 — cutting off nine years of potential savings for consumers who were considering certain renewable energy systems. The end-of-year deadline also drastically reduces the time people have to schedule qualifying installations.

Homeowners who want to claim the solar tax credit for the 2025 tax year need to make a financial transaction before the new December 31 deadline, says Hector Castaneda, a certified professional accountant and president of Castaneda CPA and Associates. That means either paying with cash or financing the purchase ahead of the deadline.

What this means for consumers

Ending the solar tax credit can have far-reaching ramifications for consumers — even those who never planned to switch to solar panels.

More expensive solar installations

The average installation costs for solar panels was $27,720 in early 2025, according to EnergySage, an online solar marketplace. The federal solar tax credit saved homeowners an average of $8,316, dropping the price to $19,404.

But anyone purchasing solar panels for their homes after 2025 will have to rely only on state-based incentives to save money. States vary in what incentives they offer, saving some residents money upfront with sales tax exemptions, or money over time with property tax exemptions. But even combined with local tax credits and rebates for solar installations, state incentives won’t make up for the thousands of dollars in savings homeowners will lose after 2025.

To complicate matters, solar panel costs were already becoming volatile before Trump rang the solar tax credit’s death knell. Tariffs on imported solar components and equipment began affecting the industry earlier this year, creating uncertainty about supply chain reliability and affordability.

Cal Morton, owner of EasTex Solar, a solar installer serving the East Texas region, says the tariffs kicked off a turbulent market for solar companies. “It was already the craziest year that I can think of,” Morton says.

Consumers quickly began to feel the effects of an unstable market. The average cost of residential solar energy systems increased 3% between the first quarters of 2024 and 2025, according to a June 2025 Wood Mackenzie report. Prices are likely to continue to rise, making the solar market more unsteady without the solar tax credit.

Longer payback periods for new systems

Homeowners who purchase solar panels without the benefits of the solar tax credit will likely pay a higher price tag. This translates to a longer gap between solar installation and breaking even with a system’s savings, also known as the payback period.

The average payback period for solar customers was just over seven years in early 2025, according to EnergySage. But homeowners in some areas were already looking at closer to 20 years before breaking even on their purchases. Price hikes and the loss of the tax credit will likely lengthen those payback periods.

Lease, PPA and battery trends

As homeowners back away from solar panel purchases, companies that offer leases and power purchase agreements (PPAs) are likely to become the major competitors, says Chris Hopper, co-founder and chief executive officer of Aurora Solar, a software platform that streamlines the solar array design process for installers.

Homeowners might be able to still save money after 2025 by leasing solar panels or entering a PPA before July 4, 2026, when solar companies’ tax credits change. These arrangements allow homeowners to generate solar energy without purchasing the equipment, while the companies that own the equipment receive a tax break. If a company passes on that tax break to the consumer, it can lower the overall cost of the system.

Additionally, the deadline changes don’t apply to solar battery purchases. Homeowners who purchase batteries to use as storage systems, such as pairing with a new or existing solar energy system, can claim a tax credit to offset up to 50% of the cost. The credit will begin to phase out in 2034 and end on December 31, 2035.

Less solar power and higher electricity bills

The elimination of the solar tax credit comes at the same time that the U.S. energy market is experiencing a growing demand for power, Hopper says. Solar energy has been helping with that demand. It was responsible for 69% of the new electricity-generating capacity that utility companies added to the U.S. power grid in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Wood Mackenzie report from June 2025.

Although commercial solar projects can continue to see tax benefits longer than residential systems, they tend to take longer to put into operation. The lengthy timeline means less solar energy production to support the growing need for more energy in the meantime.

Energy Innovation, a non-partisan think tank specializing in energy, climate research and policy analysis, estimates that the loss of that additional energy will raise the cost of electricity for consumers.

Janice DiPietro, chief integration and customer officer at ReVision Energy, a New England-based solar company, agrees. She cites the combination of new tariffs, the loss of the solar tax credit and the increased demand for power as primary factors.

“As a result, electricity rates will increase at a faster than average pace,” DiPietro said by email.",https://www.ketk.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2025/07/solar-panels-e1752866077410.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-20 02:00:01.957658

Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ: PLUG) is a pure-play hydrogen solutions provider that designs, manufactures, and services fuel cell systems (GenDrive) for material-handling equipment, stationary backup power (GenSure), and on-road vehicles, alongside electrolyzers and hydrogen refueling infrastructure (GenFuel). The company sells hardware, supplies hydrogen fuel under long-term contracts, and offers maintenance and managed services for its deployed fleet of fuel cell units and production facilities. Operating in the broader clean-energy and decarbonization industry, Plug Power addresses demand from logistics and industrial customers seeking to reduce emissions. It competes with other fuel-cell and hydrogen players such as Bloom Energy, Ballard Power Systems, and FuelCell Energy, as well as industrial-gas companies like Air Products & Chemicals and Air Liquide, and faces indirect competition from battery-electric powertrain suppliers. Plug’s vertically integrated model—covering production, delivery, and end-use of hydrogen—gives it scale advantages, with over 70,000 fuel cell systems and 250 fueling stations deployed globally.

Recent Performance

Over the past 12 months, Plug Power’s stock has plunged roughly 55%, compared with a 13.6% gain for the S&P 500. This underperformance reflects lingering investor skepticism over Plug’s path to profitability amid deep negative margins and substantial share dilution. Political uncertainty also weighed on sentiment: an executive order in early 2025 paused the release of DOE loan guarantee funds, putting its $1.66 billion green-hydrogen loan at risk and prompting cost‐cutting measures. More recently, Plug saw a rally on bipartisan support for extending hydrogen tax credits through 2028, but the broader trend remains one of volatility and downward pressure.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

Analysts forecast Plug’s revenue to climb from about $969 million in 2025 to $1.32 billion in 2026, a compound annual increase of roughly 36%. Growth drivers include ongoing orders from anchor customers Amazon and Walmart, rapid expansion of its GenEco electrolyzer business (up 575% year-over-year in Q1), and the commissioning of a 15-ton-per-day hydrogen plant in Louisiana, boosting total U.S. production capacity to ~40 TPD. Plug’s cost-reduction program “Project Quantum Leap” is targeting $150–200 million in annual savings, while a $525 million secured credit facility has strengthened near-term liquidity.

Quality & Moat

Plug remains unprofitable, with a 12-month net loss of ~$2 billion and free cash flow of –$901 million, alongside a gross margin loss of 55% in Q1 2025 versus –132% in Q1 2024. Returns on equity (–1.21%) and invested capital (–65.48%) are deeply negative. However, Plug’s integrated hydrogen ecosystem—covering production, storage, and fuel cells—creates a high barrier to entry, and partnerships with major logistics operators provide a stable demand base. Management has demonstrated capital discipline by refinancing dilutive convertible debt, cutting cash burn in Q1 to $152 million (from $288 million prior year), and committing to no new equity raises in 2025.

Valuation

Plug Power trades at an enterprise value of roughly $3 billion, implying an EV/sales multiple of about 3× on 2025 revenue estimates. Traditional earnings multiples are negative (forward P/E of –0.87×), and price-to-book stands at 0.57×. The average analyst price target of $1.29 suggests a 16% downside from today’s $1.79 share price, underscoring cautious sentiment given execution risks and ongoing losses.

Market Sentiment

Analyst consensus is “Hold” with 19 covering brokers, reflecting mixed views on near-term catalysts and profitability. Insider activity has included CFO Paul Middleton buying 650,000 shares on June 9 and 350,000 on May 16, signaling internal confidence , although the net insider buying/selling ratio of 0.93 indicates overall modest net selling. Short interest is elevated at 25.9% of float (2.4 days to cover), up 23% month over month, pointing to bearish bets. Institutional ownership sits near 43.5%, while retail holds the balance, highlighting a polarized base.

Key Risks

Unprofitable Operations and Cash Burn: Persistent negative gross margins, substantial free cash flow deficits, and a track record of asset impairments raise uncertainty over when Plug will reach sustainable profitability.

Execution and Dilution Risk: Meeting ambitious production and cost-reduction targets under Project Quantum Leap is critical; failure could force new equity raises and further dilute shareholders.

Regulatory and Policy Uncertainty: Shifts in U.S. policy—such as executive orders impacting DOE loan disbursements or future changes to hydrogen tax credits—could disrupt funding and slow project rollouts.

Competitive Pressures: Alternative decarbonization solutions, including battery-electric vehicles and rival fuel-cell technologies from Bloom Energy and Ballard, could limit Plug’s market share gains.

Financial Leverage and Volatility: While Plug holds net cash, its interest coverage is deeply negative (–43×) and its beta is 1.34, indicating high earnings and stock volatility under economic stress.

Bull Case

Rapid Revenue Growth: Analyst projections of mid-30% annual revenue growth driven by large contracts, electrolyzer deployments, and hydrogen plant expansions could deliver material upside.

Margin Turnaround: Gross margins improved from –132% to –55% in Q1; further cost savings and internal hydrogen production could push margins toward break-even and unlock valuation re-rating.

Strong Institutional and Insider Support: Recent debt refinancing reduced dilution risk, and insider purchases combined with anchor customer partnerships (Amazon, Walmart) reinforce confidence in management strategy.

Policy Tailwinds: Extension of clean-hydrogen tax credits through 2028 under recent legislation enhances project economics and potentially accelerates demand for Plug’s solutions.

Valuation Leverage: Trading at ~3× forward EV/sales—below many fast-growing tech peers—offers attractive upside if growth and profitability come through as expected.

Bear Case

Ongoing Losses: Continued negative margins and hefty cash burn strain balance-sheet resilience, risking further dilution if equity capital becomes necessary.

Policy Risk: Uncertain federal support for hydrogen (e.g., DOE funding delays or future tax-credit rollbacks) could derail project timelines and revenue projections.

Competitive Threats: Emerging battery-electric solutions and competing hydrogen technologies may win customers, limiting Plug’s ability to convert market potential into sales.

High Short Interest and Volatility: Elevated bearish positioning (26% of float shorted) increases downside risk if negative news triggers a sell-off and amplifies stock swings.

Execution Complexity: Scaling global manufacturing, supply chains, and plant commissioning is operationally demanding; missteps could erode customer trust and slow deployments.

On Our Radar

Q2 2025 Earnings (Aug 7, 2025): Investors will scrutinize revenue growth, margin progress, and cash-flow trends, and seek updates on cost-reduction and DOE funding status.

DOE Loan Guarantee Milestones (Late 2025): Key drawdown and disbursement schedules for the $1.66 billion DOE loan will provide insight into Plug’s hydrogen-plant buildout and capital needs.

Hydrogen Tax-Credit Policy Updates: Congressional decisions around extending or phasing out production and investment tax credits for hydrogen projects could materially affect project economics.

Electrolyzer Product Launches (H2 2025): New GenEco product rollouts or technology enhancements may drive higher-margin revenues and strengthen Plug’s competitive positioning.

Investment Recommendation

Plug Power represents a high-beta, high-risk play on the emerging clean-hydrogen economy. Its rapid revenue growth and improving margins, underpinned by major customer contracts and policy support, point to a potentially significant upside if execution stays on track. However, the company’s long history of losses, execution complexity, and reliance on government funding introduce substantial volatility and dilution risk. A long-term investor with a high risk appetite may view current levels as an attractive entry point to benefit from a hydrogen rebound, while more risk-averse investors might wait for sustained profitability and clearer policy visibility before committing.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-07-20 04:57:54.899580

The argument for rolling back these tax credits is that they promote unnecessary government intervention and market distortion.
The One Big Beautiful Bill will reduce the burden of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) on middle- and upper-middle-income taxpayers.","A bill, which is being discussed and debated in the US these days is President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” (also known as OBBBA). Though the bill has finally been passed by the Parliament and approved by the President, in the process, it has definitely broken a friendship that was in the news recently, where Elon Musk was seen as Santa, to President Trump, as he played a significant role in getting him elected to this post. Elon Musk is so upset with this law that he has even formed a new political party. While President Trump claims that his bill will bring more prosperity to the US than ever before, and help make America great again, critics including Elon Musk believe that this bill can wreak havoc on the US economy.

Before passing any judgement on who is right and who is wrong, let’s try to understand what this bill means?

One thing for sure is clear that bill will increase the federal deficit in the coming decade. The US debt is projected to increase by $3.3-$3.9 trillion in the next one decade, from 2025. Currently, (as of 2025) US national debt is over $34 trillion, which is more than 120 percent of its GDP, and is very high even from the perspective of a developed country.

It is clear that the federal debt is already very high, and the interest outgo on increased debt could deteriorate the economic scenario for the US. Interest payments on the existing debt are already the largest federal expenditure, competing with defense and health expenditures, and this scenario could get even worsen in the coming years. Although, this new law will lead to a huge jump in the federal debt, but with the debt increasing from time to time, Americans have realized its inevitability. Perhaps, this is the reason that although those aware of its impact are worried, the general public may not be. This is why Trump has been able to garner support for the bill in the Parliament and among the general public as well.

But the markets are not so kind to Donald Trump, as they are signaling the potential risks from the rising debts. The yield on US government bonds is rising as investors are demanding higher returns for holding the debt. Some experts have also warned of a fiscal crisis if the yield on government debt rises. If the US is unable to control its debt or the world loses confidence in the dollar, the crisis could worsen. Rating agencies such as Fitch have already downgraded US credit rating, citing long-term fiscal challenges.

Another provision that has been controversial, is the provision to phase out the clean energy tax credit. The clean energy tax credit was included under past President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) 2022.

The Inflation Reduction Act introduced a number of tax incentives to promote clean energy, including a variety of tax credits for solar, wind and other renewable energy projects, electric vehicle (EV) taxes, home energy efficiency upgrades, etc.

These credits were designed to promote investment in clean technology, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and speed the transition to a low-carbon economy. The new law will roll back most of these credits over a period of time, usually 2 to 5 years.

The argument for rolling back these tax credits is that they promote unnecessary government intervention and market distortion. These incentives cost hundreds of billions of dollars and add to the national debt. Donald Trump says fossil fuel and traditional industries should be given a level playing field. He says energy policy should focus on affordability and reliability, not just decarbonization.

Opponents say rolling back these credits will slow clean energy deployment and undermine climate action. The move could also discourage private investment in renewable infrastructure and domestic manufacturing, threatening jobs in the growing clean tech sector.

By phasing out the Clean Energy Tax Credit from the Inflation Reduction Act, this law marks a significant shift in US energy and climate policy. While governments all over the world, including India, are making major efforts to promote green energy expansion, this move of the Trump administration is being considered regressive.

Under the new law, a 1 per cent tax will be levied on international remittances in the form of money sent from individuals in the United States to individuals outside the country. It is worth noting that the House version initially proposed a 3.5 per cent tax, but the Senate lowered it.

Other major provisions of the bill

There are hundreds of provisions in the OBBBA. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) was signed into law by President Donald Trump, under which for most income groups, personal income tax rates were reduced and standard deductions were increased, and tax credits for children were doubled. These reliefs were to expire at the end of 2025. The “One Big Beautiful Bill” removes that expiration date, making lower individual tax rates permanent. This means that unless Congress changes the law again, Americans in most income brackets will continue to benefit from lower marginal tax rates, higher standard deductions, higher tax credits for children, and more.

The One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBBA) increases the Child Tax Credit (CTC) to $2,500 per child (from $2,000 earlier) to provide more financial support to families with children. It’s important to note that a large portion of the credit is refundable, meaning families can receive the money even if they owe little or no income tax.

The One Big Beautiful Bill will reduce the burden of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) on middle- and upper-middle-income taxpayers. The Alternative Minimum Tax is a parallel tax system designed to ensure that higher-income earners, who benefit from many deductions and credits still pay a minimum level of tax.

Workers will also find relief in this law. The law specifically introduces new tax deductions for tips and overtime pay, aimed at benefiting hourly employees, especially those working in hospitality, retail, service, etc. Tip-earning workers (such as restaurant servers, bartenders, hotel workers, etc.) can now deduct a portion of their reported tip income from their taxable income. The bill also allows a deduction for income earned from working overtime, typically hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week. These measures will increase take-home pay for workers who rely heavily on tips and overtime, encourage hard work, especially for those who put in extra hours, and also help address income volatility in sectors with inconsistent pay.

Although the Trump administration has succeeded in making this law that reduces taxes and increases debt, but due to this political turmoil has increased. America’s increasing debt is now a reality, how will it deal with it? What will be Trump’s plan to deal with the challenges facing the dollar?

Political reporter

The first schools in England to install what the government described as ""Great British Energy solar panels"" were made in China, the BBC has learned.

The first 11 schools involved in the GB Energy scheme bought solar panels from Aiko and Longi, two Chinese firms.

The government said the scheme was ""the first major project for Great British Energy - a company owned by the British people, for the British people"".

Labour MP Sarah Champion said GB Energy should be buying solar panels from companies in the UK rather than China, where there have been allegations of forced labour in supply chains.

""I'm really excited about the principle of GB Energy,"" she told BBC News.

""But it's taxpayers' money and we should not be supporting slave labour with that money. And wherever possible, we should be supporting good working practices and buy British if we can.""

She added: ""That means that yes, unfortunately, in the short term, solar panels are probably going to be slightly more expensive.

""There are solar panels made around the world in Taiwan, Canada, even in the UK.""

Longi and Aiko both told the BBC they forbid forced labour in their production and supply chains.

China is the world's leading producer of solar panels and the suppliers in the Xinjiang region have been linked to the alleged exploitation of Uyghur Muslims.

Earlier this year, the law was changed to ban GB Energy from investing in renewables if there is evidence of modern slavery in their production.

China has dominated the market and, according to the International Energy Agency, the country's global share in all the manufacturing stages of solar panels exceeds 80%.

Champion, who is chair of the International Development Select Committee, said ""abuse in renewable supply chains is insidious and hard to root out"".

But she urged ministers to exclude known human-rights offenders from winning public contracts.

A GB Energy spokesperson said all of the solar contracts issued under the schools initiative complied with the UK's modern slavery rules.

The Xinjiang challenge

Up to 50% of the world's supply of polysilicon - a key component in solar panels - is estimated to come from the Xinjiang region.

Mark Candlish is the director of GB-Sol, which calls itself the only manufacturer of conventional solar panels in the UK.

He said polysilicon was ""a key social issue facing our industry, with the risk of forced labour in the main mining areas"".

He added: ""The global solar market is so dominated by China that it is difficult to avoid buying Chinese if you want the low cost energy and low carbon benefits of solar PV.""

Many businesses and governments - including the UK's - buy Chinese solar panels because they are cheaper than those made elsewhere.

Two thirds (68%) of the solar panels imported by the UK came from China in 2024, according to HMRC trade data. That's an increase on the figure in 2023, when Chinese products accounted for 61% of UK solar imports.

A report by Sheffield Hallam University in 2023 linked various solar companies to suppliers in the Xinjiang region.

One of the report's authors, Alan Crawford, said the general lack of transparency in the entire solar supply chain was greater now than it was in 2023, when his Over-Exposed report was published.

""Companies that were willing to comment are now silent,"" he said.

'Ethical supply chains'

GB Energy is a state-owned company that was set up by the Labour government to invest in renewables, such as solar power.

In its first big investment, GB Energy is spending about £200m on rooftop solar for 200 schools and NHS hospitals across the country.

The first tranche of this funding has been spent on the Chinese solar panels for the 11 schools.

The Department for Education told the BBC which companies had made the solar panels in response to a freedom of information request.

A GB Energy spokesperson said the company would ""lead the way in ethical supply chains"" and insisted there was ""no place for forced labour or unethical practices in the UK's energy transition"".

The spokesperson added: ""That is why we are introducing a statutory duty on Great British Energy to prevent modern slavery in its supply chains, and reviewing supplier transparency and disclosure standards to ensure confidence in all public-facing renewable programmes.

""All contracts issued under this schools and hospitals solar initiative complied with UK procurement rules, including extensive requirements under the Modern Slavery Act.

""GBE will seek to uphold these requirements in its contracting arrangements and are actively engaging with international partners to raise the bar globally on solar supply chain accountability.""

China has been accused of committing crimes against humanity against the Uyghur population and other mostly-Muslim ethnic groups in the north-western region of Xinjiang.

In state-sponsored programmes, detainees are forced to produce goods including polysilicon, a core ingredient in solar panels, according to the US Department of Labor.

The Chinese government has denied all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang.

Longi and Aiko are both members of the Solar Stewardship Initiative, which is a scheme designed to develop confidence in the supply chain and the responsible sourcing of solar panels.

An Aiko spokesperson said the company was ""committed to upholding the highest standards of ethical business conduct and responsible sourcing"".

""We take any concerns related to human rights and labour practices seriously and expect our suppliers to do the same,"" the spokesperson said.

""As part of our ongoing efforts, we engage with suppliers to promote transparency and continuous improvement in line with international guidelines. We are also closely monitoring global supply chain developments and remain committed to working with stakeholders to support a fair and sustainable solar industry.""

Longi said it regretted the findings of the Sheffield Hallam University report and ""categorically affirms that forced labour has no place within our supply chain"".

A company spokesperson said the conclusions in the Over-Exposed report ""may not fully reflect the comprehensive measures Longi has implemented to ensure full compliance with international labour standards"".

""Independent third-party audits play a critical role in verifying compliance and identifying potential risks,"" the spokesperson said.

""While the complexity of global supply chains presents challenges, Longi remains steadfast in its efforts to eliminate any risks associated with forced labour.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/04c4/live/619e09a0-650e-11f0-9bd4-3b6cedfeb853.jpg,N,,2025-07-19 23:35:29.179173

By vertically integrating its hydrogen supply chain, securing policy-driven tailwinds, and locking in transformative commercial partnerships, Plug Power is positioning itself as a dominant force in a market projected to grow to $1.5 trillion by 2050. For investors, the company's strategic execution and alignment with macro trends make it a compelling case study in how to capitalize on the energy transition.

Vertical Integration: Building a Resilient Hydrogen Ecosystem

Plug Power's most distinctive advantage lies in its control over the entire hydrogen value chain—from production and distribution to end-user applications. In 2025, the company operates two flagship green hydrogen plants: a 25-ton-per-day (TPD) facility in Georgia, the largest liquid green hydrogen plant in North America, and a 15-TPD plant in Louisiana. These facilities, combined with a 15-TPD hydrogen hub in Texas powered by wind energy, now produce approximately 45 tons of liquid hydrogen daily. This scale is critical for reducing costs and ensuring supply stability, a key barrier for competitors relying on fragmented supply chains.

The Uline partnership exemplifies the power of this strategy. By supplying hydrogen and deploying GenDrive fuel cells and GenFuel infrastructure across 10 distribution centers, Plug Power has created a closed-loop system where hydrogen production directly fuels industrial demand. Uline's commitment to secure up to 15 TPD of hydrogen through 2030 not only validates Plug's technology but also locks in recurring revenue and operational data to refine efficiency. For context, Uline's logistics footprint represents a microcosm of the broader industrial sector's shift toward decarbonization—a trend Plug is uniquely positioned to monetize.

Policy Tailwinds: Leveraging the Inflation Reduction Act for Scalability

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has transformed the economics of green hydrogen, and Plug Power is leveraging its provisions with precision. Section 45V's Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit, which offers up to $3.00 per kilogram of hydrogen for projects with ultra-low carbon intensity, is a game-changer. Plug's use of renewable energy for electrolysis—such as the wind-powered Texas plant—qualifies it for the highest tax credit tiers, directly boosting margins.

The IRA also provides flexibility in sourcing clean energy, including Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) and renewable natural gas (RNG), which Plug is integrating into its supply chain. This adaptability is critical as the company aims to scale to 500 TPD in North America by 2025 and 1,000 TPD globally by 2028. The recent $1.66 billion conditional loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy further de-risks capital expenditures, enabling Plug to expand its production network without diluting shareholder value.

High-Impact Partnerships: Validating Market Demand

Plug's commercial agreements are more than revenue streams—they're proof of concept for hydrogen's role in decarbonizing heavy industry. The Uline partnership, for instance, demonstrates how hydrogen can replace fossil fuels in material handling and logistics, a sector responsible for 8% of global CO₂ emissions. By 2030, Uline's deployment of Plug's infrastructure could reduce carbon emissions by over 100,000 metric tons annually, a figure that underscores the environmental and economic scalability of Plug's solutions.

Equally significant is the confidence of Plug's own leadership. In May and June 2025, CFO Paul Middleton purchased 1 million shares of company stock, a move that signals internal conviction in the company's trajectory. This aligns with broader market sentiment: Plug's stock has gained 120% year-to-date (as of July 2025), outperforming peers in the energy transition space.

Investment Implications: A Maturing Growth Story

Plug Power's journey from a speculative innovator to a commercial validator is nearing a tipping point. With operational plants, policy-driven profitability, and partnerships that scale with demand, the company is transitioning from capital-intensive growth to cash-generative maturity. For investors, this represents a rare opportunity to back a business that is not only riding macro trends but actively shaping them.

The risks, however, remain manageable. While hydrogen infrastructure requires upfront capital, Plug's vertical integration and government support mitigate these costs. Moreover, the company's focus on industrial applications—where carbon pricing and regulatory pressure are most acute—ensures a clear path to profitability.

Conclusion: Positioning for the Hydrogen Economy

Plug Power's strategic positioning in the green hydrogen market is a masterclass in aligning technology, policy, and partnerships. By controlling its supply chain, leveraging IRA incentives, and securing long-term contracts with industry leaders like Uline, Plug is building a business model that transcends the energy transition hype cycle. For investors seeking exposure to the hydrogen economy, Plug Power offers a rare combination of innovation and execution—a compelling case for inclusion in a clean energy portfolio.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-20 01:59:53.690547

Several states, including Wisconsin, Colorado, New Mexico, and Maryland, have beaten the Golden State to the punch in strengthening state clean water protections in response to weaker federal protections.
The Right to Clean Water Act is the fulfillment of a promise made when our state leaders first acknowledged clean water is a human right.","OPINION – If there is one thing the new Trump Administration has proven it’s that our precious democracy can go through great fluctuations depending on who resides in the White House. And thanks to President Trump’s deep reach into the current makeup of the US Supreme Court, sudden shifts in our regulatory environment are creating shockwaves on a wide range of topics that have left state leaders scrambling to retain our safety nets.

For example, federal policy changes are forcing California leaders to get creative to protect our shared natural resources and public health. The Supreme Court’s now-infamous Sackett v. EPA decision dramatically reduced the reach of the Clean Water Act, leaving many formerly protected waterways and wetlands much harder to protect from pollution, especially in the West.

Fortunately, we have leadership in California to ensure this seismic disruption in policy is muted by a response that could expedite how state law will capture the same protections that federal clean water permits once did. SB 601 (Allen), also known as The Right to Clean Water Act, attempts to piece back together the regulatory system established under the federal Clean Water Act over the past five decades. The Clean Water Act was intended to ensure the waters of the United States are “fishable, swimmable, and drinkable” for every American. But recent decisions by the US Supreme Court and related forthcoming regulatory changes made by Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency have severely narrowed the reach of this landmark law. GIS maps developed by the NRDC estimate more than 600,000 miles of California’s streams and up to 96% of our wetlands could lose federal Clean Water Act protections based on changes due to Sackett and further impending moves under Trump’s EPA.

That’s where SB 601 comes in. The bill aims to restore and streamline the permitting process that ensures water pollution is well monitored and controlled in California under the authority of California’s Porter-Cologne Act. With those protections now severely weakened, everything from our coastlines to our drinking water sources lack the protections we’ve all come to expect. SB 601 allows for the retention of a regulatory framework for managing water pollution in the state by expediting the replacement of the now-absent federal regulation with state authority.

SB 601 would strengthen state enforcement options and make it possible to increase penalties on polluters so that state penalties can align with the type of enforcement that was previously possible under federal law. With environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act now narrowed for many types of projects, protecting clean water under SB 601 is even more essential.

SB 601 was drafted with the basic goal of maintaining the clean water protections previously ensured through federal law. But as the bill has made its way through the legislative process, one critical tool for clean water enforcement – the citizen suit provision – has already been scuttled by the Senate.

Citizen enforcement is not just nice to have. State agencies expect and rely on community members to help enforce clean water laws because they lack the resources to pursue every violation. Citizen enforcement is fundamental to ensuring clean water protections in a state where water pollution remains the norm far too often, particularly in low-income communities and communities of color. It is essential that legislators reinstate this critical right within SB 601 so that it remains available to every Californian.

SB 601 is essential – but it’s hardly revolutionary. Several states, including Wisconsin, Colorado, New Mexico, and Maryland, have beaten the Golden State to the punch in strengthening state clean water protections in response to weaker federal protections.

The Right to Clean Water Act is the fulfillment of a promise made when our state leaders first acknowledged clean water is a human right. At this moment in time, perhaps more than ever before in our nation’s history, we need California to show the world we mean what we say when it comes to protecting public health and our natural world.

BP PLC has agreed to divest its onshore wind business in the United States to LS Power Development LLC, toward a goal of $3-4 billion in asset sales this year.

The sale of BP Wind Energy North America Inc. to New York City-based LS Power consists of 1.3 gigawatts (GW) net capacity from 10 projects in operation.

Five of the projects are wholly owned by BP: the 44-megawatt (MW) Flat Ridge I and 470-MW Flat Ridge II in Kansas, the 288-MW Fowler Ridge I and 99-MW Fowler Ridge III in Indiana, and the 25-MW Titan in South Dakota.

In each of the other five, BP owns 50 percent: the 21-MW Auwahi in Hawaii, the 248-MW Cedar Creek II in Colorado, the 200-MW Fowler Ridge II in Indiana, the 125-MW Goshen II in Idaho and the 141-MW Mehoopany in Pennsylvania.

All 10 projects, which can generate up to 1.7 GW gross, are grid-connected and signed to 15 offtakers, according to a joint statement Friday.

To be managed under LS Power’s portfolio company Clearlight Energy, the projects would grow the purchaser’s operating fleet to about 4.3 GW, the statement said.

“LS Power will add bp’s US onshore wind business to an existing fleet of renewable, energy storage, flexible gas and renewable fuels assets, which comprise a 21GW operating portfolio and more than 780 miles of high-voltage transmission lines in operation as well as another 350+ miles currently under construction or development”, it said.

The parties expect to complete the transaction by year-end, subject to regulatory approvals. The price was not disclosed. Employees will transfer to the new owner.

LS Power chief executive Paul Segal said, “We are focused on a holistic approach to advancing American energy infrastructure that includes improving existing energy assets while investing in transformative strategies that make energy more efficient, affordable and available”.

“Well-located with well-structured contracts, these new assets will expand our renewable energy presence and help to meet growing energy demand across the US”, Segal added.

William Lin, BP executive vice president for gas and low-carbon energy, said, “We have been clear that while low carbon energy has a role to play in a simpler, more focused bp, we will continue to rationalize and optimize our portfolio to generate value”.

BP expects to achieve $3-4 billion of a target of $20 billion in divestment proceeds by 2027, part of a “reset” strategy that involves scaling down renewables investment and cutting costs.

“This is a major milestone on our journey to a 100% clean energy future” said David Hochschild, chairman of the California Energy Commission.
The momentum is profound.” The new record comes as renewable energy is facing several headwinds.
He brags about a 67% clean energy milestone but ignores the real story,” said Steve Hilton, a Republican running for governor in 2026.
Nevertheless, the California Energy Commission last month approved the world’s largest battery solar project, a huge new facility in Fresno County, the Darden Energy Project.","California has hit a new record for clean energy.

Solar, wind, hydropower and other carbon-free sources made up 67% of the state’s retail electricity supply in 2023, the most recent year that data is available, according to new statistics released Monday by the California Energy Commission.

The total is up from 2022, when it was 61%. It exceeds the prior record of 64%, set in 2019.

Under a state law signed by former Gov. Jerry Brown in 2018 aimed at reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to climate change, California is required to reach 100% renewable and carbon-free electricity by 2045.

Solar, wind, geothermal, large hydropower, biomass and nuclear energy are allowed to count under the law.

“This is a major milestone on our journey to a 100% clean energy future” said David Hochschild, chairman of the California Energy Commission. “Two-thirds clean energy was considered mythology even 10 years ago. Alternative energy is now the wrong word to use for renewables. And we are just getting started. The momentum is profound.”

The new record comes as renewable energy is facing several headwinds.

Earlier this month, Republicans in Congress passed and President Trump signed a bill that removes and reduces many of the tax breaks, federal grants and other incentives that were put in place by President Biden to encourage states, private companies and homeowners to expand renewable energy and electric vehicles.

Trump also signed an executive order on July 7 directing the Treasury Department to review tax subsidies to renewable energy.

“Ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts to unreliable energy sources is vital to energy dominance, national security, economic growth and the fiscal health of the nation,” Trump wrote.

Gov. Gavin Newsom called that approach, in which Trump continued long-running subsidies for oil and gas, a mistake.

“As the federal government turns its back on innovation and commonsense, California is making our clean energy future a reality,” Newsom said Monday in a statement. “The world’s fourth-largest economy is running on two-thirds clean power – the largest economy on the planet to achieve this milestone.”

California has some of the highest electricity costs of any state. The average retail electricity price in California in April was 31.77 cents a kilowatt-hour, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, nearly twice the national average of 17.45 cents. Only Hawaii (42.44 cents) and Connecticut (32.28 cents) were more expensive.

“Governor Newsom’s press release is a perfect example of political theater. He brags about a 67% clean energy milestone but ignores the real story,” said Steve Hilton, a Republican running for governor in 2026. “California families and small businesses pay the highest electricity prices in the nation, we have one of the highest poverty rates, and our economy is being choked by overregulation and soaring energy costs.”

Polls show clean energy remains popular. In a poll last year by the non-partisan Public Policy Institute of California, 66% of California voters said they support the state’s law requiring 100% clean energy by 2045.

Hochschild said part of the reason for high electricity costs is wildfires. State regulators have required utilities like PG&E to bury powerlines in highly flammable areas to reduce fire risk, which can cost millions of dollars a mile.

Frank Wolak, a Stanford University energy economist, noted that clean energy mandates are a big reason Californians pay twice as much for electricity as people in Texas and other states.

“Renewable energy is great,” Wolak said. “But the burden often falls on people who are renting and living in apartment complexes. People who don’t own a house can’t put solar panels on the roof to lower their electricity bills.”

One of the main challenges is that the sun doesn’t shine at night and the wind doesn’t always blow.

To address that, California regulators have pushed utilities and other companies in recent years to build battery storage plants. The plants capture electricity generated by solar farms during hot parts of the day and then release it back onto the power grid at night after the sun goes down.

Battery storage has increased tenfold in the past five years in California, from 1,474 megawatts in 2020 to 15,763 megawatts now, according to the California Energy Commission. A megawatt is enough electricity to run 750 homes. California has been building battery storage faster than anywhere in the world except China.

But a major fire in January at one of the world’s largest battery storage plants, run by Texas-based Vistra in Moss Landing, has raised safety concerns about the technology and given rise to community groups opposing new plants in their neighborhoods.

Nevertheless, the California Energy Commission last month approved the world’s largest battery solar project, a huge new facility in Fresno County, the Darden Energy Project.

Many more will have to be built, Hochschild said. Electricity demand is steadily growing statewide due the growth in electric car sales — 25% of new car sales in California are now electric vehicles, the most of any state — along with the expanded demand from data centers needed for artificial intelligence.

The state will need 52,000 megawatts of battery storage by 2045, the energy commission estimates.

Hochschild said the Moss Landing plant was built five years ago using battery chemistry that is now being replaced by safer technology. And the facility was built by stacking thousands of lithium-ion batteries inside an old PG&E concrete building. New standards require each battery unit to be outside, separated from each other with sensors and alarms.

“I don’t believe there are safer battery standards anywhere in the world for what we require here,” Hochschild said. “I have to vote on all these projects. I will never vote to approve a battery storage project or any project that I feel wouldn’t be safe in my community or my house.”",https://www.montereyherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/EBT-L-WINDPOWER-XXXX-08.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-07-19 23:35:59.477859

Ajay Bansal, President of AIPDA, said the idea is to give fuel station owners a chance to produce their own Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) by converting waste into CBG on-site. He explained that petrol pump owners can use 150–200 square yards of their existing space to set up small-scale CBG units.

“These mini plants will include a compressor, cascade, and dispenser, all in one setup,” Bansal said. “The idea is to make CBG using crop stubble, municipal waste, and household garbage. Each unit would require an investment of ₹5 to ₹6 crore.”

Bansal highlighted the urgency of the shift, pointing out the 8–10% annual rise in fuel consumption while India continues to import 90% of its crude oil. “We must start using waste to generate our own fuel,” he said.

India has ambitious plans to establish 5,000 CBG plants that will produce 15 million tonnes of CBG per year—around 40% of the country’s current CNG consumption. The estimated national potential for CBG production is 62 million metric tonnes (MMT), with the added benefit of generating 370 MMT of organic fertilizer as a by-product.

Biogas is produced by breaking down organic waste such as agricultural residue, cow dung, sugarcane press mud, solid municipal waste, and sewage. When purified and compressed, this biogas becomes CBG—a renewable fuel with properties similar to CNG. It can be used in vehicles and in industrial and commercial sectors, especially considering the vast amount of biomass available in India.

The government launched the SATAT (Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation) initiative on October 1, 2018, to encourage the use of waste as a resource. The program aims to reduce fuel imports, create rural jobs, cut emissions, and limit the burning of farm and organic waste.

This comes after Gov. Greg Abbott vetoed a planned ban on most hemp products, which contain THC at lower levels than marijuana, as well as more than two dozen other bills that lawmakers had approved.

Abbott has also called on lawmakers to tackle emergency preparedness in the wake of catastrophic flooding in Central Texas, as well as redrawing the state’s congressional districts and passing conservative priorities such as banning abortion pills. Here’s what you need to know:

Why there’s a special session

During their regular legislative session in the spring, state lawmakers passed a bill that would have banned consumable hemp products like vapes, gummies and drinks that provide a similar high as marijuana. The broad ban would have taken effect in September, if not for Abbott’s veto. He then ordered a special legislative session for lawmakers to regulate the hemp industry and address other bills he vetoed.

The other vetoed bills on Abbott’s agenda range from changes to the criminal justice system to water rights management, but many eyes will be on how lawmakers address a loophole in previous state laws legalizing hemp that allowed the sale of THC products — which spawned an entire new industry across Texas.

Lt. Gov Dan Patrick, who has claimed that THC is driving young people to suicide and altering people’s brains, championed the ban and even threatened to make lawmakers work overtime by preventing other important legislation from advancing if they didn’t approve a ban.

Experts say there are some health concerns, including that THC can be addictive, but they say it doesn’t usually cause widespread psychosis or brain damage.

The hemp industry and its advocates warned the ban could shutter the hemp industry and hinder access to the non-psychoactive CBD and CBG and to medical marijuana for patients in need of pain relief.

Lawmakers did expand the state’s limited medical marijuana program, but medical marijuana dispensaries still hope lawmakers will heavily regulate the hemp industry by putting in place age restrictions and banning synthetic delta-8 THC, which makes up the bulk of consumable hemp products.

A special session lasts up to 30 days, and state lawmakers can only work on the governor’s agenda items.

After facing pressure from President Donald Trump’s political team, Abbott has asked lawmakers to redraw some of Texas’ 38 U.S. House districts ahead of the 2026 midterms.

He also directed lawmakers to focus on these areas following the deadly Hill Country floods over the July 4 weekend:

Flood warning systems

Emergency communications

Natural disaster preparation

Relief funding for the impacted areas

Abbott also included several high-profile and controversial conservative priorities that didn’t pass during the 140-day regular session, including:

Banning cities and counties from hiring lobbyists to advocate for them at the Capitol

Requiring people to use bathrooms that align with the sex they were assigned at birth

Cracking down on the manufacturing and distribution of abortion pills

During the session, which ran from January through early June, state lawmakers failed to pass a bill that would have established a statewide plan to improve Texas’ disaster response. House Bill 13 called for the plan to include “the use of outdoor warning sirens,” like those used in tornado-prone Texas counties, and develop new emergency alert systems.

State Rep. Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston, said he would propose legislation to ensure people are alerted with sirens along watersheds instead of notifications on their phones that could be silenced or missed.

How can I participate in the legislative process?

Contact your lawmakers: Texans can share their concerns and personal stories with their elected representatives, which can be the most effective form of advocacy, said Kathy Green, the director of state and federal strategy for AARP Texas who has more than 30 years of experience working in and around state government.

“If you’ve got stories about those actual things that affect your daily life, talk to your legislator about that,” she said. “They need to hear the stories; they need to understand what people back in their districts are facing.”

But it helps to be prepared with knowledge of the legislation, including its impact and possible costs, and about the lawmaker you’re contacting, said state Sen. Judith Zaffirini, D-Laredo. For example, don’t lobby a legislator to support a bill that they authored, she said.

Meeting with the lawmaker’s staff can be just as important as meeting with their boss, Zaffirini added.

“Staff is very important in the process because staff makes the recommendations regarding the bill,” she said. “So by working with a staff, [constituents] prepare the staff to be persuasive with a member.”

Testify at a public hearing: You can register through kiosks at the Capitol or online while using the Capitol Wi-Fi. In the Senate, you may have to fill out a card in person during the hearing to testify. You can find more tips on how to testify here.

During a special session, a Senate committee or subcommittee must post notice of a meeting at least 24 hours before the meeting, according to the state’s legislative guide. House committees or subcommittees must also typically post notice for a public hearing held during a special session at least 24 hours before, unless the rule is suspended by a vote of the members on the House floor.

It is more impactful to succinctly speak about your experience than it is to read written testimony or just cite facts, said Luke Metzger, the executive director of the advocacy group Environment Texas. But you can also submit written testimony or have someone else testify on your behalf.

It can take time for legislation to come up for discussion in a committee hearing, especially if a hearing is scheduled for after a chamber meets for floor debate, so it helps to be prepared to be at the Capitol for a while.

“Planning is critical, and typically plan to spend the day and stay overnight if necessary,” Zaffirini said. It can also help to communicate with staff if you need to leave by a certain time, she said.

Join an advocacy group: If you find an organization that is working on issues that matter to you, they can help you navigate and stay engaged in the legislative process. But it doesn’t take a well-funded organization, said Shera Eichler, a government affairs consultant and former chief of staff for a state representative.

“Maybe there’s a group of parents or a group of your neighbors that share the same common concerns, where you can all meet with the legislator together or send a letter together,” she said.

The outlook for the domestic solar industry has soured alongside the abrupt shift in federal energy policy this year. Nevertheless, some projects continue to slide through. A case in point is a the new 150-megawatt Santa Teresa solar power plant slated for construction in Doña Ana County, in New Mexico. The project is particularly interesting because it is yet another demonstration that the US solar industry can deliver more clean kilowatts, more quickly, than any other available energy resource.

More Clean Kilowatts, More Quickly

The new Santa Teresa project was okayed for construction to begin last week. Along with a 150-megawatt solar array, Santa Teresa includes a battery energy storage system of 600 megawatt-hours. If all goes according to plan, the whole system will be up and running before the end of 2026, which is just around the corner.

Electricity ratepayers in New Mexico won’t be the only ones to benefit from the new solar power project. Santa Teresa comes under the wing of the Texas utility El Paso Electric, which has about 465,000 customers spread out over an area that covers El Paso and other parts of Texas as well as New Mexico.

The 2026 timeline beats new gas power plants by a long shot. Despite efforts by the Trump administration to support more gas power plant construction, a shortage of turbines has contributed to construction delays stretching up to seven years for new gas projects in the US.

More Solar Power For Texas, From Global Investors

In addition to the speedy delivery of clean kilowatts, Santa Teresa is also of interest because it is an interstate electricity project, which is unusual for Texas. Unlike other states, Texas has largely walled itself off from the US regional grid system. With only a few minor exceptions, Texas is dependent on in-state resources, which substantially explains why Texas grid managers and policymakers have a long track record of supporting in-state wind and solar power projects.

That’s all in the past. Today’s Republican-dominated state legislature has the knives out for renewable energy. However, as the Santa Teresa project demonstrates, renewable energy from out-of-state can still trickle in here and there.

“This Project is about more than adding solar power — it’s about delivering lasting value to the communities and businesses we serve,” a spokesperson for El Paso Electric emphasized in a press statement announcing the go-ahead for the Santa Teresa project. “By providing clean energy and added capacity to the entire region, we’re strengthening reliability, supporting sustainability and investing in future economic development growth.”

Follow The Money To A New Solar Power Project

The leading renewable energy firm DESRI is the developer behind the Santa Teresa project, and that’s of interest as well. DESRI illustrates how and why the renewable energy transition is inevitable here in the US, despite recent efforts to prop up fossil power plants. US presidents come and go, but global investment firms can stick around for decades, and the US continues to be ripe territory for solar power investors.

DESRI comes under the umbrella of the DE Shaw Group, which describes itself as “a global investment and technology development firm with more than $60 billion in investment and committed capital as of September 1, 2024.” DE Shaw has offices in Europe and Asia as well as North America. All together, the firm has 70 solar and wind projects under its belt in various stages of development, totaling 9 gigawatts.

DESRI notes that the financing for the new solar power plant in New Mexico was provided by DNB Bank ASA, New York Branch, and National Bank of Canada acting as Joint Coordinating Lead Arrangers, along with Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited, New York Branch, and Korea Development Bank. Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas also supported the financing as Administrative Agent.

Who Needs Gas When You Have Solar Plus Storage, Plus Geothermal Energy?

The US solar industry lobbied long and hard to convince Republican leadership in Congress that solar power can fulfill the nation’s growing thirst for energy, in combination with energy storage systems. That went over like a lead balloon, but shrinkage in the domestic solar industry is not necessarily going to guarantee long term growth for gas producers in the US.

One fly in the ointment is geothermal energy. Geothermal power plants are currently confined to a few scattered locations in the US, but new systems are emerging to take advantage of geothermal resources in other regions of the US, too.

Although new ESG (Enhanced Geothermal Systems) technologies have yet to crack the mainstream market, they are right on the edge and the timeline is not doing any favors for gas stakeholders.

The US startup XGS, for example, has a two-phase, water-saving, 150-megawatt advanced geothermal project underway in New Mexico. Under a partnership with Meta, the project is expected to be fully operational by 2030. That’s around the same time gas stakeholders expect their projects to crank up to speed — if they can get their hands on the turbines, that is.

The 150-megawatt project is just for starters. A recent report estimates that New Mexico holds about 160 gigawatts worth of geothermal resources within its borders, and state officials are not in a mood to just sit there and twiddle their thumbs about it. In June, New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham affirmed the state’s support for the XGS project, emphasizing the potential to attract more data centers to the state with zero-emission energy.

What Will Happen To Solar Power Now?

As for the US solar industry, under normal circumstances, the US Department of Defense could be relied upon to help support the market for solar power. After all, the Air Force in particular was an early adopter of solar during the Obama administration, attracted by the benefits of energy security and resiliency. Now that costs have dropped and the supply chain has matured, the national security case for solar power and other renewables is stronger than ever.

However, these are not normal times. A few modest USAF solar projects have popped up here and there in recent months, and the newly established Space Force has embarked on a solar research project, but today’s DoD is not exactly in hot pursuit of non-fossil fuels.

Again, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the field is clear for new gas power plants. Keep an eye on that geothermal industry. The Air Force recently prequalified a roster of geothermal firms to bid on new Defense Department contracts, with XGS among them.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/solar-power-desri.png,N,,2025-07-19 23:37:08.837126

As the global push for decarbonization intensifies, a promising climate and energy partnership is emerging between India, Taiwan and South Korea — three democracies with complementary strengths, and shared goals and growing strategic interest. The combined efforts of the three could shape Asia’s green future.

India’s energy transition is gaining momentum. It aims for 500 gigawatt (GW) of non-fossil capacity by 2030 and net zero by 2070. Solar and wind are expanding, and more than 50 percent of power capacity now comes from non-fossil sources.

However, coal still dominates, so access to clean, affordable technology is essential to stay on track without slowing development.

Taiwan faces limits due to geography and geopolitics. Dependent on imported fossil fuels, it is investing in solar and offshore wind, while targeting net zero by 2050. A carbon pricing system will launch next year, starting with heavy emitters. Taiwan’s industrial base, especially in semiconductors and energy components, is vital to global supply chain decarbonization.

South Korea also pledges to be net zero by 2050. Seoul’s Korean New Deal promotes green hydrogen, smart grids and carbon-neutral manufacturing. Climate now features in its foreign policy as an economic strategy and soft power.

What links these nations is opportunity.

India brings scale and demand; Taiwan offers industrial know-how; and South Korea contributes innovation and finance. India needs solar technology and battery systems. Taiwan seeks energy diversification and new markets. South Korea looks for hydrogen partners and secure supply chains.

India wants to reduce reliance on Chinese solar imports. Companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co could support domestic manufacturing through joint ventures, helping India expand and giving Taiwan broader market access.

Offshore wind is another shared interest. Taiwan has established a strong regulatory framework and operational projects. South Korea aims for 12GW of offshore wind by 2030. India, with a lot of coastline, is at an early stage. Collaboration on research and development, training and pilot projects could support India’s development.

Hydrogen presents long-term potential. South Korea is investing in green and blue hydrogen, vehicles and export hubs. Taiwan could become a transshipment point for Australian hydrogen. India is building electrolyzer capacity through its National Green Hydrogen Mission. A trilateral effort could advance research, safety standards and cost reduction.

Smart grids and digital energy systems offer further synergy. Taiwan and South Korea are deploying artificial intelligence-based grid management, electric vehicle infrastructure and storage. India’s “One Sun, One World, One Grid” project promotes transnational solar links. Physical integration might not be feasible, but common standards and knowledge-sharing can boost energy resilience.

Finance remains a challenge. South Korea has tested green bonds and blended finance. Taiwan’s upcoming carbon market might inform India’s evolving platform. A trilateral dialogue could explore joint financing models to reduce investment risk and support clean energy growth.

Still, obstacles remain. Taiwan’s international status complicates formal agreements, especially with India, which adheres to the “one China” policy. India is cautious of foreign influence in energy policy and has avoided Just Energy Transition Partnerships — multilateral platforms between developed and emerging economies designed to deliver climate finance that supports developing countries.

South Korea’s regional ties add complexity.

Given the constraints, informal cooperation might be more feasible. Industry bodies, think tanks and universities could drive dialogue and joint research on solar manufacturing, hydrogen standards and green finance. Platforms such as the International Solar Alliance or Clean Energy Ministerial could support engagement without political friction.

For Taiwan, such efforts enhance visibility and energy security. For India, they offer industrial growth and technology access. For South Korea, they enable diversification beyond the US-China dynamic and improve long-term energy security.

In a world increasingly shaped by climate geopolitics, India, Taiwan and South Korea could chart a cooperative low-carbon path. With shared values and complementary capabilities, collaboration on clean energy, supply chains, and climate finance can form the base of a resilient and strategic Asian partnership.",https://www.taipeitimes.com/assets/images/TaipeiTimesLogo-1200X1200px_new.jpg,N,,2025-07-19 23:36:15.482148

Indiana Emerges as Midwest Hub for Carbon Capture and Storage Development

By Richard McDonough, U.S. Correspondent

(P&GJ) — “Owing to the supply of CO2 from industrial sources, combined with the presence of multiple reservoirs and caprocks that meet the geological conditions required for injection and storage, Indiana has high potential as a candidate for CCS [carbon capture and storage] projects.”

This summary was one of the statements included in an overview of Carbon Sequestration in Indiana, in the April edition of the Indiana Journal of Earth Sciences. This overview was written by Valerie Beckman-Feller, Rachel Culver, Ashley Douds and Maria Mastalerz, members of the research staff at the Indiana Geological and Water Survey at Indiana University.

“Indiana has a large number of industrial and power facilities that could be suitable for carbon capture and storage under the right technical and economic conditions,” said Ryan Kammer, carbon management research manager at the Great Plains Institute. “Over 99% of CO2 emissions in the state are emitted by the 146 facilities that are eligible for the 45Q tax credit and span a number of industrial and power sectors, including cement, ethanol, and steel facilities, which have CO2 emissions intrinsic to their processes and will likely need carbon capture to fully decarbonize.”

According to a report from the Carbon Capture Coalition, the 45Q tax credit can be claimed when an eligible project has securely stored CO2 in appropriate geologic formations, including saline or other geologic formations or oil and gas fields. The credit can also be claimed when an eligible project has reused the captured CO2 or its precursor carbon monoxide (CO) as a feedstock, to produce low embodied carbon products such as fuels, chemicals and building materials.

These tax credits are an important aspect of CCS activities.

Much of Indiana also has potential for permanent storage in saline geologic formations, as evidenced by a number of Class VI well permits that are under review or already approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)—the sixth highest number of any state.

Indiana state agencies and universities have also been a part of several Department of Energy-funded projects, one of which ultimately led to an approved Class VI permit, the third Class VI well to be approved by the EPA.

While technical and economic considerations will be required at the site level, the potential geologic storage available in Indiana could position Indiana as a leader in the Midwest for both carbon capture and carbon storage, Kammer added.

The Class VI permit referenced is a Final Permit issued to Wabash Carbon Services by the EPA, according to the Underground Injection Control (UIC) Class VI Permit Tracker; this database was last updated on May 24.

Rulemaking Process

The rulemaking process is underway in Indiana for carbon sequestration projects. Comments are being considered for proposed rules by the Indiana Natural Resources Commission (NRC). The commission describes itself as “… an autonomous board that addresses issues pertaining to the [Indiana] Department of Natural Resources (DNR).”

Among the regulations being considered are ones for entities seeking to obtain a CO2 transmission pipeline certificate of authority, obtain a carbon sequestration project permit, administrative and procedural items regarding carbon sequestration projects and CO2 transmission pipelines, ongoing responsibilities of a storage operator, and records of a storage operator.

Rule 5, which is being considered by the commission, focuses on CO2 transmission pipelines.

A variety of requirements are included in this specific rule. For example, different levels of liability insurance would be required during the construction as well as during the operation of pipelines depending on the length of the pipelines.

“An applicant for a carbon dioxide transmission pipeline certificate of authority shall illustrate a financial ability to construct, operate and maintain a carbon dioxide transmission pipeline by giving the department documentation proving the applicant obtained the insurance required…” according to the proposed regulations.

For a pipeline not more than 20 mi in length, liability insurance would be required in the amounts of $700,000 for each person and $5 million for each occurrence.

For a pipeline longer than 20 mi in length, liability insurance would be required in the amounts of $700,000 for each person for the first 20 mi plus $12,500 for each additional mile or part of an additional mile for each person and $5 million for each occurrence for the first 20 miles plus $12,500 for each additional mile or part of an additional mile for each occurrence.

In addition to these amounts required, the proposed regulations would require an applicant for a CO2 transmission pipeline certificate of authority to maintain liability insurance while constructing, operating and maintaining a pipeline, including at least $1 million for each person and $5 million in the aggregate, as well as at least $1 million for each occurrence and $5 million in the aggregate.

The proposed regulations would require that the individual designated to manage the construction of a pipeline have minimum levels of education, experience and specific skills in pipeline design or construction, chemicals or refining.

According to the DNR, “No permits or certificates have been issued at this time by the DNR for either carbon sequestration or pipelines. After the first comment period concludes, DNR will publish a summary of the comments and responses to the summarized comments.”

The NRC indicated in a statement that it anticipates final rules will likely become effective in October of this year.

Hickory CCS Hub

Tenaska is involved in developing a CCS hub in Warren County, Indiana, which is located along the state’s border with Illinois and is west of Lafayette, Indiana. Tenaska, headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska.

Currently, the Hickory CCS Hub is in early development in western Indiana and has had several discussions with Warren County leaders, as well as with neighbors of the proposed site, according to the company.

“We believe the proposed location has the appropriate geology to support the safe, long-term storage of CO2 — and we intend to prove this out with seismic surveys and related work in support of a Class VI application,” said Bryan Crabb, the Tenaska developer on the project. Right now, our team is focused on aligning the development schedule with customer needs and timelines.”

Permanent Storage

One of the firms most active in the CCS industry in Indiana is Vault 44.01.

The firm, headquartered in Denver, Colorado, is focused on permanent geological storage of CO2 deep underground. Key members of Vault’s team have been involved in the design and implementation of CCS projects for more than 20 years, according to a statement from Vault, including projects currently operating in Illinois, Saskatchewan and Alberta.

“Our company works in partnership with industrial emitters across North America to develop CCS projects,” said Hugh Caperton, senior vice president Development of Vault. He added:

Vault is currently working with seven ethanol facilities across Indiana, Ohio and Illinois and expects to begin construction on our first project in early 2026, upon receiving approval from the EPA. We are also working with industrial partners in the power, hydrogen, forest products and cement sectors on earlier-stage CCS projects in the U.S. Midwest, U.S. Southeast and Canada.

He continued: “Vault is backed by a $300 million equity commitment from Grey Rock Investment Partners and invests alongside our industrial partners to bring CCS projects to fruition.” Grey Rock is headquartered in Dallas, Texas. Currently, four CCS projects are in process by Vault in Indiana.

Though the firm declined to identify the specific locations in Indiana, publicly available documents indicate the locations as being in Madison County, Montgomery County, Randolph County and Wabash County.

“Since inception, Vault has focused on industrial facilities with high-purity CO2 emission streams that are proximal to viable geology for permanent sequestration,” said Caperton. “This focus on near-site sequestration opportunities, in-house technical expertise, commercial flexibility and a core initiative to educate and inform stakeholders has enabled Vault to secure seven contracted projects with ethanol producers, four of which are in Indiana.”

Vault expects to place the injection wells on the ethanol plant’s property, meaning there will be no pipeline. For the fourth project, Vault plans to construct a pipeline of 3.5 mi (5.6 km) to move the CO2 away from the town.

“Vault’s four initial projects represent about 1.2 mtpa of CO2 sequestration and we anticipate our first project will reach commercial operations in 2026 with the additional facilities following in 2027 and 2028, Caperton said. “Once completed, the projects will improve the competitiveness of our partners’ ethanol plants and enable them to access new markets, benefiting the biofuels and agricultural sectors in Indiana.”

The geology of Indiana is one of the key aspects that beckons the CCS industry to the Hoosier State.

“Indiana’s geologic environment is broadly sound for CO2 sequestration and its supportive regulatory environment creates substantial opportunity for in-state development of CCS projects for Indiana’s industrial base,” Caperton said. “Conversely, despite an excellent geologic resource in Illinois, recently passed state legislation is likely to hamper development of CCS projects in the near term.”

Governmental regulatory activities affect the development of CCS projects throughout North America. Caperton indicated that the regulatory environment is welcoming in Indiana.

Future growth is likely for the CCS industry in Indiana, according to Caperton.

“As ethanol producers and other industries look to increase competitive advantages, Indiana’s early leadership position via business-friendly legislation and opportunities for rural Americans creates a desirable roadmap for many industries, states, and local communities,” he said.

Indiana’s current legislation and rulemaking for CCS provides tools for industry and project developers to develop CCS projects, placing Indiana as a leader in the Midwest for CCS development, and according to Caperton, coupled with sound geology for sequestration, stands at the forefront for both near-site sequestration development and broader scale projects with associated pipelines.

Lastly, Utility-Led Community Solar will provide grants to local utilities to offer shared solar programs to low-income households.","Georgia BRIGHT is just weeks away from launching the first of several initiatives using obligated funding from the federal Solar for All program. Starting August 4, qualifying Georgia homeowners with an income at or below 80% of the Area Median Income (AMI) for their county and household size will be able to enter a drawing to receive one of approximately 400 fully prepaid solar leases with no upfront, monthly, or ongoing maintenance costs. A second drawing for 400 more systems will be held in the spring of 2026.

“The No-Cost Solar Plan delivers on Solar for All’s goal of making solar energy available to all households, especially those in underserved communities,” said Georgia BRIGHT Director Alicia Brown. “At a time when everything is getting more expensive, this program will deliver significant savings to the households that need it most.” In most cases, participants in this program will save between 50% and 70% on their electricity bill.

On Earth Day 2024, The Georgia BRIGHT Communities Coalition, including lead applicant Capital Good Fund, along with coalition member cities, Atlanta, Savannah, and Decatur and dozens of other Georgia stakeholders, was allocated $156 million from Solar for All to bring solar to thousands of households statewide between summer 2025 and mid-2029.

Other Georgia BRIGHT Solar for All programs are also in the works. Later this summer, Georgia BRIGHT will launch a second residential initiative, the Residential Solar Savings Plan. Qualifying households will receive custom solar installations at no upfront cost, with low monthly payments that guarantee day-one savings of at least 20%, net of monthly payments. Like the No-Cost Solar Plan, the residential lease includes all maintenance as well as the option for battery storage to ensure resilience against severe weather.

The BP wind projects, already supplying power to 15 off-takers, provide immediate revenue visibility and a foundation for future growth.
As the U.S. races to meet its decarbonization goals, companies like LS Power will play a defining role.
The question is not whether renewable energy will prevail but which players will emerge as the sector's leaders.
Clearlight Energy, with its expanded footprint and strategic clarity, is poised to answer that question decisively.","The acquisition of BP's U.S. Onshore Wind Business by LS Power marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of the renewable energy sector. By integrating 1,300 MW of operating wind capacity into its portfolio company, Clearlight Energy, LS Power has not only expanded its operational scale but also reinforced its position as a cornerstone of the U.S. clean power transition. This deal, which adds to Clearlight's existing 3,000 MW of wind and solar assets, underscores a strategic alignment with the accelerating demand for reliable, low-carbon energy in an era defined by AI-driven industrial growth and decarbonization mandates.

Strategic Rationale: Diversification and Scale

The BP acquisition is more than a transaction; it is a calculated move to diversify Clearlight Energy's geographic footprint and generation mix. The 10 wind assets—spanning seven states, including Indiana, Kansas, and South Dakota—offer a blend of mature, cash-generating projects and strategic locations adjacent to existing infrastructure. This diversification reduces exposure to regional market volatility and enhances grid reliability, a critical factor as data centers and AI hubs demand 24/7 clean power.

Moreover, the acquisition complements Clearlight's existing portfolio of solar, battery storage, and transmission assets. With LS Power's broader infrastructure network—over 21,000 MW of operating capacity and 780+ miles of high-voltage transmission lines—Clearlight is uniquely positioned to address the “last-mile” challenges of delivering renewable energy to high-demand corridors. The integration of BP's wind assets also accelerates the monetization of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives, which favor projects with long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) and grid connectivity.

Market Positioning: A Platform for Long-Term Growth

Clearlight Energy's post-acquisition capacity of 4,300 MW places it among the largest renewable operators in North America. This scale is not merely a function of size but of strategic intent. By acquiring operating assets with stable cash flows, LS Power avoids the risks associated with greenfield projects, which often face permitting delays and supply chain bottlenecks. The BP wind projects, already supplying power to 15 off-takers, provide immediate revenue visibility and a foundation for future growth.

The deal also strengthens LS Power's ability to compete in a rapidly evolving market. While solar and wind remain dominant, emerging technologies like green hydrogen and long-duration storage are gaining traction. Clearlight's expanded portfolio offers a platform to integrate these innovations, particularly in regions with high renewable potential. For instance, the South Dakota Titan project (25 MW) could serve as a testbed for hybrid systems combining wind with hydrogen production, leveraging the state's abundant land and low-cost transmission.

Regulatory and Policy Tailwinds

The U.S. clean power sector is being reshaped by policy frameworks that prioritize decarbonization. The IRA's $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and green bank initiatives have unlocked capital for projects like Clearlight's, while state-level mandates—such as 100% clean energy targets in 17 jurisdictions—create a predictable demand environment. LS Power's ability to leverage these policies is a key differentiator.

However, regulatory uncertainty looms, particularly under the Trump administration, which has signaled a reevaluation of federal incentives. Clearlight's focus on operating assets, which are less reliant on future policy shifts, provides a buffer against such risks. Additionally, the company's emphasis on transmission infrastructure—a historically underappreciated asset class—positions it to benefit from the growing need to connect remote renewables to urban centers.

Investment Implications

For investors, the acquisition represents a rare confluence of strategic execution and macroeconomic tailwinds. LS Power's disciplined approach—prioritizing high-quality assets with long-term PPAs and leveraging its operational expertise—reduces the typical volatility of renewable energy investments. The company's balance sheet, supported by a AAA credit rating, further enhances its ability to fund growth without diluting shareholder value.

A critical metric to monitor is the performance of LS Power's stock relative to broader energy transition indices. shows a steady upward trajectory, reflecting market confidence in its strategic direction. Investors should also track the deployment of IRA-funded projects under Clearlight's REV Renewables platform, which manages over 21 GW of development pipelines.

Conclusion: A Blueprint for the Energy Transition

LS Power's acquisition of BP's U.S. onshore wind business is more than a transaction—it is a blueprint for how large-scale infrastructure firms can navigate the complexities of the energy transition. By combining operational excellence, strategic diversification, and policy alignment, Clearlight Energy is not just participating in the renewable revolution; it is shaping its trajectory. For investors seeking exposure to the clean energy sector, this deal offers a compelling case study in how to build long-term value in an era of rapid change.

As the U.S. races to meet its decarbonization goals, companies like LS Power will play a defining role.

In addition to slashing federal funding, the nearly 900-page bill eliminated the solar tax credit that homeowners could claim for installing solar panels on their properties.

Here’s what you need to know about the changes to the solar tax credit and how it’ll likely affect everyone — including those without solar panels.

What is the solar tax credit?

The solar tax credit, also known as the residential clean energy credit, reduces homeowners’ taxes if they install qualifying solar equipment. It essentially lets homeowners use money they would have paid in taxes to install solar energy systems. Taxpayers can claim up to 30% of the installation costs for new clean energy systems on their properties.

The incentive often makes the upfront costs of switching to renewable energy more affordable for homeowners, and it has saved Americans a lot of money. In fact, more than 1.2 million taxpayers claimed $6.3 billion with the residential energy tax credit during the 2023 tax year, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. Rooftop solar electricity systems represented 60% of those claims.

What’s changed for the solar tax credit?

The current version of the solar tax credit was introduced as part of former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which continued a tax break for homeowners who installed solar panels through 2034. The IRS planned to phase out the credit starting in 2033 rather than end it abruptly.

However, Trump’s bill ends the solar tax credit on December 31, 2025 — cutting off nine years of potential savings for consumers who were considering certain renewable energy systems. The end-of-year deadline also drastically reduces the time people have to schedule qualifying installations.

Homeowners who want to claim the solar tax credit for the 2025 tax year need to make a financial transaction before the new December 31 deadline, says Hector Castaneda, a certified professional accountant and president of Castaneda CPA and Associates. That means either paying with cash or financing the purchase ahead of the deadline.

What this means for consumers

Ending the solar tax credit can have far-reaching ramifications for consumers — even those who never planned to switch to solar panels.

More expensive solar installations

The average installation costs for solar panels was $27,720 in early 2025, according to EnergySage, an online solar marketplace. The federal solar tax credit saved homeowners an average of $8,316, dropping the price to $19,404.

But anyone purchasing solar panels for their homes after 2025 will have to rely only on state-based incentives to save money. States vary in what incentives they offer, saving some residents money upfront with sales tax exemptions, or money over time with property tax exemptions. But even combined with local tax credits and rebates for solar installations, state incentives won’t make up for the thousands of dollars in savings homeowners will lose after 2025.

To complicate matters, solar panel costs were already becoming volatile before Trump rang the solar tax credit’s death knell. Tariffs on imported solar components and equipment began affecting the industry earlier this year, creating uncertainty about supply chain reliability and affordability.

Cal Morton, owner of EasTex Solar, a solar installer serving the East Texas region, says the tariffs kicked off a turbulent market for solar companies. “It was already the craziest year that I can think of,” Morton says.

Consumers quickly began to feel the effects of an unstable market. The average cost of residential solar energy systems increased 3% between the first quarters of 2024 and 2025, according to a June 2025 Wood Mackenzie report. Prices are likely to continue to rise, making the solar market more unsteady without the solar tax credit.

Longer payback periods for new systems

Homeowners who purchase solar panels without the benefits of the solar tax credit will likely pay a higher price tag. This translates to a longer gap between solar installation and breaking even with a system’s savings, also known as the payback period.

The average payback period for solar customers was just over seven years in early 2025, according to EnergySage. But homeowners in some areas were already looking at closer to 20 years before breaking even on their purchases. Price hikes and the loss of the tax credit will likely lengthen those payback periods.

Lease, PPA and battery trends

As homeowners back away from solar panel purchases, companies that offer leases and power purchase agreements (PPAs) are likely to become the major competitors, says Chris Hopper, co-founder and chief executive officer of Aurora Solar, a software platform that streamlines the solar array design process for installers.

Homeowners might be able to still save money after 2025 by leasing solar panels or entering a PPA before July 4, 2026, when solar companies’ tax credits change. These arrangements allow homeowners to generate solar energy without purchasing the equipment, while the companies that own the equipment receive a tax break. If a company passes on that tax break to the consumer, it can lower the overall cost of the system.

Additionally, the deadline changes don’t apply to solar battery purchases. Homeowners who purchase batteries to use as storage systems, such as pairing with a new or existing solar energy system, can claim a tax credit to offset up to 50% of the cost. The credit will begin to phase out in 2034 and end on December 31, 2035.

Less solar power and higher electricity bills

The elimination of the solar tax credit comes at the same time that the U.S. energy market is experiencing a growing demand for power, Hopper says. Solar energy has been helping with that demand. It was responsible for 69% of the new electricity-generating capacity that utility companies added to the U.S. power grid in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Wood Mackenzie report from June 2025.

Although commercial solar projects can continue to see tax benefits longer than residential systems, they tend to take longer to put into operation. The lengthy timeline means less solar energy production to support the growing need for more energy in the meantime.

Energy Innovation, a non-partisan think tank specializing in energy, climate research and policy analysis, estimates that the loss of that additional energy will raise the cost of electricity for consumers.

Janice DiPietro, chief integration and customer officer at ReVision Energy, a New England-based solar company, agrees. She cites the combination of new tariffs, the loss of the solar tax credit and the increased demand for power as primary factors.

“As a result, electricity rates will increase at a faster-than-average pace,” DiPietro said by email.",https://myfox8.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/07/solar-panels-e1752866077410.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-19 23:42:45.055160

Investment Implications: A Buy for the Long Game For investors, Talen's acquisition represents a rare convergence of macro trends and operational execution.","In the summer of 2025, Talen Energy Corporation made a bold move that underscores a seismic shift in the energy landscape. By acquiring two state-of-the-art natural gas combined-cycle power plants for $3.5 billion, Talen is positioning itself at the intersection of two of the most transformative forces in the global economy: the AI-driven digital revolution and the urgent need for reliable, high-capacity power infrastructure. This acquisition isn't just a bet on energy—it's a calculated alignment with the future of technology and the infrastructure that will fuel it.

The AI-Driven Energy Boom: A New Era of Demand

The exponential growth of AI and hyperscale data centers is reshaping electricity demand. According to the International Energy Agency, data centers' global electricity consumption is projected to more than double by 2030, with AI workloads accounting for the lion's share of this surge. In the U.S. alone, data centers will drive nearly half of the country's electricity demand growth over the next seven years. The challenge? These facilities require constant, high-volume power—a requirement that renewables like solar and wind, despite their environmental benefits, cannot yet meet on their own.

Gas-fired power plants, with their ability to provide 24/7 baseload power at competitive costs, have emerged as the linchpin of this transition. In Louisiana, for instance, Entergy is investing $3.2 billion in gas plants to support Meta's AI data center, a project that will consume 2 gigawatts of power just for computation. Similar dynamics are playing out across the American South and Midwest, where utilities are prioritizing gas to meet the inflexible energy needs of AI infrastructure.

Talen's Strategic Play: Efficiency, Proximity, and Scalability

Talen's $3.5 billion acquisition of the Moxie Freedom Energy Center in Pennsylvania and the Guernsey Power Station in Ohio is a masterclass in strategic positioning. These plants, part of Caithness Energy's portfolio, are among the most efficient combined-cycle facilities in the PJM Interconnection, a key regional grid operator. The Moxie plant (1,029 MW) and Guernsey (1,875 MW) are equipped with cutting-edge GE 7HA.02 turbines, allowing them to generate power at costs lower than most peers while emitting less CO2 per unit of energy.

What makes this acquisition particularly compelling is its geographic and operational alignment with AI demand. Both plants are located near major data center hubs and have access to abundant natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale formations. This proximity reduces transmission losses and ensures a stable fuel supply—a critical advantage for data centers that cannot afford power interruptions. Moreover, the acquisition expands Talen's annual generation capacity from 40 to 60 terawatt-hours, directly addressing the surging demand from hyperscale operators and large commercial off-takers.

Financials and Strategic Rationale: A Recipe for Outperformance

Talen's management has been transparent about the acquisition's financial upside. The plants are expected to be immediately accretive to free cash flow, with over 40% per-share growth in 2026 and more than 50% by 2029. This is no small feat in an industry where capex-heavy projects often take years to justify their costs. The acquisition also complements Talen's existing nuclear and fossil fuel portfolio, creating a diversified energy mix that balances reliability with scalability.

The timing of the deal is equally strategic. It coincides with a $92 billion government initiative to expand AI infrastructure in Pennsylvania, announced just days prior. This aligns Talen with both public and private sector momentum, as tech giants like Amazon and Google increasingly seek long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) to secure stable energy supplies. Talen's recent $650 million sale of a data center to Amazon, paired with its ability to power it via its Susquehanna Nuclear Plant, further demonstrates its unique value proposition: a hybrid energy provider capable of meeting the dual demands of reliability and sustainability.

Risks and the Road Ahead: Navigating the Transition

Critics will point to the environmental risks of gas-fired plants, including methane leaks and long-term carbon lock-in. However, Talen's management is not blind to these concerns. The company has emphasized its commitment to low-carbon solutions, leveraging its nuclear assets to offset the carbon intensity of its gas fleet. Additionally, the acquisition includes provisions for future investments in carbon capture and hydrogen integration—technologies that could extend the life of these plants while reducing their environmental footprint.

The financial structure of the deal also deserves scrutiny. Talen plans to fund the acquisition with $3.8 billion in new debt, raising leverage to 3.5x by 2026. While this increases short-term risk, the projected accretion to free cash flow and the long-term demand from AI data centers provide a strong buffer. The key will be managing debt while maintaining flexibility to adapt to regulatory shifts or technological breakthroughs in renewable energy.

Investment Implications: A Buy for the Long Game

For investors, Talen's acquisition represents a rare convergence of macro trends and operational execution. The company is not merely reacting to the AI boom—it is proactively building the infrastructure that will power it. Given the projected growth in data center demand, Talen's gas plants are likely to remain in high demand for the next decade, even as the energy transition accelerates.

The stock is currently undervalued relative to its peers, offering a compelling entry point for those with a multi-year horizon. While short-term volatility is possible due to regulatory or environmental policy risks, the long-term fundamentals are robust. Talen's ability to monetize its assets through PPAs with tech giants and utilities provides a stable revenue stream, while its hybrid energy model positions it to weather the transition to a lower-carbon grid.

Conclusion: Powering the Future, One Megawatt at a Time

Talen Energy's $3.5 billion acquisition is more than a financial transaction—it's a statement of intent. By investing in gas-fired plants that are strategically located, highly efficient, and aligned with the AI-driven energy boom, Talen is securing its role as a critical player in the next phase of the digital economy.

This move affects all variants of the EQE and EQS sedans and SUVs, including those built at the company’s Tuscaloosa, Alabama plant and imports from Germany.

The automaker has informed dealers that order books for these models are now closed. Vehicles already scheduled for production before the September 1 deadline will still be built and delivered. A Mercedes-Benz USA spokesperson confirmed the decision and emphasized that the production halt only applies to U.S.-bound vehicles.

End of EV Tax Credits a Major Factor

The pause comes as the U.S. prepares to end its federal EV tax credit program on September 30, following new legislation passed under President Donald Trump’s budget plan. Notably, none of the EQ models were eligible for the credit unless leased—a factor that limited their competitiveness in the growing EV market.

Industry analysts expect a dip in electric vehicle sales once the incentives expire, particularly for higher-end models like the EQ lineup, which were already under pressure from more affordable and better-incentivized competitors.

EQ Lineup Struggles to Find Footing in the U.S.

Despite being technological showcases for the brand, the EQE and EQS struggled to resonate with American consumers. Sales of the EQS sedan and SUV dropped 52% in 2024 compared to the previous year. Feedback often centered around their divisive, streamlined styling and interiors that failed to match the luxury feel of their gasoline counterparts like the E-Class and S-Class.

Even Mercedes executives have acknowledged that the designs didn’t carry the signature Mercedes-Benz gravitas. The EQ cars, while efficient and packed with features, seemed disconnected from the brand’s core identity.

A New Strategy: Electric Versions of Familiar Models

Mercedes-Benz is now repositioning its EV efforts by moving away from standalone EQ branding. Future electric offerings will be integrated into existing model lines, reflecting a shift in design and strategy.

The upcoming electric CLA sedan and wagon, as well as a new electric GLC SUV, are expected to embody this approach. Mercedes also recently teased an electric version of the iconic G-Class, which will retain the brand’s signature look and feel while going fully electric.

“Local-for-Local” Production Flexibility Still Key

Despite the pause, Mercedes-Benz says its commitment to U.S. manufacturing remains unchanged. The company continues to rely on its flexible global production network and local-for-local manufacturing model to respond to evolving market conditions.

Final Chance for EQ Buyers?

If you’ve been considering buying a new EQE or EQS, this might be your last opportunity—at least for the foreseeable future. With the production window closing and tax credits expiring, the remaining models could soon become rare finds.

At the same time, used EQ models have seen sharp price drops, offering compelling value for those open to buying pre-owned.",https://techstory.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_0188.jpeg,N,,2025-07-19 23:35:02.785884

David McCormick this week in Pittsburgh, a state lawmaker is proposing faster permitting for data centers.

State Sen. Camera Bartolotta, R-Washington, is drafting legislation to ensure accelerated permits for data center projects that commit to equal, or higher, environmental performance. Her co-sponsorship memorandum was introduced Thursday in the state Senate, with companion legislation to be introduced in the state House of Representatives. Several Republican House members have already agreed to sponsor the House version of the bill.

“The path is clear, better environmental outcomes can be achieved when developers are empowered to innovate, design and implement advanced techniques to increase field performance,” Bartolotta wrote in her co-sponsorship memorandum. “Engineers, and artificial intelligence, can pre-determine specific air emissions generated from multiple sized power plants. If engineering stamps and site designs meet or exceed federal limits, there is no need to wait for a multi-year DEP review.”

Bartolotta’s push is being prompted by Tuesday’s summit focusing on energy and innovation in Pittsburgh helmed by Republican Sen. David McCormick and attended by President Donald Trump. The summit included dozens of top executives from companies aiming to make the city and the state a hot spot for advancements in robotics, artificial intelligence and energy. McCormick announced more than $90 billion of investments in the state — spurring tens of thousands of jobs — although some of the projects had already been in progress ahead of the summit.

“I think we have a true golden age for America. And we’ve been showing it, and it truly is the hottest country anywhere in the world,” Trump said at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, held at Carnegie Mellon University, according to the Associated Press. “I’m honored to be in Pennsylvania, and I’m honored to be in Pittsburgh. And you’re going to see some real action here. So get ready.”

Both the president and senior administration officials on Tuesday framed the investments as part of a race against China for the most advanced deployment of artificial intelligence. Before Trump spoke, his Cabinet members spoke of the need to produce as much energy as possible — especially from coal and natural gas — to beat China in the AI race for the sake of economic and national security.

“The AI revolution is upon us,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said during an earlier panel discussion, according to the Associated Press. “The Trump administration will not let us lose. We need to clean, beautiful coal. We need to do natural gas, we need to embrace nuclear, we need to embrace it all because we have the power to do it and if we don’t do it we’re fools.”

Some of the investments on a list released by McCormick’s office were not necessarily brand-new, while others were. Some involve massive data center projects — such as a $15 billion project in central Pennsylvania — while others involve building power plants, expanding natural gas pipelines, upgrading power plants or improving electricity transmission networks.

Amazon will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, while the one-time Homer City coal-fired power plant is being turned into the nation’s largest gas-fired power plant to fuel a data center campus., Constellation Energy is reopening the lone functional nuclear reactor on Three Mile Island under a long-term power supply agreement for Microsoft’s data centers.

Bartolotta’s bill will direct the state Department of Environmental Protection to generate approved earthwork, stormwater and air permits to developers who commit to improved environmental outcomes by meeting, or exceeding, design standards. An accelerated permit will enable simultaneous pursuit of additional permits and processes like Highway Occupancy Permits, Environmental Justice Permits, land use approvals and other complicated hurdles in an effort to speed up project approval. If a lawsuit is filed challenging an aspect of a data center project, the associated permit timelines shall be suspended during the legal dispute to ensure permits do not expire because of extended lawfare – something Bartolotta said has led to abandoned projects in the state.

“We need to be faster,” she said.

But those incentives are going away now that President Trump signed what he's called the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" into law on July 4.

That means in the coming months there will be ""a 'hurry-up-and-buy' 'limited-time-offer' kind of dynamic"" to get these government incentives, says Ari Matusiak, CEO of the nonprofit Rewiring America.

""If you want to access them, then really you need to get going,"" he says.

Here's what you need to know about what's happening to federal tax incentives for everything from solar panels to heat pumps to electric vehicles, and how much time you have to get that federal money.

Home solar tax credits end Dec. 31

The country's first major climate policy under the Biden administration secured at least a decade of federal tax incentives for rooftop solar panels, solar water heaters and geothermal heat pumps, says Sean Gallagher, vice president of policy for the Solar Energy Industries Association.

These technologies not only reduce climate pollution, they also make energy bills more affordable.

Scientists say that solar energy plus batteries, as well as energy-efficient appliances, are all reliable technologies that can save households money. Despite the evidence, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers wrote in an email to NPR, ""Instead of subsidizing unreliable energy sources at the expense of hardworking taxpayers, President Trump is unleashing American energy to lower costs to provide further relief for businesses and families.""

The tax credit meant homeowners could get up to 30% off the cost of installation or equipment. That tax incentive goes away Dec. 31.

Matusiak suggests that people sign a contract with a contractor and pay for and install the project before the end of the calendar year so that they can secure their eligibility for the tax credit.

Solar project installation can take a few months and some contractors can have long wait times. That's why he suggests talking to a contractor as soon as possible.

Another incentive for heat pumps and insulation ends Dec. 31

In addition to the 30% off investments in things like home solar, a federal incentive called the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit will also disappear later this year.

That credit meant up to $2,000 off heat pumps, water heaters, biomass stoves or biomass boilers on your tax bill. To qualify, appliances must have a high efficiency rating. Some manufacturer websites list tax credit-eligible equipment, as does the Energy Star Product Finder.

The tax credit also offered up to $1,200 off home upgrades like new insulation, doors and windows.

To qualify for this tax credit, it's not enough to just purchase the equipment. They must be ""placed in service"" during the calendar year — another reason Matusiak suggests moving quickly.

Federal tax credits for electric vehicles end Sept. 30

Currently, some electric vehicle buyers are eligible for a federal tax credit worth up to $7,500 for buying or leasing a new EV, and up to $4,000 for a used vehicle. That money is available as a cash rebate at the time of purchase and can be used as a down payment. (Not every buyer and not every vehicle qualifies. You can read more about these credits here.)

The new law ends those credits after Sept. 30, over the protests of auto dealers, who said such a rapid change will be disruptive. Rogers at the White House wrote in an email to NPR that ending the tax incentives will ""lower costs and incentivize Made in America products.""

Dealers are now scrambling to sell qualifying EVs on their lots before the tax credits disappear. ""This is going to be the best time to buy an EV in a long time,"" says Pat Ryan of the car-buying app CoPilot. ""But, of course, that will go away when prices effectively go up when the rebate ends.""

The nonprofit research group Resources for the Future says that its modeling suggests EV sales as a share of the total U.S. market could contract by a third with the end of the credits.

That doesn't mean the end of the EV industry, analysts say. ""Automakers have spent literally billions of dollars building out supply chains,"" says Joseph Yoon of the auto data company Edmunds. ""I don't think it's just going to turn around and say, 'Oh, well, that was a fun little experiment.'"" But it could significantly reduce the pace of EV adoption and, as a result, lock in decades worth of future carbon pollution from the gas-powered vehicles being sold today.

EV tax credits do boost EV sales, but they require a high government expenditure for each additional sale they encourage; some economic research has suggested that putting money toward chargers is a more cost-effective policy approach. The Trump administration has been working to roll back charger funding, too.

The tax-and-spending package will end a credit available to businesses and individuals to help with the costs of installing EV chargers, specifically in low-income or rural areas. That credit, which covers 30% of the installation cost, will end June 30, 2026. Separately, the Trump administration has also frozen funding to build high-speed EV chargers on highways, a move that some states are currently challenging in court.

There's still money available from some states and utilities, for now

Some local utility companies offer incentives for technologies like heat pumps, residential solar, or insulation, so experts suggest checking in with your local utility.

The country's major climate legislation in 2022 gave more than $8.5 billion to states, including Arizona, Georgia, New York and Wisconsin, to help them expand or establish rebate programs for home green technology upgrades. Much of that money is still available.

Rewiring America and another nonprofit called The Switch is On have online tools that can help people, in most states, plug in their ZIP codes and incomes to search for the federal, state, local and utility company incentives for which they're qualified. Consumers can also check for incentives at an online database from the N.C.

This week, the focus is on Sugar Creek Lavender farm, a female-owned, family-run lavender farm north of Lebanon.

At Sugar Creek Lavender Farm, the Lavender family — yes, that’s their real last name! — plants, harvests, and makes products with lavender.

“We started it four years ago,” owner Traci Lavender told News 8’s Daybreak. “My family and I…had an extra acre and we wanted to do something with that acre, so we went with lavender. My husband read about it in a hobby farming magazine and he’s like, ‘I think we can do this, you know?’”

While the farm is not yet open to the public, the Lavender family hopes to offer you-pick sessions, photo shoots, yoga classes, and tours in about two years.

In the meantime, lavender lovers can enjoy a “Learning About Lavender” presentation, sip something sweet at a Lavender Tea Tasting, or sign up for a “Make & Take” class to create their own lavender sugar scrub or lavender Play-Doh.

Sugar Creek Lavender Farm sells a number of lavender-based items on its website, including sugar scrub, body butter, eye pillows, linen spray, dryer bags, and tea blends.

“We also have the baking sugar. You can mix it in coffee or tea or lemonade, but you can also bake with it. I make scones with it, or tea breads,” Lavender explained. “We also have dryer bags. A lot of people don’t like to use lavender because there’s lots of chemicals in some of the dryer sheets. I was reading that people are using lavender, so we have four bags in there that are equivalent to 40 loads of laundry.”

If you’d rather do your shopping in person, several central Indiana shops carry the farm’s products: Indiana Gifts and Tru-Finds Treasures in Lebanon, Shop Small, Shop Handmade in Crawfordsville, and Possibilities: Homes Re-Imagined in Franklin.

This plan follows efforts by other firms, many from Gulf countries, to sign agreements to strengthen Syria’s energy and port infrastructure.
After 14 years of war, Syria’s electricity sector has been severely damaged and currently produces only 1.6 gigawatts of power compared to 9.5 GW before 2011.
In May, Syria signed a memorandum of understanding with Qatari company UCC Holding to develop power projects worth $7 billion, including four combined cycle power plants and a 1,000 MW solar power plant in southern Syria.
In a LinkedIn post on July 17, Syrian Finance Minister Yisr Barnieh announced that three American companies are forming a coalition to invest in Syria and develop the country’s energy sector.","Jonathan Bass, CEO of Argent LNG, announced on July 18 that Hunt Energy, Baker Hughes, and Argent LNG will develop a master plan for the development of Syria’s oil, gas, and energy sectors as part of a partnership aimed at restoring the energy infrastructure devastated by 14 years of civil war.

According to Reuters, this move marks a rapid shift as American companies enter a market previously subject to one of the world’s strictest sanctions regimes, lifted by former US President Donald Trump.

The companies plan to engage in exploration and production of oil and gas, as well as electricity generation to support the economy, as the Syrian government seeks to reintegrate the country into the global arena. This plan follows efforts by other firms, many from Gulf countries, to sign agreements to strengthen Syria’s energy and port infrastructure.

“We are initiating the development of a comprehensive masterplan for energy and power generation in Syria, based on a preliminary assessment of opportunities for near-term improvements in generation capacity and service delivery,” Bass told the agency by phone.

“This includes potential activities across the value chain—from exploration and production to electricity generation, including combined-cycle power plants,” he added, declining to provide further details.

After 14 years of war, Syria’s electricity sector has been severely damaged and currently produces only 1.6 gigawatts of power compared to 9.5 GW before 2011. Restoring the sector requires billions of dollars in investment, and the cash-strapped state is seeking private investors or donors to cover costs.

In May, Syria signed a memorandum of understanding with Qatari company UCC Holding to develop power projects worth $7 billion, including four combined cycle power plants and a 1,000 MW solar power plant in southern Syria.

A Clash of Interests in the Automotive Marketplace Fossil fuel interests, however, continue to loom heavily in the automotive futures background.
EV sales are at a record high, while combustion vehicle sales continue to fall.","With recent good news about EVs, we have every right to feel optimistic.

We’re ready to celebrate a tipping point for the dominance of gas cars on the road — as current vehicles are removed from service and the comfort zone with EVs increases, the goal of 30% new EV sales is within reach in Colorado and Washington State by 2026.

Used EVs are forecast to rebuild their resale value, contributing to a more robust EV marketplace.

The average transaction price of a new EV in the US has gone down by 7.4% since January 2023.

EVs have even increased utility revenues more than they have increased utility costs, leading to downward pressure on electric rates for EV-owners and non-EV owners alike.

Clearly, the transition to electric mobility contributes to the reduction of environmental pollution, which is also beneficial for public health and helps to reduce fossil energy consumption. Then why does the future for EVs so tenuous?

Barriers continue to exist that hinder mass consumer understanding and acceptance of EVs, brought to you in the US by Project 2025.

Why EVs are on the Rise in Europe

The transportation sector is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and accounts for nearly 45% of global oil demand, primarily due to the widespread use of internal combustion engine vehicles. Passenger cars account for nearly three-quarters of the sector’s emissions.

A new study by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), a comprehensive life-cycle analysis of all major powertrain types, reinforces earlier findings: only battery electric cars can deliver the large-scale emission cuts needed to address Europe’s most polluting transport mode. The study calculates that battery electric cars sold today in Europe emit nearly four times less GHGs over their lifetime than gasoline cars.

The ICCT research reveals that battery electric cars sold today produce 73% less life-cycle GHG emissions than their gasoline counterparts — even when factoring in production. The result is a 24% improvement over original 2021 estimates. In contrast, other powertrains, including hybrids and plug-in hybrids, show only marginal or no progress in reducing their climate impacts.

That means Europe’s electricity mix is getting cleaner, and, with it, the climate advantage of EVs is growing.

Of course, that data emerges from the European automotive marketplace.

US News about EVs Continues to Be Skeptical

Policy support for EVs in the US has changed significantly over the last year. Significantly, elements of the Inflation Reduction Act are being removed or threatened, and California’s ability to set its own emissions standards is weaker than it has been in the last 30 years.

Most debilitating is the sweeping tax and budget legislation approved by the US Congress that will eliminate $7,500 tax credits for buying or leasing new electric vehicles and a $4,000 used-EV credit by September 30. Those incentives sparked EV sales in recent years, and it will take savvy automobile consumers to take advantage of the credit before it expires. US businesses will suffer as well, since providing production tax credits and then pulling them so quickly afterward infuses instability into the marketplace — factories require incredible amounts of long-term planning and capital investment.

“Throwing that work and investment into the trash will make companies question whether to take a risk in the States again,” muses CleanTechnica editor, Zachary Shahan. “The US is becoming a less predictable, less stable, less trustworthy market for businesses with these coming changes, especially in the EV and solar power sectors.”

So, on one hand, it’s hard to celebrate that, by the end of 2023, thirteen states and Washington, DC had accrued more than 10% of auto sales as electric.

Then again, hope springs eternal.

EVs now draw upon numerous technological advancements made possible over the last decade.

Emissions reduction is a powerful mechanism that is increasingly informing consumer attitudes about and perceptions toward EVs.

The potential impact of the total cost of ownership (TCO) has become an important factor for consumers as they consider an EV for their next vehicle.

EVs technologies and business models are reshaping market structures, technological paradigms, and consumer behavior while markedly reducing environmental impact.

A Clash of Interests in the Automotive Marketplace

Fossil fuel interests, however, continue to loom heavily in the automotive futures background. Differences between efficient prices and retail fuel prices are large and pervasive, says the IMF. For example, 80% of global coal consumption was priced at below half of its efficient level in 2022. Full fossil fuel price reform could reduce global carbon dioxide emissions to an estimated 43% below baseline levels in 2030 (in line with keeping global warming to 1.5-2oC), while raising revenues worth 3.6% of global GDP and preventing 1.6 million local air pollution deaths per year.

Of course, the global political will to promote such fossil fuel price reform is nearly nil. Fossil fuel subsidies were $7 trillion in 2022, or 7.1% of GDP. Explicit subsidies (undercharging for supply costs) have more than doubled since 2020 but comprise only 18% of the total subsidy — 60% is due to undercharging for global warming and local air pollution.

As CleanTechnica’s Steve Hanley outlines, the Trump administration has freed manufacturers to build cars and trucks that spew more fine particulates, oxides of nitrogen, and carbon dioxide in their wake. Fracking companies no longer have to worry about turning aquifers into toxic waste because the US has an “energy emergency, which has given the fossil fuel companies a license to run roughshod over any and all environmental restrictions.”

EV adoption rates are influenced by a wide range of factors, including individual level demographics, attitudes, lifestyle preferences, perceptions of EVs capabilities, and infrastructure availability. Military action in the Middle East artificially heightens oil prices, trickling down — as always — to the consumer. High gas prices continues to spark EV consumer interest. Such global confluences have led recent EV analysts to point to five themes evolving for EVs for the remainder of 2025.

EV sales are at a record high, while combustion vehicle sales continue to fall.

EVs are increasingly global.

Low cost charging is a key enabler.

Battery innovation is making EVs increasingly desirable. Leading batteries can charge more than halfway in five minutes, and more progress could be on the horizon with safer long-range solid-state chemistries.

EVs are reducing oil demand at an exponential rate.

More and more charging points are being built, with localized mixes of home, workplace, and public chargers.

Electric buses, trucks, and freight handling equipment have proven to be less expensive to operate and maintain compared to traditional diesel-powered equipment.

The US may seem to be slipping backwards with transportation electrification, but the rest of the world has recognized the benefits of electric power and is embracing the transition to electric vehicles.

China has imposed export restrictions on technologies critical for electric-vehicle battery production to strengthen its global market dominance. The restrictions require a government license for overseas transfers of technologies used in battery manufacturing and lithium processing. The move has created uncertainty for Chinese EV makers' expansion plans, especially in light of tariffs from the EU.

Line 5 stretches from Northwestern Wisconsin to Sarnia, Ontario, including a 4.5 mile stretch on the lakebed where Lake Huron and Lake Michigan meet. The pipeline transports more than 22 million gallons of crude oil and natural gas liquids through the Great Lakes daily, raising concerns amongst environmental advocates, who warn that an oil spill would carry catastrophic consequences.

Enbridge identified gaps in the pipelines protective coating in 2014, and the pipeline was later dented in three places by an anchor strike in 2018. The pipeline company later reached an agreement with the state to consolidate the dual pipelines currently operating in the Straits of Mackinac into a new segment housed in a concrete-lined tunnel and buried below the lakebed, in hopes of containing any potential oil spills.

In order to move forward with the project, Enbridge needs approval from three agencies, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, the Michigan Public Service Commission and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

While EGLE and the Public Service Commission have both approved permits for the project, a 2024 settlement between Enbridge, EGLE and the Bay Mills Indian Community requires the company to redo its water resources permit using the results of new wetlands surveys.

EGLE opened public comment on the company’s revamped wetlands protection and Great Lakes Submerged Lands permits on July 17, with the comment period to remain open through Aug. 29, 2025.

The department will also host two meetings throughout the public notice period: an information session on Aug. 12 in a Q&A format regarding the application and EGLE’s review process and a formal public hearing on Aug. 19, where comments will be taken for the record. Additional comments can be submitted online.

During this period EGLE said it would review the application and information provided by the applicant, collect and consider public comments, continue tribal consultations and continue coordinating with other agencies and partners.

During the public notice period, EGLE said it’s common for the department to request applicants to consider additional modifications to the project and provide additional information in response to the ongoing review and in coordination with other state agencies and parties.

“Enbridge’s commitment to safeguarding the Great Lakes, natural resources, and communities continues to drive our work behind building the Great Lakes Tunnel, and locating a new, replacement section of the Line 5 pipeline inside the protection of the tunnel, deep under the lakebed,” Enbridge Spokesperson Ryan Duffy said in an email.

“We support and welcome the public comment process now underway. Public and stakeholder input is essential to the process and we look forward to hearing feedback and answering questions,” he said.

As EGLE opens public comment on the permits, members of the National Wildlife Federation are demanding the department conduct a full review of Enbridge’s proposed drilling area as required by the Great Lakes Submerged Lands Act, pointing to concerns of tunnel collapse, explosion and pollution during the construction of the Line 5 tunnel.

“The Great Lakes Submerged Lands Act is in place to safeguard the Great Lakes and our natural resources from unnecessary projects that cause harm,” Beth Wallace, the federation’s Great Lakes climate and energy director said in a statement. “Any attempt to shortcut or narrow their review will only benefit the interest of big oil, could open a wide door for other extractive industries, and would undermine the legal standards meant to protect our public waters.”

Once envisioned as a centerpiece of the state’s coastal defense strategy, the multibillion-dollar effort to reconnect the Mississippi River to its eroding wetlands will now be replaced by a scaled-down approach.

“The Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project, in its current form, is no longer financially or practically viable,” Gov. Jeff Landry said in a statement. “Since 2016, the cost of this project has doubled and is now expected to exceed the over $2 billion budget. This level of spending is unsustainable.”

The state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority has reached an agreement with federal trustees to formally end the project.

As part of the termination process, the project’s authorized budget has been slashed from $2.26 billion to $618.5 million, representing funds already distributed. Those dollars can now only be used to close out the project, according to a resolution signed by the Louisiana Trustee Implementation Group.

CPRA had been leading construction of the diversion and served as the lead implementing trustee for the project under the Natural Resource Damage Assessment program tied to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Federal officials said CPRA’s decision was driven by a mix of legal hurdles, including the suspension of a key permit by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and ongoing litigation.

Originally approved for funding in 2023, the diversion was meant to rebuild marsh in Plaquemines Parish by diverting sediment-rich water from the Mississippi River into the Barataria Basin.

However, critics argued it would devastate the region’s fisheries by flooding estuaries with fresh water and altering salinity levels vital to shrimp, oysters, and other marine life.

“Beyond the financial concerns, the MBSD threatens Louisiana’s seafood industry, our coastal culture, and the livelihoods of our fishermen — people who have sustained our state for generations,” Landry said. “We cannot continue down this broken path.”

Instead, state officials are eyeing a return to a smaller, earlier version of the project known as Myrtle Grove. That plan envisions a diversion about a quarter the size of the Mid-Barataria proposal, and CPRA has budgeted $1.6 million for its development in the agency’s 2026 annual plan.

The state also plans to construct a large land bridge in the Barataria Basin using dredged sediment, a technique seen as more compatible with existing fisheries and less dependent on uncertain long-term modeling.

“CPRA is now moving forward with another coastal restoration plan — one that balances our environmental goals with the needs of all citizens, businesses, and industries,” Landry said.

A final budget reconciliation will be prepared by CPRA and NOAA, and any remaining funds from the Mid-Barataria project will be made available for future restoration work in Louisiana.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/51/9511e101-c734-4475-84e9-3d63a2abdd89/687a936f6ec53.image.jpg,N,,2025-07-19 23:46:21.699611

American energy dominance is a phrase we hear often, one we like, and with the right strategy, it is achievable. The strategy in short: America should innovate, make energy here, and sell it globally. To counter China and achieve this dominance, we have to embrace what America already does well—innovate and build—and what we need to do better: permit energy projects and sell globally.

Innovate

America has led the world with the greatest breakthroughs in energy technology. In the 1880s, Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, which was followed by power stations and power lines. In the 1940s, as part of the Manhattan Project, American innovators generated energy from nuclear fission. The hydraulic fracturing success story began with a breakthrough by a Texas entrepreneur in the 1970s, research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) efforts supported by the Department of Energy (DOE), and tax incentives.

Home to 17 national labs, America is the world’s innovation leader. Partnering with amazing private sector developers to commercialize technology and academic institutions that are training some of the best and brightest, and the next generation of energy technology will continue to be developed in the United States, something we should never cede.

Breakthroughs for small modular nuclear reactors, fusion energy, energy storage technologies, enhanced geothermal, and more ways to capture carbon dioxide are extremely close to wide-scale deployment.

But getting these world-class technologies built and commercialized requires federal policy support. You literally can’t untangle government policy and investment with energy—you just can’t. Oil production had accelerated depreciation, and natural gas received production tax credits and US DOE support. The new technologies that make our grid more affordable, reliable, and clean need similar support.

The current DOE, the largest public financier for energy projects, is reevaluating the way it gives loans to and awards projects based on goals and economic viability rather than agendas. And Congress just gave President Donald Trump One Big Beautiful Bill with key tax incentives that allow private sector energy developers to build more.

At ClearPath, we are conservatives who believe in markets over mandates, and successful energy developers must be able to stand on their own two feet. But developing new energy technology isn’t like creating a new app for your iPhone or software in your garage. It’s capital-intensive, requiring lots of gear, concrete, steel and land. There’s an appropriate role for the federal government in supporting these innovations in the early stage, funding for demonstrations, and smart tax incentives to help companies scale from idea to deployment, just like America’s natural gas industry.

Make it Here

Yet, getting the innovation and financing in a better place doesn’t mean projects will be built—America has a world-class apparatus for getting in the way. Today, it takes longer to get an energy permit than it does to earn a college degree. The current permitting system has become a tangled mess across different federal regulatory bodies, state and local governments, and mountains of litigation. There is a big opportunity for Congress to look at how the United States currently operates its permitting system so we can continue to meet rising energy demand while complying with all laws and environmental standards.

In the administration’s energy dominance agenda, they have pushed for expedited permitting and identified permit by rule as a potential solution. That is a good first step, but for a durable solution that lets America build now and well into the future, there will need to be a change in law.

Sell it Globally

Now, let’s imagine we continue our innovation dominance, and we make it simpler for energy to be built. We can drive down costs for American consumers, but what about global energy dominance?

Without a holistic federal strategy, America would not only give China the upper hand, but we could also fritter away trillions of dollars already invested.

China’s strategy includes nuclear, oil and gas infrastructure, coal, renewable energy projects, critical minerals, and others that entrench reliance on their state-backed enterprises. In 2024, China started construction on about 94.5 gigawatts (GW) of coal capacity, nearly the same as America’s entire nuclear fleet. China also invested $940 billion in clean energy in 2024.

While we won’t, and shouldn’t out-subsidize the Chinese, America has the tools to compete. We just need to use them more effectively.

Right now, the US Development Finance Corporation makes money for the US taxpayer but can only provide up to $1 billion in loans and only $60 billion in total, compared to China’s nearly unlimited state financing. For example, raising these caps would allow the United States to finance bigger projects, like nuclear plants and critical minerals infrastructure.

There is also an opportunity to give the Export-Import Bank (EXIM) a strategic upgrade. EXIM’s existing China and Transformational Exports Program (CTEP) prioritizes strategic projects in areas where Beijing is expanding its reach, but it is overly prescriptive in scope. Creating a National Interest Account would allow EXIM to expand this effort to compete against more countries, such as Russia, in more technologies, such as nuclear energy.

Raising EXIM’s restrictive default rate cap on project financing would put US companies on a stronger competitive footing with Chinese and Russian state-owned firms, and strengthening EXIM’s support for domestic energy manufacturing could boost US supply chains.

As we embrace an energy dominance agenda, the US strategy needs to embrace our innovation engine, let American companies build, and acknowledge today’s geopolitical realities, ensuring American energy producers are competitive in the global market.

One rule, that the Trump administration is exempting about 50 polluters from, would have been expected to reduce cancer risks of people living within 6 miles of a chemical plant by 96 percent.
The Trump administration touted its decision as being supportive of fossil fuels and manufacturing.

On Thursday, the White House announced that it would exempt more than 100 plants from pollution limits established by the Biden administration.

The limits are aimed at reducing the releases of toxic chemicals, including those that cause cancer. One rule, that the Trump administration is exempting about 50 polluters from, would have been expected to reduce cancer risks of people living within 6 miles of a chemical plant by 96 percent.

The Trump administration touted its decision as being supportive of fossil fuels and manufacturing.

“President Trump recognizes that overly restrictive environmental regulations undermine America’s energy reliability, economic vitality, and national security,” said a White House fact sheet.

However, the move also stands in contrast with the administration’s pledge to “Make America Healthy Again.”

“Trump’s action on behalf of big corporate polluters will cause more cancer, more birth defects, and more children to suffer asthma. The country deserves better,” said Patrice Simms, vice president of litigation at Earthjustice’s Healthy Communities Program, in a written statement.

The administration issued four proclamations exempting the total of more than 100 facilities from one of four rules for two years.

One proclamation exempts about 40 medical device sterilizing plants from requirements to reduce 90 percent of their emissions of cancer-causing ethylene oxide.

Another exempts more than 50 chemical manufacturers and oil refineries from requirements to cut emissions of toxic chemicals including ethylene oxide and another cancer-linked chemical called chloroprene.

A third proclamation exempts eight producers of taconite ore, which is used to make steel, from requirements to reduce mercury emissions by about 33 percent. Fetal exposure to mercury is linked to brain and nervous system damage.

The fourth proclamation exempts six coal plants from restrictions on releases of mercury, nickel, arsenic and lead. The Biden-era rule in question was expected to reduce exposure to substances that can cause developmental delays in children, as well as heart attacks and cancer.

The Trump administration has already said that it plans to overturn a wide swath of rules aimed at reducing pollution, and so by the time the two-year exemptions expire, the rules in question may no longer be in place.

This week’s proclamations are the second publicly announced set of exemptions issued by the Trump administration.

Trump previously exempted 66 coal plants from the standard limiting mercury, lead, nickel and arsenic emissions.

The decisions come after a March move from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set up a portal allowing polluters to request exemptions from nine Clean Air Act rules.

At the time, an EPA spokesperson noted that the Biden administration had previously said it would consider exempting facilities from the ethylene oxide rule to prevent disruptions to supply chains for medical devices.

However, critics described the portal as an “invitation” for companies to pollute.",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/07/epa_020325gn06_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-19 23:45:01.168290

Analysts warn that strategy could undermine those countries’ long-term climate ambitions and energy security.

Buying more U.S. LNG has topped the list of concessions Asian countries have offered in talks with Washington over President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on foreign goods. Vietnam’s Prime Minister underlined the need to buy more of the super-chilled fuel in a government meeting, and the government signed a deal in May with an American company to develop a gas import hub. JERA, Japan’s largest power generator, signed new 20-year contracts last month to purchase up to 5.5 million metric tons of U.S. gas annually starting around 2030.

U.S. efforts to sell more LNG to Asia predate the Trump administration, but they’ve gained momentum with his intense push to win trade deals.

Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid form for easy storage and transport that is used as a fuel for transport, residential cooking and heating and industrial processes.

Trump discussed cooperation on a $44 billion Alaska LNG project with South Korea, prompting a visit by officials to the site in June. The U.S. president has promoted the project as a way to supply gas from Alaska’s vast North Slope to a liquefication plant at Nikiski in south-central Alaska, with an eye largely on exports to Asian countries while bypassing the Panama Canal Thailand has offered to commit to a long-term deal for American fuel and shown interest in the same Alaska project to build a nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would funnel gas from

The Philippines is also considering importing gas from Alaska while India is mulling a plan to scrap import taxes on U.S. energy shipments to help narrow its trade surplus with Washington.

“Trump has put pressure on a seeming plethora of Asian trading partners to buy more U.S. LNG,” said Tim Daiss, at the APAC Energy Consultancy, pointing out that Japan had agreed to buy more despite being so “awash in the fuel” that it was being forced to cancel projects and contracts to offload the excess to Asia’s growing economies.

“Not good for Southeast Asia’s sustainability goals,” he said.

LNG deals could derail

renewable ambitions

Experts say LNG purchasing agreements can slow adoption of renewable energy in Asia.

Locking into long-term deals could leave countries with outdated infrastructure as the world shifts rapidly toward cleaner energy sources like solar or wind that offer faster, more affordable ways to meet growing power demand, said Indra Overland, head of the Center for Energy Research at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs.

Building pipelines, terminals, and even household gas stoves creates systems that are expensive and difficult to replace–making it harder to switch to renewables later. “And you’re more likely then to get stuck for longer,” he said.

Energy companies that profit from gas or coal are powerful vested interests, swaying policy to favor their business models, he said.

LNG burns cleaner than coal, but it’s still a fossil fuel that emits greenhouse gases and contributes to climate change.

Many LNG contracts include “take-or-pay” clauses, obliging governments to pay even if they don’t use the fuel. Christopher Doleman of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis warns that if renewable energy grows fast, reducing the need for LNG, countries may still have to pay for gas they no longer need.

Pakistan is an example. Soaring LNG costs drove up electricity prices, pushing consumers to install rooftop solar panels. As demand for power drops and gas supply surges, the country is deferring LNG shipments and trying to resell excess fuel.

The LNG

math doesn’t add up

Experts said that although countries are signaling a willingness to import more U.S. LNG, they’re unlikely to import enough to have a meaningful impact on U.S. trade deficits.

South Korea would need to import 121 million metric tons of LNG in a year — 50% more than the total amount of LNG the U.S. exported globally last year and triple what South Korea imported, said Doleman. Vietnam — with a trade surplus with the U.S. twice the size of Korea’s — would need to import 181 million metric tons annually, more than double what the U.S. exported last year.

Other obstacles stand in the way. The Alaska LNG project is widely considered uneconomic. Both coal and renewable energy in Asia are so much cheaper that U.S. gas would need to cost less than half its current price to compete. Tariffs on Chinese steel could make building building gas pipelines and LNG terminals more expensive, while longstanding delays to build new gas turbines mean new gas power projects may not come online until 2032. Meanwhile, a global glut in LNG will likely drive prices lower, making it even harder for countries to justify locking into long-term deals with the United States at current higher prices.

LNG deals raise energy security concerns

Committing to long-term U.S. LNG contracts could impact regional energy security at a time of growing geopolitical and market uncertainties, analysts said.

A core concern is over the longterm stability of the U.S. as a trading partner, said Overland. “The U.S. is not a very predictable entity. And to rely on energy from there is a very risky proposition,” he said.

LNG only contributes to energy security when it’s available and affordable, says Dario Kenner of Zero Carbon Analytics.

“That’s the bit that they leave out … But it’s pretty important,” he said.

This was the concern during the recent potential disruptions to fuel shipments through the Strait of Hormuz and earlier during the war in Ukraine, when LNG cargoes originally destined for Asia were rerouted to Europe. Despite having contracts, Asian countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were outbid by European buyers.

“Events in Europe, which can seem very far away, can have an impact on availability and prices in Asia,” Kenner said.

Asian countries can improve their energy security and make progress toward cutting carbon emissions by building more renewable energy, he said, noting there is vast room for that given that only about 1% of Southeast Asia’s solar and wind potential is being used.

“There are genuine choices to meet rising electricity demand. It is not just having to build LNG,” he said.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.lockhaven.com/images/2025/07/18110235/AP25190256970594-753x500.jpg,N,,2025-07-19 23:46:58.607289

As per Bloomberg, the $200 million facility, located in Soperton, Georgia, was initially scheduled to begin production last year.

Chief Executive Officer Jimmy Samartzis confirmed the revised timeline in an interview, attributing the most recent delay to equipment issues not related to the core technology. “My hope is that by the end of the third quarter we are fully operating,” he said.

Advt

“The modifications we made to the equipment that was hindering us, unrelated to the technology itself, should satisfy what we need.”

Funding and regulatory hurdles

LanzaJet received funding from the US government to develop the plant, which is being watched as a test case for the broader ethanol-to-jet fuel sector.

Although the company imported Brazilian sugar-cane ethanol in 2023 to pilot production, it has not yet sold any of its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on the open market.

Production will begin using Brazilian ethanol, despite the company being ineligible for the Inflation Reduction Act’s 45Z tax credit.

Under current rules, only SAF made from North American feedstocks qualifies, and the ethanol must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 per cent. Most US corn-based ethanol does not meet this threshold.

“There is only a scant amount of US product that meets the required threshold,” Samartzis said. He added that LanzaJet plans to transition to American feedstocks and is advocating for a lower emissions-reduction requirement of 30 per cent.

Tribal Tax and Investment Reform Act of 2025 As previously discussed, the OBBB included one provision aimed at providing tax parity to Tribal governments related to the Adoption Tax Credit.","Signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) contains extensive revisions to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (Code). (For a comprehensive analysis of the bill, see Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""Trump Signs the One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" July 3, 2025.) Although few provisions directly reference Tribal governments or their members, several could impact Indian Country. Work also remains because, with the OBBB, Congress failed to address longstanding Tribal tax priorities.

This Holland & Knight alert offers an overview of several provisions included in the OBBB that will likely impact Tribal governments and their members. Following that overview is a brief description of several Tribal tax priorities that remain pending before the U.S. Congress.

Adoption Tax Credit Parity Provision

Section 23 of the Code provides a tax credit to parents for certain adoption expenses, including adoption fees, court costs and attorney fees (Adoption Tax Credit). Individuals who adopt a child with a special need are often eligible for the full credit even if they pay no adoption expenses that would qualify for the credit. Before the OBBB's passage, only states could determine that a child had a special need. Under the OBBB, Tribal governments now have the same authority to determine that a child has a special need for purposes of the Adoption Tax Credit. This increases access to the full Adoption Tax Credit for taxpayers who adopt a child when a Tribal government has determined that the child has a special need, correcting a longstanding Tribal parity issue in the Code. This provision was included in the Tribal Tax and Investment and Reform Act of 2025 (discussed below) and is the only provision from that bill to be included in the OBBB.

New Tax Deduction for Seniors

Under the OBBB, taxpayers aged 65 and older are entitled to a new deduction of up to $6,000. The new deduction begins phasing down when the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income exceeds $75,000 (or $150,000 in the case of a joint return). This new deduction goes into effect for the 2025 tax year and will sunset at the end of 2028.

Deduction for Tipped Workers and Overtime Pay

The OBBB offers tax relief to many tipped workers and those who earn overtime pay. Under the OBBB, both provisions will sunset at the end of 2028.

Deduction for Tipped Workers

The OBBB created new Section 224 of the Code. Under Section 224, individuals who receive cash tips in an occupation that ""customarily and regularly received tips"" as of the end of 2024 may claim a deduction of up to $25,000. The new law does not provide a definition for occupations that ""customarily and regularly received tips;"" however, it requires that the U.S. Department of the Treasury issue a list of occupations that customarily and regularly received tips as of the end of 2024.

The new deduction for tipped workers begins phasing down when the tipped worker's modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000 (or $300,000 in the case of a joint return). The deduction is only allowed for qualified tips that are included on a W-2 or information statement furnished to the individual by their employer showing the portion of payments reasonably designated as cash tips and the occupation of the person receiving such tips. Employers should take notice of this requirement, as it will require changes to information statements.

To qualify for this deduction, individual taxpayers must have a Social Security number. Additionally, if married, individuals must file their taxes on a joint return.

Given that many Tribal governments employ tipped workers at casinos, restaurants and other establishments, this new law could be very beneficial. However, tribes and their casinos that have tip agreements with the IRS should consider potential implications.

Deduction for Overtime Pay

The OBBB also provides for a new deduction of up to $12,500 (or $25,000 in the case of a joint return) for ""qualified overtime compensation"" received by an individual. New Section 225 of the Code defines ""qualified overtime compensation"" as overtime compensation paid to the individual that is required under Section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.

Similar to the tipped worker deduction, the overtime pay deduction begins phasing down when an individual's modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000 (or $300,000 in the case of a joint return). For an individual to claim the deduction, his or her employer must also include the portion of any payments that are qualified overtime compensation on a W-2 or information statement furnished to the individual. Additionally, as with the tipped worker deduction, individuals must have a Social Security number and, if married, they must file their taxes on a joint return.

Provisions Affecting the New Markets Tax Credit, Low-Income Housing Tax Credits and Opportunity Zones

The OBBB permanently extends the New Markets Tax Credit and permanently renews Opportunity Zones. It also increases allocations for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, as well as modifies Opportunity Zones by imposing stricter eligibility requirements and providing enhanced benefits for rural investments. These programs have incentivized investments in economically distressed areas, including many Tribal lands. As such, Tribal governments may wish to consider how the OBBB's provisions related to these programs may benefit Tribal communities.

Rescissions of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Funds

The OBBB additionally repeals unobligated funds from the IRA for a host of federal programs, including the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program. Under that program, the U.S. Department of Energy secretary could provide loan guarantees to federally recognized tribes for amounts due on loans for energy development projects. The OBBB eliminates funding from numerous other programs funded under the IRA, including grant programs for transmission deployment and siting. Additionally, the OBBB scales back many of the IRA's clean energy tax credits and incentives, which Tribal governments had increasingly explored due to the availability of direct pay.

Further information about these and other similar changes is provided in Holland & Knight's Comprehensive Analysis of the OBBB, as well as Holland & Knight's previous alert on the OBBB's impacts on IRS clean energy tax credits.

Modifications to Gambling Tax Law

The OBBB also reduces the amount of gambling losses individuals may deduct on their annual tax returns. Under previous law, individuals could deduct 100 percent of their gambling losses up to the extent of their gambling winnings. Following the OBBB's passage, individuals may only deduct up to 90 percent of their losses as of the 2026 tax year.

To demonstrate how this change may affect taxpayers, consider, for example, an individual who has $100,000 in gains from gambling and $100,000 in losses from gambling. Previously, under Section 165(d) of the Code, that individual could fully deduct all $100,000 of his or her gambling losses, leaving the individual with a $0 net effect. Beginning in 2026, that same individual is limited to a deduction of $90,000 (90 percent of $100,000), leaving the individual with $10,000 of tax gain from gambling despite having no economic gain. This change may increase taxes on frequent and professional gamblers and could carry with it implications for Tribal casinos.

Tribal Tax and Investment Reform Act of 2025

As previously discussed, the OBBB included one provision aimed at providing tax parity to Tribal governments related to the Adoption Tax Credit. However, a number of Tribal tax priorities remain unaddressed.

Introduced by Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), the Tribal Tax and Investment Reform Act of 2025 (S. 2022) includes Tribal government parity provisions in the areas of tax-exempt bond financing, excise tax exemptions, employee plan administration, tribal charity funding and child support enforcement, among others. Below is a discussion of three of S. 2022's proposed changes.

Tax-Exempt Bonds

Specifically, the bond reforms would address certain limits on Tribal governments' ability to issue tax-exempt bonds under the Indian Tribal Governmental Tax Status Act of 1983 and current Section 7871 of the Code. Essentially, current law prohibits Tribal governments from issuing tax-exempt private activity bonds in most circumstances, and it limits tax-exempt bond status to bonds when ""substantially all"" of the proceeds from their issuance will be issued in the ""exercise of any essential governmental function."" Currently, Section 7871(e) provides that ""essential governmental function(s)"" do not include ""any function which is not customarily performed by State and local governments with general taxing powers.""

2022 would amend Section 7871 to remove many restrictions placed on Tribal governments' ability to issue tax-exempt private activity bonds. It would also eliminate the ""essential government function"" test, providing Tribal governments with increased access to tax-exempt financing opportunities for commercial projects. This would provide additional parity with state and local governments that already have access to these types of tax-exempt financing opportunities.

Pensions

Next, certain pension reforms included in S. 2022 would expand the definition of a ""governmental plan"" to include plans established by entities ""wholly owned or controlled"" by Tribal governments and would eliminate the essential governmental function test currently in Section 414(d) of the Code. This change – and other similar changes proposed in S. 2022 – should help ensure that more types of pension and employee benefits for Tribal entity employees are administered in the same manner as benefits provided to employees of state governments, providing parity for Tribal governments while reducing administrative burdens.

Social Security Benefits

Tribal governments should also take note of the impact this legislation would have on Indian General Welfare Benefits programs. Notably, S. 2022 includes provisions that would impact how these benefits are treated by the Social Security Administration, including for purposes of determining eligibility for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). If enacted, S. 2022 would exclude Indian General Welfare Benefits from counting as ""income"" for the purpose of determining eligibility for SSI, as well as certain Medicaid programs and benefit programs administered by states. Additionally, it would exclude any Indian General Welfare Benefits from counting as ""resources"" for the purpose of determining SSI eligibility for the nine-month period after the General Welfare Benefit is received. Tribal governments with minors' trusts would also benefit, as grantor trusts for which the tribe is the grantor would be excluded from resources for SSI purposes.

Tribal governments should lend their support to S. 2022 as it would have broad implications for their members, help lift up their economies and reduce administrative burdens.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14849_2738.jpg,N,,2025-07-19 23:40:06.992640

In the end, the tariffs are a catalyst—a forced march toward a more secure, though more expensive, battery supply chain.","The U.S. Commerce Department's imposition of a 93.5% anti-dumping tariff on Chinese graphite—coupled with existing duties—has created an effective 160% barrier for Chinese imports. This aggressive trade action, part of a broader effort to decouple from China's grip on critical minerals, is reshaping the global battery material landscape. For investors, the ripple effects of this policy shift are both immediate and long-term, offering opportunities in North American and global graphite producers as the EV industry scrambles to diversify its supply chains.

The Tariff Shockwave: A 160% Hurdle for Chinese Graphite

Chinese graphite has long dominated the market, with the country controlling over 85% of anode active material production. The U.S., which imports nearly 180,000 metric tons annually (two-thirds from China), now faces a steep cost increase for battery-grade graphite. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has warned that this critical material is among the most exposed to supply risks, and the tariffs are accelerating efforts to diversify sourcing.

The 160% effective tariff—combining anti-dumping, countervailing, and legacy Trump-era duties—has already triggered market volatility. Shares of Syrah Resources Ltd. (SYR.AX), a key Australian graphite producer, surged 38% on the news, while South Korean battery material firm Posco Future M (006390.KS) rose 24%. These moves reflect investor anticipation of reduced Chinese competition and a scramble to secure alternative suppliers.

North American Producers: A New Era of Opportunity

The U.S. lacks domestic natural graphite mining and relies entirely on imports, but the tariffs are catalyzing investment in domestic production. Companies like Westwater Resources Inc. (WSTH) and NOVONIX (NVX.AX) are positioning themselves to fill the gap. Westwater, constructing a 12,500-tonne-per-year plant in Alabama, plans to scale up to 50,000 tonnes by 2028. NOVONIX, already operating the most advanced synthetic graphite facility in North America, is expanding its Tennessee plant to meet surging demand.

Canadian firms are also capitalizing on the shift. Nouveau Monde Graphite (NMG.T) and Northern Graphite (NGC.T) have seen significant stock gains as they position themselves as low-carbon, high-purity alternatives. Canada's geological endowment and existing infrastructure make it a prime candidate for scaling graphite production, particularly as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) offers tax credits for materials sourced from allied nations.

Global Diversification: Beyond North America

While North America is the primary beneficiary, the tariff-driven reshuffling is also creating opportunities in other regions. Japan's JX Nippon Mining and South Korea's SK On are expanding their refining capabilities to capture a larger share of the U.S. market. African nations like Madagascar and Brazil, with untapped graphite deposits, are also emerging as potential suppliers.

However, challenges remain. U.S. automakers like Tesla (TSLA) and Panasonic (6752.T) argue that domestic producers still lack the capacity to meet quality and volume demands. Tesla's stock dipped 0.7% after the tariff announcement, reflecting investor concerns over near-term costs. The company has warned that establishing a self-sufficient U.S. graphite supply chain could take 5–7 years and require $12–15 billion in investment.

Investment Strategy: Balancing Risk and Reward

For investors, the key lies in hedging between short-term volatility and long-term structural shifts. Here's how to navigate the opportunities:

Prioritize Producers with Proven Capacity: Companies like NOVONIX and Syrah Resources already have the technology and scale to meet EV-grade requirements. Their expansion timelines align with the 2028–2030 demand forecasts.

Monitor Geopolitical Developments: The final tariff determination in December 2025 could adjust rates, affecting stock valuations. Watch for policy signals from the U.S. Treasury and Commerce Department.

Diversify Regional Exposure: While North American producers are the most obvious beneficiaries, South Korean and Canadian firms offer lower risk due to their established supply chain ties and regulatory alignment with the U.S.

Consider ESG Metrics: The IRA prioritizes sustainable sourcing. Firms like Nouveau Monde Graphite, which emphasize low-carbon processing, are better positioned to qualify for tax credits.

Conclusion: A Resilient Future for the Battery Supply Chain

The U.S. anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese graphite are more than a trade maneuver—they are a strategic pivot toward supply chain resilience. While the immediate costs for EV manufacturers are steep, the long-term goal of reducing reliance on China is clear. Investors who align with this vision will find fertile ground in North American and allied producers, as well as in companies pioneering alternative anode materials. The graphite supply chain is no longer a monoculture; it is evolving into a diversified ecosystem, and those who adapt will thrive.

In the end, the tariffs are a catalyst—a forced march toward a more secure, though more expensive, battery supply chain. For the right investors, this is not a crisis but an opportunity to bet on the next phase of the EV revolution.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-19 23:40:11.794312

It was set for July 14 — about a month after MDE issued the permit, according to MDE’s website.
Trump’s EPA flags a problem with offshore wind permit issued by Maryland That letter also cites written decisions issued by the EPA’s appeals board, including one that stated that the board “lacked jurisdiction” to evaluate this type of permit.
The US Wind project, which is planned about 10 miles from Ocean City’s shoreline, is the wind project that is closest to construction in this region.
Since President Donald Trump (R) took office for his second term, offshore wind projects have landed in his crosshairs.","The Maryland Department of the Environment is defending the permit it issued to a wind farm proposed off the coast of Ocean City, after a challenge from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The Thursday letter from Maryland Secretary of the Environment Serena McIlwain also said the state would not be reissuing the permit, as the EPA requested, because the state had not made a mistake that needed correcting.

The EPA had contended that when Maryland issued the permit to Baltimore-based company US Wind, it identified the wrong process for citizens to file appeals.

Amy Van Blarcom-Lackey, EPA administrator for Region 3, which includes Maryland and other mid-Atlantic states, contended in a July 7 letter that any appeals challenging the air pollution permit issued to US Wind should be filed to the clerk of the EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board.

But Maryland argues that its permit would need to be appealed through the state courts, which would involve filing a challenge at the appropriate circuit court — in this case in Worcester County.

Notably, the due date for a state court challenge has already passed. It was set for July 14 — about a month after MDE issued the permit, according to MDE’s website.

“Long-settled procedure dictates that state-issued permits are appealed under State law, not Federal law,” McIlwain’s letter says.

Trump’s EPA flags a problem with offshore wind permit issued by Maryland

That letter also cites written decisions issued by the EPA’s appeals board, including one that stated that the board “lacked jurisdiction” to evaluate this type of permit.

“MDE will not re-issue the permit and will continue to follow the proper state procedures to consider appeals,” McIlwain concluded, near the end of the roughly two-page letter.

In an emailed response, the EPA stuck to its guns. An EPA spokesperson said the agency had notified MDE that the final permit decision “contains an error, with clear guidance on next steps. But they don’t seem to care about complying with legal requirements.”

The MDE website for the US Wind project originally referenced both the state appeals procedure and the EPA process, but McIlwain said that information had been “included at EPA’s request. It has been removed, and language has been added clarifying that the Federal appeals process does not apply.”

Authority to issue Clean Air Act permits like the one for US Wind is delegated to the state from the EPA — the basis of the federal agency’s claim for jurisdiction for appeals. That authority, specifically for permits on the outer continental shelf, was re-certified in early 2024 under the Biden administration.

The US Wind project, which is planned about 10 miles from Ocean City’s shoreline, is the wind project that is closest to construction in this region. The company, which leased the area in 2014, received a key permit from President Joe Biden’s (D) Department of the Interior at the end of 2024.

Final buildout of the project is still years away, but it calls for construction of 121 wind turbines, up to four offshore substations and one meteorological tower, according to the state’s website. When complete, the project could generate 2,200 megawatts of energy, enough to power up to 718,000 homes, according to the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.

Practically since its inception, the project has faced fierce opposition from local officials in the resort town, who cite concerns that beachgoers would lose a pristine ocean view if the turbines were visible from shore.

Since President Donald Trump (R) took office for his second term, offshore wind projects have landed in his crosshairs. Earlier this week, Trump announced that wind and solar projects would undergo increased scrutiny under his administration. Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” also rescinds tax credits for renewable energy projects that do not begin construction by next July.

In April, Trump appointed Blarcom-Lackey to lead the EPA’s Mid-Atlantic office. She succeeded Marylander Adam Ortiz, who moved to a deputy secretary role at MDE.

Two other companies have offshore leases in the vicinity of Ocean City and the Delaware beaches — Ørsted and Equinor. While Ørsted received its first lease area around the same time as US Wind, Equinor won its auction last year. Neither project have received its federal permits from the Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.

The announcement was made by Albany County’s economic development chief during the July meeting of the county IDA, when Kevin O’Connor told attendees the closeout was formally “funded” with the receipt of Atlas Copco’s administrative fee earlier this month.

This transaction is tied to a necessary legal step whereby Atlas Copco temporarily gives up legal ownership of its property to the IDA, which in turn leases the land back to the company in exchange for substantial tax savings. The arrangement is a typical development-agency transaction.

The deal nets Atlas Copco a little under $2 million in tax benefits.

The project was put on hold in March because of the “election back in November,” O’Connor said during the June meeting of the county IDA, alluding to Donald Trump’s presidency, which he said was followed by the company’s desire “to see how things shaped out.”

The time allowed Atlas Copco to cut “back on some ancillary things,” O’Connor said, which lowered the project cost from $40 million to $32 million.

With costs shrinking, the company’s sales-tax exemption was adjusted from $1,625,625 to $1,375,000, with the real-property-tax exemption decreased from $734,000 to $670,000 — the property tax abatement, $21,000 per $1 million of assessed value, is spread out over 10 years. The company’s annual Payment In Lieu Of Taxes (PILOT) over that time will be $221,550.

The downward revision also affected a grant the company received as part of Albany County’s Sustainable Technology and Green Energy (STAGE) program, which went from $500,000 to $475,000.

The company is also eligible to receive back 30 percent of the project’s total cost. This is because of tax credits through the federal Department of Energy, made possible by passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

Decarbonization

The expansion of its School Road manufacturing facility will allow Atlas Copco to fill a void in the decarbonization marketplace.

The company’s compressors are used in the carbon-capture and sequestration (CSS) processes employed by American industries such as ethanol production, cement manufacturing, and power generation. With CSS, these industries are able to reduce climate-changing greenhouse gasses by capturing the carbon dioxide emissions and permanently storing it underground.

But the growth of the CCS industry has been hampered by a lack of domestic manufacturing capacity, particularly when it comes to the type of large-scale compressors made by Atlas Copco.

“In the decarbonization, carbon capture, and carbon sequestration markets, these are brand new. They didn’t exist 10 years ago. They didn’t really exist five years ago except in some pilot plants. Now it’s a full-blown industry across the heartlands where ethanol was made,"" Randy Dirlam, Atlas Copco’s Voorheesville general manager, told members of the village planning commission in April of last year.

To meet this demand, the company needed to build a facility not allowed by village code.

The village zoning board in June 2024 approved a variance to allow for an addition to the existing building to be built 20 feet higher than the 40 feet allowed by zoning. The facility’s 101,000-square-foot footprint will expand by 50,000 square feet, where zoning allows only for 20,000 square feet.

Costs

The breakdown of $32,835,000 in costs includes:

— Buildings: $24,500,000;

— Machinery and equipment costs: $7,715,000;

— Utilities, roads, and accessory costs: $270,000; and

— Architects and engineering fees: $350,000.

Per the company’s IDA application, Atlas Copco incurred another $291,000 in costs due to advanced engineering and environmental studies.

The project saw reductions from:

— The acquisition and installation of solar panels being delayed, resulting in an approximate $2 million reduction;

— The equipment budget being reduced from $11.1 million to $7.7 million due to a reduction in overhead cranes; and

— Not updating office spaces, $2 million.

The project, according to Atlas Copco’s IDA application, will add 55 full-time positions with a salary range between $50,000 and $115,000.

There are currently 248 full-time employees on School Road, 35 of which would have been “lost without this because of competitive pressures,” according to O’Connor.",https://altamontenterprise.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/copy_of_ready_to_start_imgm7513_copy.jpg?itok=sjH8AS-o,N,,2025-07-19 23:40:18.134894

The report also links energy policy directly to AI competitiveness, citing projections that U.S. data centers will consume more electricity by 2030 than all energy-intensive goods manufacturing combined.
“There is no AI without energy,” it warns, quoting the International Energy Agency.
Four executive orders signed in May direct reforms at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and aim to quadruple U.S. nuclear capacity by 2050.
“Affordable, reliable, and sustainable electricity supply will be a crucial determinant of AI development,” the report states.","The White House Council of Economic Advisers on Thursday released a report highlighting the Trump Administration’s energy strategy, projecting that policies aimed at “unleashing American energy” could raise U.S. GDP by as much as 1.9% by 2035 and support national security, energy affordability, and emerging technologies like artificial intelligence.

The report argues that revitalizing domestic oil, gas, coal, and nuclear production — combined with regulatory reform and infrastructure investment— can strengthen the U.S. economy while meeting the surging energy needs of AI-driven data centers and reshored manufacturing.

“The United States is blessed with a wealth of natural resources,” the report states. “Enacting policies that make the most of U.S. resource abundance and promote U.S. energy dominance can meaningfully contribute to economic growth and consumer welfare.”

The White House credited President Trump’s executive actions, including faster permitting, resumed federal leasing, support for advanced nuclear reactors, and grid modernization efforts, for laying the groundwork for increased production and investment.

According to the analysis, energy-focused policies could increase GDP by:

25% to 0.67% from deregulation alone.

03% to 0.13% from removing restrictions on offshore oil commingling.

025% to 0.11% annually from expanded production on federal lands.

At least 0.03% from increased liquefied natural gas exports.

The report also links energy policy directly to AI competitiveness, citing projections that U.S. data centers will consume more electricity by 2030 than all energy-intensive goods manufacturing combined.

“There is no AI without energy,” it warns, quoting the International Energy Agency.

The report notes that just one ChatGPT prompt can be ten times more energy-intensive than a Google search.

To meet this growing demand, the administration has proposed an “all-of-the-above” strategy, with special emphasis on expanding nuclear power. Four executive orders signed in May direct reforms at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and aim to quadruple U.S. nuclear capacity by 2050.

“Rapid growth of low-cost domestic baseload generation is essential to compete for AI dominance,” the report states, noting that China is already building 150 new nuclear reactors and could become the world’s largest nuclear power producer by 2030.

The White House also used the report to tout the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act”, which ends tax credits for wind, solar, and electric vehicles while expanding credits for biofuels, hydrogen, hydropower, and carbon capture.

The bill also appropriates funds to rebuild the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and build out grid reliability.

In a warning about overreliance on renewables without adequate backup, the report cites a major blackout in parts of Europe earlier this year caused by a sudden drop in solar generation, calling it “a concerning example of some critical flaws of renewable energy.”

To stabilize prices and supply, the administration advocates for delaying the retirement of coal and nuclear plants and interconnecting U.S. regional power grids.

“Even during hours of normal operation,” the report notes, “arbitraging regional price differences could lead to cost savings.”

The report concludes that small modular reactors could play a vital role in meeting data center needs. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are already exploring co-locating data centers with SMRs.
