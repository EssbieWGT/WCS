Related: Would You Buy An EV After The Tax Credit Expires?

President Trump’s decision to axe the previous Biden administration’s $7,500 of tax credits against an EV purchase means the nationwide subsidies will cease at the end of this month. Some Californians, clean air campaigners, and several automakers had hoped Newsom would step in to offer state aid to replace the federal incentives, something he himself had previously pledged. But last week, he told reporters it was unaffordable.

No Safety Net from Sacramento

“We can’t make up for the federal vandalism of those tax credits [by the Trump administration],” Newsom said at a press conference when asked what he was planning to do about replacing the expiring credits.

“But we can continue to make the unprecedented investments in infrastructure,” he continued, highlighting that the state now has over 200,000 public chargers compared with only 120,000 gas pump nozzles.

Newsom claimed in 2024 that he would step in to replace the federal EV aid if it was ever eliminated, but following through on that promise has proved impossible due to California’s growing budget deficit. An earlier state subsidy program ended there in 2023, though after Newsom’s latest speech, his office reportedly said it could be reintroduced next year, potentially by using cash generated by California’s carbon-trading scheme.

A Broader Fight Over Clean Air

In addition to railing against Trump’s work to sabotage California’s nearly 60-year fight to clean up automobile pollution, Newsom slammed GM and other automakers. He accused them of being complicit in the push to block California’s ban on the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles set to take effect in 2035.

“GM sold us out, Mary Barra sold us out,” he said, tying the dispute over incentives to a larger battle about California’s right to set environmental standards.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GM-platev-CA-Segpy.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 14:00:51.122845

Blue Ridge Power will eliminate 348 positions in Fayetteville and 169 in Asheville by Nov. 18, according to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) filed with the state last week.

Pine Gate formed Blue Ridge Power as its engineering, procurement and construction company in 2021. At the time, Pine Gate said Blue Ridge Power would be headquartered in Asheville, and it would have offices in Fayetteville, Charlotte and Midland, Michigan.

Blue Ridge’s website states it has more than 700 employees. Blue Ridge Power is not part of Blue Ridge Energy or Blue Ridge Electric.

Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump has used his second term to end projects related to wind and solar energy. In July, Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that ended subsidies for solar and wind energy projects years earlier than planned. Developers and analysts predicted that the legislation would slash the installation of renewable energy over the next decade.

Blue Ridge cited changes in the industry as the cause of the layoffs.

“Blue Ridge Power has experienced market headwinds similar to those impacting the entire renewable energy industry, requiring Pine Gate Renewables to dedicate significant resources to support the organization. After reviewing numerous options to find a path forward, Pine Gate made the difficult decision to conduct an orderly wind-down of Blue Ridge Power. Blue Ridge Power will continue to assess how best to support each of its ongoing projects, including working with its customers to transition those projects to another EPC provider. This decision in no way reflects the hard work or dedication of our valued team members, and we are deeply grateful for all of their contributions,” Pine Gate released in a statement.

Blue Ridge may be able to retain or extend the layoff date for some workers depending on various factors, which it did not specify. Blue Ridge workers are not part of a union.

Founded in 2016, Pine Gate has about 300 employees and has closed more than $7 billion in project financing and capital investment, according to its website.

Virginia’s Loudoun County alone supports nearly 6 GW of operating and under-construction data centers—more than any other U.S. county.

Many top data center locations prioritize access to affordable electricity and fiber, not population centers.

U.S. data center energy consumption could double by 2030, posing challenges for the nation’s grid infrastructure.

The map above, produced by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) on behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Grid Deployment Office, shows the sprawling and powerful infrastructure behind America’s data center boom. Using a range of public data sources, it visualizes power transmission hubs in megawatts (MW), highlighting where the electric grid is already working hard, and where future pressure may build.

The table below highlights counties that use the most power for data center facilities:

Loudoun County, Virginia (home to “Data Center Alley”) tops the list with nearly 6,000 MW of active capacity and another 6,300 MW planned.

Why Are Data Centers Located Where They Are?

It’s tempting to assume that large populations drive data center development, but that’s often not the case. Instead, it comes down to a mix of factors:

Electricity availability and cost: Data centers consume vast amounts of power. States like Virginia, Texas, and Oregon offer competitive electricity pricing and stable infrastructure.

Access to water: Many facilities use water for evaporative cooling, so proximity to aquifers or rivers can be crucial.

Fiber networks: Low latency is king. Proximity to fiber optic infrastructure and subsea cable landing stations is critical.

Zoning and incentives: Tax incentives and permissive local zoning laws can make or break a deal.

With this in mind, here are a few areas on the map worth highlighting:

Ashburn, VA and Surrounding DC Suburbs

The data center cluster around the DC suburbs, especially Ashburn, is known as the “Data Center Capital of the World” and “Data Center Alley.” It hosts the largest concentration of internet infrastructure globally, where about 70% of the world’s internet traffic flows daily. This area offers abundant and reliable power from Dominion Energy, dense fiber connectivity, aggressive state tax incentives, and proximity to major government and enterprise customers, making it the preferred hub for hyperscale cloud and data companies.

The I-85 Corridor

This region, which roughly runs from Atlanta up into Virginia, is emerging as a strategic data center hub. The corridor benefits from improved transmission infrastructure, and growing local tax incentives. Atlanta’s proximity to major East Coast markets and Virginia Beach’s new subsea cable landing stations make this region a digital on-ramp to global networks.

West Texas

Known for its vast open spaces and powerful winds, West Texas offers some of the lowest electricity prices in the country. It’s also home to major renewable energy projects, including wind and solar farms that help data center operators meet clean energy goals. This has drawn attention from major players like Microsoft and Meta.

Eastern Washington and Oregon

The Columbia River powers a dense cluster of hydroelectric dams, which in turn support energy-hungry data centers in towns like The Dalles and Quincy. The cool, dry climate further reduces the need for mechanical cooling, making this region one of the most cost-efficient for data center operations.

Can the Grid Keep Up?

U.S. data centers already consume 2-3% of the country’s electricity. According to WRI, this could double by 2030, especially with AI workloads driving GPU server farms that are far more energy-intensive than traditional ones.

Meanwhile, the pressure is on utilities and policymakers to expand grid capacity faster than ever before. Interconnection queues are long, and power disputes are already delaying projects in places like Northern Virginia and Silicon Valley.

Yet, the demand shows no signs of slowing, making the power grid one of the most important tech battlegrounds of the next decade.

The United States remains the clear leader, generating nearly 30% of the world’s nuclear electricity, equivalent to the next two countries combined. Despite no new large-scale reactors coming online in decades, high capacity factors and life extensions for existing plants have kept U.S. nuclear energy production steady.

China has rapidly risen to second place as it continues to expand its fleet of reactors, with multiple new units under construction.

France, where over 60% of electricity comes from nuclear, saw the largest year-over-year growth among the top five producers in 2024 (+12.2%).

Meanwhile, Russia—the fourth-largest nuclear power producer—experienced a slight decline in nuclear power generation (-1.0%) in 2024. Canada, Spain, and Finland all posted modest drops, largely due to scheduled outages or load adjustments in their grids.

On the other hand, India saw the largest increase in nuclear power production in 2024, growing by over 13% from 2023 levels.

The World’s Aging Nuclear Reactor Fleet

As of 2025, there are 416 operating nuclear reactors worldwide, and around two-thirds of these are more than 30 years old. Nuclear reactors are typically designed to operate for 40–50 years, although they can operate for longer with lifetime extensions.

Although the currently operating fleet is aging, more than 60 new reactors have commenced operations in the last 10 years. Furthermore, around 70 new reactors are currently under construction across 15 countries, brightening the outlook for the world’s reactor fleet.

Since our last update in January, several key developments across multiple jurisdictions have occurred, including the beginning of several state programs.

Legislative Developments

When we last reported at the start of 2025, five states had passed EPR legislation: Maine, Oregon, Colorado, California, and Minnesota. The tally has now reached seven. Following the publication of its needs assessment in February, Maryland passed SB 901 in May, establishing a full EPR program for packaging. Washington, one of the states already imposing post-consumer recycled content and other requirements for plastic product packaging, enacted SB 5284 on May 17, establishing the seventh EPR program.

Momentum continues to grow in additional states. Since the beginning of 2025, two states, Hawaii and Rhode Island, have passed legislation tasking state environmental agencies with conducting needs assessments to evaluate the potential for an EPR program. Hawaii Governor Josh Green signed HB 750 on May 27. Rhode Island Governor Daniel McKee signed H6207 on June 30. In addition, in Massachusetts, an EPR Commission was established to recommend and propose EPR policies to the General Court, Massachusetts’s legislative body. The commission will host six public meetings and make initial recommendations and related findings no later than January 15, 2026.

Meanwhile, some states with existing EPR programs are exploring updates to their statutory programs. On June 20, Maine, the first state in the nation to pass an EPR for packaging law in 2021, passed SP 579, updating the program with the intent of reducing regulatory costs associated with the program, aligning the program with other states’ programs, and clarifying select definitions. On March 17, Minnesota introduced SF 2619 in an attempt to exempt all paper products from the list of materials covered under Minnesota’s EPR program. Despite initial buzz, the bill has not moved out of committee.

New York, which has been working on passing EPR legislation for several years, again failed to pass an EPR program this legislative session; however, the bill will remain active for the 2026 session.

Regulatory Developments

States with existing EPR legislation have been working on developing their regulatory programs. After California Governor Gavin Newsom declined to accept draft regulations in March, citing high costs for small businesses, CalRecycle went back to the drawing board. On August 22, CalRecycle submitted to the Office of Administrative Law a new proposed rule aimed at simplifying fee structures, clarifying definitions, and expanding product exemptions. The public comment period is open until October 7.

Multiple states continue to refine their plans regarding what materials must be collected by municipalities and the fees that will be required from producers for different packaging categories. These decisions depend, in large part, on whether circular solutions are currently available or whether more resources (generated from producer fees) are still needed to develop them. In August, Maine’s Department of Environmental Protection held a stakeholder meeting on the updated draft Packaging Material Types List that was issued in July. This list designates which types of packaging will be considered “readily recyclable,” “reusable,” and “compostable.” Similarly, on August 15, CAA issued a proposal that seeks to amend the “responsible end market” provisions in Oregon. This proposal is undergoing public comment until October 15.

Ecomodulation provisions are another area of ongoing activity. On May 16, Circular Action Alliance (CAA) issued a proposal seeking to amend the ecomodulation provisions of the Oregon Producer Responsibility Organization (PRO) plan. This proposal, which underwent public comment and is now awaiting a decision by the Department of Environmental Quality, would create “bonus” opportunities for producers that transition from single-use packaging to refillable packaging. On August 14, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) opened a public comment period on draft amendments to the regulations focusing on ecomodulation. The proposed amendments specify the circumstances under which producer fees may be reduced (e.g., use of post-consumer recycled (PCR) content produced in Colorado, among other criteria). Notably, although the Advisory Board recommended approval of the proposal, its recommendation letter noted “significant concern” with CAA’s proposal to use mass balance accounting to support claims that covered materials contain PCR content and recommended that CDPHE request the Solid and Hazardous Waste Commission to conduct a rulemaking process on the allowance or disallowance of free allocation accounting in verifying PCR content. The outcome of this process could have a substantial impact on producers’ ability to claim incorporation of PCR into plastic packaging sold in Colorado.

Programmatic Developments

So far, Circular Action Alliance has largely cornered the market as the PRO in states with EPR programs, having now been selected in Colorado, Oregon, California, and Minnesota. There may be growing potential for sector-specific PROs to advance more tailored compliance plans, however. In August, Colorado approved the Lubricants Packaging Management Association as a PRO for certain petroleum and automotive products.

Oregon leads the nation on implementation of its program plan and its first disbursement of funds to communities. Producers reported data to CAA earlier this year, and CAA anticipates the program will cover 415,000 tons of material over the course of the two-and-a-half years covered by the current PRO Plan (ending in December 2027). In Colorado, producers were required to report by the end of July. Minnesota producers had to register with CAA by July 1, and CAA “encouraged” California producers to register by December 5.

Key Tasks for Producers

Producers should continue to focus on the following tasks in 2025:

Develop or refine data collection plans.

Assess opportunities for fee reduction by leveraging ecomodulation provisions and lifecycle assessments.

Identify “pain points” or areas of programmatic ambiguity that may warrant engagement with CAA or state agencies.

Monitor state enforcement activity.

Continue to monitor new legislation, regulatory processes, and updates from CAA.

Contributing Writer

(lailluminator.com) — In a defiant tone, Gov. Jeff Landry said nothing has changed about Hyundai Motor Group’s plans to open a massive $5.8 billion steel plant in Donaldsonville, even after an immigration raid on the South Korean company’s facility in Georgia sparked outrage back home.

“I would think that whatever they did that they weren’t supposed to do, I’m sure they are not going to do it here in Louisiana,” Landry said Tuesday (Sept. 16) an economic development news conference.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents threw the United States’ relationship with trade partner South Korea into turmoil when they conducted a raid Sept. 4 at the Hyundai-LG Energy Solution battery plant in Ellabell, Georgia. Federal authorities detained more than 300 South Koreans working at the factory.

After the immigration sweep, U.S. officials released a video showing detained South Koreans shackled in chains. Some complained they were kept in unsanitary conditions while in custody.

South Korean President Lee Jae Myung warned this week that South Korean companies might be reluctant to invest further in the U.S. following the raid, The Associated Press reported. The South Korean government also plans to investigate whether American officials committed human rights violations against the detainees.

But a spokesman for Hyundai Motor Group said last Tuesday the company will stay the course with its plans in Louisiana.

“There are no changes to our previously announced plans. We have a strategic long-term commitment to the U.S. market,” Michael Stewart, director of public relations and communications at Hyundai Motor North America, wrote in an email.

Some of the South Koreans were working at the Georgia plant illegally, U.S. officials have said.

South Korean officials have criticized the U.S. visa process, particularly the cap on specialized worker visas, which they said makes it difficult for their companies to operate in America, according to The Washington Post.

In Baton Rouge, Landry refused to answer a reporter’s question about whether foreign nationals would work on the steel plant project in South Louisiana.

“I mean, it’s a pretty trick question, I mean, it’s a pretty big project,” the governor responded.

“I don’t expect anybody illegally to be working on the project,” Landry added.

President Donald Trump struck a more conciliatory tone Sunday in a Truth Social post that addressed fallout from the Georgia raid. He welcomed foreign companies to bring foreign workers into the U.S., at least on a temporary basis.

“I don’t want to frighten off or disincentivize Investment into America by outside Countries or Companies,” Trump wrote. “We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at their own ‘game,’ sometimes into the not too distant future!”

In an interview Tuesday, Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan Bourgeois said she expects South Korean nationals will work at the Donaldsonville site. But their positions will not count toward the more 1,300 jobs Hyundai Steel has committed to creating in Louisiana as part of its project, she said.

“Could there be foreign nationals here? I assume there could be,” Bourgeois said. “But absolutely, Hyundai Steel is committed to using Louisiana labor on that project.”

Bourgeois said her team met with Hyundai Steel officials shortly after the Georgia raid to talk about logistics and progress on the Donaldsonville project. At that time, no concerns were raised about the immigration sweep having an impact on the company’s Louisiana plans, she said.

“They have not taken their foot off the gas pedal,” she said.

The project is Hyundai’s first steel plant in the United States and was announced with a lot of fanfare at a March event held at the White House with Trump and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Benton. It’s expected to supply automobile factories in Alabama and Georgia with steel for the production of several hundred thousand cars per year after it is completed in 2030.

Louisiana officials have devoted $600 million in state and local taxpayer funds to support the facility, according to The Times-Picayune, in part because it is expected to be transformational for the Donaldsonville area. Officials have said the 1,300 jobs affiliated with the plant will have an average salary of $95,000, far above Louisiana’s $58,000 median household income.

State Rep. Ken Brass, a Democrat who represents Donaldsonville, said he is confident Louisiana citizens will be hired for jobs at the plant and at other smaller businesses that open up to support the facility.

A new community and technical college branch in Donaldsonville that will train plant workers was included in the incentive package used to lure Hyundai to Louisiana. The state already has design plans for the $30 million training facility, Brass said.

By Delaney Nolan, The Lens, and

Emily Sanders, ExxonKnews

(Special) — London Toussaint, 8, points to the sugarcane field just behind her home.

“That’s where we play at,” she says, “Me and Lyric, my best friend.”

For children in rural St. James Parish, Louisiana – which straddles the Mississippi, about an hour upriver from New Orleans – the sugarcane fields that dot the area are perfect for games of hide-and-go-seek, running down the rows between the tall plants.

They like to play there during the cooler months, said London’s mother, Nylah Toussaint, as she hoisted her one-year-old daughter Dream up to her hip. Nearby, there’s a berry tree they like to sit under.

But unknown to the Toussaints, Exxon has quietly pushed through a plan to bury a controversial pipeline in their playing field – one that experts say will be seriously under-regulated, and far too close to homes like the Toussaints’.

“We wasn’t informed,” Nylah Toussaint said, frowning. “I never knew anything about a pipeline.”

With little public input, Exxon received local government approval to install the pipeline here, in the area widely known as “Cancer Alley,” the 85-mile span of the Mississippi River lined by nearly 200 petrochemical plants, stretching from New Orleans to Baton Rouge. The new eight-mile, 24-inch-wide pipeline would transport highly-compressed carbon dioxide through this part of St. James Parish, passing just 155 feet from a business and 355 feet from the nearest residence.

The proximity might be worrisome for any pipeline, but CO2 pipelines are particularly concerning, critics say, because carbon dioxide is a transparent, odorless asphyxiant that doesn’t dissipate like natural gas.

Pipeline will feed CO2 into the nation’s fast-growing carbon-capture transport network

The CO2 running through the eight-mile St. James pipeline will be captured within the parish, from the Nucor steel manufacturing plant in Convent. It will be piped northwest from Convent, will turn west to cross underneath the Mississippi River, and then pass near a commercial area of St. James until it reaches CF Industries, in Donaldsonville, in neighboring Ascension Parish. There, it will be fed into an existing carbon capture and transport network.

The Toussaint family lives along that pipeline’s path in St. James, where rental homes, apartments, and an RV park surround the quiet Sugar Hill residential neighborhood.

St. James Parish councilmembers waved through the proposal, which is now in the hands of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and its streamlined permitting process for CO2 pipelines.

It’s all part of a national CO2 pipeline buildout that is accelerating under Trump.

Industry representatives say carbon capture – when CO2 is captured from smokestacks and other industrial processes and piped elsewhere – reduces emissions. But across the country, residents, advocates and safety experts are raising the alarm about planned carbon pipelines’ proximity to people, the potential for disaster if an incident were to occur – and the lack of public input, as local boards rubberstamp the projects, like the St. James Parish Council did in July.

In 2023, Exxon purchased carbon dioxide pipeline operator Denbury, and now owns most of the carbon pipeline infrastructure in Louisiana. The state has become the epicenter for deploying carbon capture technology, as petrochemical companies claim to use it to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

Thanks to the new pipeline, Nucor will be able to sell “low-carbon steel” for higher prices. Exxon originally suggested the CO2 captured from Nucor would be transported 100 miles away and stored underground in Vermilion Parish.

But the Trump administration recently increased tax credits that incentivize using captured carbon to drill for more oil in a process known as enhanced oil recovery, where companies inject high-pressure CO2 underground to force out more crude oil. Since that change, Exxon reportedly indicated to the St James Planning Commission that the CO2will instead be transported to Hastings, Texas, for enhanced oil recovery.

Internally, Exxon officials have assumed that carbon capture and storage won’t be effectively deployed at a large scale anytime in the near future to reduce emissions. Instead, advocates warn that CCS increases net emissions. Still, the corporation continues to market it as a climate solution to the public, spending at least $50 million to date lobbying for the technology’s expansion.

For residents, part of a lifelong fight against industry

Barbara Washington, 74, can trace her family roots back to emancipation here, in the small river town of Romeville that neighbors Convent.

Once primarily a farming town, Romeville is now blanketed by pollution from chemical facilities and oil and gas infrastructure. It sits in the center of Cancer Alley.

After cancer and respiratory illnesses hit dozens of her family members, friends, and neighbors, Washington saw ties between the medical problems and high rates of pollution. A few years ago, she co-founded the St. James-based environmental justice group Inclusive Louisiana, to organize local residents fighting industrial development.

Washington can see the Nucor Steel facility and its smokestacks from the window of her home. Soon, it will mark the start of Exxon’s new CO2 pipeline.

Carbon capture projects will exacerbate the health problems here, Washington fears, by expanding industry’s license to pollute by claiming to be low-carbon. She worries about Exxon placing CO2 pipelines so near to her community, and fears it will put people at further risk.

Ashley Gaignard, an environmental advocate with Rural Roots Louisiana in Ascension Parish, where the St. James pipeline would terminate, expressed similar concerns. Gaignard has fought several carbon capture projects in her region and doubts the confident claims of industry, especially given their track record of toxic pollution and recent buyout proposals in the parish.

“They’re going to build our community out of the area,” she said. “They’re going to be the reason that we won’t have a community. I just wish that our political leaders could walk away with some integrity and do the right thing.”

Exxon is trying to skirt public feedback on the plan, advocates believe.

The parish council gave residents less than one day’s notice for Exxon’s appeal hearing, when the company managed to move the pipeline proposal forward after failing to get approval from the local planning commission. “We get in the room and it is full of industry people, people from out of the area, like they had weeks of notice to get their scripts and everything together,” said Jack Green, campaign manager at local advocacy group Rise St. James.

Gail LeBoeuf, who co-founded Inclusive Louisiana with Washington, had the same impression.. “It sounds like a public hearing here tonight and only Exxon people knew about it,” she told the council.

Earlier in the year, the legal advocacy nonprofit Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) had notified the parish council that they may be violating local and state conflict of interest laws. Because Parish Council President Pete Dufresne owns several properties in the path of the proposed pipeline, he stands to benefit financially from servitude agreements with Exxon. CCR never received a response.

The parish council did not respond to requests for comment.

Lifelong residents like Washington and LeBoeuf harbor doubts that the community is prepared. For instance, like many other rural communities facing new carbon dioxide pipelines, the St. James Fire Department is volunteer-run. Even now, Washington said, residents sometimes wait hours before firefighters arrive on scene.

Washington worries that the volunteer firefighters are not equipped for a carbon dioxide rupture. “God forbid that any explosion would happen – we know if there was a rupture, that it would be devastating for us,” she said. “We would be a little wiped-out town.”

CO2 pipeline rupture and emergency unpreparedness

When another carbon dioxide pipeline ruptured in 2020 near Satartia, Mississippi, a cloud of gas flowed into the small town, displacing oxygen, choking the engines of emergency vehicles, and initially bewildering first responders.

At least 45 people sought medical attention at hospitals. Some residents still reported symptoms of hypoxic brain injury years later.

After that incident, advocates and pipeline safety experts pushed for updated regulations for carbon dioxide pipelines from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). Regulations proposed in the final days of the Biden administration would have mandated new leak detection requirements and established emergency planning zones for two miles surrounding the pipelines, among other rules. But they were all scuttled by Trump earlier this year.

The disaster in Satartia highlighted grave concerns over emergency responders’ ability to respond to CO2 pipeline incidents.

The pipeline operator, Denbury, didn’t notify Sataria emergency responders about a leak. Instead, emergency crews had to call Denbury themselves to learn that the gas cloud contained CO2. Most did not yet fully understand the impact that carbon dioxide can have on people and even emergency vehicles. First responders who dealt with the incident have said that electric emergency response vehicles are necessary near carbon dioxide pipelines, since CO2 choked the engines of their vehicles, rendering them inoperable.

Federal regulators investigating the rupture found that Denbury had committed several violations. The company had failed to notify first responders that the pipeline was experiencing a pressure loss. And in its dispersion model, which would inform emergency responses, the company had underestimated the areas that could be impacted by such a rupture.

Denbury paid a $2.8 million penalty. Then, earlier this year, PHMSA proposed another $2.4 million fine against Denbury after its workers allegedly harassed federal inspectors who came to monitor the replacement of the damaged section of pipeline.

Louisiana CO2 pipeline threats

Near the town of Sulphur, in southwest Louisiana, where Exxon has another CO2 pipeline, Fire Chief Todd Parker is in regular contact with the company, and his firefighters are attending trainings funded by Exxon to prepare them for how to respond to CO2 leaks. The training curriculum is based in part on guidance from the American Petroleum Institute.

Exxon’s pipeline near Sulphur sprung a small leak last year. Exxon was failing to monitor the pipeline – the facility’s surveillance camera wasn’t working – and operators didn’t arrive to fix the leak for more than two hours, The Guardian reported. Afterwards, multiple local residents reported they had only learned of the leak through social media.

The bigger picture behind these incidents are not lost on residents of St. James.

If Exxon’s pipeline in St. James ruptured, the CO2 could reach people’s homes in a fraction of the distance it traveled in Mississippi.

And as a state, Louisiana has a poor track record.

In a 2022 analysis, the nonprofit Healthy Gulf found that Louisiana has more high-pressure gas pipeline incidents per mile than any other part of the country – more than twice the national average of oil and gas pipeline incidents per mile.

“It’s a lot more than I believe the St. James Parish emergency response can handle even though they have publicly said they can – we would like to see it in writing,” said Scott Eustis, a science director with Healthy Gulf.

Earlier this year, at three hearings with the St. James Parish Planning Commission, the municipal body that would have to rezone land for industrial use along the pipeline route, Eustis and other local environmental advocates raised concerns about emergency preparedness and about the risk of an incident with this particular pipeline route.

The pipeline would cross tectonic fault lines, where plates shift, Eustis said. It would also run under levees that shift when the river is at flood stage. “These pipelines are subject to a lot of forces and fatigue that you don’t see in other parts of even Louisiana,” Eustis said.

In response to the technical concerns, Exxon added a few safety precautions to its proposal. Company officials promised to build the pipeline seven feet underground, rather than four. They also added an extra automated shut-off valve to isolate the gas in the event of a rupture.

But ensuring safety “depends on a rapid response to a leak,” said Ted Schettler, science director at Science and Environmental Health Network, “which did not occur in Satartia or Sulphur.”

Exxon representatives downplayed concerns. If CO2 did rupture from the pipeline, “you’re going to be able to see it, and you’re going to be able to walk away from it,” Exxon representative Michael Smith told the parish council.

Threatening Louisiana communities

The St. James pipeline threatens places where people live, work, worship, and play, residents say. It runs less than 350 yards from Nylah Toussaint’s neighborhood, Sugar Hill Crossing; along with the nearby Sugar Hill RV Park; a juvenile detention center; at least one playground; and a church. It would pass a half mile or less from the Ascension Parish Jail and a second church.

Many of Toussaint’s neighbors have health problems and are unable to move quickly on their own, she said. “They’ve got a lot of old people who use oxygen and all kinds of medical problems, people that go to dialysis,” she said, noting that many are disabled or don’t have cars.

Those without means to evacuate would be transported by bus, said Eric Deroche, director of Emergency Preparedness in St. James Parish. But St. James Emergency Management doesn’t own any electric emergency response vehicles, as recommended by Mississippi officials.

Though St. James stopped using its community air sirens because of high operational costs, the parish’s phone emergency alert system would warn people in the area, even if they aren’t signed up for emergency alerts, he said. Exxon is paying for the parish to purchase gas meters that would detect CO2, Deroche said, and has facilitated third-party training on CO2 leaks for local emergency responders. But the department doesn’t yet have a copy of Exxon’s emergency response plan, which isn’t required on file until next year, when the pipeline goes into operation.

Deroche also has not received Exxon’s dispersion models, which show the potential dispersion of high concentrations of carbon dioxide in the event of a rupture. Though those models, if accurate, could help emergency personnel and communities prepare for possible incidents, Exxon officials argued that such models would “provide misleading information to the public” and pose a security risk.

In a statement, an ExxonMobil spokesperson said, “These projects take years of planning and testing, with strong oversight and round-the-clock monitoring. CO2 pipelines have a good safety record, and in the rare case of an emergency, we’ve taken steps to make sure local first responders are trained and ready to act.”

Unlike states and municipalities, federal regulators at PHMSA cannot enact distance requirements for pipelines. Louisiana representatives introduced legislation for carbon dioxide pipelines in the state, which included the creation of distance requirements from residences, but the bills failed to move out of committee. Some Louisiana parishes also tried to pass local carbon capture laws and moratoriums, only to find them blocked in the courts. In July, Exxon sued Allen Parish over a local ordinance that would have required local permits for carbon capture projects. The parish then rescinded the ordinance.

Though industry officials report confidence in CO2 pipelines, the risks are too great, said Gaignard, of Rural Roots Louisiana.

“They claim they’ve been doing these projects for years and years, but they have never ran carbon capture pipelines under residential communities before,” she said.

Your correspondent is…bushed, so excuse typos, lapses of thought, and imprecise prose. But I wanted to tell all of you about how Sun Day played out across the country today before I fell into bed. In a word, spectacular.

You know, from reading these missives, that this day has been in the works a long time; we needed, in the face of massive and bizarre attacks from the White House and Congress on sun and windpower, to stand up for the idea of cheap, clean energy. At nearly five hundred events across the country, that’s what happened. From one corner of the continent to the other (still waiting for pictures to come in from Alaska and Hawaii) Americans figured out dozens of ways to make their hopes for the future felt, even in this darkest of political periods. A remarkable account in the New York Times quoted one organizer, summing it up beautifully:

“I really wanted it to be celebratory and uplifting,” said Laura Iwanaga, who led the organization for Portland’s Sun Day event for the local chapter of Third Act, a nationwide climate advocacy organization founded by Mr. McKibben. “We all know what we’re fighting against but we don’t always think about what we’re fighting for.”

For me, the very first picture of the day came from my grandson, out to greet the rising sun.

Soon they were pouring in from events across the country. Many featured big crowds and important people: I was in New York, where people crammed into a downtown church to hear the city’s comptroller Brad Lander talk about deploying the city’s $300 billion pension fund to back clean energy and then spilled out into a nearby park for speeches from a U.S. Senator (Peter Welch), the state’s remarkable lieutenant governor (Antonio Delgado), a state assemblywoman (Emily Gallagher), and the ever-present and ever-powerful Rev. Lennox Yearwood. Oh, and a unforgettable rendition of Here Comes the Sun from Sun Day musical ambassador Antonique Smith.

Those were powerful memories that will last my life. But I was also taken by the pictures that showed quieter moments—for instance, people huddled in basements so that they could see their neighbor’s heat pumps or solar inverters, demystifying the whole process of converting to clean power. This is from South Carolina—and it’s how we’re going to turn people into solar consumers across the country.

And here are Wisconsites setting out on a solar tour of the state’s capital. Some of the images were spectacularly beautiful. Christal Brown choreographed a dance among the solar panels on the campus of Middlebury College.

And some were literally sweet—here’s someone making s’mores in a solar oven in San Leandro California

Everywhere the beauty of the logo (thanks Brian Collins, Beth Johnson, Eron Lutterman) was on display. (Oh, and read the account of its design from Fast Company)

So many people and organizations helped make the day happen: Fossil Free Media, of course, with Jamie Henn and Deirdre Shelly leading an amazing crew; Solar United Neighbors, the Sierra Club, Mothers Out Front, Climate Revival, Green Faith, Dayenu, a hundred more. My colleagues at Third Act were absolutely crucial: here’s Deborah Moore and Anna Goldstein, who worked around the clock

But everywhere there were kids out enjoying the spectacle. Our great hope is that they’ll grow up in a world where it seems utterly obvious to power the planet with clean energy from the sun, instead of filling the air (and their lungs) with the smoke from humanity’s fires.

For a day it was possible to believe in all of that—and the human energy that belief unleashes allows us to make it happen.

In some sense the work has just begun.

I’ll have many more images and reports in the days ahead—we’ve barely begun to sift through all that’s been pouring in these last hours. But time for a well-earned rest (and I have an early morning trip to Chicago—the beat goes on!).

Many were hoping the promise made before wasn’t empty, but it turns out people who shell out for an electric car won’t be able to make their neighbors help pay for a portion of it.

The Subaru Legacy is no more.

This news comes as the September 30 deadline for the federal EV tax credits approaches. It turns out the reason for this rather unsurprising development is rather fundamental.

It all comes down to one thing: cost. The state of California can’t foot the bill for such a measure, reports Bloomberg. According to Governor Newsom, the removal of the tax incentives by Republicans is “federal vandalism.”

Considering under the federal program people who lived in other states helped finance vehicle purchases for people living in California, we’re not sure how that even makes sense. But most politicians get rather testy when they’re told they can no longer raid private citizen’s earnings for their pet programs.

Some automakers were really banking on California offering the $7,500 EV tax credit, picking up where the federal government is leaving off. There was a proposal for a $5,000 incentive, but California can’t even float that much.

After all, the Golden State is out of cash, running a budget deficit was it keeps spending money like crazy. It’s almost like there are consequences to actions.

During a speech announcing the disappointing development, Governor Newsom made sure to threaten GM CEO Mary Barra, accusing her of “selling out” his state by pushing on US Congress to end the EV mandate in California.

However, Newsom has made a fresh batch of promises, saying next year California will offer a new EV subsidy program, even though it hasn’t had one since 2023. We can’t wait to see who he blames when that also falls apart.

The No Coffee Tax Act will bring coffee tariffs back to the level they were the day before Trump took office.
U.S. coffee prices have increased significantly in the last year, in part due to Trump’s tariffs.
Our bipartisan bill is simple: it removes Trump's tariffs on coffee to bring down costs,” said Representative Ro Khanna.
“Donald Trump’s unilateral tax on coffee has jacked up the cost of a cup for the more than 200 million Americans who drink coffee.","This past Friday, Representatives Ro Khanna (CA-17) and Don Bacon (NE-02) were joined by Representatives Don Beyer (VA-08) and Maggie Goodlander (NH-02) to introduce the bipartisan “No Coffee Tax Act,” that will repeal the Trump administration’s tariffs on coffee and lower costs for consumers.

The U.S. is the largest importer of coffee in the world. Brazil, the top source for U.S. coffee, has faced a 50% tariff under the Trump administration’s tariff policy, contributing to a surge in prices. U.S. retail coffee prices increased by nearly 21% last month compared to the same month last year. The No Coffee Tax Act will bring coffee tariffs back to the level they were the day before Trump took office. That level was 0% on everything other than coffee substitutes containing coffee.

“Americans started a revolution over a tax on tea. U.S. coffee prices have increased significantly in the last year, in part due to Trump’s tariffs. If you drink coffee every morning, how can you not be mad about that? Our bipartisan bill is simple: it removes Trump's tariffs on coffee to bring down costs,” said Representative Ro Khanna.

“Families across America are feeling the cost of higher coffee prices, which are already up 21 percent, and tariffing a product we can't grow at a large, commercial scale, only makes it worse. Tariffs are simply a tax on American consumers, raising the price of everyday goods without creating jobs or bringing production on-shore. Article One of the Constitution makes clear that Congress has the authority to set tariffs, and this legislation begins to reclaim that authority. I look forward to working with Rep. Khanna to introduce this bipartisan bill and believe it can help spark the broader debate about Congress reclaiming its constitutional role in tariff policy.” said Representative Don Bacon.

“Millions of Americans are paying a new tax on coffee every morning thanks to President Trump's tariffs. Our bill would stop it,” said Representative Don Beyer.

“Donald Trump’s unilateral tax on coffee has jacked up the cost of a cup for the more than 200 million Americans who drink coffee.

Striking at the planned array of 141 turbines is the latest move by the Trump administration to stamp out surviving renewable energy projects approved during the Biden presidency.

The project with a planned 2.4 gigawatt nameplate rating took four years to complete the permitting process and “could now arbitrarily lose approval for its construction and operations plan,” advocates with the BlueGreen Alliance said. “This is the last major federal permit wind projects need before putting turbines into the water and was awarded to SouthCoast Wind after years of careful review.”

The Sept. 18 court maneuver targeting SouthCoast Wind came on the heels of the Trump administration seeking to revoke permits for the US Wind project off Ocean City, Md. SouthCoast was one of the last acts in the Biden administration’s push to move offshore wind projects forward. Its final permit was issued Jan. 17, three days before Trump’s inauguration and his directive that same day to suspended further action on wind power projects.

As in their other moves to reverse Biden-era approvals, Trump administration lawyers contend those prior deliberations by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and other federal agencies overreached federal authority under the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, and failed to adequately consider negative impacts on fishing and other ocean users.

The SouthCoast project “has made more than $670 million in U.S. supply chain investments to date, including port infrastructure, shipbuilding, maritime logistics, and purchased manufactured equipment,” the offshore wind advocacy group Oceantic Network said in a statement protesting the administration action.

“Yesterday’s federal action remanding SouthCoast Wind’s Construction and Operations Plan undermines a critical source of American-made energy at a time when New England needs it most,” said Oceantic CEO Liz Burdock.

“This project has been a catalyst for new economic activity throughout the Northeast – revitalizing Brayton Point; driving activity at the New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal; and supporting training partnerships with local unions, technical schools, and community colleges,”

according to Burdock. “Halting this project does more than sabotage New England's energy grid - it sets back a nationwide industrial strategy built to create jobs, lower energy costs, and deliver reliable domestic power to American homes and businesses.”",https://s3.divcom.com/www.nationalfisherman.com/images/SouthCoast Wind crop.png.medium.800x800.png,N,,2025-09-22 13:07:56.903426

The hybrid vehicle category may be the lone bright spot in California’s auto market after the tax incentives go away.
Turning a new leaf “It’s probably the first auto show that the consumer is going to get a look at the all-new Nissan Leaf, an inexpensive electric car,” Moody said.
‘Glamping’ market According to Sackrison, the outdoor vehicle recreation market — sometimes referred to as “overland” — is a growing niche for the show.","The timing for this year’s Orange County Auto Show in Anaheim couldn’t be better for what is considered one of the largest electric-vehicle markets in the nation, as the $7,500 tax credit to buy them is set to expire Sept. 30.

Also ending this month is the federal Clean Air Vehicle decal program, which enabled EV and hybrid car owners to ride in the carpool lane with just a single occupant. The state has thrown a two-month lifeline to drivers to get used to the loss.

“A lot of people are aware that those tax credits are going away, and they’re going to be out making their purchases so they can benefit from the credits,” said John Sackrison, executive director of the Orange County Auto Dealers Association, which hosts the show. “I think we’re going to see a lot of buying activity between now and the end of the month. The auto show offers that opportunity to see a lot of EVs in one place.”

The Sept. 25-28 auto show at the Anaheim Convention Center will feature plenty of electric, hybrid and traditional models from more than 27 automakers and offer dozens of street test drives featuring models from Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Jeep, Ram and Toyota.

Attendees will get a taste of what driving an EV is like at the SoCal Electrified Ride Experience. It will showcase rides with professional drivers behind the wheel of new EVs — from Cadillac, Ford, Kia or Nissan — that will hum along on a large indoor track at the convention center.

Sackrison concedes that these are challenging times for auto buyers.

“I think October is going to be an interesting month,” said Sackrison. “If 27% of our county’s sales are battery electric vehicles, and those sales are going to be significantly reduced after the tax credits go away, it’s going to create a big challenge, because it’s a big part of the Orange County and California markets.”

The new vehicle sales outlook in California is expected to fall in the second half of 2025 due to inflation, stagnant household disposable income and higher tariffs putting pressure on vehicle prices, according to the California New Car Dealers Association.

Sackrison cited statistics from CNCDA showing that total new vehicle registrations in 2025 are predicted to fall just short of the 1.75 million vehicle sales seen in 2024.

EV sales have slowed, with some of that stall coming from a backlash over billionaire Elon Musk’s unabashed involvement in cutting jobs in the Trump administration. The share of zero emission vehicles in the state fell to 19.5% in the first six months, down from 22% in the same year-ago period — largely due to the drop in Musk’s Tesla sales.

Also see: OC Auto Show rolls into Anaheim with latest vehicles to check out

While OC Auto Show attendees may see an opportunity to get under the wire with buying or leasing an EV, Irvine-based electric carmaker Rivian’s latest R2 SUV model won’t be at the show to see.

Neither is Tesla coming.

Both of these EV automakers have different levers to pull for marketing that rely on showrooms in upscale settings where they can reach wealthier buyers.

A Rivian spokesperson says the company — which recently laid off 200 workers — is all “heads down on bringing the R2 to market in the first half of 2026.” On Tuesday, Sept. 16, Rivian broke ground on a $5 billion plant east of Atlanta, Georgia, where it will begin assembling the R2 in 2028.

“It’s a loss,” said Sackrison of Rivian’s absence from the show, even though the automaker has never attended since landing in Orange County five years ago. “I think they are missing a great opportunity to connect with the largest audience of car buyers in a market that buys more EVs than 45 states. Rivian’s market share is only about 1% in Orange County, so they would really benefit from the more than 350,000 in-vehicle experiences that take place at the show.”

There’s still a silver lining for what is billed as one of the nation’s first auto shows — including Southern California venues in Los Angeles, scheduled for Nov. 21-30 and San Diego on Jan. 1-4.

“The turmoil is going to lead some people to want to trade in or trade up,” said Brian Moody, executive editor of Kelley Blue Book, an Irvine-based vehicle valuation and automotive research company. “As an example, if you had an electric car mainly for the purpose of getting into the carpool lane, and now you don’t get to do that, do you really love the electric car that much, or would you maybe rather have something else?”

People who visit the auto show at the Anaheim Convention Center will kick the tires on a variety of so-called green energy vehicles. They’ll see plug-in hybrids that can run on gas and an electric-powered battery to get an extra bump of 30 to 50 miles of driving, or EVs that use only rechargeable batteries to power electric motors for propulsion.

The hybrid vehicle category may be the lone bright spot in California’s auto market after the tax incentives go away.

In California, registrations of hybrid vehicles that run on electric and gas engines increased 54% in the first half of 2025 and accounted for 19.2% of the market, totaling 181,192 registrations, according to CNCDA.

Turning a new leaf

“It’s probably the first auto show that the consumer is going to get a look at the all-new Nissan Leaf, an inexpensive electric car,” Moody said.

The third-generation 2026 electrified Nissan Leaf features a range of 303 miles, starting at $29,990 for the S+ model, considered one of the least expensive EVs on the market.

Also getting a first-time look at the show will be the 2026 Ram 1500 with a 5.7 liter HEMI V8, reintroduced in the Ram lineup after being dropped in the 2025 model year. Ram acknowledged it made a mistake by discontinuing the legendary V8 and reversed course due to strong customer demand for the engine’s 395 horsepower.

Attendees also will get a sneak peek of the Dodge Duragon SRT Hellcat, a 710-horsepower 6.2 liter HEMI V8 engine that has three rows of seating to accommodate a larger number of passengers, typically up to seven people.

Other new models to be seen at the show include:

Toyota Prius Nightshade and Toyota Crown Nightshade, both of which come as hybrids (Prius also has a plug-in version) featuring blacked-out exterior accents on wheels, window trim, door handles and other trim pieces.

Dodge Charger’s twin-turbo SIXPACK with an engine that produces 550 horsepower.

Honda Ridgeline TrailSport, an off-road-truck with a slightly raised ride height;.

Honda CR-V TrailSport, a hybrid for light off-road use.

Ford F-150 Lobo, with lowered rear suspension, 22-inch gloss black wheels and powered by a V8 engine producing 400 horsepower.

Chevrolet Suburban Premiere, a carry over from the 2025 line that offers updates to the entertainment and in-car camera systems, the latter of which allows the driver to monitor activity in the back seats.

Jeep Cherokee hybrid, an SUV that provides 210 horsepower and an estimated 37 MPG.

Exotic cars roll in

The exotic vehicle display at the auto show offers an up-close look at ultra-high-end vehicles from automakers such as Bentley, Lamborghini and McLaren. A local dealership in Irvine, Lamborghini Newport Beach, plans to roll up with a sporty Lamborghini and McLaren, both priced at more than $400,000.

The Pacific Coast Corvette Club will also feature a showcase of Corvettes, spanning every generation from the classic C1 that debuted in 1953 to the cutting edge C8 unveiled at the Tustin blimp hangar in 2019.

‘Glamping’ market

According to Sackrison, the outdoor vehicle recreation market — sometimes referred to as “overland” — is a growing niche for the show. These so-called OVR vehicles are pitched for outdoor enthusiasts who drive overland in remote areas — oftentimes along rugged and boulder-strewn trails and fire roads in mountains — just to get to a backcountry spot to sleep under the stars, or park next to a river.

The global off-road vehicle market size was estimated at just over $22 billion in 2022, and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.3% from 2023 to 2030, according to Grand View Research, and cited by Sackrison.

“It’s definitely a market that is growing,” said Mark Han, co-founder and manager for the Torrance-based OVR website, whose company rented 22,000 square feet at the convention floor to show off more than 20 off-road vehicles rigged for the outdoors lifestyle. “When we first started doing these shows two years ago at the LA auto show, 90% who came over to our space said the overland market was new to them.

For automation suppliers, the surge represents both a challenge and an opportunity: robots are emerging as critical tools in building the next generation of energy infrastructure.

Kuka, the Augsburg-based industrial robot maker, says automation is becoming essential for meeting demand at scale while maintaining quality and controlling costs.

Its systems are already being deployed in projects spanning cell assembly, battery pack production, and recycling.

At the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, for example, Kuka robots are part of the AgiloBat project, which uses “mini-environments” to assemble cells.

These enclosures reduce the reliance on large, energy-hungry dry rooms while still ensuring precise environmental control.

In Nuremberg, Kuka Systems has installed a modular production hall at MAN Truck & Bus that can build 50,000 battery packs annually, with scope to double that output.

The facility uses autonomous mobile robots and decoupled stations to increase flexibility, giving manufacturers more room to adapt as technologies and volumes change.

Robotics are also beginning to play a role in disassembly and recycling. In the DeMoBat project at Fraunhofer IPA, Kuka robots are used to dismantle used battery packs, handling diverse designs under real industrial conditions to recover valuable materials safely and efficiently.

The battery market is attracting growing interest from automation suppliers who want to be part of the build-out, working alongside manufacturers to develop scalable production systems.

Comau, the Italian robotics and automation company, has joined the SPRINT project, part of the EU’s Horizon Europe programme, to help develop quasi-solid-state sodium-ion batteries for stationary energy storage.

Although the work is focused on energy technologies rather than robotics, Comau’s role highlights how automation expertise is being drawn into the sector.

The 46-month project is exploring manufacturing processes for sodium-ion cells that use sodium iron phosphate and polymer electrolytes.

Comau is tasked with feasibility studies, process optimization, and designing roadmaps to scale production into industrial environments.

The aim is to cut costs per kilowatt-hour, extend battery life cycles, and increase European autonomy by using materials available in the region.

By engaging in projects like SPRINT, Comau is aligning with European strategies for electrification and sustainability, even if robotics is not the headline element.

The company is already active in industry associations such as the European Battery Alliance and Batteries European Partnership Association, positioning itself to play a role in how Europe builds its energy storage base.

A separate contract viewed by WIRED affirms that this applies to the Richland Parish data center, in addition to the PILOT agreement.
Texas revised the cost of its data center subsidy in 2025 from $130 million to $1 billion.
In 2024, a pause on data center subsidies was passed in Georgia but vetoed by governor Brian Kemp.
“That means some of the data centers are just going to be abandoned by the owners.” She says in the scenario that Big Tech cuts back investments in data centers, Meta would not even be able to find another buyer.","Louisiana planning authorities have voted to rush through approval for three natural gas turbines to power Meta’s massive new data center in Richland Parish. When it’s done, the 4-million-square-foot facility will require more than 2 gigawatts of energy to run.

On August 20, Louisiana’s Public Service Commission voted four to one to approve the construction of the plants, which will be run by the utility company Entergy Louisiana. The decision was met with criticism from members of the public who testified against Entergy and Meta’s plan, claiming that the process was rushed. They voiced concerns about rising energy bills and water shortages.

Documents viewed by WIRED show that state authorities agreed to grant Meta tax breaks and incentives without the company explicitly guaranteeing any full-time jobs for local workers.

Opponents of the plan were angry about the sped-up approval timeline: Entergy submitted its application in 2024, and the vote originally could have taken place this October, to give the commission’s administrative law judge the chance to issue further recommendations. But Entergy filed a motion to move the vote to August, claiming that some of the parties that had previously opposed the project were now in agreement. The rescheduled vote left no time for changes.

Critics also claim the deal doesn’t include stipulations like a cap on how much Entergy could charge utility customers for the construction of the gas plants and transmission lines in Meta’s data center build-out—a concern as massive AI data centers can cause utility bills to spike. While Meta agreed to finance the first 15 years of a 30-year loan to construct the gas plants, the construction of the transmission line will be paid for by utility customers.

“We wanted the commissioners to attach conditions and reasonable safeguards, such as a cost cap, but they instead came to this extremely disappointing and baffling decision,” says Paul Arbaje, an energy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, which opposed the Entergy application.

During the approval vote, Entergy and Louisiana’s economic development officials repeatedly pointed to the projections shared by Meta, which suggest that the project would bring a $10 billion investment and upwards of 300 to 500 well-paying jobs. In its original 2024 application for the plants, Entergy referenced Richland Parish’s low income levels—one in four residents lives below the poverty line—as a reason to authorize the plan.

“There has never been a better time to lift our residents out of poverty. There has never been a better time to give people in our region better jobs,” said Rob Cleveland, the CEO of Grow NELA, an economic development firm representing northwest Louisiana who testified in support of Entergy’s gas plants, at the hearing.

Meta’s Jobs Pledge

Louisiana politicians sought to rewrite zoning laws and shifted a tax rebate for broadband into a tax exemption for data centers, all to win Meta’s support in late 2024, according to January reporting from Nola.com. But the public had little time to scrutinize Louisiana’s economic development promises. They also heard little from Meta, which was not legally required to take part in the hearings on Entergy’s new gas plants, despite the fact that the gas plants and a new $550 million transmission line connecting energy to the data center and upgrades to a local substation (also approved on August 20) are being built entirely for the company—the latter entirely paid for by Louisiana taxpayers. Repeated attempts to force Meta to produce documents that critics claim they have not received were unsuccessful, including a July subpoena attempt.

One of Meta’s tax incentive agreements with the state, which was signed last fall and viewed by WIRED, does not stipulate that Meta subsidiary Laidley, which is running the data center project, will focus on local hiring, although it does require that all jobs be fulfilled on site. (Separately, Entergy said Meta submitted a letter to the Louisiana Public Service Commission in April saying that it will make “a concerted effort” to hire locally, but this assurance is not binding.)

And the tax incentive agreement does not actually require any of the jobs to be full-time to receive state incentives. Instead it defines “full-time job” to mean any 40-hour workweek fulfilled through any number of part-time jobs. Meta would need to hire these 500 “full-time” jobs by 2035 if it wants to receive the highest level of tax breaks, an 80 percent reduction on the full amount. It does require the jobs to provide health insurance and says the pay for all jobs should average out at $82,000 a year. The contract also charges Meta an “administrative fee” of $10,000 for every $1 billion it spends in the state.

When reached for comment, Kevin Litten, a spokesperson for the state’s economic development authority, said that the agency still expects Meta to create 500 full-time, permanent jobs, per previous announcements. “Meta is expected to create 500 direct new jobs at the facility, which in economic development terms means permanent, full-time jobs,” Litten says.

Entergy’s critics claimed the utility was reluctant to provide specifics on Meta’s job numbers in the lead-up to the August vote, refusing to explain what types of jobs will be created or how Meta estimated 300 to 500 new hires. In an email to WIRED, Entergy only referred to an impact report from Grow NELA but answered no other direct questions.

“We continually asked for analysis with how they came up with this number of jobs, and Entergy has no idea about how many people will be hired,” says Susan Stevens Miller, an attorney representing the Union of Concerned Scientists and Alliance for Affordable Energy, which opposed the application.

In an August 7 filing, Entergy urged the rushed vote on its final agreement with several parties, saying Meta’s subsidiary and the tech industry “prize speed to the market as vital to its competitiveness” and that “the Commission has the flexibility and agility to act at the new speed of business, while reasonably balancing the interests of other Louisiana customers.” Entergy said in a filing it had submitted ample public testimony and the public had a chance to ask questions and that moving quickly was, “the difference between securing the Project for Louisiana or missing out on this massive economic development opportunity, likely to another state willing to move at the speed of business.”

But when several members of the public asked questions during the August 20 hearing about the project, particularly around Meta’s assurances of jobs, they received few details. None of the agreements between Meta and the state of Louisiana that were viewed by WIRED are available in the commission’s public dockets. An earlier, six-page term sheet laying out hiring incentives was published by Power magazine in November, but it did not include further details about whether jobs could be part-time or any other details in the 93-page agreement viewed by WIRED. Advocates with the Alliance for Affordable Energy and Union of Concerned Scientists contacted by WIRED said they had never seen the full agreement until it was sent to them by WIRED.

Louisiana resident Angelle Bradford Rosenberg spoke at the August 20 approval meeting, expressing concern about the impact of the data center’s water usage and its impact on local farmers. She also questioned the impact of jobs on the local economy.

“I want local businesses to be thriving,” she said during the meeting, “but if the average data center permanent jobs are 12 to 15, and y’all saying it’s going to be 500, do y’all have a promise that they’re going to be local jobs? ... Do we actually know that they’re hiring people from Monroe, Rayville, Delhi, Holly Ridge, or are they just saying 500 jobs and they’re bringing in these folks from other places?”

But the tax exemption agreement secured between Meta and Louisiana officials did not secure any guarantee of local hiring. Litten, with Louisiana Economic Development, told WIRED that separate state tax breaks that all companies in the state are eligible for do require local hiring. They include the Quality Jobs Rebate, which provides a 6 percent rebate on payroll expenses, a program set to replace it called High Impact Jobs program.

Most data centers hire specialists from out of state for the technical jobs, according to Kasia Tarczynska, a research analyst who studies data center tax breaks at the nonprofit Good Jobs First. She says data centers employ a mix of low-skill and high-skill technical workers to manage servers in addition to security guards and maintenance roles. She says that while construction is happening, data centers often hire specialist electricians who travel from state to state to set up servers.

For this reason, she says, Meta is not the only tech company hesitant to guarantee local hiring when negotiating data center contracts. “They know that some of these jobs require skills that people in the local community just don’t have.”

In response to questions from WIRED, Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton said, “We make a concerted effort to source labor locally and provide substantial contributions directly to the community.” Clayton said that for part-time construction roles, its contractors were “working on hiring local talent” and that they would host information fairs early next year. For permanent data center jobs, Clayton said Meta would be hiring “technical operators, electricians, air-conditioning and heating specialists, logistics staff, security, and more.”

Meta’s Louisiana Tax Breaks

The state’s agreement with Meta makes clear that as public land, the property Meta is leasing is exempt from traditional taxes. It creates a menu of options for what the company would potentially owe in “payment in lieu of taxes” (PILOT), a common agreement that lets local governments offer tax breaks with provisions attached. The agreement offers Meta qualified exemptions from both sales tax and property tax.

To get the lowest level of property tax exemptions, Meta would need to invest $5 billion into the state and hire the equivalent of 300 full-time employees. At this level, Meta would have to pay 40 percent of the assessed property tax. If the company invests at least $10 billion by December 2032, it would get the highest exemption, paying 20 percent of the assessed property tax.

The agreement sets out hiring timelines that the company must also hit to receive these tax incentives: Meta can receive the highest property tax exemption as long as it hires the equivalent of 300 “full-time” jobs by 2030, 450 by 2032, 475 by 2033 and 500 by December 31, 2034.

Louisiana’s agreements ask for more than some other states’ tax subsidies. According to Good Jobs First, nearly half of state tax subsidies for data centers don’t require any new jobs to be created. But Miller has concerns that the tax breaks were not necessary at all to entice a company as large as Meta. “While everyone likes to avoid taxes, they’re not going to hire people in Richland [Parish] just because they’re going to get a tax break,” Miller says.

Louisiana had already amended a tax rebate to create an exemption for data centers in 2024 to entice Meta; in its latest iteration, it says data centers can receive a full sales tax exemption for equipment purchases in the state as long as they hire 50 full-time jobs and invest at least $200 million by July 1, 2029. A separate contract viewed by WIRED affirms that this applies to the Richland Parish data center, in addition to the PILOT agreement.

Good Jobs First says that at least 10 states have subsidies for data centers that are worth more than $100 million each, and “have suffered estimated losses of $100 million each in tax revenue for data centers,” according to its data. In total, these states forgo more than $3 billion in taxes annually for data centers. Texas revised the cost of its data center subsidy in 2025 from $130 million to $1 billion. In 2024, a pause on data center subsidies was passed in Georgia but vetoed by governor Brian Kemp.

The Franklin Farms site in Holly Ridge, the area of Richland Parish where Meta’s data center is being built, was purchased by Louisiana specifically for economic development projects. In its ground lease with Meta, Louisiana offered the 1,400-acre plot to the company for $12 million, which the lease says was the cost to the state of acquiring and maintaining the land. The lease also says Meta’s $732,000 a year “rent” is “credit toward the Base Purchase Price,” meaning the company will have paid for the property by a little over 16 years into its 30-year lease.

The price for the potential sale would be slightly higher if Meta does not reach minimum hiring and investment thresholds: As an example, the lease says if Meta only spends $4 billion in the state instead of $5 billion, the property would end up costing it $19 million. Louisiana Economic Development reserves the right to reclaim the property if Meta doesn’t invest at least $3.75 billion and hire the equivalent of 225 “full-time” jobs by 2028. When asked if Meta plans to purchase the property, Clayton said, “We’ll keep you updated on our future plans for this site.”

Meta’s presence has already caused land values to jump. A nearby tract of 4,000 acres of land in Holly Ridge is for sale for $160 million, or $40,000 per acre—more than 4.5 times the price paid by Louisiana for the data center’s site.

But there’s also a concern that Meta could delay or abandon the data center project. The PILOT agreement its subsidiary signed with the state says the company’s timeline will depend on “numerous factors outside of the control of the lessee, such as market orientation and demand, competition, availability of qualified laborers to construct and/or weather conditions.”

“My general fear is that too many data centers are being built,” Miller says. “That means some of the data centers are just going to be abandoned by the owners.”

She says in the scenario that Big Tech cuts back investments in data centers, Meta would not even be able to find another buyer. “Essentially, the state will be stuck with this warehouse full of computers,” Miller says.","https://media.wired.com/photos/68af58f4246764e1f361e9d1/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/What-Meta-Doesn't-Want-You-To-Know-Data-Center-Business-2194360641.jpg",N,,2025-09-22 12:06:54.156332

Currently, Batavia has just one Level 2 charging station in the west parking lot at City Hall, per the city. But it’s set to get two Level 3 chargers soon: one downtown and another at Batavia High School, a project partially funded by state grant money.

Level 3 charging, or direct-current fast charging, essentially provides more miles of range with a shorter charge time, according to the Alternative Fuels Data Center from the United States Department of Energy.

Batavia’s new downtown station was originally planned for Shumway Avenue near Flinn Street, but, at a recent meeting, Batavia’s Electric Superintendent Steve Allen said the city is looking for a new location.

The city is aiming to have the Batavia High School chargers go live at the end of the month, a city spokesperson told The Beacon-News on Friday. The city has not yet settled on a downtown location for the second new charging station.

The city first installed a charging station at City Hall in 2018, according to Allen, but he said the current rate of 40 cents per kilowatt-hour is now “much too high.” So, to make rates comparable to nearby communities, he suggested reducing the rate for the Level 2 chargers and instituting a rate of 50 cents per kilowatt-hour for the new Level 3 charging stations.

At the Batavia City Council Committee of the Whole meeting on Sept. 9, council members also discussed instituting a grace period for customers moving their vehicles out of the charging spots and whether to implement a fee for those who leave their cars in the spot beyond it reaching a full charge.

Allen originally suggested a 10-minute grace period, but Ald. Abby Beck suggested increasing it to 20 to 30 minutes.

The council also discussed a fee of $1 per minute that a user would be charged for leaving their car in the space past the grace period to move their vehicle.

Ald. Christopher Solfa said the overage fee seemed “a bit aggressive.”

Ald. Alan Wolff, on the other hand, said that the app customers use to pay for charging prompts customers when their vehicle is finished charging to ensure that the next person can use it.

“It’s not like we’re looking for money to have a parking space there,” Wolff said. “It’s to keep the thing charging cars. When one’s done, move it, get another one in there.”

Allen also indicated that the stations are not intended as a way for the city to generate money.

“I don’t think these are an economic boon, unfortunately,” Allen said. “I just think they’re a great thing for our community to have.”

These conversations are happening as Batavia is considering other aspects of its energy future. Recently, for example, the city passed an updated energy policy meant to guide where the city chooses to source its power from, what kinds of sources it relies on and sustainability goals.

The city currently gets its energy via an agreement with the Northern Illinois Municipal Power Agency, or NIMPA, a joint action agency made up of Batavia, Geneva and the city of Rochelle, according to past reporting. NIMPA is a partial owner of the Prairie State energy campus, according to its website, and power from Prairie State is distributed to NIMPA members, including Batavia.

Prairie State, a coal-fired power plant in southern Illinois, has previously been ranked one of the top 10 biggest polluters in the country, according to 2023 data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

At the meeting, Beck also expressed support for the charging stations, in particular the locations in the city.

“Having it be a draw, like, ‘Oh, and I can go get a cup of coffee or I can get something while I’m charging,’ is just fantastic,” she said.

The council ultimately landed on considering a 30-minute grace period and the $1 per-minute charge after that, but the details generated further debate from the council when the matter headed to a final vote on Sept. 15.

At that meeting, Ald. Dustin Pieper floated the possibility of putting a cap on how much a person would get charged for leaving their car in the spot and mentioned the possibility of whether a car would be towed if left in one of the spots for a long period of time. He also suggested adding signage that instructs users to contact the city if there’s an extenuating circumstance that prevents someone from moving their car.

Ald. Kevin Malone said he was in support of a cap on an overage fee.

“I think we can set it at a rate that makes it hurt enough that they don’t forget again, but also isn’t … us kind of price-gouging,” Malone said.

The council also discussed modeling the fee after the fee charged when someone parks in an accessible parking space.

Ald. James Fahrenbach said there should be a cap on the fee levied, but said it should be high and noted that the risk of an electric vehicle breaking down is pretty low compared to a non-EV.

Asked by Wolff how this would be monitored, Allen said that use of the charger is monitored through the machine at the charging station, but if someone chose to return to their car to disconnect the charger from the car but leave their car parked there, the city would be reliant on surveillance methods or complaints to enforce compliance.

Beck asked about how many minutes they would enforce the $1 per-minute fee for, and several council members discussed whether situations like this had come up.

Most Batavia residents don’t have electric vehicles currently, per the results of a recent citywide survey of residents. Only 10.6% of just under 800 respondents indicated that they own or lease an electric vehicle, and more than half of respondents said they don’t intend to buy one, according to past reporting.

Allen said the city hasn’t received complaints of cars parked at the charging station while not charging.

Ald. Leah Leman noted that the council was discussing two different situations: a user of the charging station leaving their vehicle in the spot beyond it reaching a full charge, versus a non-EV driver using the space for parking.

Batavia Police Chief Eric Blowers pointed to state statute, which stipulates a $75 fine for parking a non-EV at an EV charging station, and allows municipalities to increase that fine to $100.

Wolff suggested utilizing the $100 fine for a non-EV parked in a city-owned charging station and a $120 cap on the per-minute charge for an electric vehicle staying in the space beyond the grace period, as well as having the city provide a link or QR code at the charging stations to the city ordinance so users are aware of the rules. Malone also supported the $120 cap.

The new rates, along with the 30-minute grace period and a $1 per-minute overage fee, were ultimately approved by the council unanimously on Sept. 15.

Scientists agree that harnessing the energy released as atoms fuse together could produce incredible amounts of low carbon power.
Whichever confinement process is used, the goal is to sustain the fusion reaction long enough and with enough energy to achieve a new power gain.

In an interview with Bloomberg Television last week, Wright said, “I believe we will know the commercial pathway to fusion during the Trump administration.”

“Commercial electricity from fusion energy could be as fast as eight years and I’d be very surprised if it’s more than 15,” he added.

The comments by Wright, who studied nuclear fusion while attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and University of California, Berkeley, are similar to statements he made to the BBC earlier this month.

During that interview he said, “With artificial intelligence and what’s going on at the national labs and private companies in the United States, we will have that approach about how to harness fusion energy multiple ways within the next five years.

“The technology, it’ll be on the electric grid in eight to 15 years,” he said.

Scientists agree that harnessing the energy released as atoms fuse together could produce incredible amounts of low carbon power. However, they are generally far less confident than Wright on the timeline for that happening.

The challenge is the complexity of the process. While nuclear fusion occurs all the time in outer space, replicating the process on Earth involves heating atoms to temperatures many times hotter than the sun.

To get a little more technical, it involves heating deuterium and tritium to over 100 million degrees Celsius to create a plasma and then confining this plasma using strong magnetic fields in a tokamak or by applying immense pressure with lasers.

A tokamak is an experimental device that uses powerful magnetic fields to confine plasma in a doughnut shape.

Whichever confinement process is used, the goal is to sustain the fusion reaction long enough and with enough energy to achieve a new power gain.

And it was only three years ago that researchers at the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California announced they were able for the first time to produce a fusion reaction that generated more energy than it consumed.

But the Energy Department remains committed to the cause.

Earlier this month, it announced it was committing $134 million to two programs “designed to secure U.S. leadership in emerging fusion technologies and innovation.”

At the time Wright said, “Fusion power holds the promise of limitless, reliable, American-made energy” and he said the programs – the Fusion Innovation Research Engine collaboratives and the Innovation Network for Fusion Energy would “ensure our innovators have the tools, talent and partnerships to make it a reality.”

Of the total, the Fusion Innovative Research Engine collaboratives will receive about $128 million in funding to be divided among seven teams that are creating a fusion energy science and technology innovation ecosystem composed of virtual, centrally managed teams.

The teams have been charged specifically with creating a bridge between the basic science research programs of the DOE’s Fusion Energy Sciences initiative and growing fusion industries.

The remainder of the funding, about $6.1 million will go to the Innovation Network for Fusion Energy program to support 20 projects intended to accelerate private-sector fusion energy development by reducing barriers to collaboration between businesses and national laboratories or universities.

The projects selected include research in materials science, laser technology development, high temperature superconducting magnet assessment, artificial intelligence learning for fusion modeling and simulation, and enabling technologies to move toward achieving economical fusion energy.

On the private sector side, the potential of fusion energy has led to sizable investments from billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, and more recently, sovereign wealth funds and national wealth banks have been throwing their resources behind the effort.

“The pace of innovation is faster than ever before; it’s coming and it’s exciting,” Wright told Bloomberg.",https://www.thewellnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CHRIS_WRIGHT_PORTRAIT_SQ.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 13:05:41.889073

A final consideration is the fact that a boost in US LNG imports is at odds with the EU’s long-term climate objectives and net-zero objectives.","A recent report by the international intergovernmental organization Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) has highlighted the potential implications of the trade deal signed between the US and the EU on the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market dynamics.

According to the expert commentary ‘Viability of LNG Trade Growth under the EU-US Trade Deal,’ the EU–US trade deal from July, which resulted from the discussions of tariffs announced by the US, is more likely to function as a political symbol of transatlantic solidarity than a catalyst for major LNG trade growth.

Under the non-binding deal, the EU committed to importing $250 billion annually of US energy, or $750 billion in total, by 2028, with LNG expected to anchor this expansion. The deal covers natural gas, oil, and nuclear fuels, paired with an additional $600 billion of investment in the US economy.

However, GECF labels these targets as unrealistic and believes the deal could face the same fate as the energy targets of the 2019 US–China trade deal, which remained unmet since the deal created no legal obligation for either side, much like the deal in question.

The Forum bases its analysis on several factors, including, among others, the decline in EU gas demand, infrastructure bottlenecks, and the fact that the EU’s climate policies conflict with deeper fossil fuel dependence, as recently echoed by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB).

Background

The US introduced hefty new tariffs in April 2025 to shield domestic industries from foreign competition and to realign international trade in favor of US economic interests. GECF sees this as happening in a context of a seismic shift in the global trade system toward protectionism.

A baseline 10% tariff on imports from 185 countries was introduced, with a 20% country-specific tariff applying to EU member states. These higher tariffs have been repeatedly suspended, which GECF interprets to signal their use as leverage rather than as a permanent trade measure.

The tariffs were paired with an Executive Order providing for the reduction of tariffs if a trading partner takes “substantial steps” to address the US trade deficit. Since the EU represents 18% of total US imports, it emerged as the focal point of the US’s discussions with partners to address trade imbalances.

In late July, the duo worked out a framework trade deal in which most EU goods would be subject to a 15% import tariff. Additionally, the EU committed to importing $750 billion of US energy by 2028 and investing an additional $600 billion in the US economy.

Since the US exported around $70 billion worth of energy to the EU in 2024, the $250 billion annual commitment would represent more than a threefold increase for the EU, whose total energy import bill reached $407 billion in 2024.

Between 2021 and 2024, the share of pipeline gas in total EU consumption dropped by 20%, from 70% to 50%, while LNG’s share rose by the same amount, from 20% to 40%. This enabled the US to boost its gas exports to the EU from 6% to 19% and LNG from 28% to 45% over the same period.

The trend accelerated in the first half of 2025, when LNG imports surpassed pipeline gas imports in the EU for the first time. The North American country’s LNG exports to the EU amounted to $20 billion in 2024.

Possible issues

While the EU’s imports from the US could reach record levels by the year’s end, the report states the trade deal’s targets are highly ambitious, noting that both sides seem to be overpromising what can realistically be bought and sold.

The US currently has 105 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of operational LNG capacity, with an additional 115 Mtpa under construction and 100 Mtpa of planned capacity targeting FID.

Some notable projects in the development stage include Woodside Energy’s Louisiana LNG project, which is said to be 22% complete, and Venture Global’s CP2 LNG, for which $15.1 billion in financing was recently secured.

Therefore, a maximum of 100 Mtpa is theoretically available for future deals. This is expected to be even lower in practice as Asian countries have expressed their interest in purchasing US LNG, for example, in the case of Alaska LNG.

Supplying the full 100 Mtpa at current spot prices would generate only $60 billion annually for the US, which is well below the levels needed to make a meaningful contribution to the EU-US trade agreement, the report states.

An additional issue is the EU’s lack of gas demand to absorb additional LNG volumes from the US. Regional gas consumption fell sharply from 400 bcm in 2021 to 313 bcm in 2024, driven by a combination of structural and cyclical factors.

With the Union’s gas demand expected to remain flat or even decline slightly by the end of this decade, a major expansion of US LNG supply to the EU market could be limited.

Additionally, even though the EU is approving new LNG projects, capacity utilization rates remain around 50% because of the limited gas interconnection infrastructure. One example of this is Spain. While having the largest regasification capacity in the EU, the country lacks pipeline connections with neighbouring countries, so LNG cannot be distributed regionally.

The report further states that substituting spot and short-term LNG volumes from other suppliers is the best course of action for boosting US LNG exports because the majority of gas and LNG imports in the EU are tied to long-term contracts and are not easily redirected. However, there is limited scope for this to happen since a large share of spot and short-term LNG volumes already came from the US in 2024.

Another potential problem highlighted in the report is the fact that, whatever the authorities agree on, the final commercial decisions will rest with private companies. GECF explained that the EU companies base their decisions on profitability, and governments can only signal support or provide incentives, not compel them to buy US gas.

A final consideration is the fact that a boost in US LNG imports is at odds with the EU’s long-term climate objectives and net-zero objectives. The EU methane regulation is an additional factor complicating the situation and making the increase in US LNG imports difficult to achieve.

GECF feels that Europe could be at a disadvantage with the deal, as it could undermine climate credibility, increase the risk of stranded assets, and complicate the clean energy transition intended to support sustainable economic growth.

In conclusion, the organization believes that while the EU–US trade deal could theoretically have an impact on the global LNG market, it is more likely to function as a political signal of solidarity than as a major commercial driver of energy trade growth, particularly in the LNG segment.

“Moreover, roughly 250 Mtpa of LNG export capacity is under construction worldwide, and overall supply is expected to grow in line with rising global gas demand under stable prices. This expansion provides sufficient room for all major LNG suppliers.

“With Asia driving the bulk of future LNG import growth, any additional US LNG directed to the EU is likely to be offset by increased supplies to Asia from other producers, primarily GECF member countries, thereby maintaining overall market equilibrium,” the report concludes.",https://cdn.offshorewind.biz/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/04/29073650/Louisiana-LNG-1.jpg?image-crop-positioner-ts=1745905011,N,,2025-09-22 12:06:58.916852

This summer, Florida was the No. 1 economy in the country in CNBC’s “America’s Top States for Business” rankings. The achievement comes thanks to the bold leadership of Gov. Ron DeSantis and our state leaders, the illustrious businesses that call this state home and the hard-working families that make it all possible. Recently proposed utility rate hikes would only put an undue burden on the working families that are foundational to Florida’s success.

The day President Donald Trump took office, he vowed to unleash affordable and reliable American energy to curb the rising energy costs that “devastate American consumers by driving up the cost of transportation, heating, utilities, farming and manufacturing, while weakening our national security.” Florida should be following the president’s lead.

I work alongside families, businesses and community leaders across the state, and I’ve seen the negative impact of high energy costs firsthand. Florida must continue innovating and preparing the power grid for growth and storms, but higher utility bills are not the answer, and they fly in the face of Trump and DeSantis’ leadership.

A recent proposal before the Public Service Commission would hike rates by 10.5% for millions of Floridians. Even a modest monthly increase can push working families and seniors on fixed incomes to choose between necessities and will work against our state’s nation-leading economic growth. Further, rate increases have historically failed to deliver on their promised results, a fact commissioners should remember.

The commission should require greater accountability and provide more public transparency before approving new increases. Families, seniors and small businesses deserve assurances that their needs will come first and that any increase truly leads to stronger service and long-term value.

The good news is that we have smarter options.

Florida communities have shown that it is possible to strengthen resilience and reliability without raising household costs. When modern infrastructure and innovative technology are put to work, families benefit from lower electric bills and service they can count on, even when severe storms hit.

These kinds of forward-looking investments prove that innovation can protect both pocketbooks and peace of mind for Florida families. Florida leaders could explore even more market-based approaches to lowering household utility bills by increasing transparency and allowing more public input into the energy resource planning process.

Florida can modernize its grid, expand cleaner and more cost-effective technologies, and prepare for future growth without saddling families with higher bills. Affordability, reliability and innovation must go hand in hand if we want to secure a brighter energy future for Florida.

The U.S. clean energy workforce now stands at 3.56 million. In 2024, 7% of all new jobs in the United States were in clean energy, and clean energy represented 82% of all new energy sector jobs.

Despite these strong numbers, the nearly 100,000 jobs added marked a significant slowdown, adding about 50,000 fewer jobs than in 2023. E2 attributed the slowdown to federal policy uncertainty and an overall slowing economy. Find the full jobs report and methodology here.

In 2025, job growth slowdowns and investment cancellations persist. E2 research shows that since January 2025, businesses cancelled more than $22 billion of planned clean energy factories and projects that were expected to create 16,500 jobs. Analysis by Energy Innovation suggests that more than 830,000 jobs could be lost due to policy rollbacks created by the Trump Administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

“What these numbers show is that this was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024,” said Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director. “Now, clean energy job growth is at serious risk – and with it, our overall economy.”

The E2 report said clean energy jobs now represents 42% of all energy jobs in America and 2.3% of the overall national workforce. More people now work in clean energy related occupations than work as nurses, cashiers, waiters and waitresses, or preschool, elementary, and middle school teachers, said the report.

More than 520,000 jobs have now been added by the clean energy and clean vehicle sectors over the last five years, an increase of 17%, which far outpaces the fossil fuel industry’s creation of jobs and triples the broader U.S. job growth rate over the five year span.

“Every year, clean energy jobs become more intertwined and critical to our overall economy,” said Michael Timberlake, director of research and publications for E2. “These jobs are now a vital anchor of America’s energy workforce.”

The clean energy workforce has grown the fastest in Oklahoma, growing by 27.5% since 2020, said the report. Oklahoma was followed by New Mexico (27.1%), Texas (26.5%) and New Jersey (25%).

On May 29, 2025, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed House Bill No. 3809 into law, adding new provisions to the Texas Utilities Code that impose decommissioning and financial assurance requirements for certain battery energy storage facility agreements in the state [H.B. 3809]. Shortly thereafter, on June 20, 2025, Governor Abbott signed House Bill No. 3228 into law, creating similar decommissioning and financial assurance obligations for wind and solar facility leases [H.B. 3228].

Both bills took effect on September 1, 2025, and apply only to agreements entered into on or after that date [Section 3 of H.B. 3809; Section 8 of H.B. 3228]. Solar, wind, and energy storage developers operating in Texas should ensure that their lease forms reflect these new obligations.

Battery Energy Storage

Under H.B. 3809, battery energy storage facility leases, other than those involving an electric utility, must include specific obligations for the tenant relating to the decommissioning of the facility, including the safe removal of facility and storage resources and the recycling of all recyclable components [New Sections 303.0004(a)-(b) of the Tex. Util. Code]. Additionally, tenants must provide financial assurance to the landowner before the earlier of the facility lease’s termination date or the 15th-anniversary of the battery operation date [New Section 303.0005(e) of the Tex. Util. Code]. The assurance amount must be sufficient to cover the cost of removal, recycling or disposal, and property restoration, less the salvage value of the facilities and any portion of the value of the facilities pledged to secure outstanding debt [Id. at subsection (b)].

Wind Power Facilities

As amended by H.B. 3228, Section 301.0003 of the Texas Utilities Code now requires that wind facility leases include specific obligations for the tenant to recycle or reuse all recyclable components and to dispose of the remaining components at authorized facilities [New Section 301.0003(a-1) of the Tex. Util. Code]. H.B. 3228 also expanded financial assurance requirements for wind projects [New Section 301.0004 of the Tex. Util. Code]. The amount of financial assurance must be sufficient to cover the costs of removal, recycling or disposal, and restoration costs, less the salvage value and any portion of the value of the facilities pledged to secure outstanding debt [Id. at subsection (b)]. Updated cost and salvage estimates must be provided at least once every five years for the duration of the agreement, with the tenant responsible for all costs associated with compliance [Id. at subsection (c)].

Solar Facilities

As amended by H.B. 3228, Sections 302.0004 and 302.0005 of the Texas Utilities Code impose similar obligations for solar power facility agreements [New Sections 302.0004-.0005 of the Tex. Util. Code]. Solar power facility agreements must now require tenants to recycle or reuse all recyclable components and to dispose of all other components at designated facilities [Id. at Section 302.0004(a-1)]. Additionally, the amount of financial assurance provided must be sufficient to cover removal, recycling or disposal, and restoration costs, less the salvage value and any portion of the value of the facilities pledged to secure outstanding debt [New Section 302.0005(b) of the Tex. Util. Code]. The first updated estimate is required on or before the tenth anniversary of the commercial operations date and further updates must be provided at least every five years [Id. at subsection (c)(2)]. The tenant is responsible for all associated costs [Id. at subsection (d)].

Conclusion

When taken together, H.B. 3809 and H.B. 3228 impose new requirements for storage, solar, and wind projects in Texas to remove, recycle, and dispose of such facilities [H.B. 3809; H.B. 3228]. Because all leases entered into after September 1, 2025, are required to comply with these new requirements, developers should check their site control forms to ensure that they are compliant with the current version of the Texas Utility Code [Section 3 of H.B. 3809; Section 8 of H.B. 3228].","https://images.passle.net/fit-in/400x400/filters:crop(0,0,2306,1298)/Passle/671960b986748a978b266239/SearchServiceImages/2025-09-22-14-58-02-222-68d163fac4095be329b8b384.jpg",N,,2025-09-22 13:06:59.841212

Dive Brief:

North American utilities are “increasingly looking to distributed resources” to meet data centers’ rapidly growing power demand amid ongoing challenges for large-scale generation deployment, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said last week.

Their interest spurred a surge in virtual power plant deployments last year, Wood Mackenzie Global Head of Grid Edge Ben Hertz-Shargel said in a Sept. 17 note. The numbers of active company deployments, unique offtakers for VPP capacity and monetized VPP programs all grew by at least one-third year over year, according to WoodMac’s data.

But overall VPP capacity in North America grew only 13.7%, to 37.5 GW, indicating “a market that is broadening faster than it is deepening” due to persistent barriers to adoption, Hertz-Shargel said.

Dive Insight:

Wood Mackenzie counted 1,940 North American virtual power plant deployments this year, up 33% from 2024. Its count of monetized VPP programs — which pay distributed energy resource owners to dispatch energy or curtail consumption — showed the number of programs rose 35% year over year, from 321 last year to 433 this year.

The number of unique offtakers for VPP capacity increased 38% this year from 2024, WoodMac said. More than half of all offtakers increased the number of VPP deployments serving them by at least 30% year over year. And the top 25 offtakers each procured 100 MW or more in 2025.

WoodMac attributed the increased offtake, in part, to an emerging “independent distributed power producer” business model. Independent distributed power producers, it explained, are electricity retailers that finance third-party-owned energy storage offerings through grid service revenue and energy arbitrage — charging batteries when electricity prices are low and discharging them when prices are high.

Third-party-owned energy storage retains relatively favorable regulatory treatment under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Republican budget law that curtailed hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy funding authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

WoodMac’s research suggests a correlation between growth in VPP offtakers and utility commitments to data center capacity. The consultancy found particularly robust VPP offtake in the PJM Interconnection and Electric Reliability Council of Texas regions, both of which have substantial existing and projected data center capacity. In July, American Electric Power said its utilities expect to interconnect 18 GW of data center capacity by 2030, largely in ERCOT and PJM.

In his note, Hertz-Shargel said the correlation could set up a win-win-win for utilities, data center operators and distributed energy resource owners.

“This drives home the opportunity for utilities and even hyperscalers themselves to procure new VPP capacity to offset data center coincident peak demand, enabling faster grid connection,” he said. “Homeowners and business owners [with onsite energy resources] might actually earn revenue from the connection of new data centers, offsetting potential bill increases.”

But the modest increase in capacity relative to deployments, offtakes and monetized programs reveals obstacles that must be overcome before VPPs can reach their full potential, Hertz-Shargel said.

Those obstacles include enrollment caps on utility VPP programs, power market reforms that reduce VPPs’ capacity accreditation and market barriers for small customers, he said.

Brattle Group principal and distributed energy resources expert Ryan Hledik said the findings align with what he’s seeing in the distributed energy market. But he’s optimistic that VPP capacity will scale soon, given the urgency utilities and data center operators feel to source electrons wherever they can find them.

“Data center load growth appeared almost overnight, and the industry’s appreciation that VPPs could play an important role in that area has emerged even more recently than that,” said Hledik, who was not involved in Wood Mackenzie’s research.

Hledik said VPP providers, utilities and data center companies “are still gearing up to align on the right solutions,” but that work hasn’t significantly impacted overall VPP capacity yet.

“My hunch is that the growth over the next 12 to 18 months will be more noticeable, and over the next three to five years the growth could be explosive,” he said.

Hledik added that some individual VPP programs in states like California are rapidly adding capacity. He pointed to a Brattle Group report last month that showed California’s Demand Side Grid Support VPP discharged 539 MW of average output, or about half the output of a large nuclear reactor, on the evening of July 29. The report said DSGS could provide net system cost savings of between $28 million and $206 million through 2028.

The California legislature unexpectedly zeroed out funding for DSGS earlier this month. A spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom suggested the program is less important now amid a surge in new generation deployments.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/4ZrlU_-atHM1ekQWXlKPXqq6QPJivnU6LUq-kXrqq8c/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTk1MzEwMzY3LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-22 12:05:48.804519

The U.S. does not have a big enough power grid to accommodate rising energy demand — a fact that’s making electricity less affordable and reliable nationwide.

But there’s broad public support for growing the grid and allowing more electricity, including cheap, clean energy, to come online.

So says a new survey of likely voters in Ohio and Pennsylvania — two states in the severely backlogged PJM Interconnection grid region — and Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri, which are covered by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO). The survey was conducted by polling firm Cygnal on behalf of the Conservative Energy Network.

Roughly three-fourths of likely voters support expanding the electric grid, the survey found. About two-thirds are in favor of adding more transmission lines to connect clean energy and strengthen grid reliability.

And nearly 90% of respondents are concerned about rising energy costs. A majority of surveyed Republicans, Democrats, and Independents said they are ​“very concerned.”

“This is not a partisan issue. … You don’t have to appeal to one side or another,” said Chris Lane, a senior partner at Cygnal, who previewed the findings at the National Conservative Energy Summit in Cleveland on Aug. 25.

He noted that the results stand out for their consistency between regions and among different groups — including political parties. Even so, the Trump administration has in recent months worked against grid expansion, not toward it.

Adding more ​“lanes” to the grid

Energy costs are climbing in part because of rising power demand from data centers and the electrification of buildings and vehicles. Bringing more electricity generation online — especially quick-to-build, low-cost wind and solar — could increase competition and lower prices under the basic principles of supply and demand.

But just as transportation planners need to make sure highways can handle increased road traffic, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and regional transmission operators need to make sure the grid has room for more electrons. That calls for more ​“lanes” in the form of added transmission lines, plus technologies to squeeze more capacity out of the system overall.

Currently, ​“there aren’t enough power lines, they’re not all in the right places, and the ones we have are too outdated to meet the rising power demand for electricity,” Evelyn Robinson, director of PJM affairs for the renewable-energy industry group MAREC Action, said during a separate panel at the conference in Cleveland.

While all of the United States faces delays in getting new energy onto the grid, the problem is worst in the PJM region, where hundreds of projects have been stalled in the queue for years. To deal with the backlog, the grid operator switched to a new interconnection process in 2023; as of June, PJM still had about 63 gigawatts of power, mostly clean energy, stuck in that ​“transition queue.”

Across the country, wind, solar, and battery storage make up most of the resources waiting to come online, and their ​“levelized cost of energy” is cheaper or on par with other electricity sources.

The Trump administration has called for ​“the rapid and efficient buildout” of energy infrastructure, including transmission lines and grid-enhancing technologies, ​“by easing Federal regulatory burdens.”

But the administration’s actions have so far had the opposite effect. A February executive order calling for review of independent agency rulings threatens the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s ability to expand transmission. And in July, the Trump administration canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for the Grain Belt Express — the largest transmission line underway in the United States. The project aims to shuttle gigawatts of wind and solar power from the Great Plains to the East, and Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., has called the cancellation of its federal loan guarantee illegal.

The administration’s policies, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, are also expected to more than halve the amount of clean energy built over the next decade, further exacerbating concerns about soaring power prices and rising demand.

What’s on voters’ minds

The survey results may help the Conservative Energy Network convince decision makers to take steps to expand the grid.

“To the best of my knowledge, this is the first poll that’s been done in the PJM area testing these things, and in the MISO south area,” said John Szoka, the group’s CEO, at the National Conservative Energy Summit.

The polling also gauged the persuasiveness of four statements to support grid expansion. The takeaways could inform how advocates and legislators work to boost public support for clean energy.

Among conservatives in Ohio and Pennsylvania, a message focused on lower costs was about 12 times more likely to shift someone’s opinion than one about preventing blackouts, Lane noted. Messages about increasing American energy production, preventing blackouts, and providing positive job and economic impacts for Americans were more likely to move liberals than one about lowering costs.

Opinions were more divided on whether the federal government, states, or private companies should pay for grid expansion, although a slight majority of respondents in both the PJM and MISO areas said they would be willing to pay a few dollars more per month in the short term if it would reduce outages and lower costs over time.

Respondents were also mixed on who should get to choose how electricity is produced. States, landowners, and local officials all ranked above federal authorities.

Clean energy, meanwhile, received only modest support on its own. About one-fourth of the Ohio and Pennsylvania respondents said using clean energy was one of their top two policy goals, with nearly one-fifth of those surveyed in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri giving that response.

Ultimately, affordability and reliability were the clear consensus energy policy priorities for poll respondents in both the PJM and MISO areas.

With the federal government standing in the way of both grid expansion and clean energy development, however, it will be tough for the voters to get the improvements they want.

Among the most closely watched measures are proposals tied to billions of dollars in property tax cuts for both homeowners and businesses.

Earlier this year, the Texas Legislature approved the package with a two-thirds majority, authorizing the amendments to appear before voters. The Legislature also passed the state’s two-year budget, which allocates $51 billion specifically for property tax relief.

The funding comes largely from recent budget surpluses, driven by inflation and temporary federal COVID-19 stimulus dollars. Lawmakers have increasingly turned to these surpluses in recent years to finance major tax relief efforts.

Supporters of the measures, including Governor Greg Abbott, argue the tax cuts will strengthen Texas’ reputation as a business-friendly, competitive state, encouraging investment and long-term economic growth. Abbott and other proponents also stress that lowering property tax burdens directly benefits homeowners while creating a more attractive environment for employers.

Voter approval is the final step in the process, and November’s outcome will determine whether these tax cuts and other amendments become part of the Texas Constitution. For Texans, the election represents not only a decision on property taxes, but also a broader choice about how the state leverages its surpluses and shapes its fiscal future.

On November 4, Texans will decide on 17 constitutional amendments, each presented as a statewide proposition. These amendments range from tax relief measures to funding priorities and constitutional clarifications.

Proposition 1 (SJR 59): Funding for Texas State Technical College.

Proposition 2 (SJR 18): Ban on a state capital gains tax.

Proposition 3 (SJR 5): Bail reform.

Proposition 4 (HJR 7): Water infrastructure funding.

Proposition 7 (HJR 133): Tax exemption for surviving spouses of veterans.

Proposition 8 (HJR 2): Ban on an inheritance tax.

Proposition 9 (HJR 1): Inventory and equipment tax exemption.

Proposition 10 (SJR 84): Property tax exemption for homes destroyed by fire.

Proposition 11 (SJR 85): School tax exemption for elderly or disabled homeowners.

Proposition 12 (SJR 27): Changes to the State Judicial Conduct Commission.

Proposition 13 (SJR 2): Increased school tax exemption for homeowners.

Proposition 14 (SJR 3): Funding for dementia research and prevention.

Proposition 15 (SJR 34): Codifying parental rights.

Proposition 16 (SJR 37): Clarifying citizenship requirement for voters.

Proposition 17 (HJR 34): Property tax exemption for border security infrastructure.

Together, these propositions reflect Texas lawmakers’ focus on property tax relief, infrastructure investments, and constitutional safeguards. Voter approval will determine whether these measures take effect.

The raid's impact on US battery production

The Georgia facility—a cornerstone of US efforts to secure domestic EV supply chains—now faces significant delays. LG Energy Solution has announced that construction at the plant will remain on hold until the first half of 2026, setting back production by several months and potentially impacting automakers counting on battery deliveries to meet their EV production targets.

Hyundai Motor Chief Executive José Muñoz confirmed the disruption would delay the battery plant's opening by at least two to three months. The facility was set to be a key component of Hyundai's $12.6 billion investment in Georgia, with plans to produce batteries for up to 500,000 hybrid and electric vehicles across the company's portfolio of brands.

""The South Korean workers that were deported were specialized workers in the joint venture battery plant,"" Muñoz told reporters on September 18. ""The company has had to move workers from other plants to make up for the lost labor.""

The raid: Emerging details

On September 4, approximately 400 state and federal law enforcement personnel descended on the Hyundai-LG battery plant under construction in Georgia. The operation resulted in the detention of 475 workers, including more than 300 South Korean nationals. According to the search warrant obtained by the Savannah Morning News, the raid initially targeted just four Mexican nationals as ""targeted persons,"" as reported by Forbes.

Charles Kuck, an immigration attorney representing 11 individuals arrested in the raid, noted that ICE agents did not bring Korean language interpreters—suggesting the South Koreans were not the intended targets. Nevertheless, agents decided on-site to arrest all South Korean workers after determining they had entered on B-1 visas or through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA).

""One of Kuck's South Korean clients had just arrived the night before and was sitting in a conference room in a business suit, attending a meeting, when arrested by ICE,"" Stuart Anderson wrote in Forbes.The Miller quota connection

Multiple sources point to a White House-imposed arrest quota as the driving force behind the mass detention. Stephen Miller, the White House's deputy chief of staff and homeland security adviser, had publicly stated a goal of 3,000 immigrant arrests per day—a dramatic increase from the previous average of about 660 arrests daily.

""The arrest of the South Koreans was entirely driven by Stephen Miller's arrest quota,"" Kuck told Forbes. ""ICE agents screwed up by arresting people who did not abuse the visa, were eligible to engage in the type of work for which they were admitted, but ICE considered it a successful operation because they met Miller's quota.""

NBC News confirmed that ""The raid was part of a broader deportation drive by the Trump administration, which the White House has described as central to fulfilling U.S. President Donald Trump's election campaign promises. Stephen Miller, the White House's deputy chief of staff and homeland security adviser, has pushed for 3,000 arrests a day.""

Diplomatic fallout

In response to the growing diplomatic crisis, the Trump administration has engaged in damage control. Christopher Landau, a top US diplomat, expressed regret over the immigration raid during meetings with South Korean counterparts, promising that South Korean workers would face no disadvantages in reentering the US and that Washington would work to prevent similar incidents, according to Dylan Butts of NBC News.

The raid has severely strained US-South Korean relations. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung called the incident ""bewildering"" and an ""unjust infringement on the activities of our people,"" warning it could discourage future investment in the United States, as reported by both NBC News and the Wall Street Journal.

South Korean media reaction was particularly harsh. Paul Krugman, in his Substack newsletter, cited one South Korean editorial that declared: ""The sight of our workers being led out in chains resembles images of African slaves in the 18th and 19th centuries being dragged out by their owners.""

Investment uncertainty for the battery sector

The raid has raised serious questions about future foreign investment in U.S. battery manufacturing. Charles Kuck told Forbes, ""The ICE raid in Georgia is going to have a massive economic impact. Other attorneys and I are hearing from companies in Asia and Europe who say, 'Maybe we should hold off on big investments in the U.S. for at least three years.'""

This concern directly contradicts the bipartisan goal of building a robust domestic battery supply chain. Many South Korean tech giants, including Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, have been investing billions into facilities in the US as part of reshoring efforts. The raid could potentially slow this momentum at a critical time for the US battery industry.

Despite these concerns, Hyundai on September 19 confirmed it is moving forward with previously announced plans to expand its Georgia plant, committing $2.7 billion and 3,000 new jobs to phase two of the complex. This recommitment suggests the company is working to maintain its US investment strategy despite the setback.

Visa challenges exposed for the battery tech sector

The incident has highlighted longstanding challenges with U.S. visa policies for skilled foreign workers in the battery technology sector. Currently, the US allows employers to temporarily hire foreign workers in ""specialty occupations"" under its H-1B visa program; however, the system is highly selective due to an annual cap and a lottery system, as explained by NBC News.

Matters became more complicated on Friday, Sept. 19, when President Trump signed a proclamation imposing a $100,000 fee for H1-B visas granted to skilled foreign workers, leading to what the New York Times termed “a weekend of chaos,” as businesses hurried to try and bring their H-1B-issued employees who were out of the country back to the US before the new rules kicked in on Sunday. On Saturday, the Trump administration announced that the new fee would only be applied to new H-1B applicants.

South Korean President Lee has urged the U.S. ""to normalize the visa process related to investment, whether by securing sufficient visa quotas or by creating a new category of visa,"" according to Forbes.

LGES North America President and Chief Strategy Officer Bob Lee noted that difficulty obtaining visas has long been a challenge for companies like his. ""That was something many people understood, but now, after this crisis, the fact that we're placing attention on it will be a very good thing,"" he said to the Wall Street Journal.

Georgia Governor Brian Kemp suggested that the raid may ultimately lead to improvements in the visa system. He told reporters on September 17 that the incident might ""wind up smoothing the way for South Korean employees to more easily obtain legal permission to help build and operate facilities in the United States.""

Implications for the US battery industry

As the US works to establish itself as a major player in global battery production, incidents like the Georgia raid highlight the complex interplay between immigration policy, international relations, and industrial development. For the battery technology sector, several key questions remain:

As the situation continues to unfold, the long-term impact on US-South Korean relations and foreign investment in American battery manufacturing remains to be seen. What is clear is that the raid has exposed significant tensions between aggressive immigration enforcement policies and America's battery technology development goals, creating a complex challenge for the industry on both sides of the Pacific.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt9e22d2ca52b3eca2/68d155927e504efa32d78e54/Korea-ICE-raid-protest-2234262981.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-22 13:05:45.651585

An empty, 1.3-million-square-foot warehouse north of Denver was supposed to be an emblem of cutting-edge manufacturing. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis heralded a California company's plan to build a battery factory on-site as a push to ""power the future.""

But an already weakening growth outlook for electric vehicles deteriorated as President Trump's tax bill wound its way through Congress. Amprius Technologies didn't wait for the legislation to pass and pulled out of Colorado earlier this year.

The technical know-how for such work is ""still developing in the U.S.,"" Amprius Chief Executive Kang Sun said. ""Meanwhile, other countries have spent years building mature, cost-efficient battery industries, giving them a significant head start.""

Three of the four manufacturers Amprius contracts to pump out its batteries for drones, bikes and maybe one day cars are in China.

Renewable Energy Transition Fuels Unprecedented Growth in Magnet Consumption

The global pursuit of clean energy solutions is creating substantial demand for the permanent magnet market, particularly from the wind energy sector. Large permanent magnets are essential for the efficiency of direct-drive wind turbines. China’s commitment to wind power is evident, with its new installations in 2024 totaling a massive 80.45 gigawatts. Forecasts for 2025 anticipate a continued expansion, with 87 gigawatts of new installations planned. This translates directly into significant magnet consumption.

The demand for Neodymium-Iron-Boron (NdFeB) magnets from China's wind sector alone stood at 9,735 metric tons in 2024, illustrating the sector's material-intensive nature. Technological advancements are also pushing demand boundaries. In a significant development, Siemens Gamesa launched a new offshore wind turbine model in 2024. This powerful turbine has a 15 MW capacity and relies on high-performance neodymium magnets, setting a new benchmark for the industry and reinforcing the link between renewable energy goals and the Permanent magnet market.

Automation and Advanced Electronics Drive Widespread Miniaturized Magnet Demand

High-performance magnets in the permanent magnet market are the invisible engines powering modern industrial automation, robotics, and consumer electronics. In manufacturing, it is projected that China's industrial robot production will reach an incredible 941,000 units in 2025. These machines depend on magnetic sensors for precise position feedback and magnetic encoders for accurate motion control. Furthermore, magnetic grippers are employed by robotic arms in automated warehouses, and magnetic levitation systems are revolutionizing automated conveyors by eliminating friction.

In the consumer sphere, the trend of miniaturization ensures consistent demand. Global smartphone shipments reached nearly 1.3 billion units in 2024, with each device containing multiple tiny magnets. The demand for NdFeB magnets from mobile phone production is expected to reach 3,698 metric tons in 2025 across the global permanent magnet market, with production projected at 1.85 billion units. In 2024, air conditioner production, another major consumer, hit 270 million units, creating a demand for 21,000 metric tons of NdFeB magnets. Permanent magnets are now integral to a vast range of devices, including tablets, earbuds, VR headsets, and wireless chargers.

Western Manufacturing Expansion Projects Intend to Diversify Global Supply Chains

In a strategic response to supply chain vulnerabilities, significant investments are being made to establish magnet manufacturing capabilities outside of Asia permanent magnet market. Neo Performance Materials' facility in Estonia is a key project, set to begin commercial production in 2025 with an initial capacity of 2,000 tons per year of NdFeB magnet blocks. A planned second phase aims to increase this capacity to 5,000 tons per year. GKN Powder Metallurgy is also making ambitious moves, planning to establish a total capacity of 4,000 tons per year of rare earth magnets across Europe and North America, with a pilot plant in Germany scheduled to be operational in early 2025.

The United States is a focal point of this diversification. The U.S. Department of Defense has invested heavily, awarding over $439 million since 2020 to establish domestic rare earth supply chains. Key projects include MP Materials' plant in Fort Worth, Texas, which will have a first-phase production capacity of 1,000 tons per year. In parallel, E-VAC Magnetics is establishing a commercial-scale rare earth magnet manufacturing facility in South Carolina, aiming to be fully operational by 2025, significantly boosting the resilience of the North American permanent magnet market.

Circular Economy Initiatives Emerge as a Critical and Viable Solution

Magnet recycling is rapidly transitioning from a niche concept to a critical component of a sustainable supply chain, mitigating raw material risks. HyProMag USA is at the forefront of this movement, aiming to capture 10% of the U.S. domestic NdFeB magnet demand within five years, starting from 2025. Its Texas Hub facility has an ambitious target for annual production, including 750 metric tons of recycled sintered NdFeB magnets and 807 metric tons per annum of associated NdFeB co-products.

The total payable capacity of the HyProMag facility will reach 1,557 metric tons of NdFeB annually. The financial viability is compelling, with an incremental capital cost of approximately US$7 million for the facility's expansion. Highlighting its environmental benefits, a carbon footprint study in March 2025 confirmed a remarkably low CO2 footprint of just 2.35 kg CO2 equivalent per kg of its recycled NdFeB product, showcasing a sustainable path forward for the Permanent magnet market.

Defense and Aerospace Applications Underscore Magnets’ Immense Strategic Importance

The strategic value of permanent magnets is nowhere more apparent than in their critical role within advanced defense systems. The material requirements are substantial: each Arleigh Burke DDG-51 destroyer requires 5,200 pounds of rare earth elements. A single Virginia-class submarine needs an even greater amount at 9,200 pounds of these materials. Furthermore, the technologically sophisticated F-35 aircraft requires more than 900 pounds of rare earth elements for its complex systems to function in the permanent magnet market.

Recognizing this dependency, the U.S. Department of Defense has set a clear goal: to have a sustainable, mine-to-magnet supply chain capable of supporting all U.S. defense requirements by 2027. To achieve this, targeted funding has been deployed. As of March 2024, the DOD had awarded $28.8 million to Noveon Magnetics for a facility in Texas. Other awards include $2.3 million to TDA Magnetics to produce qualified magnets and a substantial $94.1 million award to E-VAC Magnetics to establish commercial-scale magnet manufacturing by 2025.

Innovation and Policy Are Actively Shaping the Future Market Trajectory

The future of the Permanent magnet market is being actively shaped by technological breakthroughs and supportive government policies. In 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy announced a significant advance in iron-nitride (Fe-N) based permanent magnets, presenting a potential rare-earth-free alternative. The pace of innovation is reflected in intellectual property, with a patent for an iron-rich permanent magnet issued on January 15, 2024, and another granted to Hangzhou Magmax Technology on September 17, 2024, for a novel demagnetization identification method.

Simultaneously, the permanent magnet market is exploring alternatives, evidenced by Valeo and MAHLE launching a magnet-free electric motor in 2024, signaling a potential long-term technological diversification. Policy is also a powerful catalyst. A U.S. bill introduced in February 2025, the Rare Earth Magnet Security Act (REMSA), proposes a production tax credit of $20 per kilogram for magnets manufactured in the United States. This incentive powerfully increases to $30 per kilogram if the component rare earth material is also sourced or recycled domestically.

Two CSU students co-founded a startup called Envirofit International that has evolved into a global leader in designing and manufacturing clean cookstoves and other technologies that enable clean energy access in the developing world.

These technologies help solve critical human health and environmental problems.

Company innovations include both cooking technologies and business models that help make products and services accessible to users.

How do you go from building clean snowmobiles in a campus lab to manufacturing clean cookstoves that help millions of people worldwide?

Ask Tim Bauer and Nathan Lorenz.

The two entrepreneurs started their work as Colorado State University students and rose from the tech transfer ecosystem to deliver 2.5 million clean cookstoves that benefit an estimated 12 million people living in low-income households around the globe, most in Africa and India.

Their 22-year-old social enterprise, Envirofit International, is based in Fort Collins and has grown into a global leader in the design, development and delivery of high-performing clean energy cookstoves that combat toxic indoor air pollution, save lives and reduce carbon emissions across the developing world.

“I could not have imagined, when we were wrenching on snowmobile engines, that we would end up here,” said Lorenz, Envirofit’s chief technology officer. “What we’re doing now has global impact.”

Envirofit’s global reach, especially into the developing world, is unique and notable, said Richard Magid, vice president of technology transfer at CSU STRATA, the university’s tech transfer organization.

“To achieve that impact, they’ve paired technical innovation with incredibly innovative business and financing operations,” Magid said. “Because traditional venture financing won’t generally support social enterprises like Envirofit, they’ve worked with foundations and impact investors to raise capital, as well as being on the cutting edge of carbon credits.”

In 2002, Bauer and Lorenz were undergraduates in mechanical engineering and, as part of a senior capstone, entered a national competition to build cleaner snowmobiles, which are notorious for spewing pollutants from standard two-stroke engines. Working at what is now the Powerhouse Energy Campus, Bauer and Lorenz developed a retrofitting kit to convert a two-stroke carbureted snowmobile engine into one with direct in-cylinder fuel injection – leading to increased engine efficiency and lower emissions. In fact, they built the cleanest snowmobile engine on record at the time.

With that win, Bauer and Lorenz realized that developing nations – teeming with vehicles with two-stroke engines – represented the biggest market for their invention.

So, in 2003, as they were entering graduate studies in mechanical engineering at CSU, the students co-founded a nonprofit startup called Envirofit International with two of their professors, Bryan Willson in mechanical engineering and Paul Hudnut in business. The group explored commercialization of the engine retrofitting kit and even secured initial funding from the Bohemian Foundation, a Fort Collins family foundation.

They might have continued down that path. But other work at the Powerhouse Energy Campus focused on reducing emissions from smoky cookstoves, and the charitable Shell Foundation suggested a partnership to accelerate this cookstove work. Soon, Envirofit added cookstoves to its product portfolio and formed a long-term alliance with the Shell Foundation. The cookstove business overtook the two-stroke business.

Then, in 2012, Envirofit transitioned to a for-profit social benefit corporation and went on to raise multiple rounds of equity and debt financing to enable scale-up.

Backed by investor partnerships, Envirofit tackled a critical problem: An estimated 2.1 billion people worldwide – a quarter of the globe’s population – cook with open fires and inefficient stoves, most often using solid fuels, such as wood, crop waste, charcoal, coal and livestock dung, according to the World Health Organization. Many live in poverty in rural parts of the developing world.

Each year, 3.7 million people die prematurely from illnesses attributed to household air pollution caused by incomplete combustion of solid fuels and kerosene used for cooking. Particulate matter and other pollutants lead to fatal heart disease, stroke, respiratory infection, pulmonary disease and lung cancer, which disproportionately affect women and children who spend more time in noxious home environments, WHO reports.

Meantime, household air pollution is a major contributor to outdoor air pollution – notably, carbon emissions that drive climate change.

To help solve these problems, the Envirofit team developed a line of cookstoves that use wood, charcoal and liquefied petroleum gas, a mix of propane and butane, as fuel. These stoves use less fuel, reduce toxic emissions and cook food quicker than traditional models.

Cost savings on fuel combined with subsidized pricing – largely possible with carbon market strategies – are key factors allowing families to afford the cookstoves, said Bauer, Envirofit president and chief operating officer. Many people in the company’s target market live in energy poverty, spending perhaps 30% of their household incomes on fuel. That has prompted Envirofit to focus much of its business planning on energy access.

“What we’ve really developed is the business model to get these products into people’s lives,” Bauer said. “The key challenge to scale-up is not the product development but rather the business model to enable it.”

Central to its business planning was Envirofit’s move to deal in high-quality carbon credits, which is possible because of significant emissions savings with the company’s products. This allows the company to provide products at a 50% subsidy, which improves affordability and adoption.

Meantime, Envirofit has grown to about 60 employees, has several international offices and is in its fifth consecutive year of profitability.

The company’s goal is to help move people up the “energy ladder” – from using less efficient and higher emitting technologies to more efficient and lower emitting technologies. That means moving from solid fuels to liquefied petroleum gas, a switch that yields benefits for households and the climate alike.

Envirofit has developed a trademarked SmartGas technology to meet that goal: Customers receive cylinders of liquefied petroleum gas and, with a unique valve system, use their smartphones to pay incrementally for daily fuel needs. The “pay-as-you-cook” model keeps costs affordable for customers who cannot buy entire tanks of fuel.

These days, Envirofit is looking ahead to new ways it can provide clean energy access beyond designing and manufacturing cookstoves. As Bauer put it: “We are an energy technology company creating scalable, climate-smart solutions for emerging markets.”

The company has been honored for its solutions. For instance, the Economist, a British news journal, named Envirofit’s founders its 2013 Energy and Environment Innovators.

Willson, a company co-founder, is executive director of CSU’s Energy Institute, which is housed at the Powerhouse Energy Campus – Envirofit’s incubation grounds.

“We have this mantra of science to solutions to scale, and Envirofit embodies that goal,” said Willson, who is also a member of the company’s board of directors. “Envirofit has a unique ability to improve the lives of millions of people, and that’s really cool.”",https://source.colostate.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Envirofit-SmartGas_Customer3.jpeg,N,,2025-09-22 14:01:17.678751

“It is alarming that for the first time since 2021, utilities are regressing on their clean energy transition,” said Sierra Club Chief Program Officer Holly Bender.
As energy costs rise and extreme weather becomes more frequent, now is the time to phase out polluting, volatile, expensive fossil fuels and invest in stable, reliable, and affordable, clean energy.” ###","MILWAUKEE, Wis. – Today, the Sierra Club released its annual Dirty Truth Report, which grades 75 utilities across the country on their plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035, and transition to clean energy through 2035. This report shows that—despite their promises—We Energies is still overwhelmingly not planning for the clean energy transition and millions of Americans are facing the consequences of a grid powered by polluting fossil fuels. At the same time, electricity bills are increasing faster than inflation.

We Energies earned an F grade at a score of 6 percent in this year’s report. This is the worst grade We Energies has earned since the Dirty Truth Report began in 2021. WEC Energy Group, We Energies’ parent company, also earned an F grade this year.

“I would be embarrassed if I brought home an ‘F’ on my report card year after year. But We Energies has no shame; they’ve continued to put corporate profits ahead of people, sticking customers with higher utility bills and greater air pollution by building new gas and delaying the Oak Creek coal plant closure time and again,” said Jadine Sonoda, Campaign Coordinator, Sierra Club Wisconsin.

Faced with rapidly increasing load projections, utility companies are failing to meet this critical moment by championing renewable energy—instead, they are backsliding on their commitments and doubling down on fossil fuels. Across all 75 utilities, the companies scored an aggregate of 15 out of 100 points, earning an F. This marks the lowest score since the first year of this report in 2021, and the first time the score has ever dropped below the inaugural report.

In an interactive webpage, users can see their utility’s score and what progress–if any–the utility has made toward transitioning to cleaner, more affordable energy since the first version of the report in 2021.

“It is alarming that for the first time since 2021, utilities are regressing on their clean energy transition,” said Sierra Club Chief Program Officer Holly Bender. “By adding more gas and keeping costly coal plants online, utility companies are ignoring renewable energy—the cheapest form of energy—and forcing their customers to pay more. As energy costs rise and extreme weather becomes more frequent, now is the time to phase out polluting, volatile, expensive fossil fuels and invest in stable, reliable, and affordable, clean energy.”

She argued that the air board failed to study the economic impacts of its new standard.
Cullenward said the air board hasn’t always clearly said what its programs cost consumers.
“Lauren has been my most trusted climate advisor and the chief architect of California’s bold climate agenda,” Newsom said.
Adrian Martinez, a lawyer with Earthjustice, said California’s air board faces “perilous times.” “Everyone breathing in California depends on it,” he said.","The California Air Resources Board is getting a new leader at a pivotal moment, as it battles President Donald Trump's administration in court and contends with growing scrutiny from Democrats and voters questioning the price of the state’s climate principles.

Liane Randolph has chaired the board of the state’s top air and climate regulator since 2020. She oversaw a range of policies including landmark clean-car and truck rules, a fuel standard with implications for gas prices and the state’s signature carbon trading program, cap-and-trade. This week, Gov. Gavin Newsom nominated his senior climate advisor, Lauren Sanchez, to replace her.

Randolph, in an interview, told CalMatters her departure was part of her “personal journey,” something she began considering earlier this year.

“I've worked really hard over the last almost five years, and I'm ready for a break,” she said. “I am confident that the transition will go incredibly smoothly.”

Observers say the handover highlights the air board’s key role at a time of political pushback and consumer resistance.

“Pretty much all of the major areas in climate that [the air board] touches are going to be in really significant periods of challenge,” said Danny Cullenward, a climate expert and vice chair of an independent committee that analyzes the cap-and-trade program. “This is not an easy time to take over an agency. It’s a time when sound strategy — and not just autopilot — is going to be required.”

California’s climate ambition meets Trump opposition

Newsom’s 2020 order to phase out gas-car sales by 2035 was a watershed moment for California climate policy. His executive order was a headline-grabbing strike at the oil industry, meant to accelerate not only the state’s adoption of electric cars, but the nation’s.

Newsom said Randolph would be the champion of that effort as his pick to lead the air board just a few months later, calling her “the kind of bold, innovative leader that will lead in our fight against climate change with equity and all California’s communities at heart.”

But Randolph faced a larger challenge than her predecessors: a Trump administration bent on thwarting California’s authority. The White House immediately criticized Newsom’s order as an example of how “extreme the left has become,” evidence that liberal policymakers wanted to “dictate every aspect of every American’s life.”

While Randolph's air board made significant policy during the years of the Biden administration, Trump attacked those efforts once he returned to office.

“Liane didn't have the time or the circumstances to pivot toward a new, adjusted strategy,” said Daniel Sperling, a former member of the board, now the director of the Institute for Transportation Studies at UC Davis. “She inherited the trajectory that California was on, and that the governor was articulating, and then she got undermined by the Trump administration.”

For the gasoline car ban, the air board held months of marathon hearings filled with car owners, environmentalists and industry lobbyists. In 2022, the board approved the measure that Newsom wanted. More rules soon followed, targeting diesel trucks, locomotives and other major polluters.

Ethan Elkind, a climate law expert at UC Berkeley, said Randolph steered the board through a difficult time.

In disputes involving environmental justice groups, he said, “she really listened to people,” building consensus and lowering tensions.

“She's always very diplomatic,” Elkind said. “She was mild-mannered, she wasn’t polemical, she didn’t use it as a perch to pontificate. She seemed very measured and steady and took her role as the public face, and the need for outreach, very seriously.”

Policies moving the state toward zero emissions vehicles have struggled, as federal and state regulators have pulled industry in opposing directions.

The Biden administration signed off on California’s clean-car rules last year. But the state air board withdrew one of its most aggressive measures on diesel trucks, as well as rules on locomotives, harbor craft and other polluters, in anticipation of Trump’s return.

“There's not a full understanding of how aggressive the administration's attacks on all of California's efforts to achieve climate action have been,” Randolph said at a CalMatters event in San Francisco. She pointed to the Trump administration’s withdrawl of a rule aimed at cleaning up nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.

“That has nothing to do with electric vehicles,” Randolph said. “It was all about just attacking California's authority, and letting the big companies who supported the administration continue to pollute communities.”

Catherine Reheis-Boyd, a senior advisor to the Western States Petroleum Association, said that under Randolph’s tenure, California’s ambition got ahead of consumers and technology. Her pushback echoed the broader clash with the Trump administration, which has targeted electric cars as costly for consumers and impractical.

“We have no problem with electric vehicles,” Reheis-Boyd said, at the San Francisco CalMatters event. But “we think there should be a free market.”

Searing climate battles at home

Last November, the air board revamped its Low Carbon Fuel Standard, a program that uses financial incentives to encourage cleaner fuels as the state phases out gasoline and diesel.

The fight exposed twin challenges arising from within the state: rising costs and lingering environmental harms not addressed by the climate policy. Consumer advocates raised alarms about gas prices, while environmentalists warned that boosting alternatives like biofuels made from cow manure or soybeans offered limited climate benefits.

Phoebe Seaton, co-director of the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability, said her group “strongly disagrees” with the expansion of the fuel standard program but credited Randolph’s leadership for showing up and listening to all parties.

“We are especially grateful for the time Chair Randolph dedicated to meeting in Pixley and Fresno with people impacted by dairies,” Seaton said.

Liane Randolph, chair of the California Air Resources Board, speaks during an EVgo fast charging station launch event at El Mercado Plaza Shopping Center in Union City on Sept. 25, 2023. The event highlighted California achieving its goal of installing 10,000 direct current fast chargers for electric vehicles. Photo by Loren Elliott for CalMatters Central valley politicians criticized the program for making fuels less affordable. Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains, a Bakersfield Democrat looking to unseat a moderate Republican in Congress, called for Randolph’s resignation earlier this year. She argued that the air board failed to study the economic impacts of its new standard. Her office did not respond to a request from CalMatters for comment.

Cullenward said the air board hasn’t always clearly said what its programs cost consumers. While Newsom and the legislature will extend cap-and-trade, the board still must decide how to reshape the program after pausing work on it during the reauthorization fight.

“One of the toughest things about this process is that being really honest about what's working — and what's not working — and what the costs of the different options are, is going to be essential,” Cullenward said. “Historically, that's not something staff have ever embraced.”

Newsom praised Randolph for stepping in during a time of uncertainty and leading with “vision and resolve.” She will leave at the end of the month, before the end of her term, which lasts through 2026.

Questions about costs, affordability and environmental concerns will continue to hang over the air board as it decides how to steer cap-and-trade and other programs in the years ahead.

Randolph, in her remarks Wednesday, said California regulators must get creative in the face of federal attacks, while also addressing public concerns and communicating why the state’s policies matter.

“All of the impacts of climate change make things fundamentally unaffordable,” she said.

Newsom’s point person steps in

Randolph’s replacement, Lauren Sanchez, has been the governor’s point person on climate from within the executive office. Translating Newsom’s vision into state policy at a key turning point while also leading a 16-member board and managing the agency’s vast, highly technical staff will present a new challenge.

Sanchez built her climate credentials on the international stage and inside the governor’s office, where she helped steer billions in budget funding for climate programs and advised Newsom on this summer’s high-stakes energy and climate package.

“He turned to the aide he trusts most on climate,” said Dean Florez, the state Senate appointee to the air board. “Lauren’s been at his side drafting the playbook and steering the billions. This isn’t a change in course, it’s keeping faith with his own circle.”

Before joining Newsom’s office in 2021, Sanchez served as a climate negotiator at the U.S. State Department and later advised John Kerry in the Biden administration. She also held senior roles at the California Environmental Protection Agency and the air board, coordinating climate policy across state agencies and shaping California’s international climate work.

“Lauren has been my most trusted climate advisor and the chief architect of California’s bold climate agenda,” Newsom said. “She is a force in her own right: her expertise, tenacity, and vision will serve California well as the Board works to protect our communities and defends our climate progress against relentless attacks from Washington.”

Sanchez played a central role in weaving climate priorities into the state budget in recent years, said Jamie Pew, climate policy advisor with NetxGen Policy. Cap-and-trade pays for a climate credit that consumers see on their utility bills; Pew said Sanchez advocated for expanding the credit during the recent legislative negotiations.

“Lauren has been a champion for getting cap and invest done this year, which will ensure that funding for critical climate programs will continue to grow at a time when federal rollbacks threaten the transition,” Pew said.

Next week, the state's top air and climate regulators will vote on amendments narrowing a previously rescinded truck rule to public fleets. The board is also advancing an emergency regulation to keep its clean-car and truck standards enforceable as the board battles the federal government in court.

Many of the air board's recent accomplishments have run into roadblocks this year. As expected, Trump quickly moved to block California’s mandates aided by Congress, signing three measures in June against clean cars and two others targeting diesel trucks.

Adrian Martinez, a lawyer with Earthjustice, said California’s air board faces “perilous times.”

Most of these actions, however, were relatively muted. The one exception to this trend was a proposed rule from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that seeks to roll back the greenhouse gas reports that entities across various sectors currently must file. Across all rulemakings, agencies published roughly $2 billion in total cost savings and cut 2.4 million paperwork burden hours.

REGULATORY TOPLINES

Proposed Rules: 21

Final Rules: 62

2025 Total Pages: 45,217

2025 Final Rule Costs: -$77.1 billion

2025 Proposed Rule Costs: -$626.6 billion

NOTABLE REGULATORY ACTIONS

The most consequential rulemaking of the week – by a wide margin – was the EPA proposal on “Reconsideration of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.” The proposed rules specifically seeks:

To amend the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) to remove program obligations for most source categories, including the distribution segment of the petroleum and natural gas systems source category (subpart W—Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems), and suspend program obligations for the remaining subpart W segments until reporting year 2034.

The agency estimates that eliminating these reporting requirements will cut 2.6 million hours of paperwork and $303 million in associated costs each year from 2025 through 2033. When discounted out under a 7-percent rate across a 10-year horizon, EPA finds that the total net present value comes out to roughly $2 billion in cost reductions.

TRACKING TRUMP 2.0

There wasn’t much in the way of major regulatory policy announcements from the White House, but there were some interesting developments on the Congressional Review Act (CRA) front. First, on Tuesday, the Senate voted down the motion to proceed on S.J. Res 60, a resolution introduced by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) seeking to repeal a Trump Administration rule. This marked the first formal legislative action on a CRA resolution introduced by a Democratic lawmaker this term.

There was also another batch of CRA resolutions introduced across both chambers and parties. H.J. Res 123 was yet another resolution of disapproval introduced by a Democratic representative directly addressing a Trump-era rule. There were, however, some others with more unique circumstances. H.J. Res 125 (and its Senate companion S.J. Res 82) would repeal a March 2025 Trump-era rule that originally seemed as though it might fall outside the purview of CRA consideration. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined that the Act did apply, however. GAO’s determination also factored into the introduction of H.J. Res 124/S.J. Res 80, a pair of resolutions addressing a Department of Interior “Record of Decision” (ROD) from 2022. Despite a years-long gap since the ROD came down and the fact that it was not a typical rulemaking document, a more recent review by GAO led to the determination that “it meets the definition of a rule under APA [Administrative Procedure Act] and no CRA exception applies.”

The American Action Forum (AAF) CRA tracker provides a full survey of activity under the law thus far in 2025. As of today, members of the 119th Congress have introduced CRA resolutions of disapproval addressing 61 rulemakings across the Biden and Trump Administrations that collectively involve $138 billion in compliance costs. Of these, 16 have been passed into law, repealing a series of Biden Administration rules that had a combined $3 billion in associated compliance costs – roughly 2 percent of that potential $138 billion total. While the main window of CRA action has largely passed, there are still outstanding resolutions that could move legislatively. AAF will continue to monitor and update such developments as appropriate.

One of the benefits to purchasing a new electric vehicle (EV) — in addition to the reduced environmental impact, as well as cost savings due to not spending on gas — is the EV tax credit.

As part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that was passed in 2022, this measure provides up to $7,500 in applicable tax credit with the purchase of a qualifying new EV, as a means to incentivize car shoppers into buying an environmentally-friendly EV instead of a gas-powered internal-combustion vehicle.

Find out below when the EV tax credit expires and how to get the tax credit.

What Is Happening to the $7,500 Credit?

On July 4, President Donald Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) into law. The OBBBA essentially set the economic agenda for Trump’s second administration by extending a number of tax cuts from his first administration, as well as cutting funding to several programs such as Medicaid and the EV tax credit.

As a result of the OBBBA, the $7,500 EV tax credit will now expire on Sept. 30.

How Can You Still Get the $7,500 Tax Credit?

Following the OBBBA’s passing, auto manufacturers initially assumed that car buyers would have to sign a purchase contract, make a down payment and physically receive their new EV by or before Sept. 30 in order to receive the credit.

However, the IRS has created something of a loophole in the credit’s expiration, per Yahoo Finance. “If a taxpayer acquires a vehicle by having a written binding contract in place and a payment made on or before Sept. 30, 2025, then the taxpayer will be entitled to claim the credit when they place the vehicle in service (namely, when they take possession of the vehicle), even if the vehicle is placed in service after Sept. 30, 2025,” according to the IRS.

In short: As long as an EV buyer signs a purchase contract and pays a deposit (or the full purchase amount) by or before Sept. 30, that buyer is entitled to the EV tax credit, even if the vehicle isn’t in their possession by that date.

What does this mean for you? Well, if you’ve been planning to purchase an EV and you can affordably make a down payment on an EV between now and Sept. 30, you’ll still be able to receive the IRA’s EV tax credit before it expires for good.",https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/charging-electric-vehicle-iStock-1133694760.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 11:03:34.749682

“By leveraging LNG mega-modules, we dramatically reduce the site footprint required for world-scale LNG production, which drives down project costs and risks,” said Michaels.

The companies did not disclose the contract value of the MSA.

McDermott, headquartered in Houston, will provide engineering, execution planning and pricing for the facility’s engineering, procurement and construction phase, according to the release. Next, Monkey Island will issue a final EPC contract aligned with the timing of Monkey Island LNG’s financing activities.

Phase 1 of the Monkey Island LNG facility will include three LNG trains with a capacity of 5.2 million metric tons per annum each and a combined production of 15.6 MTPA, according to the release. Future expansion plans include two more trains that would bring the plant’s total capacity to 26 MTPA.

McDermott, which generated $8.9 billion in revenue in 2024 and was the ninth largest builder in the U.S. by that metric, will flex its modular LNG train design on the job. Rob Shaul, senior vice president of low carbon solutions at McDermott, echoed the sentiment.

“This award underscores the depth of expertise of McDermott in LNG and modular design,” Shaul said. “Our integrated delivery model—including self-perform construction and a global network of McDermott-owned fabrication yards—positions us to deliver a solution that maximizes value while minimizing risk.”

Officials expect engineering and permitting to begin in 2026 with the first LNG production slated for the early 2030s, per the release. The project will be led by McDermott’s Houston team, supported by its engineering group in Gurugram, India.

McDermott isn’t the only firm that’s capitalizing on growth in the LNG space — Bechtel, based in Reston, Virginia, got the green light to proceed on the $6.7 billion Train 4 at Rio Grande LNG in Brownsville, Texas, earlier this month.

The phase-out of EV tax credits is more than a budgetary or political change.","The federal electric vehicle tax credit (worth up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used EVs), is officially ending on September 30, 2025. For more than a decade, these incentives have played a central role in artificially propping up EV sales, coaxing buyers toward electric cars with taxpayer-funded subsidies. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act phased them out, and the marketplace is preparing for a major shift. Let the free market be just that, free. Buyers should buy what they want, and not what the states or the federal government want.

For buyers, the deadline creates a clear choice: purchase an electric vehicle now and secure the last available credits, or wait and face a market where EVs must compete without federal assistance. For dealers and automakers, the end of this program marks the beginning of a new chapter in how vehicles are marketed, priced, and sold in the United States. This is actually good news for everyone.

The EV tax credit was originally introduced to jumpstart demand for electric vehicles and help manufacturers reach economies of scale, and entice car buyers to consider an electric vehicle. Automakers like Tesla, GM, and Nissan were among the first to benefit, as subsidies encouraged early adopters to experiment with new technology. Over time, the credit became a standard talking point for dealerships and a cornerstone of federal and some state government policies aimed at accelerating the transition to EVs and the goal of eliminating gas and diesel-powered vehicles.

But the credits also sparked controversy. Critics argued they disproportionately benefited wealthier households, who were more likely to afford EVs even without subsidies, and actually be able to take advantage of the tax credit. Many Americans pointed out that taxpayers who never purchased an EV were footing the bill for those who did. By 2024, as EV sales slowed despite the ongoing credit, questions grew louder about whether the program was delivering meaningful results.

Under the OBBBA, the federal EV tax credit ends September 30, 2025. After that date, buyers will no longer be able to claim the tax credit of up to $7,500 on new EVs, $4,000 on used ones, or the $1,000 credit for a home charger. This change eliminates the point-of-sale rebates that dealers have leaned on heavily to close EV deals.

The immediate impact is urgency. Dealers are moving quickly to advertise “last chance” opportunities for buyers to lock in the tax credit. Automakers with qualifying models are pushing aggressive campaigns to clear inventory before the deadline. Dealers fear they will be stuck with a fleet of electric cars and minimal sales. Buyers who act now could save thousands, but once October arrives, those savings vanish.

Without federal support, the EV market faces a test. Will demand hold steady, or will sales cool once the financial incentive disappears? Industry analysts are divided. What’s my analysis? I see a sharp decline in EV adoption, especially among cost-conscious buyers. I expect the demand to be below a 4% purchase rate in the US. Others believe the market will gradually stabilize as more affordable EV models reach production and as states continue offering their own incentives. The issue is battery costs, increased insurance rates and huge price escalation in electricity prices.

Dealers are preparing for the possibility that EV sales will slow way down. Many are already shifting focus to hybrids and traditional gas-powered vehicles, which remain central to American driving habits. There is another way to save some money for new car buyers, an auto loan interest deduction under the OBBBA, available for U.S.-assembled vehicles of all types, have become a more important sales tool than the expiring EV credit.

One overlooked consequence of the EV credit’s end is its impact on manufacturing strategy. Automakers have spent years aligning production to maximize eligibility, ensuring that vehicles meet North American assembly requirements to qualify for the credit. With that incentive gone, companies will have greater flexibility in where and how they produce EVs. Car companies took massive losses on every vehicle they sold. For lost $40,000 on every Lightning truck, other brands took equal losses. This is not the way to do business. It caused car makers to increase costs on all their vehicles making it harder for many to afford a new car.

At the same time, the OBBBA’s focus on U.S.-assembled vehicles for loan interest deductions keeps domestic manufacturing in the spotlight. Buyers financing new American-assembled cars (whether electric, hybrid, or gas-powered), stand to gain valuable tax savings even after September 30. In effect, the policy is shifting the incentive away from what type of vehicle you buy, and toward where it is built.

For consumers, timing matters. Buyers who are serious about purchasing an EV should act before the deadline to capture the last available credit. However, it’s equally important to evaluate whether the vehicle makes financial sense in the long term without subsidies. Factors such as charging infrastructure, battery replacement costs, and resale value remain significant considerations. Resale value on used electric cars is not good.

Some households may find greater value in waiting. As the market adjusts, automakers may respond with price cuts, new financing options, or incentives of their own to sustain demand. Dealers will be very motivated to move EVs off lots if inventory slows, potentially creating better deals. Leasing would be your smartest move at that point.

The phase-out of EV tax credits is more than a budgetary or political change. It’s a signal of a broader shift in bipartisan policy. For years, Washington used subsidies to push the auto market toward electrification. If they failed to meet the numbers they were fined billion of dollars. Now, the emphasis is moving toward empowering buyers with broader tax relief, such as the new loan interest deduction, while reducing federal dependency on technology-specific incentives.

Whether this results in a more balanced marketplace or a setback for EV adoption remains to be seen. What is certain is that the market will now have to stand on its own. Automakers that can deliver reliable, affordable vehicles that do not rely on subsidies and can produce what consumers want.

September 30 is a clear turning point. For buyers, it is the last chance to claim thousands of dollars in federal support for an EV purchase. For automakers and dealers, it is the end of a crutch that has shaped sales strategies for over a decade. And for the broader economy, it marks the beginning of a new approach – one that rewards American manufacturers and consumer choice rather than federal pressure for a single technology or type of propulsion.

Can the EV market maintain momentum without subsidies, especially in North America? What is for certain, we have a big win for customer choice.

Living in a post-storm Western NC Those economic uncertainties are plaguing folks in the mountains as well one year after Helene.","One year ago, Tropical Storm Helene struck Western North Carolina. Rivers rejected their boundaries and trees slid from their mountains. Houses were uprooted from their foundations. Roads buckled under pressure. Lives were thrown from their course. The storm was cataclysmic. For 12 months, the region has focused on recovery, rebuilding and healing. One year after Helene, it has emerged transformed: battered, but in many respects stronger.

Small businesses like restaurants, tourist attractions and farms are bouncing back. Even so, in parts of the mountains, some are still struggling for basics such as food, housing and good health. One year after Helene, Western North Carolina’s recovery is still a work in progress — one that will determine not just whether the region returns to what it was, but what it becomes.

Reckoning with life, one year after Helene

One year after Helene, emotions run high. Physical reminders of the destruction remain, but the anniversary is a mental reminder, one that threatens to reopen certain scars.

“It is OK to feel like you are grieving a loss right now, because we did lose a lot,” David Jackson, president of the Boone Chamber of Commerce, told Carolina Public Press.

“We lost time. We lost people. We lost places. We have been so concerned and busy with restoring that not everybody has fully processed what happened. This one-year milestone will do that.”

Beside that grief, however, is hope. For Fabrice Julien, professor of health science at UNC-Asheville, balancing the two isn’t always easy.

“There’s this optimism, this feeling that something better could be just over the horizon,” Julien said. “In the background, though, that destruction remains. Behind every smile and every laugh, there’s a temporary moment of pause.”

This isn’t just any time of year in the North Carolina mountains. Helene struck at the most lucrative time for the region: the changing of the autumn leaves. This is when folks in the mountains make their “hibernating money,” as Jackson puts it. They did not get the chance to make that money last year.

Earning a living in a post-Helene NC

Employment has bounced back one year after the storm. Since January, the jobless rate in Buncombe County, home to Asheville, dropped from 6.8% — North Carolina’s highest at the time — down to 4.1% this summer. That’s a sign of a healthy economy returning.

“The health of the body before any injuries is really important to how you recover,” said Clark Duncan, director of the Asheville Chamber of Commerce. “Luckily, we were in robust economic health before the storm.”

Still, many small businesses in the mountains are on shaky ground one year later. They desperately need an injection of money but can’t stand to take out another loan.

In downtown Asheville, however, Meghan Rogers, director of the Asheville Independent Restaurant Coalition, sees reason for cautious optimism.

“I am feeling positive and hopeful, and I tend to be a glass-half-empty kind of girl,” Rogers told CPP.

“I have seen the gumption and the grit that our independent restaurants have shown to get reopened and to hire back. I’ve been overwhelmed at what it takes, what they’ve shown from day one through an entire year. Please come and see us.”

Some businesses and restaurants have even reopened in Asheville’s devastated River Arts District one year after Helene. But the continued health of the small business community relies heavily — perhaps too heavily — on the success of this fall.

“People are on a really thin margin right now,” Jackson said. “We need our fall to behave. We need sunny days and a lot of tourists.”

Visiting a post-Helene NC

The loss of tourism dollars over the past year has been devastating for the region. The immediate loss of the most valuable months was reinforced by the prolonged perception that the mountains were not open for business.

One year later, park visitation at Grandfather Mountain is down nearly 20% compared to this point in 2024.

The leisure and hospitality industry in Asheville is down 10% in terms of employment, Duncan said.

Rutherford County lost up to 50% of is average tourism revenue. The Rutherford County Tourism Development Authority had to lay off three employees, according to director Don Cason.

“It is pretty devastating,” Cason said. “Businesses have had to recover and survive without hardly any income.”

In the destruction, though, Rutherford County sees opportunity to reimagine itself. Before the storm, the upper portion of the Broad River was 100 feet wide. One year later, its banks are 600 feet apart, according to Cason. The county is planning to build hiking and biking trails in that extra space, hopefully attracting more visitors.

Businesses and local governments across the mountains are welcoming everyone back with open arms.

“We need you,” said Jeff Kaplan, director of Venture Asheville. “We are not going to make it back, to build a stronger, better Asheville in the future, without our visitor support. Everyone here benefits from visitors. Please come back.”

Unfortunately, visitor spending across the state has been slow this year so far, according to Marlise Taylor, director of tourism research at VisitNC. That’s due to an uncertain economy and fears of recession — many are closing their pocketbooks and staying put.

Living in a post-storm Western NC

Those economic uncertainties are plaguing folks in the mountains as well one year after Helene. A significant portion of Western North Carolina's population is still struggling to meet basic needs.

Access to food and shelter was already strained in parts of the North Carolina mountains. The storm deepened those insecurities. In communities like Spruce Pine and Swannanoa, grocery stores have not yet reopened. Food banks and housing services are serving record numbers of people.

MANNA Foodbank is seeing more than 170,000 visits per month across its 16-county service area. That’s the most the foodbank has served in its 42-year history.

“This is due to the storm, as well as the rising cost of goods and the stagnant wages in our region,” Micah Chrisman, spokesperson for MANNA, told CPP.

“People are having to work multiple jobs to make ends meet. They’re choosing between buying their medicine or paying for groceries or paying rent. The cost of living is just too high. Businesses in our area may be open, but they are not able to pay livable wages. Rich and poor people are coming to our pantries.”

The increased demand isn't just from people who lost jobs or homes in the storm. One year later, Sarah Banks, health director for Haywood County, describes seeing teachers, nurses and middle-income families accessing county services for the first time.

In Spruce Pine, where the town’s only dedicated grocery store remains closed due to catastrophic flooding, traffic at the local food bank is staggering.

At Mitchell County Shepherd’s Staff, director Starli McDowell says she served 1,979 households in August. The population of Spruce Pine is only 2,192.

McDowell says Shepherd’s Staff is still giving out clean water just as fast as they can get it, and helping folks pay their bills, fix their wells and repair their homes.

Those with homes to repair count themselves lucky. The housing crisis, which already plagued Western North Carolina, continues to fester one year after the storm.

Evictions are on the rise, according to David Bartholomew, an attorney at Pisgah Legal Services. Rents briefly declined immediately after the storm but quickly returned to pre-Helene levels and have remained elevated. Activists were lobbying for an eviction moratorium in the aftermath of the storm, but it never materialized. Bartholomew says as the months pass, landlords and property managers are becoming less inclined to work with assistance programs.

Last week, 100 people in danger of eviction were lined up at the door of Grace Covenant, an Asheville church that has dedicated itself to rent assistance. On that day, Grace Covenant dedicated $50,000 of its funding and $15,000 from the Long-Term Recovery Group to stop evictions, according to pastor Marcia Shoop.

“There are a lot of people on the edge,” Shoop told CPP. “And there are so many kinds of edges people can fall off.”

One year after Helene, street homelessness has increased measurably in Asheville. According to Asheville homeless agency Homeward Bound, point-in-time count data from January 2025 showed 328 unsheltered individuals in the Asheville area, up from 219 in 2024 — an increase of 50%.

Meanwhile, the number of people in transitional housing decreased from 250 to 157. Temporary solutions are running out faster than permanent ones can be found.

Many of Homeward Bound’s clients navigated the everchanging deadlines and extensions for FEMA hotel and temporary shelter vouchers that have now expired.

“That created a lot of instability for our clients, many of whom we are still in the process of rehousing,” said Ansley Carter, spokesperson for Homeward Bound. “A year later, we still see people at the lowest income level struggling to move from those temporary situations into stable housing.”

A year of contradictions

The economic recovery in the mountains defies easy conclusions.

In many ways, the region has bounced back remarkably. Unemployment rates have returned to healthier levels. Most businesses have reopened. Infrastructure is largely restored. The mountains bill themselves as open for business.

But those facts obscure a complex reality. At the one-year mark, much remains to worry about. Food banks are serving more people than ever before. Street homelessness has increased 50% in Asheville. Teachers and nurses are relying on assistance programs. In Spruce Pine, nearly as many households visited the food pantry as live in the town.

Still, hope abounds.

“This is going to sound like a cliché, but it isn’t,” John Mitchell, Henderson County manager, told CPP.

“The residents of this county, the folks who work in emergency management, the churches, everyone else: they have looked after our neighbors. They’ve done the hard work to get this community back on its feet.

“There is still suffering. There is no doubt about that. But this recovery has been profound.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/044400f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2762x1450+0+189/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F59%2Fc9%2F49ff6c8044bbb3869f7ad434fd6b%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-22-at-9-07-18-am.png,N,,2025-09-22 11:04:17.957246

TVA issued a Letter of Intent (LOI) signaling interest in deploying Type One’s “Infinity Two” stellarator fusion technology once it reaches commercial readiness.

Infinity Two is designed as a first-generation baseload fusion plant, employing stellarator technology—a fusion approach already proven to achieve stable, steady-state plasma operation. Type One Energy emphasizes that the plant will use existing materials and technologies, aiming for faster deployment compared with rival fusion concepts that remain in the experimental stage. The LOI also envisions potential training uses for the plant’s prototype facilities, positioning Oak Ridge as a hub for workforce development in advanced nuclear.

TVA President and CEO Don Moul said the project could make Tennessee the home of the first U.S. commercial stellarator fusion facility, underscoring TVA’s role in supplying reliable, carbon-free energy to support surging electricity demand from artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and advanced manufacturing.

For Tennessee, the project bolsters Governor Bill Lee’s broader push to develop a “nuclear ecosystem” in the state. Oak Ridge already has a storied history in nuclear research, and officials say this next phase could deliver both economic growth and high-value jobs in the Tennessee Valley.

Type One Energy, founded in 2019 and venture-backed in 2023, is pursuing what it calls a low-risk commercialization pathway, blending computational physics, advanced manufacturing, and high-field superconducting magnets. The company’s FusionDirect program is designed to shorten the timeline for delivering market-ready plants. CEO Christofer Mowry described the TVA partnership as “the world’s first private-sector fusion power plant project.”

The agreement remains preliminary. Any final commitment to build Infinity Two will require TVA Board approval, regulatory clearance, and alignment with TVA’s least-cost planning processes. The LOI does not yet include funding or offtake contracts for the plant’s energy output.

The announcement reflects broader momentum in the U.S. toward advanced nuclear innovation, as utilities explore options beyond fission to meet demand. While fusion remains unproven at commercial scale, the TVA–Type One partnership highlights growing confidence that the technology could move from laboratory experiments toward real-world power generation within the next decade.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/oilprice.com/3270883a29ee4206fc51ec8bddba327e,N,,2025-09-22 12:06:40.755056

“While data centers are the source of new load, there’s an enormous opportunity to tap VPPs as the new source of grid flexibility,” said Hertz-Shargel.

Looking ahead, the Wood Mackenzie report identifies “regulatory pushback” as a key obstacle to further VPP integration, pointing to utilities’ practice of rate basing distributed energy resources – including the cost of distributed energy systems in the utilities’ asset base, from which they can earn a return – as one that limits opportunities for new distributed energy investment.

In most states hosting Microsoft facilities, grid electricity remains at least 50% fossil fuel-generated, and new data centers will instigate additional coal and gas consumption.
“The sheer scale of Microsoft’s AI data center buildout could have global implications for the climate, and it also comes with serious impacts for local communities.
These data centers contribute to higher electricity rates and raise concerns over water supply in the regions where they are clustered,” said Rachel Kitchin, Senior Corporate Campaigner at Stand.earth.

SEATTLE (Traditional Puget Sound Salish and Duwamish Lands) — A new report released today by environmental advocacy group Stand.earth finds that Microsoft’s rapid expansion of AI data centers is set to lock in massive new fossil fuel infrastructure, undermining the company’s 100% renewable energy and carbon-negative commitments, and threatening community health across the U.S.

The report, titled Global Ramifications, Local Impact: Microsoft’s AI Pollution Footprint, finds that Microsoft’s electricity demand for AI data centers will surge over 600% by 2030, which is enough to power the entire New England region, or 12% of all homes in the U.S. Despite the company’s significant investments in renewable-energy generation, the report also reveals that most of Microsoft’s North American data centers still draw at least 50% of their power from coal and gas grids — which will result in utilities planning new gas plants, pipeline expansions, and coal-plant life extensions to meet the growing load.

The report’s key findings include the following:

North American electricity demand from Microsoft data centers will surge over 600% by 2030 — enough to power 12% of all homes in the U.S., or almost the entire electricity consumption of the New England region (i.e., Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont).

In most states hosting Microsoft facilities, grid electricity remains at least 50% fossil fuel-generated, and new data centers will instigate additional coal and gas consumption.

Microsoft’s data center pollution (i.e., Scope 1 and 2) reached over 7.87 million metric tons of CO₂e (i.e., carbon dioxide equivalent) globally in its 2023 fiscal year — an amount that exceeds the annual climate pollution generated by the state of Vermont.

Colocation deals obscure the full scale of pollution: Microsoft leads all hyperscalers in pre-leased third-party capacity, but provides 0% dedicated reporting on its energy use or pollution.

“The sheer scale of Microsoft’s AI data center buildout could have global implications for the climate, and it also comes with serious impacts for local communities. These data centers contribute to higher electricity rates and raise concerns over water supply in the regions where they are clustered,” said Rachel Kitchin, Senior Corporate Campaigner at Stand.earth. “If Microsoft is set to demand as much energy as an entire U.S. region, the least the company can do is ensure that demand isn’t met with fossil fuels that pollute local communities. Microsoft can’t hand-wave away community concerns with sleight-of-hand promises of future clean energy, or greenwash its ongoing love affair with fossil fuels — these new data centers must be backed by new, locally sourced, 24/7 renewable energy before they go online.”

A case study included in the new report analyzes proposals underway in Person County, North Carolina, which is home to multiple coal plants, including one of the largest coal plants in the U.S. As a result, its communities have dealt with decades of toxic pollution, including groundwater with high levels of arsenic, chromium, cobalt, and selenium, as well as radioactivity 11 times the maximum contaminant concentration limit. A planned AI build-out in the county has prompted Duke Energy to propose new gas turbines, pipeline extensions, and even consider extending coal-plant operations — threatening air quality, water supplies, and community well-being in a historically marginalized region. While Microsoft has not formally announced that this site will house a data center, at a spring 2025 hearing held by the North Carolina House Committee on Energy and Public Utilities, an American Petroleum Institute representative gave a presentation that identified this site as a Microsoft data center.

“Big companies like Microsoft can make their own clean energy and work with the utility to make sure that everyone has enough reliable power – and regular customers shouldn’t have to pay for expensive dirty power plants and pipelines when our needs can be served by clean energy,” said Steph Gans, Assistant Director of Clean Water for North Carolina. “It’s like asking us to pay for Bill Gates’s electric bill. If Microsoft really didn’t want their data centers to be used as an excuse to build more fossil fuel projects and charge customers for it, they would intervene in North Carolina’s carbon plan proceedings, they would speak out against lobbyists who use their projects as a reason to push gas-friendly legislation, and they would already have a plan to use clean energy for their projects.”

The report concludes with the following recommendations:

New data centers must be powered by 24/7 renewable energy: To ensure new data center energy demand isn’t being met by fossil fuels or false solutions that pose new risks, Microsoft must make a commitment to build out local, additional 24/7 renewable energy infrastructure before its data centers begin operation.

Increase transparency around hourly matching energy procurement: Microsoft should publicly report granular data around the implementation of hourly matching to ensure the energy needs of its data centers are met by renewable power at all times of the day.

Scale up community benefit programs: Microsoft should ensure timely, active, and good-faith outreach to communities where it wants to establish data centers.

Establish and enforce these same renewable energy, transparency, and community benefit standards for colocation data centers: As a large user of colocation facilities, Microsoft should use its power to pressure the colocation data centers it contracts with to follow the same protocols it implements to reduce environmental and community harms.

Strengthen voluntary and regulatory reporting standards: Leading AI companies must advocate in support of ending reporting loopholes in global target-setting initiatives such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which permit low quality renewable energy procurement, and support a shift to granular (i.e., 24/7) energy accounting.

“Right now we’re at a crossroads. The direction Microsoft chooses for its AI strategy will directly impact both the global climate and local communities across the U.S.,” said Kitchin. “Done correctly, Microsoft and other leading AI providers have a chance to rapidly accelerate our society’s shift to a renewable energy future with a new type of climate commitment fit for the age of AI. Microsoft can provide real benefits to the communities and grids where they operate, and make itself a major force for positive change on both a local and global scale.”

Telle’s action represents a key step toward implementing the National Energy Emergency declared in President Trump’s Executive Order 14156 dated Jan. 20, 2025, which is effectively ensuring American Energy Dominance

“The guidance that I provided to the Corps today is in direct response to President Trump’s leadership and vision to make America energy dominant,” said Telle. “Our nation has a finite amount of land that we must use efficiently to compete globally during the 21st Century, and the Corps will now consider an energy generation project's energy density or energy- generation-per-acre as it makes permitting decisions.

“We will prioritize those projects that generate the highest energy return on investment for the American public. This policy will conserve land, reduce environmental impact, and incentivize energy generation at a time when we cannot waste our precious land resources.”

The guidance directs the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to prioritize processing Clean Water Act and Rivers and Harbors Act permit applications related to projects that would generate the most annual energy generation per acre over projects with low generation per acre. Considerations will include a project’s annual potential energy generation per acre, whether it would displace more reliable energy sources, and whether it would denigrate the aesthetics of America’s natural landscape.

Energy generation types vary in how much land they require to generate the same amount of power and therefore vary in how much they impact the environment. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), to generate 2,000 megawatts, an onshore wind farm requires 170,000 acres and a solar farm requires 12,000 acres.

Demonstrations have shown how they can be sped up with AI tools for document management and simulations of the power grid.","As hyperscalers and AI companies rapidly expand their computing resources to train better models and provide services to users, AI’s impact on energy is attracting scrutiny. The coming fleet of data centers will feature some of the largest individual sources of electricity demand and while there is substantial uncertainty about exactly how much electricity data centers will consume, growth toward 10 percent of U.S. electricity within this decade is a reasonable estimate. Such growth has raised questions about how the United States can adequately supply electricity to power this technology while maintaining grid security, affordability, and progress toward environmental goals.

Powering AI will surely impact electricity demand, and it is increasingly likely that AI itself will transform electricity grid operations. Modern AI tools can process large amounts of data, explore and optimize solutions to complex problems, and be used by centralized and decentralized decisionmakers to find local and global optima. AI should therefore be particularly helpful in the electricity sector, which is replete with data and clear performance metrics (e.g., price, reliability, revenue, and efficiency). These interventions would be welcomed and timely for the sector, which is now challenged with meeting multiple imperatives and has emerged as a priority issue for policymakers on both sides of the aisle.

Grid Applications of AI

There have been some excellent and in-depth reviews of AI applications to the electricity sector, which have informed and inspired this analysis. In particular, a recent systematic review of papers documenting how AI and machine learning tools can be applied to energy systems found dozens of examples where AI was providing documented improvements over existing practices and key insights for how they can be classified in terms of specific AI technologies and maturity, as well as issues for public policy. Additionally, the Department of Energy published a comprehensive report highlighting AI applications to modernize the grid, and the International Energy Agency published an in-depth study of both the energy demands of AI and its potential applications within energy.

This analysis is not intended to comprehensively identify all potential contributions of AI to the electricity sector, but rather to highlight the near-term solutions readily scalable to help address the three core challenges facing the electricity sector: reliability, operational efficiency, and rapid growth.

Managing AI Induced Grid Vulnerabilities

As these applications demonstrate, AI has the potential to mitigate immediate challenges facing today’s electricity grid. However, implementing these tools requires careful attention to the inevitable new risks that arise from deploying new technologies. Because the electricity sector is so critical, complex, and sensitive, appropriate measures must be put in place to ensure these benefits are safely realized.

The key challenge for policy makers is to strike a balance between encouraging AI adoption where it most enhances reliability, efficiency, and growth while safeguarding critical infrastructure with appropriate governance and oversight mechanisms. Implementation at scale will need appropriate safeguards for maintaining cybersecurity.

Risks from AI integration with the grid span the value chain. In the case of real-time decision support, AI systems are considered black boxes, making it difficult to verify and validate tool outputs before implementing system-wide changes. Faulty or poorly trained models could amplify, rather than reduce, reliability concerns. Similarly, because AI systems themselves are so complex, pairing them with the already complicated grid architecture could lead to new failure modes. Existing literature has sought to highlight these risks and recommend mitigation measures. For example, the DOE Office of Cybersecurity, Energy, and Emergency Response wrote a report on the potential risks of expanding the use of AI in critical energy infrastructure.

Due to the criticality of the grid, electricity planners, regulators, utilities, and operators are historically risk adverse. Integrating AI solutions at scale—especially those informing real-time and automated operational responses—will be a slow process without policymakers supporting clear objectives, industry working together to iterate and learn quickly, and appropriate safeguards in place for consumers and the grid.

Effective risk mitigation will be essential for building confidence in AI applications on the grid. Protecting customer privacy through data anonymization can reduce exposure to misuse of sensitive information, such as household occupancy patterns. Establishing clear industry standards will give utilities and regulators a shared foundation for evaluating tools, while maintaining human oversight in critical decisions can ensure accountability. Robust testing environments, digital twinning, and regulatory sandboxes will allow new applications to be trialed safely before widespread deployment, and system redundancies can provide additional safeguards to preserve reliability if AI-enabled systems fail. Together, these measures can help translate technical innovation into trustworthy practice.

Key Observations and Policy Recommendations

America's AI Action Plan identifies the “limited and slow adoption of AI” as a key bottleneck to realizing its potential economywide impacts, citing “distrust or lack of understanding of the technology, a complex regulatory landscape, and a lack of clear governance and risk mitigation standards.” These barriers are evident in electricity, where AI tools show clear promise but remain at the pilot stage.

Although AI offers significant opportunities for improving reliability, cutting costs, and permitting growth, adoption has been uneven. A Federation of American Scientists report identified 12 high-value AI applications for the grid, yet even the most technically mature are not applied at scale in the United States. Surveys from the International Energy Agency confirm this globally: Grid operators reported using AI for asset management and planning (70 percent) or grid development (54 percent), while fewer than one-quarter (23 percent) reported deploying AI in daily operations such as load forecasting. Operators expressed skepticism about relying on AI for critical decisions, preferring advisory roles for software and maintaining traditional standards.

To realize the benefits of AI in energy, the United States must balance the try-first experimentalism preferred in the digital economy with the stringent safety and reliability demands of the power system. Achieving this balance will require political leadership from the federal government to prioritize strategic projects, support near-term demonstrations, and promote best practices through standards and information sharing.

Some immediate policy recommendations are as follows:

Develop standards to capture reliability benefits of AI. The AI Action Plan calls for a coordinated federal approach to domain-specific efforts led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In doing so, NIST could lead in adapting its AI Risk Management Framework—a voluntary framework that guides the safe and trustworthy design, deployment, and use of AI—to grid applications for load forecasting, fault detection, and other operational matters. Working with the DOE, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and industry, NIST could define standards that would give operators and their regulators a shared basis for validating AI’s performance and reliability, building confidence in the tools that are developed so that they can be widely adopted. The DOE and states could use those standards in supporting grid enhancement projects and implementation initiatives with grants and loans.

Allow FERC to incorporate AI into grid planning and expansion. Prolonged interconnection processes are stalling the development of new generation. Demonstrations have shown how they can be sped up with AI tools for document management and simulations of the power grid. Defining how these tools can be used by grid planners is a key task for regulators and thus should be a FERC-led process. The Federation of American Scientists recommends that a FERC-DOE-RTO working group convene to “clarify the regulatory pathway for AI use cases in grid planning,” a proposal which would bring the right parties into the process and provide clarity on how AI-enabled tools can inform long-term investment and expansion decisions.

Define priority regions for demonstration projects. The DOE has existing authority to support grid enhancements and projects that would implement AI in applications such as dynamic line ratings. With substantial expertise in grid flows and data center development, the DOE can define priority areas where congestion is exacerbating electricity rates and limiting growth. Deploying AI-assisted tools such as dynamic line ratings and distributed energy resource management in high-impact contexts will build confidence, generate replicable models, and demonstrate the value of federal leadership.

Support demand flexibility, large and small. The AI Action plan cites data center flexibility as a key tool for improving grid efficiency and accommodating new demand. Federal support should extend this principle to encourage distributed participation through virtual power plants and other distributed resources. Expanding demand-side options will give utilities and regulators more tools to deploy during periods of peak load, and consumers access to the benefits ofa more dynamic grid.

Economy-Wide Energy Effects

This paper has thus far focused on what AI can do in support of the electricity sector and highlighted several areas where AI tools can address the challenges that sector faces today. Resolving these issues through the application of AI and broader reforms to the energy sector will be important for a thriving economy in the future. But AI can and will affect energy use more broadly.

AI tools will help deliver efficiencies across energy intensive sectors of the economy, where firms adopt practices to reduce costs and increase output. In its AI and Energy report, the International Energy Agency estimated energy savings across key subsectors by 2035 that could be achieved with AI applications (See Table 2). Based on projected 2035 U.S. demand, AI applications could save nearly 2,500 petajoules (PJ) of energy for the U.S. if fully realized. This translates to approximately 4.5 percent of 2035 demand in the three most energy intensive sectors.

Applications for AI thus create opportunities to make industry, transportation, and buildings more productive in terms of total energy usage (not just electricity). And since these sectors have traditionally been labeled hard to abate because they are difficult to electrify, AI-driven energy reduction could provide another pathway towards marginal decarbonization.

Whether AI can provide tools to accelerate larger increases energy productivity of the economy, in the same way economists expect it to increase labor productivity, is an important question beyond AI’s own energy consumption or applications to the grid.

Conclusion

AI tools are uniquely positioned to address problems in energy, a sector replete with data, complex optimization problems, and multiple layers of governance. The tools already under development will enhance efficiencies, save companies and consumers money, and help realize new business models and technologies. However, without appropriate safeguards and regulatory oversight, the same AI solutions that could enhance grid operations could unleash new vulnerabilities to this critical infrastructure. The question facing policymakers is how those tools might be utilized to solve immediate problems facing society, and how those can be prioritized and accelerated while moderating the degree of additional risk.

The United States has adopted a strong stance toward winning the AI race, recognizing the economic and security stakes of being at the front of the line in this new technology. The country is now rushing to enable that victory by increasing the availability of electricity for datacenters through vigorous investment, accelerated permitting for individual projects, and infrastructure strategies. As that is done, applying AI solutions to the energy sector could help reduce friction in expanding and operating an increasingly complex grid. Reliable and affordable electricity at the scale necessary to meet the needs of innovative industries of the future is key to U.S. economic security and competitiveness. AI is a driver of challenges to the grid but should also be seen as a tool that can be leveraged to enhance the grid and allow the electricity sector to rise to the challenge.

Temperatures flare

Climate change may be a nonstarter for the Trump administration, but activists and scientists haven’t taken their feet off the gas pedal as they pressure the rest of the world to live up to previously agreed climate commitments — a pressure campaign that will be out in full force this week in New York.

Except the specifics of those commitments are largely MIA at the moment.

This year, all countries that signed the Paris Agreement are required to submit their new climate pledges. These nationally determined contributions, or NDCs, must be sent every five years to demonstrate each country’s commitments to help the world stick to the goal of keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Usually, NDCs are submitted long before UNGA, but this year, only 36 out of 197 countries have published their NDCs, writes my colleague Jesse Chase-Lubitz, who will be at Climate Week. Still missing from the list are some of the world’s biggest emitters, including India, Saudi Arabia, the European Union, and Indonesia.

A high-level meeting of 40 heads of state on Sept. 24, when each leader will give a preview of their country’s NDCs, will be the first window into the missing commitments.

“This is an important moment,” Marcos Neto, assistant administrator at the U.N. Development Programme, tells Jesse.

He’s not especially worried about the number of NDCs still to be submitted — pointing out that there has been a consensus throughout the U.N. that “quality and ambition is more important than doing it in a hurry” and that so far the NDCs submitted are “fundamentally a better set of NDCs.”

Those that have already been sent in, he says, are “better, more ambitious, more investible. They take cost into account, and are far more whole-of-society than before.”

Forced reform

Back to UNGA (expect to hear that a lot this week). An overarching theme will be reforming the U.N. itself, motivated in no small part by U.S. President Donald Trump’s budget cuts, which have forced the U.N. to slash its own budget, fire staff, and consolidate agencies, as my colleague Colum Lynch has been detailing for months.

Trump’s fingerprints on the process have engendered deep skepticism among U.N. staffers and experts, who claim the reforms are a hasty cost-cutting exercise rather than a carefully thought-out blueprint for making the U.N. more relevant.

“I have no doubt there’s a lot of efficiencies to be had, and people should be brave and try to tackle it,” Elizabeth Campbell, the executive director of ODI Global Washington, told Colum during a recent Devex Pro Briefing with Richard Gowan, the U.N. and multilateral diplomacy director at the International Crisis Group. “I am highly skeptical that the U.N. itself can effectively pursue that kind of reform. I don’t really see it able to do it,” Campbell said.

For his part, Gowan argues that U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres’ consolidation project has been hindered by internal bureaucratic resistance, a lack of clarity in U.S. plans for the U.N., and a dwindling timetable as Guterres enters his final year as head of the world body.

“When you talk to diplomats, most of them will say: Yeah, we support UN80. This needs to happen just to keep the ship afloat, but we’re going to wait for the next person, whoever she is, or whoever he is, and we’re going to see if we can find a new secretary-general who will have the time and the political capital to really drive a much bigger strategic review of where the U.N. is going.”

Fine line

When does sexual education for teenagers cross the line? What is that imaginary line anyway? Who draws it and who has the power to erase it?

There are no easy answers, but it’s a constant battle of wills in today’s culture wars. One of those confrontations is playing out at UNICEF, which scrubbed its website of guides meant to help teenagers navigate their bodies and relationships, after a conservative U.S. advocacy group accused the agency of pushing “sexually explicit programs targeting children.”

For the Center for Family and Human Rights, or C-Fam, UNICEF’s sexual education publications normalized LGBTQ+ relationships, promoted masturbation, and encouraged girls to explore their anatomy, among other things.

For some UNICEF staff, it was critical information that’s now been censored — setting a worrying precedent.

“What do children and young people want and need? That should be the core of what we do — a lot of what was taken down had been designed and discussed with them and with their caretakers,” a staffer tells my colleague Ayenat Mersie.

But Lisa Correnti, C-Fam’s executive vice president, tells Ayenat that taking down web pages did not amount to a win: “The removal of its public-facing material cannot be regarded as a success if the agency continues to promote the same controversial issues and materials in a less visible manner.”

All-nighter

Back in Washington, D.C., lawmakers in the U.S. Congress have been engaged in their own pitched political battles. One notable debate that the development community kept a close eye on was the reauthorization of the U.S. Department of State, which is managing the foreign assistance portfolio it inherited from the U.S. Agency for International Development.

After a nearly 36-hour marathon session, the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a set of bills that would not only reauthorize the State Department, but also put in place a new organizational structure and set of policies, including how it would focus foreign assistance — assuming the bills become law.

That’s a long way away. Historically, State Department reauthorizations have been a bear, so getting this latest one out of committee is merely a first step. The full House still needs to approve it. Then the Senate will have its own proposal, which would have to be reconciled with the House version and then approved again by both houses of Congress. Then it heads to Trump’s desk.

Still, the nascent bills offer a useful window into what foreign assistance might look like in its new home. Among other things, they would create an undersecretary for foreign assistance, a director, and an Office of Foreign Assistance Oversight.

Republicans cheered — and pushed through — the passage, while Democrats booed it.

On the overall restructuring of the State Department, Rep. Chris Smith, a Republican from New Jersey, said, “The administration has already showed this model delivers faster, more effective assistance while strengthening U.S. credibility abroad.”

But Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the committee, criticized the bills for “rubber-stamping the Trump administration’s illegal action to shutter USAID.”

The partisan divide mirrors the larger schism over federal spending, which will consume both chambers over the next few weeks, so don’t expect the reauthorization to be a priority, especially as the U.S. government careens toward a shutdown if no budget deal is reached by Sept. 30.

What: Lush created a limited-edition body bar called “It’s Getting Hot in Here” to raise awareness about climate justice and phasing out fossil fuels.

When: Available in stores across the U.S. and Canada during Climate Week (Sept 21–Oct 3, 2025).

Why: 75% of profits from the body bar go to Oil Change International and aligned groups fighting for a fast, fair, and funded phaseout of fossil fuels.

How to Join: Purchase the product in-store or online, share your vision of a fossil fuel–free future through Lush’s interactive activity, and sign up with OCI to keep building the movement.

Every person deserves clean air to breathe, safe water to drink, and a stable climate to live in. But fossil fuel executives knowingly destroy our planet for profit and frontline communities are paying the highest price.

The fossil fuel industry makes billions in record profits, while wildfires choke our air, heat domes scorch our cities, and floods wipe out homes. This isn’t an accident, it’s the cost of their greed.

At Oil Change International (OCI), we fight to stop it. For twenty years, our mission has been to expose the real cost of oil, gas, and coal, and fight for a fast, fair, and funded phaseout of fossil fuels. We’re data-driven, people-powered, and justice focused.

Communities over fossil fuel executives

The climate crisis is a justice issue. Indigenous, Black, and low-income communities are often hit first and worst by climate disasters. They’re also leading the charge for change.

From Louisiana to Nigeria, we partner with frontline organizers who fight back against fossil fuel expansion. In California, we’ve worked alongside youth activists pushing for an end to neighborhood oil drilling. In Japan, we support campaigns to stop dangerous new fossil fuel projects and hold governments and companies accountable.

And we don’t just fight fossil fuels—we follow the money. OCI exposes how governments pour billions into oil and gas projects, even as they make empty climate promises. Our advocacy helps power movements and our research brings the receipts.

The science is clear

To avoid climate collapse, governments must stop approving new fossil fuel projects.

And we can afford it. The billions in fossil fuel subsidies handed out each year could instead fund real climate solutions: renewable energy, green jobs, and investments in the communities hit hardest.

But fossil fuel companies don’t just block action, they sell dangerous distractions. From carbon capture to gas, their techno fixes are just new ways to keep polluting. We’re calling them out and helping people see through the greenwashing.

Hope

All over the world, people protect their homes and families. Communities organize, youth lead. The pressure is mounting. The era of fossil fuels is ending, it’s just a matter of how quickly, and how just the process will be.

A fossil-free world isn’t just possible, it’s necessary. And it’s already being built.

How You Can Help

Among all renewable energy generation technologies, solar alone accounted for 6,012 new jobs (between Q4 2023 and Q4 2024) thus expanding its cumulative to 370,556, according to the report by the environmental advocacy group.

The US clean energy jobs now account for 42% of all energy jobs and 2.3% of overall national workforce in the country. E2 shares that now more people work in clean energy related occupations than work as nurses, cashiers, waiters and waitresses, or preschool, elementary, and middle school teachers.

Clean energy and clean vehicle sectors added more than 520,000 jobs with an increase of 17% over the last 5 years, ‘far exceeding’ the gain in employment in fossil fuels, gas and diesel motor vehicles as well as the overall US economy.

Recent Trump administration policies have slowed renewable energy growth by cutting tax credits, canceling permits, and adding regulatory hurdles. While the E2 report does not reflect these actions, analysts believe that significant job losses have already taken place in the industry and may lead to more.

Broadly speaking, state lawmakers should strongly consider deploying mandatory GHG emissions reporting programs where they don’t already exist.","In a new phase of the Trump administration’s assault on the federal government, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced last week that it plans to largely dissolve the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). The GHGRP is an important, high-quality data resource for federal agencies, industry stakeholders, community advocates, and many others working to advance the clean energy transition, cut pollution, and protect public health.

You can’t manage what you can’t measure, and this move is an extension of the Trump administration’s broader assault on sources of truth. The public has a right to know how much dangerous, planet-warming pollution is being emitted by large industries, and policymakers need these numbers to make informed decisions. Eliminating the GHGRP would limit access to unbiased information on pollution in communities across the country—an intentional move to slow climate progress and let major polluters off the hook.

But states can step up to fill the gap, and advocates can still push back. The comment period on EPA’s decision to eliminate the GHGRP is open until November 3, 2025. This is a moment for vocal resistance, before the White House’s decision is finalized.

What Is the GHGRP, and Why Does It Matter?

The Obama administration established the GHGRP in 2010 as an initiative to track climate-warming pollution from the nation’s biggest emitters. For the last 15 years, the program has collected emissions data on more than half a dozen greenhouse gases from roughly 8,000 of the highest-polluting industrial facilities across the U.S. GHGRP’s datasets. These publicly available emissions records are a treasure trove for lawmakers, businesses, and climate advocates. They can use them to track and compare facilities’ emissions, identify opportunities to cut pollution, and develop informed climate policies. Economists have even found that the GHGRP, by forcing transparency and accountability for major polluters, has helped deter greenwashing and encouraged meaningful corporate environmental initiatives.

If we want to tackle the climate crisis, we need to know where climate pollution is coming from. Pollution monitoring is often a priority for environmental justice advocates and frontline communities because cutting pollution requires understanding its sources. The GHGRP provides that foundational knowledge to empower emissions mitigation initiatives, and closing it down will broadly obscure our visibility into where climate pollution is coming from in the U.S. This move advances the Trump administration’s imperative, backed by the oil and gas industry, to undermine any attempts to combat the climate crisis. But we have the tools to respond.

States Can Fill the Gap Left by the GHGRP

States can establish their own greenhouse gas reporting programs—and several already have. California, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Massachusetts, and New Jersey all require some set of major polluters to report their GHG emissions to state agencies. Each state lays out its own methodology for tracking emissions and sets its own thresholds for which entities are required to report, but the ultimate outcome is the same: an entirely state-based program collecting the kind of data that EPA will no longer track.

Those reporting programs are a valuable tool to help states measure their progress toward decarbonization targets, and California and Washington’s enable them to implement nation-leading cap-and-trade initiatives. California’s reporting rule has been on the books since 2007—three years before EPA established the GHGRP. There is a strong precedent for states acting on their own to track major pollution sources.

Other states are lining up for similar initiatives, with greenhouse gas reporting programs currently in development. Earlier this year, for example, New York’s Department of Environmental Conservation released its own draft rule to establish a mandatory GHG reporting program. The rule incorporates lessons learned from the EPA GHGRP and other state reporting programs. Building on those precedents, New York will soon have its own program in place to require annual emissions reporting from the state’s largest polluters—a model that can be replicated by any number of other states looking to maintain high-quality GHG emissions data after the GHGRP is shuttered.

Individual state programs aren’t the only pathway to collecting emissions data without federal buy-in. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) has set up a similar system (PDF) across nearly a dozen states. RGGI sets a regional cap on carbon dioxide (CO2) pollution from the power sector and creates an interstate market in emissions allowances, which are distributed to polluters through quarterly auctions. In order to set up and run that allowance market, every RGGI member state sets rules for the covered energy facilities to monitor and report their CO2 pollution.

While these state and regional programs are more limited in scope than the federal GHGRP, they demonstrate clearly that state lawmakers have all the tools at hand to effectively replace the GHGRP for facilities within their jurisdiction. A rollback of the GHGRP would be a major blow to our ability to measure the problem we’re facing, but states can step up to gather and report their own high-quality pollution data without relying on the Trump administration.

What Comes Next?

Broadly speaking, state lawmakers should strongly consider deploying mandatory GHG emissions reporting programs where they don’t already exist. In doing so, they can draw on the reporting rules already written in more than a dozen states; there’s no need to reinvent the wheel.

In the immediate term, states with reporting programs already in development—New York foremost among them—should also accelerate their rulemakings to fill data gaps before GHGRP winds down. As the Trump administration eliminates climate protections across the board, states can take up the mantle of leadership.

Climate advocates also have the opportunity to push back during the open comment period on the decision to shutter GHGRP, which closes on November 3, 2025. Public comments provide a crucial opportunity to build a record of opposition that can slow down the Trump administration’s rollbacks. Adverse comments on Trump’s rollbacks can support legal challenges down the road and serve as extra hoops for agency officials to jump through, because they are legally required to respond to substantive objections. Losing the GHGRP is a setback, but we aren’t left helpless. State leaders and concerned citizens can and must act.

As part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that was passed in 2022, this measure provides up to $7,500 in applicable tax credit with the purchase of a qualifying new EV, as a means to incentivize car shoppers into buying an environmentally-friendly EV instead of a gas-powered internal-combustion vehicle.

Find out below when the EV tax credit expires and how to get the tax credit.

What Is Happening to the $7,500 Credit?

On July 4, President Donald Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) into law. The OBBBA essentially set the economic agenda for Trump’s second administration by extending a number of tax cuts from his first administration, as well as cutting funding to several programs such as Medicaid and the EV tax credit.

As a result of the OBBBA, the $7,500 EV tax credit will now expire on Sept. 30.

Discover Next: I Asked ChatGPT Which Hybrid Vehicles To Stay Away From Buying: Here’s What It Said

How Can You Still Get the $7,500 Tax Credit?

Following the OBBBA’s passing, auto manufacturers initially assumed that car buyers would have to sign a purchase contract, make a down payment and physically receive their new EV by or before Sept. 30 in order to receive the credit.

However, the IRS has created something of a loophole in the credit’s expiration, per Yahoo Finance. “If a taxpayer acquires a vehicle by having a written binding contract in place and a payment made on or before Sept. 30, 2025, then the taxpayer will be entitled to claim the credit when they place the vehicle in service (namely, when they take possession of the vehicle), even if the vehicle is placed in service after Sept. 30, 2025,” according to the IRS.

In short: As long as an EV buyer signs a purchase contract and pays a deposit (or the full purchase amount) by or before Sept. 30, that buyer is entitled to the EV tax credit, even if the vehicle isn’t in their possession by that date.

What does this mean for you? Well, if you’ve been planning to purchase an EV and you can affordably make a down payment on an EV between now and Sept. 30, you’ll still be able to receive the IRA’s EV tax credit before it expires for good.

Engineering innovation, customer centricity and collaboration are helping industries meet the challenge.

By Ruben Alvarez, CEO of John Crane

At John Crane, we work with customers across a wide range of industries – from oil and gas to renewables, chemicals and power generation – giving us a front-row view of how the energy transition is taking shape around the world.

From large scale industrial players to regional innovators, there is an urgency, complexity and opportunity involved in decarbonising operations, a process to be engineered in a way that supports the critical systems the world relies on every day.

Facing real-world hurdles on the path to cleaner energy

Transitioning from traditional fuels to cleaner technologies isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. There’s legacy equipment to adapt, regulations to navigate, mandatory legislation to comply with – all while keeping operations safe, reliable and increasingly low-emission.

For many organisations, that means balancing operational performance with the urgent need to decarbonise, reduce fugitive emissions and improve energy efficiency across everything from process equipment to storage.

360 sustainability: Steps businesses can take to implement circularity

While traditional energy systems remain essential in many regions today, the focus is shifting toward cleaner, more sustainable solutions, with traditional fuels like liquefied natural gas (LNG) playing an important role along the way.

There’s no ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution. The energy transition looks different in every country, and even every facility. But that’s also where the opportunity lies. If you can solve these challenges, you go beyond ticking boxes and start to shape the future of energy.

One of the most effective ways to decarbonise existing fossil fuel power plants is through post-combustion carbon capture, which removes CO₂ from flue gas after combustion. According to the International Energy Agency, carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) could reduce energy-related emissions by 13%, with global capture capacity set to grow by 35% and storage by 70% by 2030.

Across the industry, more companies are making CCUS a practical part of their decarbonisation strategies. This technology is rapidly progressing from pilot projects to large-scale operations, often in demanding environments.

First CO2 volumes successfully stored at Northern Lights

Putting customers at the heart of innovation

So, how do we help companies make this shift? It comes down to listening to what customers need and then working with them to deliver real solutions.

The lessons we’re learning from hydrogen projects in Europe are already helping customers in North America and Asia. In water-scarce regions, we’re helping operators use less and recycle more by reducing process losses and improving system efficiency. And in remote locations, our teams are finding ways to keep critical equipment running longer and more reliably. It’s a two-way street: we learn as much from our customers as they do from us.

Take our work with Franco Tosi Meccanica in Italy, for example. Together, we’re supporting a pilot project on supercritical CO₂ power cycles – a technology that could make power generation cleaner and more efficient. Our job is to engineer sealing solutions that can perform under the demanding conditions of advanced power generation systems. It’s a great example of how collaboration is driving real progress.

Innovation is about responding directly to what keeps our customers awake at night.

Growth with purpose

So, what’s next? For me, it’s about growth, but not just in terms of numbers. It’s about growing our impact: helping more customers reach their sustainability goals, investing in our people and nurturing the wider industry, while pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.

Our partnership with the University of Sheffield in the UK is one example. We’re working with researchers to push the boundaries of sealing technology for high-pressure hydrogen storage and other low-carbon applications. It’s not just about new products. It’s also about investing in the next generation of engineers and making sure the industry has the talent and ideas it needs to thrive.

We’re also seeing growing interest in LNG as a transitional fuel in several markets. While not the end goal, it can offer a practical bridge in reducing emissions where renewables are not yet scalable, and we are helping customers operate these systems more cleanly and reliably.

As the world undergoes this energy transition, engineering advancements and specialised sealing technologies will play a vital role in ensuring the efficient and reliable operation of both renewable and fossil fuel power generation systems.

New energy landscape means new opportunities

If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that progress in this industry doesn’t come from standing still. It comes from rolling up our sleeves, collaborating across borders and being open to new ideas.

The road to a cleaner energy future isn’t always smooth, but it’s absolutely worth the effort.

The future of energy is being written right now, all over the world, and I’m excited to see where we can go together.

Dive Brief:

Based on low, medium and high emissions scenarios, the U.S. will reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26%-41% in 2040 compared with 2005 levels, according to Rhodium Group’s Taking Stock 2025 report.

However, the pace of decarbonization will slow dramatically, partially due to recent and potential policy changes by Congress and the Trump administration. Under the high emissions scenario, Rhodium estimates that average annual U.S. GHG emissions reductions were 1.1% from 2005 to 2024. That figure is now projected to fall to just 0.4% from 2025 to 2040, a 64% relative decline.

“The outcomes we report throughout Taking Stock this year are subject to considerable uncertainty, including an incredibly dynamic policy environment and persistent non-cost barriers to clean energy deployment,” the Sept. 10 report says. “These factors will continue to shape how the energy system and GHG emissions evolve in the coming years.”

Dive Insight:

The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have adopted or proposed a wide range of policies that are likely to increase climate pollution compared with policies under the Biden administration. Those changes include a second withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, ending federal tax credits for electric vehicles and altering other clean energy credits, eliminating federal rules limiting GHG emissions from fossil fuel power plants, blocking wind and solar projects and more.

“The effects of these policy shifts are compounded by rapid growth in electricity demand driven predominantly by the growth in large AI data centers, a weakening macroeconomic outlook, and an increasingly export-driven fossil fuel sector,” the report says.

Additionally, Rhodium said its estimates should be taken with a grain of salt, given the unstable economic and policy environment.

“Emissions outcomes vary due to a range of expectations for economic growth, future fossil fuel prices, and clean energy cost and performance trends,” according to the report.

Under the medium and low emissions scenarios, decarbonization would likely continue to accelerate rather than slow with annual GHG emissions declining 1.4% and 1.9%, respectively, according to the report.

The power, transportation, and oil and gas sectors are driving emissions reductions in GHG.The power sector is projected to emit 15%-43% fewer emissions in 2040 compared with 2024 levels, despite growing electricity demand, the report found.

“Renewables grow substantially in all three emissions scenarios through 2030 to claim the expiring clean electricity tax credits, but deployment diverges after that,” according to Rhodium.

Transportation emissions, meanwhile, will fall 8%-20%, as zero-emissions vehicles comprise a larger share of the U.S. vehicle fleet, according to Rhodium. The report attributes the increased market share to falling battery prices and greater consumer acceptance.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/KgfDHOMT72pDBeY1K71Kg4sqswL2NkOy789TLOf_T_c/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS8yRUFIQUJULmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-22 10:00:04.574279

The investment was made through FEIP, Foresight’s flagship energy transition infrastructure fund. With a capacity of 49.4 MW / 98.8 MWh, this project represents a significant boost for the company in its commitment to energy storage as a fundamental solution for meeting the new challenges facing the sector.

The Glendevon project, connected to the distribution network, will support grid regulation in the area. It will play a key role in managing demand peaks and will contribute significantly to achieving net zero goals.

GRS, with 126 plants operating worldwide and 4.1 GW of installed capacity, has leveraged the experience and knowledge in storage accumulated within Gransolar Group to undertake the engineering, design, construction and commissioning of the facility. It has also agreed with Foresight to carry out the operation and maintenance (O&M) work for at least the first two years after the project is fully energised and commissioned.

The company, focused on its strategy of promoting energy storage in all areas where it operates, has celebrated the mechanical completion of the Glendevon. “Storage is no longer just an add-on: it is the key to making renewables reliable and competitive. And at GRS, we have the knowledge and the team to make it a reality for companies committed to progress, such as Foresight,” says Christian Moeckel, the company’s Global Commercial Director.

Richard Thompson, Partner and Co-Manager of Foresight Energy Infrastructure Partners, comments: “The completion of the Glendevon battery project marks a key milestone in our commitment to supporting the UK’s transition to a net zero energy system. Partnering with GRS has enabled us to deliver a high-quality asset that will play a crucial role in strengthening grid stability and accelerating the deployment of renewable energy.”

This puts the program, which is being developed through a collaboration with General Motors and charging infrastructure company EVgo, nearly halfway to its goal of 500 locations and 2,000 charging stalls.

Dive Insight:

Pilot is building many of its chargers in rural areas because fewer than half of rural counties had any public EV charging infrastructure, the company noted in its announcement. These could not only be a resource for customers in more remote areas, but can also encourage stops from road-trippers with electric vehicles.

Pilot travel centers are typically located along interstates, which carry more than 20% of total traffic in the U.S., according to the announcement. Its travel centers, which offer on-site restaurants and free WiFi in addition to their 350 kilowatt fast chargers, give customers plenty to do while their cars charge. They also feature Plug & Charge payments for compatible EVs.

“Our collaboration with General Motors and EVgo continues to bring highway-based charging to more routes where this critical infrastructure is needed to enable coast-to-coast EV travel,” said Shannon Sturgil, senior vice president of alternative fuels at Pilot.

To date, Pilot has received $15 million in funding help from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. While the Trump Administration has made some changes to the NEVI program, that funding could still help Pilot, GM and EVgo build more sites.

The report grades 75 utilities across the country on their plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035, and transition to clean energy through 2035. The average score across the country was 15 out of 100.

Missouri utilities advocated for a law passed earlier this year that will make it easier to increase utility bills for new gas-burning power plants and future projects approved by regulators who are appointed by the Governor. Kansas passed as similar law last year. Customers will see new rate increases to pay for new gas plants years before they provide service, largely in the name of economic development for multibillion dollar tech companies building power-hungry data centers.

The price of new gas-burning power plants is outpacing inflation, and the trend is likely to continue according to new analysis. Duke University research notes that new demand for electricity, for example from data centers, can be flexed to avoid building expensive new gas plants while maintaining electric grid reliability.

Ameren Missouri earned a 5% (F), an 11% decrease from the previous year. Ameren owns and plans to operate its Labadie coal-burning power plant until 2042, which is the one of the largest, dirtiest, and deadliest power plants in the country, because it lacks all modern pollution controls. Ameren admits its Sioux coal-burning plant is unlikely to operate at least 20% annually, meaning it could be offline when needed as customers continue to pay for the asset. Last year, the Sierra Club told utility regulators that Ameren over-inflated the price of renewable energy when critiquing the cost of Sioux’s extended operation.

AECI earned a 0% (F), which is the same score the utility earned the previous year. AECI is throwing good money after bad at its Thomas Hill coal plant in northern Missouri that has a recent history of breaking down. Thomas Hill didn’t operate for more than six of the last twelve months, including this past January when it was needed to power the grid during a polar vortex. AECI can be more secretive about its financials because it’s not a monopoly utility regulated by the state, nor is it a municipal utility that is overseen by locally elected officials.

Evergy earned a 9% (F), a 3% decrease from the previous year. Evergy was spotlighted in the report because of the utility’s multi-year backslide from renewable energy investments toward extending coal plant operations and building new gas-burning power plants. CEO David Campbell’s pivot toward more coal-burning and gas-burning saw the utility quietly drop its 70% greenhouse gas reduction target by 2030 goal from its website and regulatory filings as the company continues greenwashing its image.

In an interactive webpage, users can see their utility’s score and what progress–if any–the utility has made toward transitioning to cleaner, more affordable energy since the first version of the report in 2021.

Statement from Ty Gorman, Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign Organizing Strategist in Kansas:

“The dirty truth is that Evergy is extending uneconomic coal plants and building loads of new gas-burning power plants that will extract a massive amount of wealth from hardworking Kansans and benefit their worldwide shareholders. CEO David Campbell is responsible for this problem, and we need communities to come together and demand that his monopoly utility address its harms. Multibillion dollar tech companies with climate goals must fund clean energy, like Google, because Kansas communities are subsidizing new gas-burning power plants for their power-hungry AI data centers.”

Statement from Brian Smith, Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign Organizer in Missouri:

“I’ve talked to cooperative members throughout Missouri, and the dirty truth is that the average person has no clue that AECI exists, let alone the massive influence it has over the rates and power sources for their regional electric cooperatives. Knowing that AECI exists would be like the average cooperative member knowing that Pepsico owns Doritos—choice is an illusion.”

The annual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly in New York comes more than a month after a deadline passed that Trump imposed on his Cabinet to identify international organizations that the U.S. should quit, defund or reform.

Since establishing the deadline in February, the president has intensified his attacks on global establishments that were created to combat rising temperatures, while also reversing domestic regulations, laws and commitments designed to expand clean energy and reduce climate pollution.

Now, his administration could be weighing whether to leave the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, a move that would reshape international efforts on global warming for years to come, according to former Trump officials and environmental advocates.

The 1992 treaty, known as the UNFCCC, serves as the international structure for efforts by 198 countries to slow the pace of rising levels of greenhouse gases. It’s also the underlying framework for the Paris Agreement, which Trump moved to abandon on his first day in office.

Since then, his administration has dissolved the State Department office responsible for leading U.S. climate negotiations, dismembered a program that tracks the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions and thwarted clean energy policies in favor of expanding oil, gas and coal. Those actions are antithetical to the goals of the UNFCCC.

A high-profile departure from the global framework on climate change would be a marked escalation of Trump’s moves to divorce the U.S. from the nearly unanimous sentiment globally that climate change poses economic and natural upheaval. It would also be the most enduring step that Trump has taken so far, his allies argue.

By comparison, the 2015 Paris Agreement can be left and reentered on the whim of whomever happens to be president. Reentering treaties, such as the UNFCCC, could be more challenging.

“There is zero benefit to remaining in the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change,” Steven Groves, a former Trump official who’s now at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said in an email. “Leaving the Convention would prevent future Democrat administrations from circumventing Senate advice and consent on treaties, as President Obama did with the Paris Agreement.”

Groves, who served as chief of staff to Nikki Haley when she was ambassador to the U.N., said he doesn’t think Trump would use his U.N. speech to withdraw from the climate treaty. Such a move would be “trivial” compared to Trump’s focus on trade, investment and peace deals, Groves said.

White House spokesperson Davis Ingle said Trump would lay out a vision “for a safe, prosperous, peaceful America and the world” in his speech.

“Under President Trump’s leadership, our country is strong again, which has made the entire globe more stable,” Ingle said. “In only eight months, the President has brokered seven peace deals, secured historic trade deals and investments, and strengthened alliances across the world.”

The White House did not answer questions about whether the U.S. would withdraw from the UNFCCC or whether it was up for discussion.

‘Contrary to American interests’

The UNFCCC was ratified by then-President George H.W. Bush and supported by the Senate — one of the strongest commitments made by America to the climate fight. The United States’ connection to the Paris Agreement is more tenuous. Former President Barack Obama entered into partnership with that pact through an executive action, a move that has continued to irk conservatives.

If Trump does withdraw, it would raise questions about whether the U.S. could reenter the UNFCCC in the future.

Some legal experts say the Senate’s consent does not operate in perpetuity after the U.S. has left a treaty. Others argue that if a president can unilaterally leave a treaty that has earned support from two-thirds of the Senate, they could rejoin it without a new vote.

“Otherwise, you’re just handing this huge amount of power to a president to forever cancel the act of the Senate,” said Jean Galbraith, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has written about treaties.

Regardless of the legal pathway, Galbraith said withdrawing from the treaty could pitch the global effort to grapple with rising temperatures into turmoil.

“First, it takes the United States out of the main forum for a crucial conversation about how to save our planet,” she said. “And second, it is a kind of potential path to a lot of instability going forward.”

Whether the review over quitting international fora has risen to Trump’s attention is unclear.

Eugene Chen, a senior fellow at New York University’s Center on International Cooperation, said the U.S. could reshape global plans on energy and environment even if Trump decides against quitting the UNFCCC.

Staying in the treaty, he said, could “have the benefits of being able to influence discussions and gum up the works if they so choose.”

Brett Schaefer, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who produced his own assessment of which organizations he thinks the U.S. should leave, argued that Trump should withdraw from the UNFCCC in part because the U.S. is not behind the more substantive agreements it underpins, including the Paris Agreement.

“If the United States is not going to support the prescriptive agreements, that casts questions over whether we should be participating in that process,” he said.

The review that Trump ordered has made its way through the State Department, according to two former officials who were asked for input during the process about how different organizations and treaties have benefited the United States. That feedback fed into a spreadsheet containing the names of treaties and institutions that included questions about their costs and benefits and asked for quantitative rankings.

It’s unclear where the review stands now. Trump’s February executive order instructed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to deliver it to the White House by early August.

A State Department spokesperson declined to answer detailed questions about the status of the review.

“President Trump ordered a review of U.S. participation in and funding for international organizations to ensure U.S. investments in international organizations are not contrary to American interests,” the spokesperson said in an email.

The executive order also called for input from the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Mike Waltz, who was confirmed for the position Friday, indicated during his Senate hearing that he believes the U.S. is spending too much attention and money on U.N. initiatives, including on climate change.

“It’s quite a list,” Waltz said, adding, “I think it is incumbent on this administration to say, ‘What’s it doing?’”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/ee/e2/55507aaa448b97ee7c46587e2f2a/trump-82212.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 12:06:08.137069

During the summit, Lombardo said the Thacker Pass lithium project – the largest known lithium deposit in North America – positioned Nevada as “a key player in both national and global supply chains.” Thacker Pass isn’t the only lithium mine in Nevada feeling the impact of falling lithium prices.
Lithium prices have fallen more than 80% since their peak in 2022, reshaping market dynamics including in Nevada.
Analysts expect lithium prices to remain volatile the remainder of the year.
Major tech companies are now also investing heavily in large AI-enabled data centers, and lithium battery storage will be a part of that, said Cage.","Nevada is the only state in the nation that can deliver on every phase of the lithium life cycle – from mining to recycling.

Industry experts in the state say that selling point has the potential to make Nevada a leader in the lithium battery supply chain that powers everything from electric vehicles to the data centers driving AI growth.

Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo emphasized the importance of lithium for diversifying Nevada’s tourism-heavy economy at his second annual Nevada Lithium Summit Friday.

The lithium industry, however, has been hammered by falling prices in recent years due to softer demand and an oversupply of the battery metal globally, which has made mining the metal in the U.S. less attractive to investors.

On the second day of the lithium summit, Politico reported the Department of Energy (DOE) was reevaluating a $2.3 billion loan to the Thacker Pass lithium project, a massive proposed mine in Humboldt County near the Nevada-Oregon border. The energy agency cited the drop in price as a key factor in their rethink of the loan.

During the summit, Lombardo said the Thacker Pass lithium project – the largest known lithium deposit in North America – positioned Nevada as “a key player in both national and global supply chains.”

Thacker Pass isn’t the only lithium mine in Nevada feeling the impact of falling lithium prices. Earlier this year, mining developer Ioneer Corp. lost a $490 million investment to their Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron project in Esmeralda County after their investing partner backed out of the project, due in part to plummeting lithium prices.

Lithium prices have fallen more than 80% since their peak in 2022, reshaping market dynamics including in Nevada. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence said average lithium fell from nearly $80,000 per tonne globally in December 2022 to about $10,000 per tonne this September. Analysts expect lithium prices to remain volatile the remainder of the year.

“Commodities ebb and flow,” said Tom Burns, the director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED), during a press conference at the summit.

Despite falling prices, Burns said Nevada’s position as the only state in the nation with a complete “Lithium Loop” that could offer mining and processing to battery manufacturing and recycling gave the state an edge for investment.

More investment from the federal government isn’t off the table, said Burns. President Donald Trump has made reducing foreign critical mineral dependency a major priority, citing national and economic security concerns. Nevada is poised to meet that need, said Burns.

“There is movement within the federal government to support critical minerals and mining and processing as a whole,” Burns said. “I think you’ll see that in Nevada.”

“Specifically, the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy has an interest in making sure those are produced here,” Burns continued.

Nevada Battery Coalition CEO Caleb Cage said industry experts believe the growing demand for lithium and battery storage will increase and stabilize prices for the metal over the next decade.

“Looking at it long term, the remarkable demand for lithium in particular should have the market effect of adjusting that price to make some of these projects more viable,” Cage said.

“The demand for battery storage is only growing right now,” Cage said.

Growing battery storage demand has already boosted Nevada’s economy. A decade ago, about 100 people were employed in the battery manufacturing industry, according to GOED. In 2025, more than 14,200 were employed in the industry.

Manufacturing grew by about 83% in Nevada from 2015 to 2025, significantly more than the 13% national average. That growth was largely driven by the battery manufacturing industry boosted by electric vehicles and clean energy demands.

Several companies have invested in battery manufacturing and recycling facilities in Nevada, including Tesla and Redwood Materials.

Major tech companies are now also investing heavily in large AI-enabled data centers, and lithium battery storage will be a part of that, said Cage.

Electricity demand in the U.S. has continued to grow, driven in part by AI data centers that are on track to triple their share of national electricity usage from 4.4% in 2023 to 12% by 2028. Those data centers will need battery storage systems to offset power outages and reinforce the grid when demand is high or supply is limited.

Growing adoption of renewable energy sources, sustainability objectives, and need for energy efficiency is also driving the transition away from traditional lead-acid batteries to lithium-ion batteries in data centers.

In June, Redwood Materials launched Redwood Energy to build low-cost energy-storage systems that can meet surging power demand from AI data centers. The company said it’s already powering a modular data center in Sparks, Nevada for AI infrastructure company Cursoe at an energy cost lower than the grid.

“They’ve got that proof of concept out in Northern Nevada right now, and that model is going to be something that they want to replicate,” Cage said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-90/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/lithiumboom-1024x7681758542925.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=EFWYOxzu,N,,2025-09-22 10:00:41.716904

This week, the organization launched a six-figure ad campaign in Washington, D.C., aimed at spurring senators to get back to working on wildfire resilience and forestry reform. Though the bill’s approach is divisive — the House version drew initial pushback from more than 100 environmental organizations, including the Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, and League of Conservation Voters, for opening up large tracts of federal forest to logging, among other concerns — Weiner told me “there’s no huge substantive holdup in the Senate that is keeping it from getting to 60 votes.”

I caught up with Weiner this week to learn more about where things stand with the Fix Our Forests Act and talk through some of the bill’s more controversial regulatory rollbacks. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Catch our readers up: Why the Fix Our Forests Act, and why now?

We’re looking at a generational opportunity to change the way we do land management. This is the most significant change Congress has considered since the Healthy Forest Restoration Act, and maybe even since the original National Forest Act.

The smoke impacts of wildfires are killing more people than the flames. Wildfires are the most significant driver of PM 2.5 emissions growth in the country right now. The clean air community has done a fantastic job of reducing industrial emissions of PM 2.5, which has had real public health impacts, but those gains are in danger of vanishing because of the growth of wildfire smoke exposure.

Then there’s the climate. If you care about carbon emissions, this is a huge opportunity at a time when a lot of other climate issues seem to be on the backburner. The 2020 fire season in California — a particularly bad year — released enough carbon to undo 20 years of the state’s emissions reduction progress. The 2023 Canadian wildfires, if treated as a country, would have been the third-largest emitter in the world that year. And if you start thinking about Alaska and the Boreal burning in the way the West has been burning, it could potentially be game over for the climate. It’s important that people understand that this is an existential climate issue and that we have an opportunity to make progress in a bipartisan way.

You and I have chatted before — we first spoke about the Fix Our Forests Act almost a year ago, now. What’s happened in the past 12 months with the bill?

The bill passed the House right after the Los Angeles fires. The last time we spoke [in October 2024], the bill had passed the House in the previous Congress with a bipartisan margin. But this time, it got a much bigger bipartisan show of support: 64 Democrats and all the Republicans in the House.

The bill saw some changes and improvements to focus on the immediate needs in Los Angeles County [after the January 2025 fires] — things like improving the ability of a city like Los Angeles to gain access to Community Wildfire Defense Grant funding and improvements to the Wildfire Intelligence Center targeted at making sure it plays a role in helping local governments make decisions on where to place assets before a high risk event.

Then the bill went to the Senate, but instead of moving the House bill through, a group of senators came together to write a bipartisan version with some changes. Senator Curtis from Utah was the lead, along with Senators Padilla, Hickenlooper, and Sheehy. Their version included changes to the litigation section from the House bill, which had raised concerns among a lot of environmental organizations, as well as modifications to the permitting section. That earned the bill the support of more environmental organizations than the version from the House — they have the Nature Conservancy, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Audubon Society, and the National Wildlife Federation on board, as well as a lot of local organizations and wildfire groups like the Alliance for Wildfire Resilience.

But then a lot of the oxygen in the Senate was taken up by the reconciliation package. That put a pause on things through the August recess, and now they’re looking to hopefully mark up the bill during the October work period. We’re very optimistic about being able to get floor time. We think there’s a clear path to 60 votes in the Senate for this bill, and if there’s a good, constructive markup, it could be much more than that. There’s no substantive holdup as much as there is the ever-present fear of stasis and losing momentum. That’s why we launched an ad campaign with an eye toward building the urgency back up.

How did the ad campaign come together?

The idea was that this is a bipartisan issue, so where is the support? We didn’t need to launch a big persuasion campaign; we needed to highlight the absurdity of the fact that, eight months after Los Angeles, we still haven’t had any meaningful action from Congress. There is an opportunity before them that would make a big difference in wildfire policy writ large.

I’m interested in your focus on using “state-of-the-art science” and “new and innovative technologies” to address wildfires and forest health. What have you seen in this space that has made you excited?

The bill is about improving the planning and implementation of wildfire policy — especially mitigation work like treatment projects, but also in the built environment. A big cornerstone of that would be the creation of a new Wildfire Intelligence Center, which would use the most advanced technology to understand what our risk profile is on the ground across landscapes and jurisdictions. Right now, there is no one entity in government responsible for taking a comprehensive look at risk across landscapes, what we’re doing on the ground, and how that buys down risk.

At the same time, one of the things we’re negotiating is making sure that the Forest Service and the Department of Interior are positioned to work with some of the companies doing advanced modeling, detection, and tracking work — as opposed to having the government try to build its own clunky system. We’ve modeled it after successful efforts elsewhere in government, such as the Defense Innovation Unit and other Department of Defense and NASA programs that have been great at harnessing private sector innovation for government use. There’s also a new pilot program in the bill, in Section 303, that would create a pathway for the Forest Service to start identifying and piloting new technologies and give them a path to scale across the agency if they find that it helps them do the job better, faster, and cheaper.

The timber industry has collaborated with the Forest Service on fire suppression since the 1920s. In the decades since, “forest management” has at times been used as a euphemism for industry-friendly practices like tree thinning, which many ecologists say would allow invasive species and brush to flourish, and would actually worsen wildfires. How would cutting the red tape around “vegetation management activities” not be a handout to the timber industry?

We all know that the best tool for mitigation is good fire, prescribed fire, beneficial fire, and — where appropriate — managed fire, as well. Unfortunately, because we’ve taken fire out of these landscapes, forested landscapes in particular are so overgrown that you couldn’t introduce good fire even if you wanted to. So mechanical thinning has to be a part of this.

One of the tensions here is that the timber industry wants merchantable timber. They want the big trees, and in a lot of cases, those are the ones we want to keep in the ground with these projects. What we’re focused on is invasive species, overgrown areas, and dead trees from morbidity events like recent droughts so that we can reintroduce good fire at scale. If we all let it burn, like some have proposed, you’d end up with hundreds of thousands of acres of landscape burning at a time, like we saw in the [2021] Caldor fire, where nothing will grow back in a way we recognize for at least decades — and given climate change, maybe not ever.

It’s important to make sure that we don’t go back to the timber wars [of the 1980s and 1990s between environmentalists and loggers in the Pacific Northwest], but at the same time, we need to recognize that the biggest threat to our forests right now is catastrophic fire, not the timber industry. We want to deal with the threat at hand and make sure the pendulum that swung during the timber wars — for very good reason — against the timber industry comes back a little, but doesn’t swing too far in the wrong direction, either. The Senate bill strikes the right balance there.

A number of major environmental groups initially came out in opposition to the Fix Our Forests Act over numerous concerns, including that it erodes Endangered Species Act protections by exempting the Forest Service and BLM from the requirement to adjust land management policies as new information about how projects could affect threatened species arises. What is the other side of this tradeoff? How would limiting the consultation requirement advance the goal of reducing wildfires?

The biggest challenge right now is that, because of all of the regulatory hurdles, it can take upwards of a thousand days to get a project off the ground anywhere in the country. One great example of that is in the Angeles National Forest. They announced a fuel break maintenance strategy in 2020, but they were not able to get the requisite approvals until the start of December 2024. It took four years — and then the last of the permits that were most relevant to Altadena didn’t get approved until March, two months after the fire. There are very real consequences to this kind of delay, both for the environment and for human health and safety, that need to be taken into account.

If you take a step back and look at the bill, the main tool that it uses is not broad NEPA exemptions or writ-large changes in the law. It utilizes categorical exclusions, a method that has been used for energy projects in other areas and is increasingly sought after to advance targeted projects with public benefits.

One great example is the Tahoe categorical exclusion, on which a significant portion of this bill is based. It was a 10,000-acre CE created in 2016, which allowed for work that protected communities and ecosystems and got good fire on the ground. It’s work that directly saved South Lake Tahoe from the Caldor Fire. But one of the challenges right now is that the current level for CE is 3,000 acres, and when we’re talking about landscapes in forests that are hundreds of thousands of miles big and a fireshed that nationwide is 50 million acres, then 3,000 acres is not enough for it to be worth it for the Forest Service and Park Service and DOI officials to go through the CE process — which takes six months and is very rigorous.

But we also wanted to show restraint here for environmental purposes. We wanted to make sure that this was as targeted as it needed to be, and not overly expansive.

The decision drew swift blowback from climate groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council, which called the pipeline a “climate and affordability boondoggle.” The utility’s “own demand forecasts confirm there is no imminent reliability need — capacity is more than sufficient to meet peak demand well into the 2040s, even under unusually cold temperatures,” Chris Casey, the New York utility regulatory director at NRDC, said in a statement. “The Commission’s decision to signal its support for this fracked gas pipeline very likely contradicts state law, is not in the public interest, and will be vigorously challenged.”

2. California Democrat says Interior Department halted solar approvals

Representative Scott Peters, the Democrat who represents part of San Diego, accused the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management of halting permitting on solar projects in California. At a press conference Thursday to promote a bipartisan proposal he drafted along with the Colorado Republican Representative Gabe Evans to ease federal energy permitting, Peters said he had just been told that the agency would not approve any more panels. “It’s hard to get a deal unless we resolve that,” Peters said, according to a post on X from Politico reporter Joshua Siegel.

The proposal is a framework for a bill, essentially a blueprint of what members of the House Problem Solvers Caucus feel constitute reasonable compromises. For Republicans, the agreement offers fewer bureaucratic roadblocks to all kinds of new infrastructure, including gas pipelines. For Democrats, it charts a path for building more of the transmission lines that are key to adding more renewables to the grid. “It’s a big step to have our caucus, which is a pretty significant number of Republicans and Democrats, sign on to a pretty detailed set of policy principles,” Peters said. But as Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin wrote last month, “unless Democrats trust the Trump administration to actually allow renewables projects to go forward, his proposal could be dead on arrival.”

3. New climate tech coalition forms

On Thursday, a new coalition that includes Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy, consulting giant McKinsey, and Stanford University’s Doerr School of Sustainability launched the Climate Tech Atlas. The proposal maps out ways to decarbonize different sectors of the economy, and lists priorities for innovation. The idea is not to eliminate potential solutions, Heatmap’s Katie Brigham reported in her scoop about the project, but rather “to enable the next generation of innovators, entrepreneurs, researchers, policymakers, and investors to really focus on where we felt there was the largest opportunity for exploration and for innovation to impact our path to net zero through the lens of technology,” according to Cooper Rinzler, a key collaborator on the initiative and a partner at the venture capital firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures.

4. Microsoft unveils ‘the world’s most powerful AI data center’ in Wisconsin

Microsoft has announced “the world’s most powerful AI data center” in southeastern Wisconsin. The project, called Fairwater, “is a seamless cluster of hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA GB200s, connected by enough fiber to circle the Earth 4.5 times,” CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a post on X. “It will deliver 10x the performance of the world’s fastest supercomputer today, enabling AI training and inference workloads at a level never before seen.” He said Microsoft would match “all of the energy that is consumed with renewable sources.”

heatmap.news

That power generation could prove more popular than the data center itself. Just 44% of American voters would support or strongly support a data center being built near them, while 42% would oppose or strongly oppose it, according to a Heatmap Pro poll Matthew covered last week. That mere 2% of net support compares to net support of 34% for a gas plant, 19% for a wind farm, 34% for a solar project, and 11% for batteries.

5. Climeworks inks largest-ever carbon removal deal with Schneider Electric

The carbon removal startup Climeworks just signed its largest-ever deal. By 2039, the Switzerland-based company, one of the biggest direct air capture developers in the world, agreed to suck 31,000 tons of CO2 from the atmosphere on behalf of Schneider Electric, the French industrial giant. Schneider said it remains committed to slashing the direct emissions from its operations by 90% in the next 25 years, and that this deal addresses “future neutralization needs while pursuing aggressive emissions reductions, and supporting the scale-up of an industry crucial for achieving net zero.” In a statement, Schneider’s sustainability chief Esther Finidori said that “both carbon removal and carbon reduction are fundamental to achieving our climate goals, as well as those of the planet.” For Climeworks, the deal is a “milestone,” said CEO Christoph Gebald.

THE KICKER

The speed of climate change may be throwing the insect world out of whack. But a new study has put offshore oil rigs in the North Sea to work identifying the vital role a migratory insect plays. University of Exeter researchers studied 121 marmalade hoverflies that landed on an oil rig in the Britannia oil field. The rig off the coast of Scotland was far from any vegetation or land, so the pollen found on 92% of hoverflies “shows they can transport pollen over great distances, potentially linking plant populations that are hundreds of kilometers apart,” according to a press release. “By analysing the pollen samples and wind patterns, we estimate that many of the hoverflies had flown from places including the Netherlands, northern Germany and Denmark — over 500 kilometers away,” Toby Doyle, Exeter’s Centre for Ecology and Conservation in Cornwall, said in a statement.

Speaking at the 6th CII International Energy Conference & Exhibition, Joshi said the milestone was achieved five years ahead of schedule. “We have already achieved over 50 per cent of our installed power capacity from non-fossil fuel sources, and we have done it 5 years ahead of the timeline. We have also crossed 50 per cent of the 500 GW target (252 GW),” he said.

The minister said nearly 20 lakh households had benefitted from solar under the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana and that schemes such as PM-KUSUM and PM-JANMAN had enabled farmers and villages to access solar pumps and off-grid power. “We are not just giving people free electricity, we are empowering them to become energy producers,” he said.

On investments, Joshi said his ministry had secured commitments worth ₹32.45 lakh crore from banks and industry for clean energy initiatives. He added that insurance surety bonds had been permitted as an alternative to earnest money deposits and performance bank guarantees for renewable projects.

He said India had achieved an installed module manufacturing capacity of more than 100 GW. “So far, almost ₹50,000 crore has been invested under the PLI scheme for high-efficiency solar PV modules, creating more than 12,600 direct jobs,” he said.

Joshi said the government had set a target of achieving domestically manufactured solar cells by 2028, along with a plan for wafers and ingots. “I have also given my ministry clear directions to come up with a trajectory for domestic polysilicon production,” he said.

On tariff levels, Joshi said Madhya Pradesh had recently discovered a price of ₹2.70 per unit for solar with battery storage and ₹2.15 per unit without storage in auctions. “Today, solar-plus battery is costing much less than thermal power,” he said.

This edition of Projects Weekly is highlighting several new solar projects in development in the United States and Canada, plus a healthy dose of financing news. We start off with news from Catalyze, which partnered with CS Energy to develop 27 MW of distributed solar projects in New York. Plus, PowerBank is expected to receive interconnection results soon on three community solar projects in Nova Scotia, while the company also has secured all required municipal approvals for two brownfield solar projects in Skaneateles, New York.

On the financing front, Macquarie Asset Management has committed $350 million to support Nexamp’s utility-scale solar and battery storage expansion in the United States; and Soluna has secured $100 million from Generate Capital to expand green data centers.

Finally, air conditioning manufacturer Daikin has tapped ENGIE to advance the company’s unified solar power strategy across Texas.

Catalyze adds 4 new community solar projects to New York

Catalyze has completed four community solar projects in central and western New York. Developed in partnership with CS Energy, the 27 MW of solar energy adds to Catalyze’s robust New York footprint, helping the state reach its goal of installing 6 GW of distributed solar ahead of schedule.

The projects leveraged standardized design, a consistent racking system, and trusted subcontractor relationships, allowing the Catalyze and CS Energy teams to accelerate schedules and bring power online. At the same time, construction access and laydown areas were carefully managed so that farmland could return to its pre-existing condition, allowing landowners to continue farming outside the solar arrays. These four completed sites represent the first half of an eight-project collaboration between Catalyze and CS Energy. The remaining projects, totaling more than 25 MW, are scheduled for completion over the next year.

Cool factor: The four projects — located in Pavilion, Phelps, Fonda, and Fabius, New Yrok — were designed to integrate seamlessly with the local grid and built with prevailing wage labor, supporting both reliability and clean energy workforce development. The installations were supported by New York State programs, including the Inclusive Community Solar Adder and the Community Adder, which help ensure reliable energy access to low-to-moderate income (LMI) subscribers and disadvantaged communities.

“This milestone is about more than megawatts, it’s about taking action,” said Andrew D’Amico, chief operating officer at Catalyze. “We are seeing businesses move fast to lock in the long-term benefits and cost advantages of solar power while federal tax credits are still in place, with states offering incentives designed to expand access.”

The timing of these projects highlights the importance of acting quickly to secure federal tax incentives. Current solar investment tax credits cover 30% of project costs, with potential bonuses of 10% for domestic content and an additional 10% for projects in designated energy communities.

PowerBank makes progress on solar projects in Nova Scotia and New York

PowerBank Corp. expects receive interconnection results within the next 30 days for three community solar projects in Nova Scotia, plus the company has secured all required municipal approvals for two brownfield solar developments in Skaneateles, New York.

The three projects in Nova Scotia, located in Sydney, Brooklyn, and West Petpeswick, are owned by AI Renewable Flow-through Fund and PowerBank is the lead developer and builder. If the interconnection results are positive and the projects are financially feasible, the PowerBank expects to begin construction in the Spring of 2026. PowerBank will partner with local Nova Scotia engineering firm, Trimac Engineering, to deliver the projects. Over the projects’ lifetimes, they will generate up to a combined $6.95 million in electricity savings for the local communities.

The two projects in New York are located on industrial brownfield sites in Skaneateles, which is in the state’s Finger Lakes Region, in Onondaga County. The projects have secured all required municipal approvals, including variances, site plan approval and special use permit. The projects will now pursue NY Department of Environmental Conservation approval to enter construction.

Cool factor: The Canadian Federal government and the Province of Nova Scotia are very supportive of Community Solar, with a number of incentives, including the Smart Renewables and Electrification Pathways Program (SREPs), Indigenous-Led Clean Energy Stream, and the Low Carbon Communities program.

Following receipt of the necessary permits and financing for the two New Projects, PowerBank intends to commence the construction. Once completed, each of the sites will be operated as a community solar project.

Macquarie Asset Management commits $350 million to support Nexamp projects

Macquarie Asset Management has facilitated $350 million of long-term financing to Nexamp Inc. to support the construction of the company’s first utility-scale solar and battery storage projects.

“We believe this relationship will allow the team to realize rapid success in the utility-scale energy transition market,” said Harlan Cherniak, head of Americas infrastructure debt at Macquarie Asset Management. “Through this $350 million facility, we will continue to solidify our credit and insurance division as a global leader in the infrastructure and asset-based credit market.”

In a separate transaction, Nexamp raised additional development capital from Nomura to advance earlier-stage project development and sustain its robust national pipeline of utility-scale opportunities.

Cool factor: Macquarie’s financing will facilitate the construction of more than 1 GWac of solar and storage projects across the high-demand MISO, ERCOT and NYISO markets, while Nomura’s capital will advance development activities in MISO, NYISO and PJM, three of the nation’s fastest-growing regions for utility-scale renewables. Nexamp’s long-term expertise in greenfield development of commercial distributed generation assets will complement its successful development of new utility-scale projects.

Daikin selects ENGIE to advance unified solar strategy across Texas

Air conditioning manufacturer Daikin has signed a five-year agreement with ENGIE North America to power all of the company’s Texas facilities with 100% renewable electricity, including the Daikin Texas Technology Park (DTTP), home to its largest manufacturing site and North American headquarters.

“This initiative represents a major step forward in aligning our operations with Daikin’s long-term sustainability goals,” said Mike Knights, senior VP of procurement at Daikin. “By working with ENGIE, a global leader in the energy transition, we’re securing clean electricity for our Texas operations while reinforcing our environmental responsibility goals. The initiative facilitates a transparent, traceable connection between operational energy use and a certified renewable energy source.”

Cool factor: Under the agreement, Daikin will source renewable electricity from the Impact Solar project in North Texas, which is owned and operated by a third party and has been in commercial operation since 2021. This relationship brings Daikin closer to its goal of making the DTTP a Net Zero Factory by 2030 and supports the company’s global Environmental Vision 2050.

This milestone builds on Daikin’s recent installation of a solar array at DTTP, which powers the facility’s central chiller plant and supports grid integration. Together, these efforts reflect a broader strategy shaped by a two-year collaboration with ForeFront Power to evaluate energy usage, sustainability goals, and procurement planning. The result is a forward-looking approach that advances Daikin’s environmental goals while reinforcing its leadership in sustainable manufacturing and corporate responsibility within the HVAC industry.

California will not replace the expiring $7,500 federal EV tax credit, with Gov. Gavin Newsom citing budget constraints and prioritizing infrastructure over direct subsidies.

Automakers lose hoped-for state relief, as companies like Rivian, Hyundai, and Volkswagen had urged California to offer a $5,000 incentive to offset the federal rollback.

Newsom escalates tensions with automakers, accusing GM and CEO Mary Barra of leading efforts against California’s 2035 gas car ban, while leaving open the possibility of a future state credit funded through carbon-trading revenue.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Friday the state will not replace the $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit set to expire Sept. 30, reversing an earlier pledge to restart California’s own subsidies. The decision removes what automakers had hoped would be the nation’s largest state-level incentive in the country’s top EV market.

Newsom, speaking in San Francisco, said the state cannot offset the loss of federal support, calling the phaseout “federal vandalism.” Instead, he told California that it will direct resources toward expanding charging infrastructure rather than direct purchase subsidies.

The announcement delivers a blow to EV makers such as Rivian, Hyundai, and Volkswagen, which had urged state leaders to create a $5,000 incentive to soften the impact of the federal rollback. California accounted for about 27% of all EV sales in the United States last year, positioning it as the most critical market for continued consumer adoption.

Newsom’s reversal follows a pledge made in 2024 to backfill the federal program if it were eliminated. However, California’s growing budget deficit derailed those plans. The state ended its previous EV tax credit program in 2023 and now falls outside the group of 17 states still offering some form of incentive, according to the Tax Foundation.

The governor also aimed at Detroit automakers, singling out General Motors and CEO Mary Barra. Newsom accused GM of “selling out” California by leading efforts in Congress to block the state’s 2035 ban on new gasoline-powered vehicle sales. California regulators had estimated the ban would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 35%.

The event was part of a national “day of action” billed Sun Day, founded by veteran environmental activist Bill McKibben and first Earth Day coordinator Denis Hayes.

“It’s so sad to watch the sun going to waste,” McKibben said at a press conference, standing beside environmentalists and their children. “Every single day, energy from heaven going to waste while we drill down to hell for another dose of the stuff that is wrecking this planet.”

McKibben was joined at the press conference by other activists, as well as officials from New York and his home state of Vermont.

“We have the ability here to protect our children, to protect our future,” said New York’s lieutenant governor, Antonio Delgado.

The event in the park followed an all-afternoon celebration of clean power, with displays of solar panels, child-friendly lessons on renewable technology, and panel discussions. One popular panel featured McKibben and New York City’s comptroller, Brad Lander.

In other parts of the country, activists held more than 500 other actions meant to highlight the creative ways Americans are ditching fossil-based energy. In Virginia, volunteers climbed rooftops to install solar panels on affordable homes built by Habitat for Humanity. In North Carolina, families gathered at a farm powered by solar panels. And in Michigan, organizers held a car show to show off electric vehicles; families also held a beach clean up nearby.

Renewable energy sources have seen unprecedented growth in recent years. Last year, they accounted for over 90% of total energy expansion globally, one analysis found. And the US generated less than half of its energy from fossil fuels for the first time this past March.

Yet the day of action came amid unprecedented attacks on climate protections and the renewable energy transition by the Trump administration. Since January, his administration has rolled back grants for solar, kicked off an all-of-government approach to shut down wind, halted and delayed wind projects, and launched more than 150 other anti-environmental and anti-renewable energy actions. The plans are threatening not only the climate but also Americans’ pocketbooks, said Vermont senator Peter Welch.

“Clean energy is really good for affordability. It lowers the utility bills people are struggling to pay and creates really good jobs,” Welch said in an interview. “What Trump is doing is wrecking that economic potential. Customers are going to get hammered.”

Despite these attacks, the event had an overall air of optimism. McKibben said though the US is backsliding on climate progress, much of the rest of the world is continuing to build out renewable power.

“The pattern around the world is unmistakable,” he said in an interview. “The reason that it’s happening is partly because of the climate crisis but also largely because this is the cheapest form of energy, and it’s getting cheaper every year.”

The Sun Day action came ahead of Climate Week in New York City, an annual event that convenes government officials, corporate actors and activists for a vast array of climate-focused events. It also came one day after the “Make Billionaires Pay” march, for which 25,000 people took to the streets in New York City.

“Billionaires caused the climate chaos, spearheaded the rise of authoritarianism and they continue to profit from our suffering. But they forgot one thing: there are more of us than there are of them,” said Renata Pumarol, an organizer with the environmental justice non-profit Climate Defenders, in a statement about the Saturday protest.

Sun Day participants did not shy away from naming the fossil fuel companies who have been the primary cause of global warming. But it focused largely on solutions aimed at taking on the climate crisis instead of the actors behind it.

McKibben, for instance, praised Utah’s move three months ago to legalize the installation of solar panels on balconies – something that is illegal in all other US states. And New York assemblymember Emily Gallagher previewed a state bill she will introduce next week aimed at helping renters access solar panels.

At the press conference, McKibben noted that though the forecast for Sunday showed cloudy skies, the day was bright and warm.

By Marcel Suri, CEO and Co-founder of Solargis

Extreme weather poses a serious threat to the solar energy industry. Higher occurrence of events such as heavy rainfall, fast changing sunny and cloudy weather, snow storms, hurricanes, high atmospheric pollution and hailstorms can significantly disrupt energy generation and cause material damage to PV systems.

In all cases, there are serious financial consequences for PV power plant operators and investors.

The growing pressure is on the US solar industry, too. Throughout the United States, more frequently climate patterns take the form of unusually warm weather, flash floods, wildfires, strong winds, and severe thunderstorms.

To ensure systems are designed and prepared to withstand harsher, less predictable conditions, PV developers must gain a deeper understanding of power supply fluctuations and model them accurately in real time to minimize potential losses.

What the numbers show

At Solargis, we conduct an annual analysis of global horizontal irradiation (GHI) difference, comparing each year’s data against the long-term averages (LTA) – data that directly impacts the performance of solar power plants.

Our 2024 findings reveal significant increases and decreases in solar irradiation across various US regions. For example, an extreme heatwave affected states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. We also observed unusually intense solar irradiation in moderate regions like the Midwest and Northeast, including the Great Lakes area.

These were not isolated events.

Other regions experienced climate-related disruptions too, including wildfires, which burned over one million acres of land in California alone, and late-season snowstorms in the northern Rocky Mountains. In October last year, a tornado significantly damaged a 45MW Lake Placid Solar Power Plant in Florida, shortly before Hurricane Milton hit the area.

Harnessing the power of data

The key to understanding how climate-related events affect PV system performance lies in the granularity and accuracy of the data used to model and simulate solar conditions.

Most solar simulation software today still relies on hourly Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) data. These datasets consolidate weather conditions from multiple past years into a single ‘typical’ year, capturing average solar and temperature patterns.

However, TMY fails to reflect real-world variability – whether short-term (intra-hourly) or interannual (year-to-year natural variability cycles). The limited temporal resolution and historical depth of TMY data mean that simulations based on it often overlook these ‘non-typical’ events and fail to account for critical operational risks.

This disconnect between simulation and reality can only be addressed through PV modeling based on higher-resolution datasets. Time Series data, which offers 15-minute granularity over multiple decades, enables significantly more accurate assessments of PV system behavior. But improved datasets alone are not enough – solar developers also need sophisticated software solutions capable of processing and interpreting this data effectively.

Protecting and empowering solar developers and investors

In a future shaped by more challenging weather events, the solar industry cannot afford to rely on legacy approaches. Forward-looking companies must embrace a new standard of modeling – one grounded in real-world physics and supported by data that reflects the full range of environmental conditions a PV power plant encounters.

High-resolution datasets, when paired with advanced simulation software, equip developers and investors with the insights needed to:

Predict weather-related impacts more accurately,

Create more robust designs, plan preventive operation and mitigate downtime,

Improve system resilience and operational efficiency, and

Strengthen confidence among insurers and financial stakeholders.

As the US solar sector faces the mounting challenges of climate volatility, access to granular, long-term data will become indispensable.

Understanding irradiance variability – and being able to model it accurately – is essential for protecting assets, securing investment, and maintaining consistent energy production.

The company is currently collaborating with MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center to build SPARC, the precursor to CFS’s first commercial plant, ARC, which the company expects to be the first grid-scale fusion power plant in the world.
Bob Mumgaard, Co-founder and CEO of CFS, said: “The agreement with Eni demonstrates the value of fusion energy on the grid.
As energy demand grows, Eni supports the development of fusion power as a new energy paradigm capable of producing clean, safe, and virtually inexhaustible energy.
This international partnership confirms our commitment to making fusion energy a reality, promoting its industrialization for a more sustainable energy future.”","Italian energy company Eni announced today that it has signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) worth more than $1 billion with Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), to offtake energy from CFS’ first commercial fusion plant, which is anticipated to come online in Chesterfield County, Virginia in the early 2030s.

Fusion, the process of combining two atoms to form a single atom to release energy, has been long referred to as the “Holy Grail” of clean and abundant energy production, given its potential to produce power from hydrogen – the most common element in the universe – without producing carbon emissions associated with fossil-fuel based power, and without the highly radioactive output of nuclear fission processes. Large scale fusion energy generation has been elusive, however, given the need to create extremely high temperatures and pressure.

Spun out of MIT in 2018, Massachusetts-based CFS is working to develop the world’s first net-energy positive – i.e., producing more energy than it consumes – fusion device, to prove and scale the production of fusion energy. The company is currently collaborating with MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center to build SPARC, the precursor to CFS’s first commercial plant, ARC, which the company expects to be the first grid-scale fusion power plant in the world.

CFS recently raised more than $860 million in a Series B2 fundraising round to advance the commercialization of its fusion technology. The new PPA with Eni follows an offtake agreement recently signed with Google.

Bob Mumgaard, Co-founder and CEO of CFS, said:

“The agreement with Eni demonstrates the value of fusion energy on the grid. It is a big vote of confidence to have Eni, who has contributed to our execution since the beginning, buy the power we intend to make in Virginia. Our fusion power attracts diverse customers across the world — from hyperscalers to traditional energy leaders — because of the promise of clean, almost limitless energy.”

Eni was an early investor in CFS in 2018, and the company increased its investment in CFS’ recent financing round. In 2023 Eni and CFS signed a Collaboration Framework Agreement to accelerate fusion energy development, with the collaboration spanning areas including operational and technological support project execution through the sharing of methodologies learned from the energy industry, and relationships with stakeholders.

Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi said:

“Eni has been strengthening its collaboration with CFS through its technological know-how since it first invested in the company in 2018. As energy demand grows, Eni supports the development of fusion power as a new energy paradigm capable of producing clean, safe, and virtually inexhaustible energy.

The disappearance of the federal tax credit could force these companies to rethink pricing strategies or cut back production plans to match reduced demand.","Over the past few years, the federal EV tax credit has played a crucial role in boosting electric vehicle ownership. Buyers of new electric cars have received an average benefit of $6,700, while those opting for used models claimed around $3,400. In total, Americans claimed $3.3 billion in new EV credits and $95.6 million for used EVs in 2023 alone. This direct financial relief helped make EVs more appealing in a country where gasoline-powered vehicles still dominate.

At the same time, the national market for electric vehicles remains relatively modest. According to Supercar Blondie, EVs accounted for just 1.7 percent of all light-duty vehicles on U.S. roads in 2023, even with the tax credit in place. While that figure marked a slight increase from the previous year’s 1.2 percent, the overall momentum remains fragile, with new EV sales actually falling by 6.3 percent in the second quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.

California Stands to Lose the Most

Among all U.S. states, California faces the steepest drop if the federal EV tax credit ends. The state, which has long led the country in EV adoption, could miss out on approximately $1.1 billion in incentives. Texas follows with nearly $273 million at stake, and Florida comes next, potentially losing around $201 million in benefits.

The scale of California’s reliance on the tax credit is a direct reflection of its aggressive push toward clean energy and transportation alternatives. But as reported by Supercar Blondie, without this financial support, the affordability of EVs could plummet for thousands of consumers, forcing many to delay or abandon electric vehicle purchases altogether.

In contrast, some states may barely register the change. Mississippi, North Dakota, and Louisiana are cited as regions where the EV credit had minimal impact in the first place. With fewer residents investing in electric vehicles, the loss of the credit in these areas is unlikely to disrupt local markets in any significant way.

Drop in Sales Hints at Waning Momentum

Even before the scheduled end of the credit, EV sales have started to show signs of strain. Nationwide sales of new electric vehicles fell by 6.3 percent in the second quarter of 2025 compared to the same timeframe in the previous year. This downturn suggests a growing hesitation among buyers, potentially tied to the looming expiration of financial incentives.

The trend is especially concerning considering the relatively low base from which EV adoption is growing. At just 1.7 percent of light-duty vehicles, EVs still occupy a small slice of the U.S. automotive market. Without the continued nudge from federal credits, that slice may shrink even further—particularly in areas with limited infrastructure or weak local incentives.

This softening in consumer demand also places pressure on automakers, many of which have expanded their EV lineups in response to environmental goals and evolving regulations. The disappearance of the federal tax credit could force these companies to rethink pricing strategies or cut back production plans to match reduced demand.

Uneven State Infrastructure Could Widen the Gap

The disparity in how different states will be affected by the credit’s end points to deeper structural differences across the country. States like California, Texas, and Florida have made significant investments not only in EV adoption but also in charging infrastructure, public awareness, and state-level incentives. These efforts have created more favorable environments for electric vehicles.

On the other hand, states with limited charging networks or weak policy support may struggle even more to attract EV buyers once the federal incentive is gone. As noted in the same source, this could leave automakers with a “patchwork market,” where progress is clustered in specific regions while others remain stagnant.

The lack of a consistent national strategy means the EV market could fracture along state lines. LendingTree’s analysis, as cited in the article, warns that in the absence of federal support, areas without strong local programs will see demand slow even further, exacerbating the already uneven rollout of electric transportation.",https://thenewswheel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EV-charging-.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 09:00:48.262034

With about a week and a half left before the next fiscal year begins, don’t hold your breath on anything happening soon to avoid a government shutdown.

President Donald Trump’s latest comments about negotiating with Democrats are a reminder of the difference between a get-together and getting together. “I’d love to meet with them, but I don’t think it’s going to have any impact,” Trump told reporters over the weekend. “They want all this stuff, they haven’t changed, they haven’t learned from the biggest beating they’ve ever taken, just about.”

Visa Fee Faces Likely Challenges

Trump signed a proclamation Friday that would move to extensively overhaul the H-1B visa program, requiring a $100,000 fee for applications in a bid to curb overuse. The fee, however, flouts clear requirements of federal immigration law and will invite immediate lawsuits, attorneys say.

The fee, which took effect Sunday, could also have devastating effects on businesses that expected to add workers through the specialty occupation visa program this fall. It would be imposed as a condition of US entry for foreign workers hired through the H-1B program popular with the tech sector, although it’s unclear what it would mean for visa holders already in the country.

Redistricting Begins Today in Two States

Two more states are starting the process of revising congressional district lines, Greg Giroux reports.

Ohio’s constitution requires a new map because the one put in place after the 2020 Census wasn’t bipartisan and therefore had to be temporary. A likely scenario there is for the Republican-dominated legislature to miss a Sept. 30 deadline to pass a map supported by a majority of both parties. That would trigger action by the GOP-dominated Ohio Redistricting Commission, with an Oct. 31 deadline to approve new lines in a bipartisan vote. If it doesn’t, the legislature could do its own, at the risk of lawsuits under anti-gerrymandering constitutional provisions. Don’t expect anything to get settled quickly there.

Utah is going to move faster. The state’s Legislative Redistricting Committee will hold two public meetings this week and publish a proposed map on Thursday. It’s revising the state’s four-district map after a judge ruled that the legislature unconstitutionally repealed and replaced a voter-approved anti-gerrymandering initiative. Read More

Kirk Aftermath

In the days before yesterday’s memorial service for slain activist Charlie Kirk, the head of the FCC changed the national conversation around that killing by saying there could be repercussions against ABC for comments made about Kirk’s supporters by late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) called that “mafioso” behavior, and another GOP senator now has added to the criticism. Kentucky’s Rand Paul (R) said on NBC’s Meet the Press that the media regulator “has got no business weighing in on this.”

“Any attempt by the government to get involved with speech, I will fight,” Paul said.

Trump and other Republicans have supported the push on broadcasters. “The FCC has a responsibility to call balls and strikes,” Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) said on Fox News Sunday. Read More

Eye on Tariffs

US companies are being pitted against each other over how tariffs should apply to their products. Businesses are able to suggest that their competitors’ products be subject to tariffs through a process that so far has produced lopsided results, Isabel Gottlieb reports.

Earlier this year, the Commerce Department granted virtually all requests to tariff certain products not already falling under another tariff measure or investigation. No rebuttals arguing against them were granted.

The filings in the tariff cases show the complexity of the arguments for protecting US factory production this way. LG Electronics wrote that raising the price of imported household appliances would lead to lower demand, “directly undermining the very type of domestic manufacturing capacity these tariffs are meant to protect.” Read More

Did You Ace the Quiz?

Give yourself a star if you selected Option B — No pricing data required. Though typically required on proposals worth $2 million or more, for Golden Dome the contracting officer is tasked with determining if a vendor “is not likely to offer other than fair and reasonable pricing.”

The other quiz choices are there to entertain procurement professionals. It’s common for companies that lose out on a contract to have future opportunities (Option A) and for proposals to include subcontracting plans (Option C).

As for cybersecurity standards (Option D), BGOV analysts Maika Ito and Paul Murphy flag that that even though the Pentagon’s Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification doesn’t take effect department-wide until Nov. 10, those meeting Golden Dome’s Oct. 10 bidding deadline also will have to comply.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Governors of more than a quarter of U.S. states are pushing for greater influence over the country's biggest power grid -- PJM Interconnection -- where electricity prices are surging as demand driven by AI data centers outpaces the connection of new supplies.

Rising power bills in PJM, which operates the grid covering 13 states and the District of Columbia, or one in five Americans, have led to a political backlash over the last year and threats by some governors to abandon the regional grid.

The group of state leaders plans to announce the ""PJM Governors' Collaborative"" on Monday during a summit in Philadelphia to advocate for their interests in PJM, a member-run organization in which states do not have a vote, according to a person familiar with the plans.

""Among the first ideas the PJM Governors’ Collaborative will discuss at the summit will be historic reforms to PJM governance to give the states a larger role in decision-making moving forward,"" the source said.

Ballooning prices in PJM have been caused by a confluence of factors, including the cost to produce and transport electricity and a surge in demand brought by Big Tech data centers. PJM's territory holds the largest concentration of energy-intensive data centers in the world.

Capacity payments, which are made to power plant operators to guarantee they run during periods of spiking demand to avoid blackouts, are a piece of power bills in the region.

Those payments, determined by annual energy auctions, have risen by about 1,000% over the last two auctions on the projected rise of data center demand coupled with largely stagnating power supply.

PJM is governed by a board of managers, and its voting members include transmission line owners and independent power plant operators.

While states are not given a vote, they have wielded their power over PJM in other ways. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro led a successful push to put a price ceiling and floor on PJM's most recent capacity auction.

Governors are seeking a more formal role in shaping PJM that might be modeled after similar groups in Midwest and New England grids, a source familiar said.

Shapiro, who runs the biggest electricity-producing state in the PJM region, plans to discuss issues including the PJM stakeholder process, market reforms, connecting new power supplies faster and increasing transparency in PJM, according to a release by the governor's office.

As part of its future plans, Inox Solar will expand the Bavla facility to its full 3 GW capacity in the second phase.
Bharat Saxena, CEO and Whole-time Director of Inox Clean Energy, added that Inox Solar is rapidly increasing its capacity while providing advanced solar technology.","Inox Clean Energy Limited’s wholly owned subsidiary, Inox Solar Limited, has announced the start of production at its new solar module manufacturing facility in Bavla, Ahmedabad, Gujarat. The facility has begun operations with a first-phase capacity of 1.2 GW, which is part of a larger 3 GW plant.

The state-of-the-art, fully automated Bavla plant is equipped with advanced technology to manufacture N-type TOPCon solar modules using M10, G12R, and G12 solar cells. These modules represent the latest standards in global solar manufacturing, offering higher efficiency, reduced degradation, and improved reliability. The bi-facial design of the modules allows them to generate power from both sides, increasing the capacity utilization factor (CUF) and improving overall productivity.

As part of its future plans, Inox Solar will expand the Bavla facility to its full 3 GW capacity in the second phase. In addition, the company is developing an integrated solar cell and module manufacturing plant with a capacity of 4.8 GW in Dhenkanal, Odisha. This project will play a key role in strengthening India’s domestic solar manufacturing ecosystem, reducing reliance on imports, and positioning the country as a major contributor to the global renewable energy supply chain.

Devansh Jain, Executive Director of INOXGFL Group, highlighted that the first phase of the Bavla facility was completed within just four months. He stated that this milestone is not only about expanding production capacity but also represents a significant step toward India’s energy independence. With the current gap in domestic solar cell manufacturing, large companies like INOXGFL, which offer integrated solutions, are well positioned to benefit from the sector’s growing opportunities.

Bharat Saxena, CEO and Whole-time Director of Inox Clean Energy, added that Inox Solar is rapidly increasing its capacity while providing advanced solar technology. He emphasized that the commissioning of the first phase of the Bavla facility aligns with India’s goals of self-reliance and sustainability in power generation. The achievement further reinforces INOXGFL Group’s reputation and leadership in the renewable energy sector.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image007.png,N,,2025-09-22 09:00:04.507854

This has prompted the centre to actively engage with state governments to tackle the issue by buying more clean energy.

“We are trying to convince state governments, which are waiting for power prices to decline further. A second round of talks will be held soon,” said federal minister Pralhad Joshi at the Confederation of Indian Industry's energy conference.

According to government data, more than 44 gigawatts of clean energy remain unsold across the country. This surplus highlights a mismatch between supply growth and demand from state distribution companies, many of which are struggling with financial constraints and are hesitant to commit to long-term power purchase agreements.

GST Impact

Joshi added that the GST reforms align with India’s commitment to energy transition and self-reliance, making renewable power more competitive compared to conventional sources.

The GST Council recommended reducing the GST rate on all types of solar inverters from 18% to 5%. It also recommended a uniform 12% GST rate on parts and accessories for the manufacturing of solar power-based electronic items.

A wild card for grid batteries is how much domestic manufacturing may step up to get around the FEOC restrictions.
“You don’t need that big of a change in EV demand to really create plenty of opportunities” for grid battery production, she said.","A clean energy technology often linked with renewables is notching record growth in President Donald Trump’s America, encroaching on fossil fuels even in the Texas oil patch.

Batteries that can store and release big amounts of electricity are increasingly connecting to the electricity grid and major industrial projects like data centers, even without the federal grants and loans offered in the Biden administration.

Those batteries are providing critical backup to the wind and solar industries that Republicans routinely chastise as unreliable — and this year stripped of grants and long-term tax cuts.

“This year is looking extremely strong now with some projects moving ahead quicker than anticipated,” said Allison Weis, global head of storage at consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.

Batteries are expected to account for roughly a quarter of all installations to the grid this year, according to the Energy Information Administration, with storage costs projected to decline substantially in the coming years. In the second quarter of this year, battery installations were 63 percent higher than the same period last year, according to the American Clean Power Association.

All together, the battery market is threatening plans for new natural gas, diesel and coal plants. The reason is simple: Batteries allow companies to store and use power when they need it. That means a data center developer can store solar-generator electricity and use it at night, instead of relying on a fossil fuel plant, like a gas peaker, to step up.

“Batteries and solar are like peanut butter and jelly,” said Mark Dyson, managing director for carbon-free electricity with the environmental group RMI. “There’s a natural diurnal cycle to the sun, obviously, and also therefore to how batteries are going to be operating most economically.”

In deep-red Texas, the battery buzz is growing louder.

“We’re really trying to change the game,” Jon Parrella, the Houston area-based chief executive officer for battery firm Terraflow Energy, said in an interview. “We can get data centers online faster without having to have the grid infrastructure change as massively as everybody thinks [it needs].”

Several factors are driving private investment. Many companies are looking to batteries to meet clean energy pledges — and power demand growth forecasts not witnessed in the U.S. for decades, driven in large part by a scramble to stand up artificial intelligence data centers. Developers are also seizing on batteries to bypass sluggish permitting for new large projects like power plants.

Meanwhile, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the marquee Republican legislation this year that cut wind and solar subsidies, delivered a win for batteries, preserving a key tax credit through 2033.

And signs of trouble in fossil fuel markets are also spurring battery growth. Natural gas prices are projected to rise in the coming years, while low crude oil prices are forecast to stymie U.S. production.

Cutting carbon emissions

Parella’s company is developing a project in Bellville, west of Houston, using vanadium flow batteries. That’s a type of battery technology often considered long-duration energy storage (LDES) because they can discharge electricity for up to 10 hours or more. Other long-duration technologies include iron-air batteries and even pumped hydropower storage.

A separate Terraflow project on the Gulf Coast in the Port of Victoria is also advancing. Project partner Optimus Technology Group is planning to use Terraflow batteries at data center projects in Texas, Arizona, Ohio and other states, according to Keith Borie, vice president at Optimus.

The long-duration systems differ from lithium-ion batteries, which are more prevalent today but discharge for shorter periods of time and pose some risks for leakage and fires.

Parella says batteries are competing with “thermal” power generation, a reference to fossil fuels.

“From a carbon footprint, the biggest thing and impact we have is we significantly reduce the need for thermal generation of data centers,” he said. “They do not have to fire up anywhere near as much, and it gives us the ability to significantly reduce that footprint.”

Terraflow is just one company in a broad battery market in the U.S. that’s racing to catch up with global competitors.

“We are way behind other countries in terms of electrification and moving away from fossil-based economies,” said Anna Siefken, a former DOE official under Biden who now is North America policy and markets lead at the industry association LDES Council. “We have to make the market.”

Lithium-ion batteries, similar to technology in smartphones and electric vehicles, currently dominate the market.

They have changed how the grid operates over the past several years, increasingly providing power when demand surges, such as during evening hours in California when the sun is no longer shining. That differs from initial uses of batteries a decade ago to provide power mainly during small disruptions.

Among the biggest players are Tesla, whichunveiled a new grid battery product last week called Megablock, which combines four existing batteries around a transformer. The company is promising deliveries next year and claims it can reduce construction costs by preengineering the system in the factory, so it can plug easily into the grid.

“Lithium ion has gotten so cheap … it’s almost easier to just add more lithium batteries than to try and switch to a different technology,” said Weis.

As one example, a new battery complex on Oahu, Hawaii, began operating last year with Tesla Megapacks to replace power lost from the state’s last retired coal plant.

Skepticism at DOE

While Energy Secretary Chris Wright has said he supports long-duration storage, he also is critical of renewables.

“We need more affordable energy storage,” Wright said recently at the Council on Foreign Relations, arguing that batteries increase the costs of renewables “five- to fifteen-fold.”

“We don’t have a practical way to firm wind and solar today,” he said, referring to power that can be supplied 24 hours a day.

Battery proponents point to skyrocketing power costs from gas and coal plants during periods of highest demand. Meanwhile, they say batteries and renewables alone are not likely to fully power grids anytime soon, arguing that some gas peaker plants will continue to be important contributions to the grid.

Dyson said it would be “ridiculously expensive” to power grids with only renewables and batteries “because you’d need to oversize all three of those resources to a level that is untenable.”

“Nobody is asking for or suggesting that wind or solar should be 24-7 resources,” he said. “No resource is 24-7 — even so-called baseload power plants have frequent outages that are incredibly disruptive when they occur.”

But experts say Wright’s downbeat comments on batteries don’t match their increasing market penetration.

“Almost all of the planned capacity in Texas is solar and storage, so it must be penciling out for those developers,” said Seth Feaster, an energy data analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “Otherwise, you’d be building gas plants.”

“You could have a stampede that’s going over a cliff. I don’t think that’s true in the electricity markets,” he said.

DOE’s loan office is continuing to finance an Eos Energy Enterprises battery project in Pennsylvania, after the Biden administration closed a loan guarantee for the company in December. Other battery producers have applied to the loan office, according to a DOE spokesperson, who did not provide details on the applications.

The deployments come as renewables, which are tied to many battery projects, are under pressure in the U.S.

The Trump administration is frustrating permitting for wind and solar on public lands. In the first half of this year, solar energy provided more than half of new generation to the U.S. electricity grid, according to analysis earlier this month from the Solar Energy Industries Association and Wood Mackenzie. While that data demonstrates strength in the sector, new solar installations dropped in comparison to 2024. The analysis suggests a fifth less solar will be deployed in the U.S. in 2030, compared with previous forecasts.

Made-in-America challenges

While grid batteries emerged from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act with a preserved tax credit, the law is still creating headwinds for the industry.

The megalaw included “foreign entities of concern” provisions set to kick in in January aiming to prohibit imports of components from China, North Korea and other foreign adversaries.

While the measure allowed companies to obtain tax credits if they break ground through 2033, it included tighter timelines for the industry to comply with FEOC restrictions than many other industries. In 2026, storage projects will need to spend 55 percent of costs on non-FEOC components, a percentage that increases to 75 percent by decade’s end.

Considering that most battery components come from China, the restrictions add additional barriers for developers.

“There’s definitely a risk,” said Weis, noting that coming Treasury guidance will clarify how much the rules could exacerbate challenges for the sector. The guidance is required by the end of next year, but could be released earlier.

After the law’s passage in July, analysis firm BloombergNEF estimated grid battery installations could drop 15 percent over the next decade from where they would be otherwise, largely because of the FEOC restrictions.

Treasury’s guidance could be particularly important for battery cells, as the rest of a typical storage system is “relatively easy to source outside of China,” Weis said.

The growth this year is being driven partly by developers aiming to start projects before the restrictions hit in January, analysts say.

There’s a push to “really get things in the ground as fast as possible,” said Weis. The effects of FEOC may not be seen significantly in the industry until 2027, she said.

Tariffs and immigration raids

There also could be a contraction in growth next year because of the uncertainty from tariffs and policy shifts that occurred in the early months of Trump’s presidency — a period that takes time to show up in deployments.

“There was a pause in getting contracts signed,” she said.

After an expected drop in installations in 2026 and 2027, the industry should recover to 2025 levels within five years, but factors such as how much the Trump administration cracks down on permitting for solar projects tied to batteries could change things, according to Weis.

And despite the push for long-duration storage by Wright, that segment of the market may not be competitive until after 2030, said Isshu Kikuma, an analyst at BloombergNEF.

“It will be very difficult” to compete with the low costs of lithium-ion technology, although DOE could play a role in supporting startups, he said.

Among the startups that have pulled back on sodium-ion technology, a potential alternative to lithium-ion, is Bedrock Materials. The company halted operations earlier this year after facing cost challenges.

A wild card for grid batteries is how much domestic manufacturing may step up to get around the FEOC restrictions. Wood Mackenzie’s projections, for example, assume that growth in domestic supplies by the end of the decade will help counter any downturn.

LG Energy Solution, a Korean battery-maker, is among the companies well positioned to help drive domestic manufacturing because it has EV plants that are not being utilized and can be switched to produce grid batteries, Weis said.

“You don’t need that big of a change in EV demand to really create plenty of opportunities” for grid battery production, she said.

The company’s battery plant with Hyundai in Georgia wasrecently delayed after a raid by U.S. immigration authorities. White House immigration policies are threatening a brain drain at EV and battery plants.

Still, Parella said storage demand is likely to outstrip supply over the foreseeable future.

“The manufacturing capacity for long-duration storage is way short of where it needs to be,” he said. “The market’s so massive that there could be 20 more companies like us, and there’s still room for everybody to play.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/e6/15/e41ef7954f28a75308d865ffb12e/ew-0919-dabbs-marshall-batteries-2000-01.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 08:00:09.028658

The report grades 75 utilities across the country on their plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035, and transition to clean energy through 2035. The average score across the country was 15 out of 100.

The updated report comes out after a year of massive giveaways to the coal industry by Governor Braun and President Trump, while the federal government has ramped up attacks on affordable and easily deployable renewable energy resources, like wind and solar, which Indiana severely lacks.

Utility scores below

Duke Indiana earned a 0% (F) for the second year in a row. Since the previous report, Duke had its latest rate case approved by state regulators, locking in customers to higher monthly utility bills than if it were to stop burning coal at Edwardsport, based on the utility’s own financial data. Comparing Duke’s 2021 energy plan to its 2024 energy plan, the utility slashed 3,798 megawatts of clean energy investments and delayed a company-wide exit from coal from 2035 to 2038 by extending the life of its Gibson coal plant in southwest Indiana.

Duke's 2021 energy plan proposed shutting down unit 5 at the Gibson coal plant by 2025 and units 3 and 4 by 2029. Additionally, Duke’s 2021 energy plan proposed 4,697 megawatts of wind, solar, and storage by 2035. In Duke’s new plan, between now and 2035, the utility will only install 499 megawatts of solar and 400 megawatts of battery storage, for a combined total of 899 megawatts of new clean energy. Duke will go from a meager 100 megawatts of wind energy to none by the end of the decade when it lets a power purchase agreement expire, and the utility has no plan to bring new wind energy online between now and 2035.

CenterPoint Energy earned a 33% (D), 25% lower than its score last year. The utility is in the midst of writing its next long-term energy plan, which has a large impact on the evaluation of scores in the Dirty Truth report. CenterPoint was going to retire all coal by 2023 with a resource mix of primarily solar (54%) and wind (27%) according to its previous energy plan. In its current plan, CenterPoint cancelled 285 megawatts of clean energy contracts and is modeling keeping coal online past 2030. While CenterPoint is much smaller than Duke, it has still invested more in renewable energy and is closing coal plants.

The Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) saw its score decrease the most, earning a 57% (B), after earning an 80% (A) last year, its previous lowest score. The score lowered because of planned new gas plants due to growing demand driven by data centers, but the score remains higher than most utilities because it is closing coal plants.

Indiana Michigan Power saw the second largest dip in scores, earning 48% (C) this year after earning 66% (B) last year. I&M’s lower score comes on the heels of parent company AEP’s request to Indiana regulators to shift all costs for the uneconomic OVEC coal plants from being shared between its Michigan and Indiana customers to only Indiana customers. In 2025 alone, Ohio ended all subsidies to the OVEC coal plants and Michigan limited cost recovery, making the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission’s actions stand out.

AES Indiana saw its score remain unchanged from last year, earning it another 57% (B) in this year’s report. However, in May 2025, AES issued a request for proposal to build two new gas-burning power plants, up to 1,600 megawatts total, to power large load users like data centers, a move that would cause greenhouse gas emissions to skyrocket.

Statement from Megan Anderson, Senior Beyond Coal Campaign Organizer in Indiana:

“Governor Braun, monopoly utilities, and tech companies are driving up monthly utility bills for Hoosier families by straddling us with expensive coal and gas costs to feed power-hungry data centers. Braun’s executive orders and new laws aimed at bailing out uneconomic coal plants are forcing Hoosiers to subsidize electric infrastructure for data centers, hurting our economy and our health. I hope Gov. Braun is serious about decreasing rates, but it feels disingenuous based on his actions.

“Duke Indiana is not only failing compared to its monopoly utility peers in Indiana, it is also among the worst when compared to utilities across the nation. Duke’s failing strategy was approved by state regulators under Gov. Braun’s watch earlier this year, who granted the monopoly utility a massive rate hike that pumps hundreds of millions into its coal plants, including the economic clunker Edwardsport plant. There’s no better example of Duke’s renewable energy failure than the fact it will not have any wind energy resources after a power purchase agreement expires in a few years.”

Statement from Nicole Chandler, Beyond Coal Campaign Organizer in southwest Indiana:

“CenterPoint’s backsliding on renewable energy commitments is a step in the wrong direction for southwest Indiana and Hoosiers. CenterPoint is drafting its next long range energy plan right now, giving its VP Shane Bradford the opportunity to do what is right by Hoosiers and retire its costly and polluting FB Culley coal-burning power plant and commit to investing in more affordable, renewable energy.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-22 10:01:05.645033

Dragging Duke Energy Florida’s score down is the uncertain future of its Crystal River coal-burning power plant. Duke is studying a closure plan for the power plant that will come out later this year. Sierra Club analysis of public data finds the coal plant was only needed 11% of the time during peak summer demand, and proposes that costly polluting power could be replaced by accelerating the utility’s investments in solar and battery storage, providing a hedge against volatile gas costs for customers. Duke can still act now to take advantage of sunsetting renewable energy incentives. Renewable energy is important to the largest tech companies to power their data centers, which Duke wants to attract to its service territory with a new rate structure it seeks approval of from state regulators.

Duke is a monopoly utility, meaning customers do not have a choice in where to buy electricity. High utility bills is one reason that St. Petersburg is evaluating whether it can establish a municipal utility to replace Duke as its electricity provider.

Statement from Walter Smith, Beyond Coal Campaign Organizer in Tampa Bay:

“The best thing Duke’s state director Melissa Seixas can do to ease utility bill impacts for customers is to retire the Crystal River coal-burning power plant and replace it with solar and storage.

Oklo Aurora powerhouse (Image: Oklo)

Oklo is participating in the DOE’s newly established Reactor Pilot Program, a pathway created in response to executive orders signed in May 2025 to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment and to modernize nuclear licensing. Aurora-INL is one of three projects awarded to Oklo under the program, with two awarded directly to Oklo and one awarded to its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy.

“Oklo Inc.'s Aurora powerhouse will deliver clean, affordable, and reliable American energy to power a new generation of intelligence manufacturing across the country,” said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “As advancements in artificial intelligence drive up electricity demands, projects like this are critical to ensuring the United States can meet that need and remain at the forefront of the global AI arms race. I am honored to be attending today's groundbreaking in order to witness firsthand the innovation and increased energy production we’re seeing under President Donald J. Trump’s American Energy Dominance Agenda.”

The Aurora-INL is a sodium-cooled fast reactor that uses metal fuel and builds on the design and operating heritage of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II), which ran in Idaho from 1964 to 1994. Oklo was awarded fuel recovered from EBR-II by the DOE in 2019 and has completed two of four steps for DOE authorization to fabricate its initial core at the Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility (A3F) at INL.

“This opportunity positions us to build our first plant more quickly,” said Jacob DeWitte, CEO and co-founder of Oklo. “We have been working with the Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory since 2019 to bring this plant into existence, and this marks a new chapter of building. We are excited for this, and for many more to come.”

“DOE is excited by the opportunity to work with reactor developers, such as Oklo, to capitalize on this moment of broad support for new nuclear generation and bring the Reactor Pilot Program into reality,” said Robert Boston, manager of the DOE Idaho Operations Office.

Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co., a subsidiary of Kiewit Corporation, one of North America’s largest construction and engineering organizations, will serve as lead constructor supporting the design, procurement, and construction of the powerhouse under a Master Services Agreement announced in July 2025. Oklo expects to leverage Kiewit’s extensive expertise in delivering large-scale industrial projects on accelerated schedules with reduced costs, while maintaining high standards of safety and quality.

The project is expected to create approximately 370 jobs during construction and 70–80 long-term, highly skilled roles to operate the powerhouse and A3F.

“INL has always been where nuclear innovation becomes reality,” said INL Director John Wagner. “Today’s groundbreaking with Oklo continues that legacy, bringing advanced reactor technology from the laboratory to commercial deployment right here in Idaho.”

About Oklo Inc.: Oklo Inc. is developing fast fission power plants to deliver clean, reliable, and affordable energy at scale, establishing a domestic supply chain for critical radioisotopes, and advancing nuclear fuel recycling to convert nuclear waste into clean energy. Oklo was the first to receive a site use permit from the U.S. Department of Energy for a commercial advanced fission plant, was awarded fuel from Idaho National Laboratory, and submitted the first custom combined license application for an advanced reactor to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Oklo is also developing advanced fuel recycling technologies in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. National Laboratories.

The Dirty Truth About Utility Climate Pledges is an annual report that grades 75 utilities across the country on their plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035, and transition to clean energy through 2035.

Duke Energy Carolinas & Duke Energy Progress earned 12% (F), while Duke Energy earned 11% (F) for its operations throughout the country, which include Indiana and Florida. The national average for utilities throughout the country was 15 out of 100 possible points.

The failing score for Duke Energy Carolinas & Progress is the result of the company's lackluster investment in renewable energy, like wind and solar, which provide affordable fixed-cost resources to the grid, unlike the volatility of gas prices. Free fuel from the wind and sun, and avoiding the volatile costs of gas, is what would have saved North Carolina utility customers up to $23 billion over 20 years under the climate law that Duke successfully lobbied to weaken earlier this year. Additionally, the price of building new gas plants is going up, on top of concerns about gas-price volatility. The increase in demand from new customers, like data centers, is a convenient scapegoat for Duke’s failure to meaningfully invest in renewable energy.

Statement from Olive Burress, Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign Organizer in North Carolina:

“It’s wrong that monopoly utilities like Duke and multibillion-dollar tech companies are using their power to force North Carolina businesses and families to pay for power-hungry AI data centers. If more people join the growing number of individuals and organizations fighting back against this massive transfer of wealth from average people to the richest companies in the world, we can make them pay their fair share.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-22 07:03:44.871805

Mayors from Freetown, Paris, Montréal, Chicago, and Phoenix to showcase how cities are stepping up on climate, whilst others step back

On the agenda: green jobs, transforming ports into clean energy hubs, making cities more livable for all, and utilising city success to inspire stronger national climate commitments

World’s largest city climate week sets the stage for November’s Local Leaders Forum in Rio and COP30 talks in Bélem

C40’s delegation for New York Climate Week brings together mayors on the frontline of the climate crisis, all of whom have won election and then, in many cases, re-election, on their pledges to improve the lives of their residents through implementing positive climate policies. The experiences of these mayors are not unique: around the world, 80% of people want their leaders to take stronger action to tackle the climate emergency (according to the 2024 UN People’s Climate Vote), indicating that climate action is not just about protecting people and the planet; it is also politically popular.

Whilst some significant national governments slow or even reverse their climate commitments, C40 Co-Chair Mayor Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr of Freetown, Mayor Anne Hidalgo of Paris, Mayor Valérie Plante of Montréal, Mayor Brandon Johnson of Chicago, and Mayor Kate Gallego of Phoenix will showcase how they are leading their cities through the climate emergency by cutting fossil fuel use, protecting communities from extreme weather, and investing in good green jobs and healthy cities.

C40 representatives will take part in a wide range of events across New York Climate Week, including the Climate Mayors Forum, where Mayor Gallego, as Climate Mayors Chair, will unite 40 US mayors to discuss how to continue to lead on climate action.

Mayor Aki-Sawyerr will also represent cities at the United Nations. At the invitation of the UN Secretary General, she will speak about how businesses, financial institutions, and city leaders can push countries to step up their commitments to reducing emissions (known as Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs). The intention is for these discussions to provide a critical step towards COP30 by sharing best practices, reinforcing credible transition planning, and generating momentum to scale up ambitious net-zero action across sectors and regions. Nearly three-quarters of C40 cities are reducing emissions faster than their national governments.

The development of the green economy is another essential part of making a climate-positive future work for everyone. This will be highlighted in two new C40 reports published during New York Climate Week:

C40 Cities, the Climate Migration Council, and the Mayors Migration Council have collaborated on a new report setting out the investment and training needed for cities to capitalise on the jobs boom created by the green transition.

C40 and Arup have new research coming out that shows how transforming ports into clean energy hubs can bring significant benefits to city residents, by boosting economies, improving public health, and creating new, good green jobs.

The mayors’ work this week will also help set the agenda of city-led climate leadership, building momentum toward the World Mayors Summit in Rio and COP30 later this year. C40 mayors will be heading to Brazil to show how cities are delivering real, practical solutions to pressing global challenges, focusing on urgent delivery, not drawn-out negotiations.

C40 Co-chair and Mayor of Freetown, Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr, said: “As mayors on the frontlines of the climate crisis, we are not only leading the world on climate action but also demonstrating that real change begins in cities. Every initiative we champion—from cleaner energy to inclusive urban planning—is about securing a greener, more equitable future for generations to come.”

“New York Climate Week is a crucial opportunity to showcase how cities in the Global South are developing practical solutions, and to ensure that the voices of our rapidly growing urban youth are at the heart of the international climate conversation.

“Our work here in New York is a vital step on the road to COP30, where we must see national leaders match our ambition and commitment.”

Mayor of Phoenix, Kate Gallego, said: “We are at a pivotal time in the climate movement – one with challenges, but also opportunities.

“Despite federal policy heading in reverse, mayors across the United States are resolved and delivering and taking action to create safer, healthier, and more affordable communities.

“As more and more Americans are impacted by climate change through extreme weather and rising costs, mayors are here to share a vision of climate action that drives economic prosperity, improved quality of life, and a safer future for our children. New York Climate Week is a chance for us to come together, share our successes, and chart a path forward with our national and global partners.

Deputy Mayor of London and C40 Board Member Mete Coban said: “I am incredibly proud to be attending New York Climate Week at a time when cities are demonstrating that real climate action delivers for everyone.

“In London, we are committed to an ambitious climate plan that is making a real difference to the lives of Londoners, including delivering cleaner air and waterways.

“Cities are playing a vital role in the green transition, and we must ensure it benefits everyone. Our work in New York is a crucial step in showing national leaders how city-led solutions can help to build a greener, fairer, and safer world for all.”

C40 Cities Executive Director, Mark Watts, said: “New York Climate Week is an essential moment for global climate action on the road to COP30.

“As we have seen in cities from Freetown to Chicago, urban leaders are not waiting for permission to act; they’re implementing tangible, science-based solutions that not only cut emissions and reduce reliance on fossil fuels but also create healthier, more equitable, and more prosperous communities.

“This momentum is what’s needed to spur national governments to step up their ambition and make meaningful commitments at COP30 in Brazil. The work C40 mayors are doing to create green jobs, transition to clean energy, and build livable cities is proof that climate action is not only possible but politically popular and economically smart.”",https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/q_glossy+ret_img+to_webp/www.c40.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cropped-Favicon-1-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-22 07:01:55.497107

Under the 2019 plan, an estimated 40% state employees would have kept working and 60% would not have.","LANSING — With no state budget deal in sight, odds are higher that Michigan's government will shut down next week.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has been mum on what that will mean starting Oct. 1, nine days from now. But Crain's obtained a copy of her administration's confidential draft contingency plan from 2019, the last time the state was on the brink of a partial shutdown. The impasse then, as now, was over road funding.

The documents, while not a final word by any means, offer a blueprint of what to expect if an agreement is not reached, including how many state workers could be laid off temporarily. Employees and vendors may begin receiving information this week.

And a state shutdown could be coupled with a federal government shutdown the same day as Democrats and Republicans in Washington, D.C., butt heads over health care funding and other issues.

Prisons would stay open. So would psychiatric hospitals, juvenile justice facilities, veterans homes and other 24/7 facilities.

Parole and probation work would be unaffected. Michigan State Police troopers and sergeants would still work. Specialized police operations and investigations would be scaled back. Child protective services and child welfare staff would remain on the job.

People receiving public assistance benefits — Medicaid, cash, food, child care and disability — would keep getting services and payments. Child support collection, adoption subsidies and Medicaid home health services would continue, as would unemployment benefits. Medicaid providers would not be paid until a budget is enacted, however. Child care providers would get their payments.

Emergency response and other health and safety functions could be pared back, including environmental and public health emergency capabilities, lab work and wildfire protection. Fish production would not be disrupted at state hatcheries.

The Mackinac Bridge, the Blue Water Bridge and the Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge would remain open but possibly at lower capacities.

Debt service payments would be made.

State road construction and capital outlay projects. Halted road construction could cost the state at least $1 million a day in contractual penalties.

The lottery, which generated more than $3.2 million a day for public education in 2019, would cease, except maybe some daily drawings.

Most licensing, inspection, remediation and permitting programs would be paused, including food, dairy, environmental, occupational and other activities. The insurance, banking, marijuana, energy, payday lending and construction industries are among several that could be impacted.

Secretary of State branch offices would close and online transactions would stop. Law enforcement could not enforce expired vehicle registration and driver's licenses during the shutdown, similar to what happened during the COVID-19 pandemic.

State parks, campgrounds, harbors, historical sites, welcome centers and rest stops would close, too.

Employment and training programs would stop. Academies for state troopers and corrections officers would be suspended or postponed.

The Liquor Control Commission, the state’s liquor wholesaler, would no longer accept retail orders. Alcohol already purchased and in warehouses would be gone after five business days. A one-month shutdown in 2019 would have cost the state $41.5 million in liquor revenue.

Businesses with state contracts likely would be told it is up to them whether to keep providing services, though some would be informed their services are needed to protect residents' health and safety. They generally would not be paid for services rendered until the government reopens, though there might be some exceptions.

Most of Michigan's roughly 50,000 state employees would be instructed to not work. “Essential” workers would work and be paid.

Under the 2019 plan, an estimated 40% state employees would have kept working and 60% would not have. Departments in which a majority of employees would have continued working were corrections, military and veterans affairs, and state police. Many non-essential workers in the other departments would have stopped working.

In 2019, the Michigan Gaming Control Board, which regulates casinos, submitted a contingency plan that called for reduced staffing but enough to keep the three casinos in Detroit open. The state budget office, though, recommended fully shutting down the agency and, therefore, the casinos. It became a moot point because a shutdown was averted.

In 2007, then-Gov. Jennifer Granholm's administration planned for the casinos to close during what was an hours-long shutdown, prompting them to sue and be granted injunctive relief.",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/Michigan%20Capitol_CL.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 08:00:43.860268

On September 8, the 200 MW/400 MWh Lingshou standalone energy storage project in Hebei, China – jointly developed by EVE Energy and State Grid Power Technology – was successfully connected to the grid. It represents the world’s first large-scale application of 628Ah cells in a 100MWh-level facility, setting a new industry benchmark.

EVE Energy delivered and grid-connected 80 Mr.Giant energy storage systems and 40 integrated converter cabins within just one week. “From quality control and engineering coordination to system commissioning and operational support, EVE Energy has proven the maturity and feasibility of big-batteries technology,” the company said in a statement.

Mass production of these large-capacity cells began in December 2024, making EVE Energy the first manufacturer to mass-produce lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells with capacities exceeding 600 Ah for stationary storage applications.

The cells are part of EVE Energy’s Mr. Flagship series designed for battery energy storage system applications. The 628 Ah Mr. Big cell is integrated into the Mr. Giant system – a 20-foot containerised unit with up to 5 MWh energy storage capacity and suitable for 4+ hour long-duration storage.

However, EVE’s Mr. Big is not the largest cell announced to date. For instance, Chinese manufacturer Hithium showcased the industry’s first LFP battery cell breaking the 1000 Ah barrier last year. Their MIC 1130Ah cell is designed for long-duration storage of four to eight hours.

More recently, BYD relased a new battery energy storage system with the world’s largest single-unit capacity of 14.5 MWh. Named HaoHan, the system uses BYD’s self-developed 2,710 Ah Blade Battery cell, which the company claims is the largest energy storage cell in the world.

While 300 Ah+ products remain the industry standard, there are multiple reasons behind the move to even larger capacity cells. Using prismatic LFP cells with double the capacity effectively halves the number of cells, connection points and overall system components. According to many manufacturers, this leads to significant improvements in performance and maintenance efficiency and lower cost – primarily due to increased energy density per square meter.

On the downside, failures in larger cells have a greater impact on the system level, and thermal management becomes more challenging because larger cells emit more heat during charge and discharge cycles, making it harder to maintain uniform temperature.

EVE Energy has already begun shipping the Mr. Giant energy storage system equipped with 628Ah cells overseas. The company completed its first batch of shipments to Australia and Europe on September 10.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eve-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 05:59:10.466491

Our mission has always been to improve lives by delivering safe, reliable and cost-effective energy solutions to the people and businesses who depend on us every day. That hasn’t changed. But how we fulfill our mission must continue evolving to meet the demands of a growing region and a dynamic energy landscape.

In the past few months, there have been broader conversations about large-scale developments like data centers and the energy they consume. These proposed projects could support a larger economic development strategy that fosters growth and modernization of our electric infrastructure. Data centers are in no way associated with our current rate review request filed with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.

In fact, we’ve developed a strategy that shows no negative impact to existing customer rates should AES Indiana power data centers in the future. This is possible because, even though more investments are required to serve those customers, we will be able to spread our costs over a larger amount of electricity sold.

This information was validated in our most recent Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) public stakeholder meeting. The IRP supports economic decision making and is a critical process for AES Indiana to gather input and analyze the future of our generation resources so we can continue our mission to serve Central Indiana.

The IRP models the cost of new generation resources, changes in fuel, power purchased in the market, and operating and maintenance costs for existing assets and analyzes how these factors could impact our overall costs. This process ensures AES Indiana identifies the best option that meets our customers’ needs in a way that is safe, reliable and cost-effective. AES Indiana is planning on completing its IRP at the end of October.

We understand customers have questions about data centers. If data center agreements progress, we have an obligation to serve existing customers while being transparent with our plans to serve new customers. This will also include following the regulatory framework that requires AES Indiana to go through a public review process to make the investments to serve the data centers and review the rates these data center customers will be charged.

Our job at AES Indiana is to deliver electricity to people and places that make our community prosper. We responsibly manage what is within our control, and we are committed to working with city and state leaders on a long-term vision for a stronger, more resilient energy future.

""Those areas have always had problems with flooding and drainage, and once we've done that work I've had very, very, very, very few calls about water,"" Raiford said.
In addition to sharing costs, the parish and the Corps share responsibilities for the project.
In areas where work has been completed, Raiford said in the past he might have gotten calls about flooded ditches during a 2- or 3-inch rain.","A plan to dredge five Baton Rouge bayous, designed in the 1990s and implemented only after the deadly flooding of 2016, is now successfully protecting homes from floodwater — and it is only 15% complete.

The Five Tributaries Project involves clearing foliage from the banks and snagging obstacles along the bottoms of five bayous in the East Baton Rouge Parish, each of which empties into the Amite River.

With these bayous cleared, their waters can drain more quickly into the Amite instead of rising over their banks and threatening residents' homes.

""If you imagine the trapezoidal channel (of the bayou), we're pretty much clearing all vegetation off the side slopes coming down to about 2 inches above the ground, and then any obstructions or hindrances in the water itself, stumps, branches, anything sticking out, we'll remove those as well,"" said David Bradley, project director with the Army Corps of Engineers.

While the dredging plan was funded in 2018, it wasn't until February 2023 that the first portion of the first bayou had been successfully cleared and snagged.

Fred Raiford, transportation and drainage director for the parish, admitted delays slowed the start of the project, but says now that the lower portions of Bayou Fountain, Ward Creek and Jones Creek have been cleared, he is already seeing results.

""Those areas have always had problems with flooding and drainage, and once we've done that work I've had very, very, very, very few calls about water,"" Raiford said. ""The reason I know that is because I go look out. I mean, I watch when it rains at night. I get up because I know I'm gonna get phone calls, I'd like to at least know I've looked at it.""

Raiford said the completed work on those three bayous has been a ""tremendous plus for us with reducing the flood risk for people in our parish.""

The clearing and snagging of lower Jones Creek was finished in February 2023, Bayou Fountain's lower few miles were done in September 2023, and Ward Creek's part was completed in May 2024.

In total, 11.2 miles of waterway have been cleared, with roughly another 55 miles to go.

Those completed areas were all from the lowest and deepest portions of these bayous, where they bottom out into the Amite River and where the water is deep enough to support barges with excavators used for clearing.

The barges won't be an option for the remaining waterways, and Bradley expects the Corps instead will be using amphibious excavators, sometimes called ""marsh buggies.""

To get these machines to the water, and to store the collected debris, the parish floodwater authority will need to pay residents to use their land.

These right of way parcels could be as small as 25-foot strips along the bayous' banks or up to an acre plot on which to pile whatever is pulled from the water.

Raiford estimated the remaining work will require more than 300 temporary land acquisitions, none of which have been made.

Once all five bayous have been cleared and snagged, the Corps will also construct concrete riprap on the banks of portions of Jones Creek and look to make channel enlargements to parts of Beaver Bayou and Blackwater Bayou in Central.

So, how much longer?

Bradley, with the Corps, said he is waiting to get a better idea of the estimated time for completion for the project before giving a date.

Raiford has estimated the end of 2031.

Both pointed to the unknown variables of ongoing environmental surveys, construction timelines delivered to the directors from contractors, and the specter of hidden utilities needing to be relocated.

Raiford was the parish's public works director when the Five Tributaries plan was first considered in 1995 and 1996. He said despite approval from the Water Resources Development Act for the project to begin construction in 1999, the lack of federal money was a hurdle.

The Five Tributaries project has an estimated cost of $255 million, with the federal money being allocated in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.

But that allocation also requires the Corps' ""non-federal partners"" to pay 25% of the costs of the total project, or roughly $64 million of that $255 million total.

So far, the parish has needed to pay only around $10 million, Raiford estimated, with roughly another $40 million being matched by a capital outlay from the state.

In addition to sharing costs, the parish and the Corps share responsibilities for the project.

The parish must acquire land and relocate utilities, while the Corps must develop environmental impact statements and award construction contracts.

As for what is immediately next: The Corps has completed environmental surveys for the upper portions of Jones Creek and has ongoing surveys for upper Bayou Fountain and upper Ward Creek.

In areas where work has been completed, Raiford said in the past he might have gotten calls about flooded ditches during a 2- or 3-inch rain. Now, the complaints have grown quiet.

Larry Galloway, former president of the Sagefield Homeowners Association, which lies on the other side of Burbank Drive from Bayou Fountain, said his neighbors experienced bad flooding during both 2016 and 2021.

On Friday, standing on the edge of a long ditch where Longwood Plantation Road turns to nothing but grass, Galloway gestured out at where a clogged culvert had to be pulled from the ground after flooding in August 2021.

""Some of them got it in their homes and these down here, they got it real bad. They couldn't get out,"" Galloway said from his neighbor's backyard. ""And boy, some houses that way, most of them it was up to the mailboxes.""

Galloway isn't sure if he has noticed less water backing up in the Bayou Fountain outlets that surround his subdivision, but he hopes Raiford is right that the snagging has helped. Mostly, he is concerned about new development in the area, especially in places that were underwater in 2021, and how those new homes might push water into Sagefield.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/8e/88e2b6b9-8747-46f5-9da0-8dc5e3ce7af6/68cdf86dbb4f6.image.jpg?crop=1662%2C873%2C0%2C187&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-09-22 05:59:33.293598

The reason: Electricity demand, also known as load growth, is surging, and NIPSCO’s clean energy plans are not keeping pace.
The failures are not happening in isolation: The federal government has eliminated $22 billion of funding for clean energy projects this year alone.
Unless utilities abandon fossil fuel expansion and accelerate clean energy, customers will be stuck with higher bills and dirtier air.
“Wind, solar, and storage combined can get us to 80 percent clean energy or beyond.”","In 2024, the planet crossed what many scientists consider a dangerous threshold: It warmed to about 1.55 °C above pre-industrial levels, passing the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 °C threshold. That same year, American utility companies largely failed to do their part to ramp down fossil fuel usage. They earned a failing grade in the new The Dirty Truth About Utility Climate Pledges, the Sierra Club’s yearly analysis of utilities’ public commitments to sustainability versus their actual plans to transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.

The report found that the nation’s largest power providers are clinging to coal, one of the dirtiest sources of energy, and racing to build new gas plants. The authors examined the long-term plans of 75 utility companies and found an industry aggregate score of just 15 out of 100—the lowest score in the report’s five-year history. It evaluated utilities based on whether they will phase out coal plants by 2030, stop building new gas plants, and invest in enough clean energy to replace fossil fuels by 2035.

On all fronts, most companies failed.

“So many utilities use load growth as an excuse to backtrack on their climate progress and goals, instead of using it as a bold opportunity to meet the moment and build the clean energy we need for a clean and renewable future,” said Emma Pabst, a campaign manager for the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign and one of the authors of the study. “The reality is that a lot of utilities are stuck in old, outdated, and dirty habits, and the data shows across the board that clean is more affordable.”

Many utilities are backsliding on their commitments to clean energy sources such as wind and sun, and greenwashing at the same time—even though 65 companies in the study have climate pledges, only three of them received an A rating. Collectively, utilities are planning less renewable capacity than is necessary to replace existing fossil plants, let alone to meet the clean energy targets that most scientists agree are necessary to prevent irreparable climate damage: 80 percent clean electricity by 2030 and 100 percent by 2035.

Despite the relative affordability of renewable energy, utilities are unable or unwilling to untether themselves from coal and gas. The 75 companies in the report plan to retire just 29 percent of coal generation by 2030, and 61 of them intend to build a combined 118 gigawatts of new gas capacity by 2035.

The Dirty Truth report comes at a time when electricity demand has skyrocketed, fueled in part by the rise of energy-intensive data centers. This is the first edition of The Dirty Truth that has taken plans to build clean energy to meet growing electricity demand into account, because it is an increasingly pressing issue for utilities—and many of them meet that demand by investing in fossil fuels.

Few examples illustrate this better than the Northern Indiana Public Service Company. Although NIPSCO earned an A in every former report, its score fell 23 points from last year to this year, dropping to its lowest-ever score of 57 out of 100.

The reason: Electricity demand, also known as load growth, is surging, and NIPSCO’s clean energy plans are not keeping pace. The company predicts far greater load growth than in previous years, but its current renewable energy plans would cover only 31 percent of its existing fossil generation and projected growth. Even though NIPSCO plans to close its remaining coal plants by 2030, the utility is also planning 400 megawatts of new fossil fuel construction at the Schahfer site by 2035. Part of that new load growth is from data centers. For example, NIPSCO plans to power potential hyperscale data center development with over 3,500 megawatts of new gas infrastructure.

NIPSCO has pledged to reduce its carbon emissions by 90 percent by 2035 and to reach net-zero emissions by 2040. But its parent company said in the spring that its climate goals, “may evolve as we assess and respond to business opportunities such as data centers.”

""We have the technologies that we need today in order to solve this. Wind, solar, and storage combined can get us to 80 percent clean energy or beyond.”

In Kansas and Missouri, the utility company Evergy scored just 9 points out of 100—only four points above its score in the first edition of the report five years ago. Evergy serves 1.7 million people and is based in Kansas City, one of the most energy-burdened cities in the U.S., where many low-income, Black, and Latino households spend six percent or more of their income on electricity.

Evergy has refused to adopt local climate goals or commit to retiring the Hawthorn coal plant in Kansas City. The utility intends to retire only a third of its coal generation by 2030, while adding more than 5,500 MW of new gas capacity by 2035. If built, that gas capacity would emit as much annual pollution as 2.5 million cars.

Evergy has also walked back its emissions reductions goals. Five years ago, the utility touted its “Sustainability Transformation Plan,” which said Evergy could cut emissions 85 percent by 2030. Since then, Evergy has removed the pledge altogether. The company also proposed fewer plans for clean energy in 2025 than it did in 2024.

The failures are not happening in isolation: The federal government has eliminated $22 billion of funding for clean energy projects this year alone.

“We saw really great climate progress during the previous administration, with the IRA and the (Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act) and lots of federal rules that cracked down on pollution to make our communities cleaner and safer. We're seeing that get rolled back piece by piece,” said Noah Ver Beek, one of the report’s authors and a senior energy campaigns analyst with the Beyond Coal Campaign. “Even more, we're seeing crackdowns on the amount of clean energy that can get built on public lands, and the processes that a clean energy project needs to go through in order to receive federal permits.”

The consequences of fossil fuel reliance will land on ratepayers. According to a separate report, Assessing Impacts Of The 2025 Reconciliation Bill On U.S. Energy Costs, Jobs, Health, And Emissions, sticking with gas and coal will drive up electricity bills by $120 a year for the average household by 2030, rising to $230 by 2035.

Despite some companies improving their plans since the report’s first edition in 2021, the overall trajectory is moving backward. Unless utilities abandon fossil fuel expansion and accelerate clean energy, customers will be stuck with higher bills and dirtier air.

The Dirty Truth report calls on utilities to recommit themselves to sustainability, even as the Trump Administration does everything in its power to defund renewable energy projects and further entrench the United States in fossil fuel reliance.

“We don't need to wait for some new technology, or something great and special and new to come up. We have the technologies that we need today in order to solve this,” Ver Beek said. “Wind, solar, and storage combined can get us to 80 percent clean energy or beyond.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-22 08:00:39.762533

Some lawmakers want New Hampshire to be a bigger part of that.,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ai-driving-data-center-boom-some-lawmakers-want-new-hampshire-be-bigger-part,"Nationally, construction of data centers is at an all-time high, Reuters reports.
Lawmakers are divided on whether data center development would be an opportunity or a concern for New Hampshire.
Watters said data center jobs were not substantially better-paying than jobs in other preexisting industries.
Some data centers are cooled with river water, a practice that raises the temperature of the water downstream, Cormen said.
But they are not the only way data centers could be powered, he noted.","As data center development takes off across the United States and the world, New Hampshire legislators and regulators are weighing what steps their state, and its aging electric grid, should take to prepare.

“For me, it’s worth considering. There may be an opportunity here, but I think there’s also concerns,” said Sen. David Watters, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

Data centers — large, energy-hungry facilities housing computer networks — are rapidly becoming more common nationwide, data center developer Craig McGahey told New Hampshire lawmakers and energy professionals at the 2025 New Hampshire Energy Summit, organized by consulting and lobbying firm Dupont Group on Sept. 15.

The rise of artificial intelligence is the biggest factor contributing to increasing data center demand, McGahey said, citing competition among so-called “hyperscalers” — expansive cloud computing companies like Google, Meta, OpenAI, and others.

“As this race for AI dominance continues, we don’t see it stopping, and it’s going to continue on for many, many years,” he said.

Nationally, construction of data centers is at an all-time high, Reuters reports. And as of March 2025, the United States had more of the facilities than any other nation, according to a Statista tally.

In other states, some of which have hundreds of data centers, the facilities have strained electric grids and, in some cases, water supplies. Yet, for now, New Hampshire is not among those: 10 relatively small-scale facilities were listed statewide on the website Data Center Map as of September 2025, putting New Hampshire in the bottom fifth nationally.

Some see an ‘emerging market.’ Others, an environmental threat.

That may, however, be set to change. Low power availability and high electricity costs have so far been the principal factors preventing an influx of data centers in New Hampshire like that seen in some other states, McGahey said. But he added that he considered the Northeast as a whole an “emerging market” for the centers.

Developers like himself, he said, were assessing different states’ regulatory landscapes, land availability, and power supplies to determine where to site new centers, which can range in size from normal office buildings to projects spanning hundreds of acres.

Lawmakers are divided on whether data center development would be an opportunity or a concern for New Hampshire.

Citing property tax revenue and employment benefits, some legislators said they wanted to see New Hampshire create a regulatory environment that would favor data centers.

“I think New Hampshire should court any business into the state,” said Rep. Doug Thomas, vice chair of the House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee, in an interview. “In order for them to come here, there has to be a market. And so we have to … show them that we’re interested.”

He and House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Chair Michael Vose cited construction and jobs as a primary benefit of growing data centers in New Hampshire. In his presentation, McGahey said a data center of the scale likely to be established in New Hampshire could employ as many as 40 people full-time, and potentially hundreds more during construction.

Others questioned whether those estimates represented enough jobs to make a meaningful impact on employment. Rep. Thomas Cormen, a member of the House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee, said in an interview the amount of people employed by data centers does not typically scale up proportionally as the centers increase in size. And, he added, for a relatively uncomplicated building like the typical warehouse-style data center, the construction phase might not last particularly long, meaning the bulk of jobs created would be temporary.

Watters said data center jobs were not substantially better-paying than jobs in other preexisting industries. “Some of the biggest ones employ maybe 100 to 200 people at a $40,000 (annual) salary,” Watters said. “I mean, that’s McDonalds. … They might make close to $40,000, too.”

Cormen also raised environmental concerns. Some data centers are cooled with river water, a practice that raises the temperature of the water downstream, Cormen said. This could be harmful to the river itself or cause dangerous ice dams and flooding in winter, he said.

“I think a lot of people have environmental concerns, and power concerns,” Watters said.

Uncertainty about how data centers would be powered, Cormen said, is another hurdle; while drawing from the grid could raise electricity costs for other ratepayers, the type and effects of unregulated local generators are another unknown.

“Before you know it, we’re talking about diesel generation,” he said. “We just don’t know.”

Speculating to meet demand

Some states have weighed implementing special rate schedules to offset the impact of increased on-grid data center demand on ratepayers, but Vose said he did not expect the New Hampshire Legislature to consider such a system in the near future.

Instead, Vose and other legislators discussed ways to increase New Hampshire’s electricity generation down the road, including through speculative technology like small, modular nuclear reactors, or SMRs.

The New Hampshire Department of Energy is assessing whether SMRs could someday be implemented in New Hampshire, Director of Energy Innovation Thomas Barrasso said at the summit. SMRs could power data centers within “microgrids,” small regionalized power grids that could operate either independently of or in tandem with the rest of the grid, he said.

“I think the microgrid piece of this, the grid modernization piece of this, the SMR piece of this kind of all start to fit together,” Barrasso said.

At the summit, Barrasso expressed optimism about small modular reactors, saying he felt the tide of public opinion toward nuclear energy was changing. A Gallup poll published in April supported this impression, showing 61% of Americans in favor of nuclear power — a six percentage point increase over the previous poll in 2023.

However, SMR critics point out that the technology is still in development, questioning Barrasso’s statement at the summit that they could eventually be “plug and play” solutions to bolster New Hampshire’s energy offerings. It may be anywhere from five to 15 years before the generators could hypothetically be deployed, according to Barrasso’s presentation.

SMRs are a “convenient” discussion for people resistant to renewable energy development, Watters said in an interview. “The interest is being driven by people who think SMRs are the answer to every problem in the world,” he said. But they are not the only way data centers could be powered, he noted.

Other technologies, including forms of renewable energy, are deployable now and could be implemented with less investment, said Dan Weeks, of solar developer ReVision Energy, at the summit. Weeks highlighted grid-scale batteries and renewable generation as other options that the state could direct attention to rather than the hypothetical future deployment of SMRs.

“Is the (Department of Energy) thinking about meeting these rising energy needs and cost concerns through … greater deployment of existing technologies that are at this point pretty far down the cost curve and probably a lot closer in the future than SMRs?” Weeks asked.

“My job was to sort of get ‘all of the above’ into the mindset of everyone,” Barrasso responded.

The Legislature has already taken some steps toward localized power generation that could be used to power facilities like data centers through SMRs. House Bill 672, sponsored by Vose and signed by Gov. Ayotte in August, paved the way for off-grid energy generators to sell power directly to buyers. Vose said he hoped that bill would “encourage” microgrids. (The bill also exempts off-grid electricity providers from renewable energy standards and the rate regulations on-grid generation is subject to.)

A resolution to declare the development of advanced nuclear technology “in the best interest of New Hampshire” also passed last session, but legislators failed to pass House Bill 710, which would have allowed utilities to own and operate SMRs. A similar bill sponsored by Sen. Kevin Avard will come before the Legislature in 2026, according to a legislative service request listed on the General Court of New Hampshire website.

McGahey acknowledged the push to build data centers quickly had led developers to look toward more quickly deployable energy solutions than SMRs. In other states, developers have constructed new gas generators to meet data center demand, he said.

“Because this race is so intense, we’re looking for solutions in two to three years. We are looking at battery storage solutions. We’re looking at natural gas plants,” McGahey said.

Looking ahead

During his presentation, McGahey forecasted demand for a wave of smaller data centers within the next three to five years. The appetite of New Hampshire policymakers and utilities toward that development, McGahey said, could play a role in determining to what extent that development progresses locally.

The reality that New Hampshire’s grid is facing, including difficulties from power shortages and aging transmission lines, may make it unlikely that the state ever sees data center development on a large scale, Watters said.

“It’s hard for me to imagine that there’d be an interest in siting them here,” he said.

But the possibility, and related concerns, were worth discussing, he said, and others at the summit agreed.

“We need to get people to the table to start to talk about what the future is going to look like,” Barrasso said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-91/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/datacenter-1024x6831758531830.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=4OppMGlt,N,,2025-09-22 07:02:30.870395

The administration’s policies, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, are also expected to more than halve the amount of clean energy built over the next decade, further exacerbating concerns about soaring power prices and rising demand.

Clean energy, meanwhile, received only modest support on its own.
With the federal government standing in the way of both grid expansion and clean energy development, however, it will be tough for the voters to get the improvements they want.","While all of the United States faces delays in getting new energy onto the grid, the problem is worst in the PJM region, where hundreds of projects have been stalled in the queue for years. To deal with the backlog, the grid operator switched to a new interconnection process in 2023; as of June, PJM still had about 63 gigawatts of power, mostly clean energy, stuck in that ​“transition queue.”

Across the country, wind, solar, and battery storage make up most of the resources waiting to come online, and their ​“levelized cost of energy” is cheaper or on par with other electricity sources.

The Trump administration has called for ​“the rapid and efficient buildout” of energy infrastructure, including transmission lines and grid-enhancing technologies, ​“by easing Federal regulatory burdens.”

But the administration’s actions have so far had the opposite effect. A February executive order calling for review of independent agency rulings threatens the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s ability to expand transmission. And in July, the Trump administration canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for the Grain Belt Express — the largest transmission line underway in the United States. The project aims to shuttle gigawatts of wind and solar power from the Great Plains to the East, and Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., has called the cancellation of its federal loan guarantee illegal.

The administration’s policies, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, are also expected to more than halve the amount of clean energy built over the next decade, further exacerbating concerns about soaring power prices and rising demand.

What’s on voters’ minds

The survey results may help the Conservative Energy Network convince decision makers to take steps to expand the grid.

“To the best of my knowledge, this is the first poll that’s been done in the PJM area testing these things, and in the MISO south area,” said John Szoka, the group’s CEO, at the National Conservative Energy Summit.

The polling also gauged the persuasiveness of four statements to support grid expansion. The takeaways could inform how advocates and legislators work to boost public support for clean energy.

Among conservatives in Ohio and Pennsylvania, a message focused on lower costs was about 12 times more likely to shift someone’s opinion than one about preventing blackouts, Lane noted. Messages about increasing American energy production, preventing blackouts, and providing positive job and economic impacts for Americans were more likely to move liberals than one about lowering costs.

Opinions were more divided on whether the federal government, states, or private companies should pay for grid expansion, although a slight majority of respondents in both the PJM and MISO areas said they would be willing to pay a few dollars more per month in the short term if it would reduce outages and lower costs over time.

Respondents were also mixed on who should get to choose how electricity is produced. States, landowners, and local officials all ranked above federal authorities.

Clean energy, meanwhile, received only modest support on its own. About one-fourth of the Ohio and Pennsylvania respondents said using clean energy was one of their top two policy goals, with nearly one-fifth of those surveyed in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri giving that response.

Ultimately, affordability and reliability were the clear consensus energy policy priorities for poll respondents in both the PJM and MISO areas.

With the federal government standing in the way of both grid expansion and clean energy development, however, it will be tough for the voters to get the improvements they want.

Local climate activists held an event Friday to celebrate the ocean’s 3.8 billionth birthday and raise awareness about the impacts of climate change and carbon emissions on the ocean’s health.

Surrounded by artwork produced by local activists, including a painting of flood destruction in Sierra Leone and a banner reading “Fossil Fuel Burning = Ocean Death,” attendees participated in ocean trivia, shared an Ashley’s ice cream cake and listened to discussions of how carbon emissions from fossil fuel-based transportation endanger the ecosystem.

“Coastal displacement!” Jenna Zidan, an organizer for the New Haven Climate Movement, or NHCM, shouted to a crowd on Broadway island.

“Wake up!” the crowd chanted in response.

“Sea ice melting!” Zidan said.

“Wake up!”

The event marked the launch of NHCM’s inaugural GOtober Campaign, which calls for less car and more public transportation use from New Haven residents in October.

The campaign emphasizes that greenhouse gases emitted by transportation are one of the main drivers of ocean acidification, Chris Schweitzer, director of the NHCM, said. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, 12 gallons of gasoline — a single tank for many cars — release 235 pounds of carbon dioxide.

Schweitzer hopes that GOtober encourages New Haveners to “defund the OilyGarchy” through concrete decisions they make about their transportation methods.

“Right now, the present administration, supported largely by millions of dollars of fossil fuel donations, is attacking everything to do with the environment,” Schweitzer said. “GOtober is partly a chance for people to say, ‘Yeah, I want to stop supporting the fossil fuel industry and spend the 500 dollars on gas elsewhere.’”

As extreme weather becomes more frequent and temperatures continue to rise, New Haveners at the event said they have noticed their environment shifting in real time.

Ethan Reynolds ’28, who attended the Sound School, a local public school on the New Haven Harbor, said that his proximity to frequent ocean storms made him “really mindful about how the changing water temperature and everything impacts the marine environment.”

Jam Lian ’28 said that while the coast helps moderate seasons, he worries that rising sea levels and temperatures make New Haven vulnerable to hurricanes due to its coastal position.

Organizers and participants alike expressed that while encouraging residents to take public transportation is necessary to stymie climate change, the current inaccessibility of the city’s transit system poses a barrier to many.

Natalie Clorio, a senior at Career High School and a former intern with NHCM, lives 40 minutes away in Derby. Every week, she pays up to $14 to take the bus to and from New Haven for school and work, she said. She said she has a part-time job to help pay for transportation.

“I don’t think high schoolers should be paying for buses,” Clorio said, adding that many of her peers are scared to take public transportation because of fears about danger on buses.

Meredith Polk, who took the bus to Friday’s event, said that her bus ran 15 minutes late, which was “pretty normal.”

“The city is really built for cars,” Polk said. “There’s a lot of parking options, so people aren’t really motivated to take the bus, and it’s not as safe to ride a bike.”

The lack of shelter, seating and signage about schedules at bus stops also makes riding the bus more inaccessible, Schweitzer said. Sandeep Aysola, New Haven’s director of transportation, traffic and parking, did not immediately respond to the News’ questions about shelter and signage. He wrote that the Connecticut Department of Transportation is responsible for buses and their scheduling.

“If you get more people on buses, the buses run more often, which is good for folks who depend on buses,” Schweitzer said.

In 2024, the NHCM proposed the “Transportation Transformation Resolution” to the city, which would require New Haven departments to detail concrete plans for improving public transportation and reducing greenhouse gases.

In March, the Board of Alders heard the NHCM’s proposal and decided to keep the resolution in committee, rather than taking a vote. The city’s alders have not yet voted on the resolution.

According to Connecticut’s latest climate report, transportation was the state’s top source of greenhouse gas emissions due to the burning of fossil fuels, at 42 percent of total emissions.",https://yaledailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/oceanbday_kccc_CatherineCheung_ContributingPhotographer-scaled-1024x732.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 05:59:28.682615

First, load growth can be met with clean alternatives like efficiency, transmission upgrades, demand-side management, renewables, and storage.
However, the data reveals a different story: most of these pledges are greenwashing, not indicative of genuine plans for a clean energy transition.","Of the three score components - coal, gas, and clean - utilities made the most progress in planning new clean energy. However, these utilities are planning enough clean energy to replace ONLY 32% of existing coal and gas generation and load growth by 2035.

Each year since 2021, the amount of additional load utilities forecast by 2035 has increased, but utilities have failed to make clean energy plans to keep pace. If we assume all planned clean energy would replace existing coal and gas generation first, planned clean energy is barely sufficient to replace half, let alone supply forecast load growth.

Utilities plan to add 118 GW of new gas capacity by 2035- which would be a 20% increase in nationwide gas capacity. While they claim this is needed to meet rising demand, there are three problems with that argument.

First, load growth can be met with clean alternatives like efficiency, transmission upgrades, demand-side management, renewables, and storage. Second, over a third of utilities are planning more gas than needed for their projected growth. Third, new gas is poorly suited for near-term needs, which require faster, more flexible solutions.

To limit global warming to below 1.5°C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientific and policy consensus shows that economies like the U.S. must retire all coal-fired power by 2030. Yet utilities in this study are stubbornly clinging to coal.

Coal is one of the most polluting and often the most expensive way to produce electricity. In fact, coal power was 28% more expensive in 2024 than it was in 2021. Retiring the rest of the coal fleet is one of the most effective ways to reduce emissions and lower customer's bills.

Of the 75 companies examined in this study, 65 have some form of climate pledge. Utilities often highlight these commitments as proof of their dedication to clean energy and environmental responsibility. However, the data reveals a different story: most of these pledges are greenwashing, not indicative of genuine plans for a clean energy transition. Despite 65 utilities having climate goals, only 3 received an A.

Utilities that are serious about their climate commitments must do more than set distant goals. They should adopt strong, science-aligned targets with regular interim milestones and back those goals with detailed, actionable plans to achieve them.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/files/styles/sierra_full_page_width/public/2025-09/bw-istock-525755829-with-cutout-low-crop2-sh.png.webp?itok=BY2f_byt,N,,2025-09-22 09:00:32.749140

Recent executive orders are facilitating the reopening of shuttered nuclear plants, such as the Palisades plant in Michigan, which is just one of the planned recommissions around the country.

This “nuclear renaissance” means that more employees are needed in the nuclear sector, and those already employed who have industry expertise need to be retained. The nuclear workforce is already older than other segments of the energy industry, with 60% of nuclear employees aged 30–45. Public and private employers must therefore invest in recruiting and training employees with the necessary technical skills, but they also must identify candidates with the right personality traits for this unique industry.

Working in a nuclear power plant can be stressful — in addition to technical competency, it requires a commitment to safety culture and teamwork. The legacy of accidents such as Three Mile Island and Chernobyl means the stakes are high, and 80% of significant events at nuclear facilities have been attributed to human error.

HR teams need a robust toolset to find the right employees and support the physical and mental health of those they currently have. Assessments are a valuable part of that toolset, and they can equip HR professionals in the nuclear industry with data that helps them support the well-being of this critical energy workforce.

How assessments assist in recruiting

Assessments such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory®-3 (MMPI®-3) can bring value by providing information about attitudes and personality traits that can inform how a candidate may approach a given job role. While HR teams should not be expected to interpret the MMPI-3 as clinical practitioners would, the assessment can be a rich source of information for them. By going beyond resumes and interviews, such tools give hiring teams a deeper understanding of work styles, interpersonal dynamics, and potential fit within the organization, helping to make more confident, informed talent decisions.

“Assessments can play a powerful role in proactively spotting signs of emotional distress or maladaptive coping styles,” says Lynsey Psimas, Ph.D., Director of Business Development, Government & Public Safety at Pearson Clinical Assessments. “When applied consistently during recruitment, these tools can reveal skills and personality traits that will either complement — or potentially clash with — the demands of a high-stress role,” she says.

Maintaining employee wellness with assessments

Supporting employees’ holistic well-being requires many strategies, spanning health coverage, time off, and financial security. Assessments add an important layer to this strategy by offering insight into emotional or psychological distress that could impact an employee’s performance.

For example, the Beck Anxiety Inventory® (BAI®) and Beck Depression Inventory® (BDI®) from Pearson are quick 21-item screeners that can help identify symptoms of anxiety or depression. Pearson also offers the Quality of Life Inventory® (QOLI®), which assesses mental health aspects like happiness and satisfaction.

If an employee is struggling with family issues or financial problems, these stressors can affect their work life as well. Assessments help HR teams to proactively identify employees who may need support to handle such challenges and remain healthy and focused at work.

“Assessments can be an integral part of broader wellness and resiliency programs,” Psimas says. “They give employers a way to monitor progress over time, such as within an Employee Assistance Program, providing actionable insights to better support their workforce,” she adds.

Assessments can also help HR teams understand how their workforce approaches teamwork, and who may thrive — or face challenges — in collaborative or leadership roles. The Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire® (MPQ®) looks at interpersonal skills, resilience, and social skills that are crucial for employees in an industry like nuclear power, where collaboration and executing on tasks are of the utmost importance. If employee conflicts are an issue or communication needs improvement, starting with an assessment like the MPQ® gives HR teams a data-driven baseline of personality traits, helping teams target development and strengthen workplace dynamics.

How to build the nuclear workforce of the future

As HR teams build up their workforce in the revived nuclear sector, they need a range of tools and tactics to find and retain the right employees who are technically skilled and able to handle this industry’s unique challenges. The need for more electricity will not diminish any time soon, and nuclear power’s emission-free nature means it will be an important part of our energy mix for years to come. As a result, employers must focus on recruiting and retaining the employees who can make this nuclear renaissance a success.

A resilient workforce is key to this process.

Policy Shifts: Carbon Pricing, Subsidies, and Regulatory Frameworks

The 2025 carbon policy landscape is marked by a dual focus on punitive measures for high-emission industries and incentives for sustainable alternatives. Carbon pricing mechanisms, such as expanded cap-and-trade systems and carbon taxes, have created a fiscal disincentive for fossil fuel dependency. According to the Future of Jobs Report 2025, 47% of employers anticipate that climate-change mitigation will fundamentally reshape their operations within five years, directly influencing capital allocation toward low-carbon technologies In charts: 7 global shifts defining 2025 so far | World Economic Forum, [https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/08/inflection-points-7-global-shifts-defining-2025-so-far-in-charts/][ 2 ].

Simultaneously, governments are deploying subsidies and industrial policies to accelerate renewable energy adoption. For instance, the report notes that one-third of surveyed organizations are adjusting business models in response to subsidies for green infrastructure, which reduce upfront costs for solar, wind, and energy storage projects These are the Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2025 | World Economic Forum, [https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/06/top-10-emerging-technologies-of-2025/][ 3 ].

The surge in demand for green jobs—such as renewable energy engineers and environmental engineers—serves as a barometer for the sector's financial health. The Future of Jobs Report 2025 identifies these roles as among the “15 fastest-growing jobs,” reflecting both policy-driven demand and market confidence in renewable technologies In charts: 7 global shifts defining 2025 so far | World Economic Forum, [https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/08/inflection-points-7-global-shifts-defining-2025-so-far-in-charts/][ 2 ]. This labor market shift underscores a critical point: as nations scale up renewable infrastructure, the associated workforce development and technological innovation create a self-reinforcing cycle of investment.

For example, the report projects that 170 million new jobs will emerge in renewable energy and related fields by 2030 These are the Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2025 | World Economic Forum, [https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/06/top-10-emerging-technologies-of-2025/][ 3 ]. Such growth signals to investors that the sector is not only aligned with regulatory mandates but also poised for sustained economic returns. The integration of skills like AI and big data into energy systems further enhances operational efficiency, reducing costs and improving project scalability The Future of Jobs Report 2025 - The World Economic Forum, [https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2025/in-full/3-skills-outlook/][ 4 ].

Geopolitical and Economic Catalysts

Beyond policy, geopolitical dynamics are amplifying the financial case for renewables. The report notes that rising trade tensions—exemplified by tariffs under U.S. President Donald Trump—have prompted countries to localize supply chains and prioritize sustainable alternatives In charts: 7 global shifts defining 2025 so far | World Economic Forum, [https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/08/inflection-points-7-global-shifts-defining-2025-so-far-in-charts/][ 2 ]. This “geoeconomic fragmentation” is driving investment into domestic renewable energy projects, as nations seek to reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels and secure energy independence.

Moreover, emerging technologies such as osmotic power systems and advanced nuclear reactors are diversifying the renewable energy portfolio, offering new avenues for high-ROI infrastructure. The Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2025 highlights innovations like structural battery composites, which could revolutionize energy storage for electric vehicles, further de-risking long-term investments .

Conclusion: A Tipping Point for Renewable Energy

The convergence of carbon policy reforms, technological innovation, and geopolitical realignments is creating a tipping point for renewable energy infrastructure. While specific ROI metrics remain sparse in the 2025 data, the broader trends—such as job growth, subsidy-driven cost reductions, and the de-risking of green technologies—paint a compelling picture of financial viability. Investors who align with these shifts are not only complying with regulatory frameworks but also capitalizing on a sector poised for exponential growth.

As the World Economic Forum emphasizes, the green transition is no longer a niche market—it is a strategic imperative for long-term profitability. The question is no longer if renewable energy will outperform traditional assets, but how quickly the global economy will adapt to this reality.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-qwen_generated_1758530741184.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-22 07:02:36.154921

""The reality is stark,"" says Melanie Robinson, global climate director at the World Resources Institute.
There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.
His administration has proposed a series of policy changes, including repealing climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants, reversing a 2009 finding that climate pollution harms people and eliminating climate pollution limits on vehicles.
""We saw in 2016 to 2020 that Trump tried to kill climate action and tried to kill the Paris Agreement,"" Grant says.","The world is producing too much coal, oil and natural gas to meet the targets set 10 years ago under the Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to limit climate pollution and avoid the worst effects of global warming.

A new report, led by the nonprofit research group Stockholm Environment Institute, shows countries plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).

The 2025 Production Gap Report comes as countries are submitting their nationally determined contributions, ahead of the annual United Nations climate conference in November in Belém, Brazil. NDCs are meant to show the progress countries are making toward the Paris Agreement goals of dramatically reducing the human sources of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet.

The SEI report shows the 20 most polluting countries, including China, the U.S. and India, actually plan to produce even more fossil fuels than they did two years ago, when the report was last updated.

""In particular, the near-term gap has increased with projected 2030 production exceeding levels consistent with 1.5 degrees [Celsius] by more than 120%, up from 110% in 2023,"" Derik Broekhoff, senior scientist at SEI and report co-author, said on a call with reporters.

China is driving much of the increase, according to the report, because it now plans to reduce coal production more slowly through 2030 than it did in the 2023 Production Gap Report. ""And China, because it represents over half of total global coal production, drives a lot of those numbers,"" Broekhoff says. Among fossil fuels, coal is the dirtiest in terms of climate pollution.

""The reality is stark,"" says Melanie Robinson, global climate director at the World Resources Institute. During a recent presentation, she said countries reviewed their progress at the 2023 UN climate meeting in Dubai and found they need to move away from fossil fuels, triple renewables, double energy efficiency, end deforestation and cut transportation pollution. ""And this wasn't a wish list — it's a to-do list. Countries pledged to it in Dubai, so now it is time to deliver,"" she says.

This report doesn't take into account Trump administration policies that are aimed at boosting U.S. fossil fuel production and limiting cleaner sources of electricity, such as wind and solar. It's based on data collected when President Biden was in office.

While Trump's flurry of executive orders and regulation changes are altering the country's climate and energy policies, those changes won't happen quickly. There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.

""The level of impact that the Trump administration is able to have on global climate is still an open question,"" says Neil Grant, analyst at Climate Analytics and co-author of the report.

Trump has already started the process to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, something he did during his first term in office. His administration has proposed a series of policy changes, including repealing climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants, reversing a 2009 finding that climate pollution harms people and eliminating climate pollution limits on vehicles.

The top U.S. environmental regulator has touted the administration's efforts to roll back plans to address climate change.

""We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more,"" Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency said in March, when he announced rollbacks.

Grant says Trump's effect on the world's climate efforts will depend on whether other countries choose to follow the President's lead.

""We saw in 2016 to 2020 that Trump tried to kill climate action and tried to kill the Paris Agreement,"" Grant says. ""He hasn't succeeded. I'm confident that he won't succeed again.""

And for now, most countries are sticking with their commitments to reach the goals in the Paris Agreement, even if this report shows they're not on track to do that. The authors of this report say achieving that now will require an even steeper decline in fossil fuel production and use in the future.

The deployment will see the company secure Fuso eCanter trucks and Mercedes-Benz eSprinter vans that will operate across metropolitan areas, beginning with Adelaide before expanding to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.

Peter Langley, FedEx Australasia Regional Vice-President, confirmed that the initial rollout will commence with 15 Fuso eCanter trucks in Adelaide, representing the first phase of a broader expansion plan.

“The introduction of these EVs to our pickup and delivery fleet in Australia marks a pivotal moment in our operations,” Langley said. The company plans to expand into additional regional and metropolitan areas as EV charging infrastructure is installed.

The EVs are expected to reduce carbon emissions by approximately 8.5 tonnes per vehicle annually, contributing to FedEx's global goal of achieving carbon-neutral operations by 2040.

This Australian deployment follows FedEx's successful introduction of EVs in New Zealand and aligns with the company's global strategy to electrify its entire parcel pickup and delivery fleet by 2040.

The move comes amid increasing EV adoption in Australia's logistics sector. In recent weeks, ANC Delivers added 111 electric vehicles to its fleet through a project co-funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).

Australia Post introduced 36 Mercedes-Benz electric vans in August, while Linfox announced plans to purchase 30 heavy-duty electric trucks in May.

Beyond vehicle electrification, FedEx is investing in aircraft modernisation, sustainable fuels, renewable energy, and efficient facilities to support its sustainability goals.

As EV charging infrastructure expands across Australia, FedEx plans to continue its electrification efforts in line with its global commitment of AU$2 billion (US$1.32 billion) initial investment in vehicle electrification, sustainable energy and carbon sequestration technologies.

Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) develops advanced fission power plants to deliver scalable clean energy and commercializes nuclear fuel recycling to convert waste into usable reactor fuel. During the September 9 episode, Cramer said that he does not think that the company’s stock is “done going higher,” as he remarked:

“Then viewers urged me to focus on nuclear power. When I looked up over, when I looked over the group, I found one that seemed like a serious spec, Oklo, which is building small form nuclear reactors. Given the high demand for electricity thanks to the data center buildout, which we heard just again tonight with Oracle, and the fact that Oklo’s a company with significant customer interest, I decided to suspend my critical judgment. And I told you that it might take only one positive headline for this stock to rock, and sure enough, a $33 stock gapped up when it was selected for a DoD contract. I don’t think it’s done going higher.”

Disruption Potential and Market Positioning

E3's entry into the lithium market is not just incremental—it is disruptive. By 2026, the company aims to supply battery-grade lithium carbonate at a cost structure competitive with global leaders, while avoiding the logistical bottlenecks of importing materials from AsiaE3 Lithium - News Releases, [https://e3lithium.ca/newsroom/news-releases/e3-lithium-provides-update-on-the-clearwater-project-and-2025-demonstration-plant-development-plans/][ 1 ]. This is critical for North American automakers, who face rising costs and supply chain fragility due to reliance on foreign lithium.

Moreover, E3's focus on ethical sourcing and environmental sustainability aligns with the values of major EV manufacturers.

E3's ability to produce lithium with a low carbon footprint and minimal water usage could make it a preferred supplier in a market where ESG compliance is becoming a competitive differentiator.

Conclusion: A High-Conviction Investment

E3 Lithium's strategic advancements—from DLE technology to regulatory progress—position it as a key enabler of North American EV manufacturing. Its phased production plan, coupled with partnerships and cost advantages, creates a compelling value proposition for investors. As the continent races to build a self-sufficient battery supply chain, E3's ability to deliver high-purity lithium carbonate at scale could not only disrupt the market but also redefine the economics of EV production.

For those seeking exposure to the energy transition, E3 Lithium represents a rare combination of technical innovation, strategic foresight, and geopolitical alignment. The question is no longer if North America needs a domestic lithium supplier—it's how quickly E3 can scale to meet the demand.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd380f2c538001.png,N,,2025-09-22 05:58:45.310040

Australian Public Policy Institute

There’s so much about this Institute that I have admired since its establishment under the leadership of my friend Dr Patricia Azarias.

In those early says of the James Martin Institute, the decision of the then-government of NSW to find a role for this institution really did set this organisation up to make that contribution.

There is enormous value in your online publications, research reports and podcasts.

But what impresses me most is the way this Institute is building a reliable pipeline of timely expertise that feeds directly into the policy process.

The Policy Challenge Grants are spectacular. They are mission-led, collaborative and directly geared to solving real-world problems that matter right now.

The findings from those projects are all the more impactful thanks to your partnerships with the university sector, the NSW Government and more recently the Australian Public Service Commission.

To the extent that I studied public policy, there was this dry language used to describe policy activism – I think the phrase ‘policy entrepreneurship’ sticks in my head as a particularly banal, individualistic conception of how policymaking works.

I really do like how Peter described tripartism. Tripartism – or this radical concept, pluralism – means the role of institutions working together in a credible way in the national interest.

That really does underline the way that the Albanese government thinks about public policymaking.

It’s a partnership with our institutions and business community. The university sector and the research sector more broadly. Our trade unions. Civil society. All working with government to solve national problems.

Think of how influential Australia’s leading economists were in the 1950s and 1960s as Australia mobilised its industrial and human resources after the second world war.

And in the 1980s, when economic expertise helped drive the modernisation of Australian industry and the internationalisation of the wider economy.

Social scientists across many disciplines have co-created a positive, distinctly Australian approach to anti-discrimination and equal opportunity for women, migrants and the First Australians.

Health economists helped design Australia’s public health insurance system.

Australia’s epidemiologists and visionary public servants, political advisers and ministers spearheaded Australian responses to the HIV-AIDS crisis in the 1980s and 1990s – and that set us up well for Australia’s COVID pandemic response.

Active collaboration between researchers and policymakers has done so much good for the health and living standards of Australians over the years.

Australia’s climate journey

Of course, there is one policy area where Australia’s world-leading researchers have, at times, been disrespected and ignored for ideological and opportunistic reasons, and at great cost to Australia.

I’m speaking, of course, about climate and energy policy, and its implications for industry policy.

Fifty years ago, researchers began referring to ‘global warming’ in scientific journals to describe the effect of carbon emissions on earth’s atmosphere.

And for 40 years at least, policymakers have been deliberating in national and international fora in search of substantial, practical responses.

Australia has everything at stake here.

A failure to lead on the global response would exacerbate all of the agricultural, industrial, public health, strategic and other risks set out in the National Climate Risk Assessment, released last week.

The Treasury modelling, and common sense, ably demonstrate the consequence of policy paralysis or inadequate, stop-start approaches to energy and industrial policy.

And more than any other place on earth, we have most to gain from a low-carbon global economy thanks to our vast solar and wind resources, mineral wealth, proximity to growing markets and strategic partnerships.

As a highly carbon-intensive and trade-oriented economy, Australia was always going to find decarbonisation to be a big challenge.

Early on, Australian governments respected the scientists who were diagnosing the problem as well as the economists and social scientists who were proposing practicable, pragmatic solutions in Australia’s national interest.

The Keating Government put Australia’s signature to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change – showing that Australia was serious about its role in reducing global carbon emissions.

The Howard Government – rarely progressive but usually pragmatic – legislated Australia’s first mandatory renewable energy target and developed plans for an emissions trading scheme.

The Rudd and Gillard Labor Governments moved heaven and earth to find a way through the political quagmire in which good climate and energy policy got stuck after 2009, when an unholy alliance of Coalition and Greens senators scuttled Labor’s emissions trading scheme.

None of those governments got everything right.

But nobody doubted their policy seriousness, their commitment to answering big problems with practical solutions, and their respect for the expert advice of scientists, researchers, the academy and the public service.

As a result, Australia has a range of tools at its disposal - renewable energy and emissions reduction targets, special investment vehicles for clean energy finance and industrial decarbonisation, and strong global partnerships – to draw on in the mission to avoid dangerous levels of warming.

The wasted decade

Of course, Australians know that the strategic leadership and evidence-based approach adopted by earlier governments was not sustained during the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison years.

The Coalition spent nine years in government engaged in an internal contest over climate and energy policy.

The result of those years and that paralysis was 22 discarded climate and energy policies and enormous investment uncertainty.

It seems obvious, but policy stability really matters for attracting the investment to drive big missions like industrial decarbonisation, research and development in energy efficiency and boosting the contribution of renewable energy resources to the Australian grid.

And for the regional Australian communities whose jobs are concentrated in heavy industries, policy stability matters too.

Instead, what we saw was policy chaos leading to corporate underinvestment in new and emerging technologies, including energy generation and infrastructure and new production processes, and in fact disinvestment in nation-building energy projects.

At the same time, Australia became a leading global exporter of LNG and, regrettably, an importer of the world’s volatile and high gas prices.

Taken together, unaffordable energy and domestic underinvestment, along with overcapacity in other markets and disruptions in global trade, have left Australia’s industrial sector in a precarious position.

Industry policy that works

In the face of growing economic and strategic competition, Australia must strengthen its existing industrial infrastructure, not abandon it.

That’s why the Albanese Labor Government has undertaken major and transformational industry policy with the Future Made in Australia agenda, encouraging investment and creating opportunity for Australian firms, workers and regional communities, so that they can share in the benefits of the shift to a low carbon economy.

This is a modern industrial policy framework. It doesn’t start with the premise that traditionally informed industry policy, which was focused upon the economic and social benefit of investment in industrial capability. But it starts, as the Future Made in Australia Act does, with what the national objectives and imperatives are.

For the Future Made in Australia, the two national interest framework principles are, firstly, founded in economic resilience and a security and strategic rationale, and secondly, in establishing Australia’s future competitive and comparative advantages in our mineral resources and low cost future energy capability.

The economic and social outcomes, which will be felt mostly in our outer suburbs and our industrial regions – again, I think of the sterile language of the economists here – as spillover benefits.

That is modern industrial policy – focused on the national interest.

Turning challenge into opportunity for revitalised industries, greater economic complexity, national resilience and good jobs

That’s what modern industrial policy can deliver when it really works.

Let me set out just one industrial and resource opportunity: the iron and steel sector.

Australia should use its vast iron ore resources and renewable energy to manufacture iron here and export value-added iron and steel products to our partners around the world, decarbonising iron and steel industrial processes for our steelmaking partners, and protecting our iron ore exporters from replacement as our customers invest in other mining regions.

The Albanese government is investing $1 billion through the Green Iron Investment Fund to support early movers to establish in Australia.

We’re backing battery manufacturing through the Battery Breakthrough Initiative.

And delivering a long-term capability in aluminium production using renewable energy through the Green Aluminium Production Credit.

In terms of the iron possibilities for Australia, the proposition that we might remove for our steelmaking partners the most emissions-intensive step in global steelmaking (which contributes about 8 per cent to global emissions) and onshore that capability here and protect the future of our iron ore sector – so reducing emissions, protecting the future of our iron ore sector, delivering good jobs, improving Australia’s economic complexity and having a big impact on productivity – that is a nation-building

objective worth fighting for.

That’s what this industrial policy framework is directed towards.

The Albanese Government routinely draws on Australia’s own scientific, economic and strategic expertise – at the CSIRO, at our university campuses, and in this sector, at the Heavy Industry Low-carbon Transition Cooperative Research Centre, and in the private sector – to make sure Australia can become a low-carbon powerhouse for the region and the world.

Change on this scale requires a clear vision for the future, courage, and a willingness take decisions in the present that make that future reachable.

This is not without its challenges. Australia’s old and unreliable coal-power stations and unaffordable gas is putting significant pressure on Australia’s industrial facilities.

For some sectors, abatement technology does not exist or is too expensive.

The Industry Sector Plan that I released with Minister Chris Bowen last week acknowledges these challenges in an honest and forthright way, and lays out a credible path for how industry can invest in new capital to reduce emissions and become more internationally competitive.

The Commonwealth and the states need to build the modern renewable energy grid faster and address the energy market pressures that could stand in the way of a Future Made in Australia.

The work of my colleagues, Minister Bowen and Minister Madeline King, on the Gas Market Review and the National Electricity Market wholesale market settings review, is particularly important.

As is the work of Minister Murray Watt in reforming environmental approvals that will expedite renewable generation and transmission projects, while protecting Australia’s environment.

The new $5 billion Net Zero Fund within the National Reconstruction Fund, announced last week, will be another tool to support Australian heavy industry to increase energy efficiency, become more productive and to decarbonise, as well as encouraging the scale-up of low emissions technology manufacturing.

I look forward to opening consultation on the Fund in a matter of days.

I’m determined to make it work for industry to meet the kind of objectives that I set out a few minutes ago, in heavy industry terms, in new technology terms, and making a real contribution to Australia’s future economic complexity.

Conclusion

In aggregate, these initiatives offer a purposeful agenda for lower emissions, more dynamic and productive industries and a more economically resilient Australia.

This is the core business of government – making choices in the present that enable a better, stronger, fairer and more resilient Australian society.

That’s hard work, and it depends on a huge range of skills and talents, wisdom and expertise, to make it happen.

I am absolutely optimistic – this is an optimistic government – that if Australia’s collective talents are mobilised – and that has to include the talents of our university sector, researchers and policy experts – then Australia will meet the industrial challenge successfully.

​“I am not seeing our leaders think beyond the immediate.” Rhode Island has traditionally been a leader in energy-efficiency programming.

Now, Rhode Island Energy is proposing rollbacks of its own, saying that its latest plan prioritizes customer affordability.
Advocates, therefore, argue that Rhode Island Energy’s plan to shrink energy-efficiency spending won’t actually result in more affordable power in the long run.","Funding for Rhode Island’s energy-efficiency programs could be cut by more than $42 million next year in an effort to rein in residents’ soaring power bills. That rollback would deprive the state of more than $90 million in benefits and potentially eliminate hundreds of jobs while creating only modest up-front savings, a new analysis finds.

Rhode Island Energy, the utility that administers the state’s energy-efficiency offerings, has proposed to slash spending on that front by 18% compared to last year and more than 30% compared to the budget originally projected in the nonbinding three-year plan introduced in 2023. If approved, the cuts will save the average household $1.87 per month, according to Rhode Island Energy.

The result of these changes, according to climate action nonprofit Acadia Center, would be more expensive electricity and more exposure to volatile natural gas prices in the long run.

“Energy efficiency is a tool for suppressing supply costs, for suppressing infrastructure costs in the long-term,” said Emily Koo, Acadia Center’s program director for Rhode Island and one of the authors of the group’s analysis. ​“I am not seeing our leaders think beyond the immediate.”

Rhode Island has traditionally been a leader in energy-efficiency programming. Over the past 15 years, the state has repeatedly placed among the top 10 states in the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy’s annual energy-efficiency scorecard. Since 2009, the state has spent more than $2 billion on efficiency incentives and services, yielding more than $6 billion in environmental and social benefits.

Now, however, the dynamics of energy markets are creating new obstacles. Nationwide, electricity costs have gone up at twice the rate of inflation over the past year, and gas prices have increased by more than four times the inflation rate. Rhode Island, like other New England states, has the added difficulty of already having some of the highest electricity rates in the country. Add in cold Northeastern winters, and the state is girding for an expensive season ahead.

As in neighboring states, regulators, elected officials, and utilities in Rhode Island are scrambling for ways to provide some relief for residents and businesses. These efforts have increasingly looked to the bill fees that fund renewable energy incentives and energy-efficiency programs as possible targets for quick, if small, bill reductions. In Maine, for example, leaders from both sides of the aisle have sought to lower incentives for customers and community solar developments that send power back to the grid, and in Massachusetts, utility regulators ordered energy-efficiency administrators to cut $500 million from a planned $5 billion three-year budget.

Now, Rhode Island Energy is proposing rollbacks of its own, saying that its latest plan prioritizes customer affordability. The company has the support of the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, which points to the growth in accounts with overdue utility bills to bolster its argument that the changes will provide needed relief to consumers.

“There is simply a financial limit as to how much cost the ratepayers can bear,” the department wrote in its public comments on the proposal.

Advocates, however, say the approach is short-sighted.

“This is weaker. It’s a retreat,” said Larry Chretien, executive director of the nonprofit Green Energy Consumers Alliance, which opposes the proposed cuts. ​“It just feeds into the narrative — that we don’t accept — that ratepayers aren’t seeing benefits from energy efficiency.”

Rhode Island’s energy-efficiency offerings include home energy assessments, weatherization services, rebates on energy-saving appliances and heating and cooling systems, and contractor training. Residents and businesses that take advantage of these programs generally save money by reducing their energy use.

The programs also create savings for the average consumer, whether or not they participate. Because the improvements slow energy consumption, they allow utilities to build less pricey infrastructure, the cost of which is passed on to customers. Efficiency measures can also lower peak demand, reducing the need to buy costlier, dirtier power from peaker plants. In Rhode Island, efficiency programs lowered electricity use 5% between 2005 and 2024; without these interventions, use would have increased 15%, according to an annual state report.

Advocates, therefore, argue that Rhode Island Energy’s plan to shrink energy-efficiency spending won’t actually result in more affordable power in the long run.

“You spend money on energy efficiency or you’re going to spend even more money on power supply,” said Forest Bradley-Wright, state and utility director for the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.

Acadia Center’s analysis also finds that more than 800 jobs in the energy-efficiency sector could be at risk if the cuts are adopted.

The draft plan has been through multiple iterations; the most recent version was released on Sept. 5. The state energy-efficiency council is expected to vote on the proposal at its Sept. 25 meeting. The plan will then go to utility regulators for final approval.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2212482104.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=0a863a9da97f5262d36eadbc29f9d0e7,N,,2025-09-22 03:58:56.449398

Emily Ghosh, a programme director at the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) in the US, said: “Fossil fuel production should have peaked and started to fall.
Eleven of the 20 countries surveyed have increased their plans for fossil fuel production since they were last analysed in 2023.
“We are in the foothills of an energy transition that is going to reshape fossil fuel demand,” said Grant.","Governments around the world are ramping up coal, gas and oil extraction which will put climate goals beyond reach, new data has shown.

Far from reducing reliance on fossil fuels, nations are planning higher levels of fossil fuel production for the coming decades than they did in 2023, the last time comparable data was compiled.

This increase goes against the commitments that countries have made at UN climate summits to “transition away from fossil fuels” and phase down production, particularly of coal.

If all of the planned new extraction takes place, the world will produce more than double the quantity of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with holding global temperature rises to 1.5C above preindustrial levels.

Emily Ghosh, a programme director at the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) in the US, said: “Fossil fuel production should have peaked and started to fall. Every year of delay [to the peak and rapid fall required] significantly increases the pressure [on the climate].”

She said an urgent “course correction” from governments was needed, but the current and planned overproduction of fossil fuels meant the world was burning through its remaining “carbon budget” – the amount that can be emitted without permanently exceeding the 1.5C threshold – at a rapid rate.

The Production Gap 2025 report, from the SEI, the Climate Analytics thinktank and the International Institute for Sustainable Development, analysed 20 major producers of fossil fuels around the world, including the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia, China, Canada, Brazil, Australia and the UK, together representing about 80% of global fossil fuel production.

Only the UK, Australia and Norway plan to reduce production of oil and gas by 2030, compared with 2023 levels. Eleven of the 20 countries surveyed have increased their plans for fossil fuel production since they were last analysed in 2023.

Several countries are planning at least to cut coal production, including China, the US, Germany and Indonesia. But India, Russia, Colombia and Australia will ramp up their mining.

Demand for fossil fuels is also key – countries must pursue renewable energy and use energy more efficiently to obviate the need for new oil, gas and coal production. Neil Grant, of Climate Analytics, said: “So far, renewable energy growth has been an addition, alongside fossil fuel demand, and we haven’t seen peak demand. But given the pace of change in the energy system that could change quite significantly.”

As transport, heating and other functions become electrified, less primary energy is needed, as electrification is much more efficient. But less demand for fossil fuels could also make them cheaper, spurring a rebound effect.

“We are in the foothills of an energy transition that is going to reshape fossil fuel demand,” said Grant. “But many governments are thinking in terms of a world where the energy transition happens very incrementally. There’s a lot of danger, [including that] the voice of the fossil fuel lobby only gets louder and holds us back from this change to a cleaner, better, greener economy. That would lead to climate chaos or significant negative economic impacts.”

All countries agreed at the Cop26 UN climate meeting in 2021 to “phase down” coal. The original commitment was to “phase out”, though without a timeline, but a last-minute intervention by China and India resulted in the weaker language being accepted.

At the Cop28 summit in Dubai in 2023, countries agreed to “transition away from fossil fuels”, though without specifying what this would mean in practice.

Derik Broekhoff, the lead author of the report published on Monday, said: “In 2023, governments formally acknowledged the need to move away from fossil fuels to mitigate climate change. But as our report makes clear, while many countries have committed to a clean energy transition, many others appear to be stuck using a fossil-fuel-dependent playbook, planning even more production than they were two years ago.”

The Production Gap 2025 report comes as world leaders prepare to meet the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, in New York this week on the sidelines of the UN general assembly.

Guterres will urge countries to come up with fresh commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ahead of the Cop30 summit in Brazil this November. Under the 2015 Paris agreement, governments must submit new national plans this year setting out their plans to 2035.

But the UN’s climate chief, Simon Stiell, has already told the Guardian that the national plans would be inadequate to keep the world within the 1.5C limit. Instead, the UN is hoping that countries will agree ways to strengthen their commitments in future and to bring other forces, such as private sector investment, to bear.

On Monday, a separate report from the Industrial Transition Accelerator estimated that of more than 700 low-carbon industrial installations in planning and development around the world, only 15 a year were gaining the finance necessary to go into full production. This represented a $1.6tn (£1.2tn) opportunity for investors, the group said.

“To keep the 1.5C goal in reach, the world needs rapid reductions in coal, oil and gas investments, redirecting those resources towards an energy transition that prioritises equity and justice,” said Ghosh. “Governments must commit to expand renewables, phase out fossil fuels, manage energy demands and implement community-centred energy transitions.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0520a9a0c8854327786deba4c661621fa617df8/707_0_7108_5686/master/7108.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=912c0142c0789f188d5bcb66da890cfe",N,,2025-09-22 03:59:00.779398

As a key raw material for lithium-ion batteries, lithium prices are closely tied to the dynamics of the EV industry. In 2022, battery-grade lithium carbonate prices in China hit a record high due to expectations of explosive demand, but subsequently experienced a sharp correction. Although prices recently saw a short-lived rebound driven by supply concerns from Chinese mines, the overall market remains oversupplied.

However, amid widespread pessimism toward the lithium sector, contrarian investing thinking reminds us that the most profound opportunities often emerge during the coldest winters. Investing in lithium stocks is not based on short-term price movements but on a deep understanding of several core logics.

First, the underlying trend of energy transition is irreversible. The carbon neutrality goals set by major global economies are not short-term policies but represent a fundamental transformation of the energy structure over the coming decades. Despite short-term challenges such as slowing growth in the EV industry and insufficient charging infrastructure, the long-term shift from internal combustion engine vehicles to EVs remains unchanged. The current industry downturn will likely weed out weaker players, paving the way for healthier future development.

At the same time, supply-side consolidation is inevitable. Current low prices are putting significant pressure on high-cost producers and will continue to do so. When prices remain below cash costs for an extended period, mines will be forced to halt production, undergo maintenance, or shut down, while financing and construction of new projects will face delays. This process will effectively reduce supply, creating conditions for the next rebalancing of supply and demand. Investing in industry leaders with low costs and strong financials during this period is akin to being greedy when others are fearful.

Based on this analysis, the following lithium stocks and ETFs are worth watching:

1. Industry Leader: Albemarle (ALB)

As one of the world’s largest lithium producers, Albemarle strengthens its industry position with a global presence across six continents and a vertically integrated business model (covering mining, refining, and purification). Long-term contracts effectively hedge against lithium price volatility, while its bromine and catalyst businesses provide diversified revenue streams. Recently, the company has accelerated its strategic moves: two lithium processing capacity expansion projects are in their final stages, and it has announced a new lithium conversion facility in the southeastern U.S. with an annual capacity of 100,000 tons (expected to be operational by the end of 2029).

2. Automaker-Backed Strategy: Livent (LTHM)

Livent, with its core expertise in battery-grade lithium hydroxide, has secured a six-year supply agreement with General Motors (GM) starting in 2025 and plans to relocate all its downstream production lines to North America. A €285 million lithium supply agreement with the BMW Group further solidifies its demand outlook. To meet surging demand, the company is tripling its lithium carbonate capacity in Argentina and expanding lithium hydroxide production across multiple global locations. Capacity expansion and long-term contracts form a solid foundation for growth.

3. Technology Innovator: Standard Lithium (SLI)

The company leverages its 150,000-acre Smackover project in Arkansas and the Bristol Lake project in California, adopting revolutionary LiSTR Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) technology to significantly improve recovery rates and reduce environmental impact. Its partnership with Norwegian energy giant Equinor provides financial security, while recent collaboration with Telescope Innovations on carbon reduction technology promotes greener production processes.

4. Resource Giant: Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (SQM)

With its resources in the Atacama Salt Flat, SQM remains the world’s largest lithium producer. The company plans to increase its production capacity to 230,000 tons by 2025, including a $490 million investment to build the world’s largest lithium refinery. Recent lithium hydroxide supply agreements with Hyundai-Kia and a joint venture with Chile’s state-owned copper producer Codelco (extending through 2060) highlight its strategic positioning.

As the knowledge partner for the ICC Global Business Summit 2025, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) contributed to the Green Tech & Energy Forum, emphasizing the critical link between India’s clean energy goals and its workforce.

The forum’s opening address by Mr Anil Razdan, former Secretary at the Ministry of Power, underscored the urgent need to mitigate global warming. He highlighted that this is the era of chemical engineers and innovators who must solve complex challenges and stressed the need for global collaboration to train both current and future generations in emerging technologies.

Mr AK Saxena, Senior Director at TERI, reinforced this message by pointing to the “twin drivers” of demand-pull and knowledge-push in technology development. He stressed the importance of aligning India’s human capital with its clean energy ambitions.

In this context, TERI has released a knowledge paper, “Emerging Energy Technologies and Workforce Transformation in India.” The paper outlines key technology trends, market trajectories, and skill gaps, proposing a strategic roadmap to align the nation’s workforce with its clean energy future.

Context

India’s transition to a clean, resilient economy by 2047 depends not just on technology but on a skilled workforce. Rapid advancements in sectors like green hydrogen, semiconductors, and AI are facing a significant constraint: a talent shortage that could slow down progress.

Technology and Market Landscape

Green Hydrogen: India targets 5 MMT per annum by 2030, backed by ₹19,744 crore under the National Green Hydrogen Mission. Electrolyser manufacturing is scaling, with tenders breaking the ₹50/kg green ammonia barrier. The challenge is cost competitiveness and creating skilled talent for stack engineering, hydrogen safety, and compression-logistics.

Waste-to-Energy: Installed capacity has nearly doubled since 2020, but at ~855 MW remains only 15 per cent of potential. Projects are challenged by poor waste segregation, public acceptance, and shortage of plant-ready operators. Policy reforms, PPPs, and better training can unlock urban waste’s 5,690 MW energy potential.

Semiconductors: The $10 billion India Semiconductor Mission has attracted multiple fab and ATMP proposals. Micron’s $2.75 billion facility is a milestone, but fewer than 200 professionals in India have fab experience, making workforce development urgent.

AI & Data Centres: Data centre capacity is projected to grow 6–7× by 2030, with $14 billion in committed investment. AI adoption can cut renewable forecasting errors by 20–30 per cent, but a shortage of grid-AI engineers, MLOps specialists, and critical-environment technicians is a significant risk.

Skill Gap and Workforce Imperatives

Current workforce readiness is inadequate: over 65 % of new clean-energy roles require re-skilling, yet formal vocational training reaches only 4 % of India’s labour force. Semiconductor fabs, hydrogen hubs, and AI-driven grid projects face project delays if talent gaps persist. Key roles identified include electrolyser stack engineers, CBG process operators, cleanroom technicians, and grid-AI engineers. Demand for many of these roles is projected to more than double by 2030, underscoring the need for immediate action on curricula, apprenticeships, and certification pathways.

Strategic Roadmap

The report recommends integrating human capital development into every mission and incentive programme. The roadmap proposes:

Integrated Planning: Workforce annexes specifying role counts and training targets for every major project.

Certification First: Nationally recognised, vendor-validated credentials to make skills portable and trusted.

Practice-Focused Training: Labs, simulators, and plant residencies to shorten time from training to deployment.

Demand Aggregation: Industry clusters to publish 3–5-year hiring forecasts to guide academic capacity planning.

Enablers and Outcomes

Four system-level enablers are critical:

Workforce mandates embedded in tenders

Outcome-linked funding tied to placement rates

A national skills dashboard for real-time visibility

Faculty and trainer development through industry sabbaticals

If implemented, this strategy could deliver higher placement rates, higher productivity across assets, and an exportable pool of skilled professionals, turning India’s demographic dividend into a competitive advantage in the global clean energy economy.

Regional Africa: US$75 million to support cocoa trade finance in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, improving traceability and boosting farmer livelihoods.

Strengthening the OPEC Fund’s financial base

The successful €500 million Euro benchmark bond marks a milestone in the OPEC Fund’s funding strategy, broadening its investor base and reinforcing its position as a credible and innovative development finance institution.

The proceeds of the bond will be used to finance and refinance projects aligned with the OPEC Fund’s development mandate, with a strong focus on sustainability and long-term impact.

About the OPEC Fund

The OPEC Fund for International Development (the OPEC Fund) is the only globally mandated development institution that provides financing from member countries to non-member countries exclusively. The organization was established in 1976 with a distinct purpose: to drive development, strengthen communities and empower people in low- and middle-income countries around the world. Our work is people-centered, focusing on financing projects that meet essential needs, such as food, energy, infrastructure, employment (particularly relating to MSMEs), clean water and sanitation, healthcare and education. To date, the OPEC Fund has committed more than US$30 billion to development projects in over 125 countries with an estimated total project cost of more than US$200 billion. The OPEC Fund is rated AA+/Outlook Stable by Fitch and S&P Global Ratings. Our vision is a world where sustainable development is a reality for all.

There are many more examples of state action across the country and across political perspectives.
For several decades, Congress has been gridlocked on environmental health protections, while lobbying and lawsuits have halted most regulatory actions.
RFK Jr. talks a good game about “making America healthy again.” But governors and state legislators are actually getting it done.
She is the author of the forthcoming book A Healthy Union: How States Can Lead on Environmental Health.","Some of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s plans to improve the nation’s health are based on solid evidence. His observation about children’s increased rates of chronic disease is correct, as are some of the likely contributors he points to, such as pesticides and microplastics.

However, the Health and Human Services secretary appears unable or unwilling to implement plans to address that issue. While he previously criticized the country’s “chemical-industrial agriculture” model, RFK Jr. has not proposed actions to reduce pesticides in food. In fact, he recently gave assurances to industry representatives that backpedaled on his past statements. And the Environmental Protection Agency, which has the primary authority to reduce pesticide use, has been approving new pesticides and aiming to bring back others that had been banned or restricted, like dicamba.

But policymakers at the state level aren’t waiting for federal action. Across a wide political spectrum, lawmakers — shored up by concerned parents — are making significant progress.

The National Caucus of Environmental Legislators reports, for example, that so far in 2025 lawmakers in 37 states — from Alabama to Iowa to New Jersey — have proposed legislation aimed at reducing perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. Added to items from cookware to firefighting foam and known as “forever chemicals” due to their persistence in the environment, PFAS are linked with a range of serious health problems.

There are many more examples of state action across the country and across political perspectives. Arkansas, for instance, now requires warning labels on hair relaxer products that contain certain toxic chemicals.

This action at the state level is not new. For several decades, Congress has been gridlocked on environmental health protections, while lobbying and lawsuits have halted most regulatory actions. To fill these gaps, some statehouses have taken up the slack — and this pattern is growing.

State-led efforts have appeal across the political spectrum. For those who dislike federal intrusion into local matters, this movement prioritizes the preferences of states’ residents. For those troubled by the inadequacy of federal protections, state action offers an alternate route to protecting communities from pollution and toxic chemicals.

States that are starting to take steps in this direction can learn from successful policies elsewhere. When it comes to protecting children from pesticides, Texas was already in the lead, with a farsighted law that requires every school district to implement policies and practices to reduce pesticide use. It girds this mandate with extensive education, technical assistance and enforcement.

Massachusetts’ Toxics Use Reduction Act requires industrial facilities that manufacture, process or otherwise use certain toxic chemicals to report their use and develop strategies to reduce harm. As with Texas’ pesticide law, a partnership among state agencies, a university and industry ensures that the latest know-how is developed and applied.

State efforts to protect their residents’ health are by no means limited to regulating harmful chemicals. In Tennessee, representatives of 24 state agencies, departments and commissions that impact health — from environment, conservation and agriculture to education and human services — meet regularly to get to know each other’s work and identify opportunities for collaboration.

A leading example of what is known as “health in all policies,“ Tennessee’s effort breaks down silos that are often found in government. Cross-departmental collaboration aims to coordinate services for food, housing and transit. Transportation staff work with health officials, so opportunities for safe walking and bicycling are included in road planning.

Regional efforts are on the rise too. When a group of states that share climate and culture join forces, they can accomplish more than they can singly. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative of northeastern and mid-Atlantic states has successfully reduced warming emissions through a structure in which participants share resources, achieving greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness. And the Southeast Regional Partnership for Planning and Sustainability brings together environmental and military officials from six states to sustain both natural resources and national defense assets in the region. The program has leveraged private funding to protect and restore more than 1.3 million acres of land while preserving mission-critical infrastructure and capabilities.

Many of these best-practice policies have been evaluated, so information on outcomes and lessons learned is available. Common contributors to successful state initiatives include environmental health education and analyses that examine a broad range of costs and benefits of policies.

RFK Jr. talks a good game about “making America healthy again.” But governors and state legislators are actually getting it done.

BARCELONA (Reuters) -When Javier Hernandez went car shopping in Barcelona, he ended up choosing a plug-in hybrid by China’s BYD – swayed by a price nearly 10,000 euros cheaper than European rivals.

The 51-year-old Spanish excavator operator wanted something cheap and versatile for city drives and trips to the Catalan mountains, but had doubts about Chinese electrified cars as he didn’t know the brands well.

With government subsidies, the BYD Seal U DM-I Hernandez opted for starts at around 30,000 euros ($35,289) in Spain, compared to over 40,000 euros for VW’s Tiguan and Peugeot’s 3008 plug-in hybrid models.

“The value for money was better, I tried it out and they could give it to me right away,” he told Reuters.

CHEAPER CARS, MORE DEALERSHIPS

Cost-conscious buyers like Hernandez are fuelling rapid growth for Chinese EV carmakers like BYD in Spain and around Europe, stepping up competition with regional and U.S. rivals like Tesla, Stellantis and Volkswagen.

“Until the arrival of BYD, if you wanted to buy an electric vehicle, you had to spend a hell of a lot of money,” BYD country manager for Spain and Portugal Alberto De Aza told Reuters.

BYD’s Spanish dealership network has nearly quadrupled to almost 100 dealers from 25 last year, De Aza said, accompanied by aggressive marketing and discounts.

Meanwhile, most established car brands have closed dealerships. Data from Faconauto shows legacy brands had 1,648 dealerships in 2024, down from 2,164 a decade ago. Volkswagen and Audi dealerships fell 40% in that period.

“Chinese competitors are increasing the pressure, and not just on us,” Markus Haupt, interim CEO of Volkswagen-owned SEAT told Reuters last week.

CHINESE EV SURGE IN MARKET SHARE

BYD’s share of Spain’s EV market, including fully-electric models and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), climbed to more than 10% in Spain in July despite EU tariffs on Chinese-made EVs. That’s more than double its European average and three times Tesla’s 3.3%.

Its share of Spain’s total car market has risen to 1.8% through August from 0.3% last year, surpassing brands like Stellantis’ Jeep or Volvo, data by industry group ANFAC shows. The Seal U is Spain’s most popular plug-in hybrid so far this year.

Still, it trails behind top selling brands like Toyota, Renault and Volkswagen.

SPAIN: A GATEWAY FOR EXPANSION

Spain’s lack of a national automotive champion makes it fertile ground for Chinese expansion, analysts say.

“It doesn’t have a strong local carmaker,” said Felipe Munoz, analyst at JATO Dynamics, adding that SEAT had lost some of its Spanish identity having been bought by Germany’s VW and looked the most exposed.

SEAT’s sales are up 4% so far this year, underperforming the broader Spanish market which rose 15%, ANFAC data shows. SEAT’s sister brand, up-market Cupra slightly outperformed, with sales up 17%.

Sales of Chinese cars are growing faster. SAIC-owned MG was up 58%, while Chery’s Omoda more than doubled its sales in Spain year-on-year through August. BYD sales were up 675% through August to over 14,000 cars.

BYD EYES EUROPEAN PRODUCTION

With cutthroat competition in their domestic market, Chinese brands are increasingly targeting Europe.

BYD aims to produce all EVs for sale in Europe locally within three years and is building a plant in Hungary. Spain could be an ideal location for further expansion thanks to its industrial infrastructure and cheap electricity, said De Aza.

Still, challenges remain.

Combined battery-electric and plug-in hybrid sales in Spain made up 21% of total car sales in July versus 10% in August last year, but below the European average of 27%.

Insufficient charging infrastructure has caused slower-than-expected EV uptake in many European markets, especially in the south. Spain has some 50,000 charging points, a third of the number in the Netherlands despite a far larger population.

For now, Spanish motorists much prefer hybrids and PHEVs, which are central to BYD’s European expansion plans.

One of them is Juan Gonzalez, a 56-year-old head of an IT department who has solar panels that could charge any EV model, but bought a BYD plug-in hybrid because he worried about longer journeys.

“If you run out of battery and you have to tackle a mountain pass you’re really in trouble,” he said.

I got to lead the ceremony for these dead a few years ago; every year the numbers remind me not to feel sorry for myself, even in newly repressive America.","Your correspondent is…bushed, so excuse typos, lapses of thought, and imprecise prose. But I wanted to tell all of you about how Sun Day played out across the country today before I fell into bed. In a word, spectacular.

You know, from reading these missives, that this day has been in the works a long time; we needed, in the face of massive and bizarre attacks from the White House and Congress on sun and windpower, to stand up for the idea of cheap, clean energy. At nearly five hundred events across the country, that’s what happened. From one corner of the continent to the other (still waiting for pictures to come in from Alaska and Hawaii) Americans figured out dozens of ways to make their hopes for the future felt, even in this darkest of political periods. A remarkable account in the New York Times quoted one organizer, summing it up beautifully:

“I really wanted it to be celebratory and uplifting,” said Laura Iwanaga, who led the organization for Portland’s Sun Day event for the local chapter of Third Act, a nationwide climate advocacy organization founded by Mr. McKibben. “We all know what we’re fighting against but we don’t always think about what we’re fighting for.”

For me, the very first picture of the day came from my grandson, out to greet the rising sun.

Soon they were pouring in from events across the country. Many featured big crowds and important people: I was in New York, where people crammed into a downtown church to hear the city’s comptroller Brad Lander talk about deploying the city’s $300 billion pension fund to back clean energy

and then spilled out into a nearby park for speeches from a U.S. Senator (Peter Welch), the state’s remarkable lieutenant governor (Antonio Delgado), a state assemblywoman (Emily Gallagher), and the ever-present and ever-powerful Rev. Lennox Yearwood. Oh, and a unforgettable rendition of Here Comes the Sun from Sun Day musical ambassador Antonique Smith

Those were powerful memories that will last my life. But I was also taken by the pictures that showed quieter moments—for instance, people huddled in basements so that they could see their neighbor’s heat pumps or solar inverters, demystifying the whole process of converting to clean power. This is from South Carolina—and it’s how we’re going to turn people into solar consumers across the country.

And here are Wisconsites setting out on a solar tour of the state’s capital

Some of the images were spectacularly beautiful. Christal Brown choreographed a dance among the solar panels on the campus of Middlebury College.

And some were literally sweet—here’s someone making s’mores in a solar oven in San Leandro California

Everywhere the beauty of the logo (thanks Brian Collins, Beth Johnson, Eron Lutterman) was on display. (Oh, and read the account of its design from Fast Company)

So many people and organizations helped make the day happen: Fossil Free Media, of course, with Jamie Henn and Deirdre Shelly leading an amazing crew; Solar United Neighbors, the Sierra Club, Mothers Out Front, Climate Revival, Green Faith, Dayenu, a hundred more. My colleagues at Third Act were absolutely crucial: here’s Deborah Moore and Anna Goldstein, who worked around the clock

But everywhere there were kids out enjoying the spectacle. Our great hope is that they’ll grow up in a world where it seems utterly obvious to power the planet with clean energy from the sun, instead of filling the air (and their lungs) with the smoke from humanity’s fires.

For a day it was possible to believe in all of that—and the human energy that belief unleashes allows us to make it happen. Even as the afternoon went on I was hearing of plans to introduce balcony solar laws in half a dozen states (and of plans to take this day global in the years ahead). In some sense the work has just begun

I’ll have many more images and reports in the days ahead—we’ve barely begun to sift through all that’s been pouring in these last hours. But time for a well-earned rest (and I have an early morning trip to Chicago—the beat goes on!). As the sun goes down (and the batteries that have been soaking up sunshine all afternoon kick in) I just want to say: Thank you all so very very much

+Wildfire smoke in America is now killing 40,000 people a year, more than car crashes. As the Washington Post reports:

“Those are huge numbers,” said Minghao Qiu, assistant professor at Stony Brook University and lead author of the paper published Thursday in the journal Nature. “This is one of the most costly and important climate impacts in the U.S.”

Between 2006 and 2019, the average cumulative smoke exposure across the country each year hovered around 100 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic meter of air, according to a preprint paper by the same author group that has yet to undergo peer review. But since 2020, Americans have increasingly been bombarded by toxic smoke. In 2023, when a sickly orange glow filled the skies of New York City and other East Coast metropolises, Americans experienced levels eight times higher. The years 2020 through 2024 have been the most extreme smoke years on record.

+New York’s utility regulator has endorsed a new gas pipeline across the Empire State—the residue of a deal by governor Kathy Hochul with Donald Trump

“This is not how you stand up for New York ratepayers, let alone our children and grandchildren who will be saddled with the true cost of this folly,” said state Sen. Liz Krueger, a Democrat from Manhattan who opposes the project.

The pipeline would run under New York Harbor and connect to natural gas infrastructure that’s already in place off the coast of Queens.

A sardonic ad takes on the governor’s trademark weakness

+A big new campaign for public renewable power is underway across the country. Advocates argue that

Traditional for-profit models of renewable energy development are not moving fast enough.

By adding public renewable energy developers, states and cities can accelerate the transition, build projects that otherwise would not get built, cut costs for schools communities, and deploy resources at the scale needed to meet our climate goals.

An early project: a case study on how public power projects have made Connecticut the leader in school rooftop solar.

+Germany’s largest agrivoltaic project has come online. As Sandra Enkhardt reports:

For livestock farming, six mobile chicken coops, each housing up to 2,500 chickens, are planned. A conventional four-crop rotation is also foreseen for arable land. Vattenfall said the modules are mounted on a longitudinal axis and can tilt east-west from a horizontal position. Wider spacing between rows allows access for agricultural machinery.

+Tax credits for EVs are ending in America in ten days time, ten years ahead of schedule (thanks GOP Congress!). But automakers have a plan: much cheaper EV pickup trucks are coming soon, from a start up called Slate, and from Ford. As Kyle Stock explains,

A decade ago, someone in the market for a new car with less than $25,000 to spend, had 43 different models to choose from. Today, there are five, according to Cox Automotive. None is electric.

But stalwarts like Ford Motor Co. and startups like Slate Auto are looking to change that, and they’re focusing on Americans’ favorite vehicle: the pickup.

With President Donald Trump’s tax bill killing EV incentives at the end of the month, the push for a sub-$30,000 vehicle that runs on electrons may help buttress the projected dip in sales.

+Amidst the joy of today’s celebrations, a really sad note. Global Witness just released its annual report on the environmental defenders killed in the past year. I got to lead the ceremony for these dead a few years ago; every year the numbers remind me not to feel sorry for myself, even in newly repressive America. It could be worse.

Last year, 146 people were murdered or disappeared for doing this work.

We acknowledge that the names of many defenders who were killed or disappeared last year may be missing and we may never know how many more gave their lives to protect our planet. We honour their work too.

""The reality is stark,"" says Melanie Robinson, global climate director at the World Resources Institute.
There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.
His administration has proposed a series of policy changes, including repealing climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants, reversing a 2009 finding that climate pollution harms people and eliminating climate pollution limits on vehicles.
""We saw in 2016 to 2020 that Trump tried to kill climate action and tried to kill the Paris Agreement,"" Grant says.","The world is producing too much coal, oil and natural gas to meet the targets set 10 years ago under the Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to limit climate pollution and avoid the worst effects of global warming.

A new report, led by the nonprofit research group Stockholm Environment Institute, shows countries plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).

The 2025 Production Gap Report comes as countries are submitting their nationally determined contributions, ahead of the annual United Nations climate conference in November in Belém, Brazil. NDCs are meant to show the progress countries are making toward the Paris Agreement goals of dramatically reducing the human sources of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet.

The SEI report shows the 20 most polluting countries, including China, the U.S. and India, actually plan to produce even more fossil fuels than they did two years ago, when the report was last updated.

""In particular, the near-term gap has increased with projected 2030 production exceeding levels consistent with 1.5 degrees [Celsius] by more than 120%, up from 110% in 2023,"" Derik Broekhoff, senior scientist at SEI and report co-author, said on a call with reporters.

China is driving much of the increase, according to the report, because it now plans to reduce coal production more slowly through 2030 than it did in the 2023 Production Gap Report. ""And China, because it represents over half of total global coal production, drives a lot of those numbers,"" Broekhoff says. Among fossil fuels, coal is the dirtiest in terms of climate pollution.

""The reality is stark,"" says Melanie Robinson, global climate director at the World Resources Institute. During a recent presentation, she said countries reviewed their progress at the 2023 UN climate meeting in Dubai and found they need to move away from fossil fuels, triple renewables, double energy efficiency, end deforestation and cut transportation pollution. ""And this wasn't a wish list — it's a to-do list. Countries pledged to it in Dubai, so now it is time to deliver,"" she says.

This report doesn't take into account Trump administration policies that are aimed at boosting U.S. fossil fuel production and limiting cleaner sources of electricity, such as wind and solar. It's based on data collected when President Biden was in office.

While Trump's flurry of executive orders and regulation changes are altering the country's climate and energy policies, those changes won't happen quickly. There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.

""The level of impact that the Trump administration is able to have on global climate is still an open question,"" says Neil Grant, analyst at Climate Analytics and co-author of the report.

Trump has already started the process to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, something he did during his first term in office. His administration has proposed a series of policy changes, including repealing climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants, reversing a 2009 finding that climate pollution harms people and eliminating climate pollution limits on vehicles.

The top U.S. environmental regulator has touted the administration's efforts to roll back plans to address climate change.

""We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more,"" Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency said in March, when he announced rollbacks.

Grant says Trump's effect on the world's climate efforts will depend on whether other countries choose to follow the President's lead.

""We saw in 2016 to 2020 that Trump tried to kill climate action and tried to kill the Paris Agreement,"" Grant says. ""He hasn't succeeded. I'm confident that he won't succeed again.""

And for now, most countries are sticking with their commitments to reach the goals in the Paris Agreement, even if this report shows they're not on track to do that. The authors of this report say achieving that now will require an even steeper decline in fossil fuel production and use in the future.

Ben Hulac: The short answer, the technical answer is Republicans were looking for ways to pay for their broader tax breaks for corporations.
Remember, Congress is in charge of writing tax law and administrations carry out tax law.
But also, I should mention a commercial scale solar tax credit will be phased out next summer.
And that was also a Biden-era tax credit that was going to go for about a decade.","Homeowners in New Jersey and beyond are rushing to install solar panels on their rooftops in order to qualify for a federal tax credit that expires at the end of the year.

Congress zeroed out that tax credit, which covers 30% of a new residential solar project, as part of a broader Republican budget law.

The loss of that federal incentive is one several threats facing the domestic solar industry, as our correspondent in Washington, Ben Hulac, explains. This interview has been excerpted and lightly edited.

Briana Vannozzi, anchor: So, Ben, this tax credit was supposed to last until 2032. Why then did Congress decide to cut it nearly a decade short?

Ben Hulac: The short answer, the technical answer is Republicans were looking for ways to pay for their broader tax breaks for corporations. This was part, if we remember back to the summer, there was a lot of debate here on the Hill about how to pass and how to pay for this massive trillion dollar bill now law.

And this was an item that Republicans wanted. So they essentially went through lots of Biden-era tax breaks for renewables, for wind, for solar, and phased them out early in order to pay for their broader package.

BV: So I know you write, you report that demand has just gone through the roof. This really lit a fire under people. What does that looked like on the ground? I mean, how many people are actually calling and requesting quotes? And we should note this is, you know, really for residential homes.

BH: Right. So I talked with two people I mentioned Lyle Rawlings, who’s a business owner owns his own solar company. And he said salespeople are just swamped. And then I talked to a woman named Emily Walker, who works for a company called EnergySage. And EnergySage crunches data and numbers about solar demand. Their numbers show that just within New Jersey, from June to July, people requesting quotes for what it would cost to put solar on their homes, which skyrocketed 109%.

So that’s a huge jump. And that coincides with Congress debating this broader law. So the interest. And New Jersey is not an outlier in this. There is a race nationwide. If you are interested in putting solar on your home, you are pedal to the metal now.

BV: Yeah, 109% that’s significant. I mean, okay, if I’m a homeowner and I want to get this installed connected before the deadline, is that even possible? And what do I need to know then?

BH: Right. It is possible. You should probably do it now. And I actually talked with a solar advocate in Philadelphia, a woman named Elowyn Corby with a solar advocacy group called Vote Solar. And this is what she said.

Elowyn Corby: If you’re interested in going solar, you should start soon. The process of getting solar is much more than the, you know, two or three days it can take to put the actual solar on your roof. It includes permitting. It includes a number of logistical steps that I would recommend not rushing. You also want to make sure that you’re taking the time to make sure you’re working with a reputable installer, someone who you trust, someone who’s done a lot of work in the community. So start now because there can be more steps than, you know, starting five days before the deadline isn’t going to work out the way you hope it will.

BV: Yeah. And so, Ben, then what happens if someone is not connected in time for the deadline?

BH: If someone is not connected, then they are likely out this tax credit, which on average could defray about $9,000 worth of the cost. So it costs tens of thousands of dollars to install panels on your home. That’s a ballpark figure. Maybe about $30,000 is a good sort of rule of thumb. This $9,000 chunk of that money could be massive and could mean the difference between someone saying, yes, I’d like to take this plunge and go solar and try to maybe in theory, go off the grid and be my own little electrical island. Or going back and canceling those plans. So it’s a big deal.

BV: How does all of this play into the broader energy policy that we’re seeing from the White House and also some retroactive tariffs that could really impact the industry, as you note? How does this all play together?

BH: The tenor on science and on renewables out of this administration has been extremely aggressive and negative. The energy secretary actually recently assembled an anti-climate science report that purported to debunk well-established climate science that is of course, not true. Humans are warming the planet by burning fossil fuels oil, coal and gas. But this is this is sort of one tendril.

This solar, this anti-solar approach, this one tendril out of Congress, out of the Republican-led administration to slow efforts to clean up the power grid, to decarbonize the broader U.S. energy system. I would say it just it fits the pattern in a lot of ways and a lot of the money. Remember, Congress is in charge of writing tax law and administrations carry out tax law. But this cut that we’ve been talking about, Bri, is just one of many that this Congress has doled out so far.

BV: Yeah. And I wonder just about the long term impact here. What did some of the advocates say who you spoke with about how this affects the industry in the long term and maybe even some of these policies in the long term, you know, the appetite for it all?

BH: Right. It’s really put a damper on the appetite. There is a lot of frenetic energy in this moment to get people hooked up to the grid, to get people on solar before the year is out. But also, I should mention a commercial scale solar tax credit will be phased out next summer. And that was also a Biden-era tax credit that was going to go for about a decade.

Now, they’re nine years roughly short of that original target. And so people are scrambling on the commercial solar side as well. And then, of course, we haven’t really delved into this, but tariffs are another massive sort of ax hanging over this industry. The administration has floated retroactive tariffs, which would be extremely destabilizing for the industry and could go back two years and charge importers on what is already on U.S. shores. So there are a lot of serious landmines here for solar in the U.S.",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2025/09/solar-energy-panel-house-home-.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 02:59:46.607321

NJ utility bills spike, fueling voter backlash and concern

Author urges lawmakers to balance cost, reliability, environment

Natural gas remains critical to grid stability and demand, writer says

Calls for investment in modern energy infrastructure

Lawmakers are looking for answers in the face of recent increases to electric utility bills. With already high living costs, the public response to these increases has come in the form of a swift and justified backlash. And not surprisingly, this complex and multifaceted issue – which requires a balancing of cost, reliability and the environment – is center stage in the gubernatorial election.

The outcome of the most recent annual regional capacity market auction sent a clear message: demand is rising, supply is lagging, and the consequences are significant and impact everyone. And the time is now to reexamine the state’s energy policies to make certain they are consistent and keeping pace with the needs of the state and its residents.

Key to any honest energy discussion is the observation that demand for energy is going up. This requires more power from more sources and the avoidance of prematurely retiring energy sources – especially natural gas – without viable, scalable replacements.

It goes without debate that a robust, well-functioning and reliable power system is essential to the health, safety, and prosperity at both the state and federal levels. Accordingly, the state and region need the right combination of resources – power plants and energy efficiency as well as accompanying infrastructure – to ensure reliability, particularly when demand is most significant and pronounced during heat waves and cold snaps.

We must prioritize investment in transmission and delivery infrastructure. The best mix of energy sources is only as strong as the grid that carries it. That means removing unnecessary regulatory roadblocks, upgrading aging systems and building with the future in mind. Without a robust and flexible grid, even the most ambitious clean energy goals will fall short.

Right now, about 72% of New Jersey households rely on natural gas as their primary heating fuel and 17% use electricity for space heating. Additionally, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, almost half of the power consumed is derived from natural gas.

This isn’t about turning our backs on alternative energy sources, rather, it’s about complementing them. Natural gas isn’t the enemy of renewable power, it’s an ally. It provides crucial backup to intermittent resources. Natural gas plants can ramp up quickly to meet sudden spikes in demand, something renewables, for all their promise, cannot yet do consistently or reliably on their own. That flexibility is essential for managing cold snaps, heatwaves and periods of rapid economic growth.

This isn’t about turning our backs on alternative energy sources, rather, it’s about complementing them.

Having an approach that takes advantage of all energy sources doesn’t just help stabilize electric prices and strengthen reliability, it also supports thousands of good-paying union jobs, keeps our manufacturing sector competitive, and helps ensure that major employers like hospitals and tech firms don’t start looking elsewhere for more dependable energy solutions.

The next governor should promote a diverse and reliable energy mix and have policies that support carbon reduction through innovation and infrastructure, not through mandates that ignore economic and logistical realities. Leadership doesn’t mean pretending we can leap to a zero-carbon future overnight, rather it means creating a clear, achievable roadmap that protects our environment while also protecting ratepayers and preserving our economic competitiveness.

Energy policy doesn’t have to be a zero-sum game. We can support all types of energy sources including the vital role conventional fuels play in our current system. To do otherwise we risk failing on all three fronts: the environment, grid reliability, and price.",https://originnjbiz.wpenginepowered.com/files/2025/09/Electric-Bill-illustration.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 00:58:41.278712

It’s only been a few months since the Trump administration and lawmakers like Missouri Senator Josh Hawley succeeded in derailing the Grain Belt Express, a high-voltage transmission line that would have brought clean energy to much of the upper Midwest. It’s not clear whether the project will go forward, but it’s already clear that people will pay more for electricity as a result—and nowhere is that more clear than in Missouri.

The Grain Belt Express would have carried 5,000 megawatts of wind power from Kansas across Missouri and Illinois into Indiana. The 1,280-kilometre project, slated to cost $11 billion and scheduled to begin construction next year, has drawn fire from critics—whose opposition includes its use of eminent domain to cross private property—and has been the target of Republican opponents like Hawley for well over a decade.

After years of lawsuits, regulatory review, and political battles in the Show-Me State, Invenergy, the nation’s largest privately-held clean energy supplier, received state approval from Kansas and Missouri in 2019. It began acquiring access to land as similar work proceeded elsewhere along the route. In March, Andrew Bailey, who was until recently Missouri’s attorney general, urged Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency to cancel the loan. He called the Grain Belt Express a project by “far-left deep staters” dedicated to undermining farmers.

Bailey opened an investigation into the project in July, alleging that Invenergy had overstated its economic benefits, and called on the state Public Service Commission to reconsider its approval. President Trump, with Hawley’s encouragement, reportedly called Energy Secretary Chris Wright and told him to cancel a US$5 billion conditional loan the Department of Energy approved in November to underwrite construction. The agency did just that on July 23, a move Hawley called “a huge win” for Missouri.

However, it’s likely that Missourians will suffer if the line is not built: It was predicted to save state ratepayers almost $18 billion in utility bills in the coming years—though Bailey has called that figure an overstatement. Jesse Jenkins, of Princeton’s REPEAT Project, which analyzes how federal climate and energy policies impact emissions and energy systems, said it’s useful to think of Grain Belt Express as “roughly five nuclear reactors’ worth of low-cost energy.” Thirty-nine municipal utilities across Missouri—including several in the same rural communities Hawley claims would be harmed by the transmission line—have already signed up to tap that supply. If the line is not built, “all the customers in all these cities are going to see higher prices than they normally would have,” said Andy Knott of the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign.

Hawley’s offices in Washington, D.C. and Columbia, Missouri did not return emails and phone calls seeking comment.

This, on top of the local impacts of the recently-passed One Big Beautiful Bill spending package—which one study suggested will cause Missouri electricity bills to skyrocket more than any other state—could create a dire situation for those already struggling to make ends meet. Kera Mashek, of the United Way of Greater Kansas City, said more than 14,000 people have called the Kansas City area 211 line seeking utility assistance so far this year.

The One Big Beautiful Bill is expected to increase Missourians’ electricity bills $240 a year by 2030 and $800 a year by 2035, according to a study from Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy policy think tank. It also could hinder climate progress. Clean energy tax credits granted by the Biden administration and rescinded by the Trump administration likely would have incentivized power companies to bring cheaper energy sources online. Without the incentives, they’ll probably continue repairing aging coal-fired plant infrastructure indefinitely, said Megan Mahajan, a co-author of the study.

The idea that people’s bills are going to go up is “certainly concerning for us,” Mashek said. Given the looming cuts to Medicaid and federal assistance programs, particularly those that help low-income people pay energy bills, under Trump’s spending package, “We could be looking at a very dire situation for a lot of households that are suddenly just simply not going to be able to afford to keep their lights on,” Mashek said.

Invenergy accused Hawley of “trying to deprive Americans of billions of dollars in energy cost savings, thousands of jobs, and grid reliability.” It plans to proceed with construction of what it calls “the largest transmission infrastructure project in U.S. history” using private financing. It’s got plenty of backers, including Blackstone, the world’s biggest private equity firm.

“A privately financed Grain Belt Express transmission superhighway will advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy and technology dominance while delivering billions of dollars in energy cost savings, strengthening grid reliability and resiliency, and creating thousands of American jobs,” the company said in a statement. It might also connect a natural gas plant to what was initially a green energy line, the company announced in July.

Invenergy took Bailey’s office to court, demanding that the attorney general withdraw the investigation. But last week, Bailey announced he’d be leaving his post to join the FBI. Governor Mike Kehoe appointed former state House speaker and federal prosecutor Catherine Hanaway, who most recently worked as lead counsel for Grain Belt Express. Hanaway says the case will proceed, and that she has recused herself.

For Knott, of Beyond Coal, the decade-plus battle over Grain Belt Express is less about what would benefit Missourians and more about a culture war over what “energy dominance” means. “They have politicized clean energy,” he said, “which is honestly just a very weird and illogical thing to do, because clean energy is much, much cheaper than fossil fuels, and we need as much energy on the grid as possible right now.”

The money-losing California-based company broke ground mid-September nearAtlanta despite U.S. president Donald Trump’s successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits, The Associated Press reported. Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.

CEO RJ Scaringe said Tuesday that Rivian will sell its R2 sport utility vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because it’s a superior vehicle.

“The description I’ll say for R2 is it isn’t an electric vehicle,” he said. “I describe R2 as an incredible five-passenger offroad machine. And it happens to be electric.”

Georgia Plant Is Key to a Mass Market and Profitability

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian’s key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV in Normal, Illinois, as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.

The Illinois plant will begin making the smaller R2 next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly. But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity. Scaringe said the Georgia operation, able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028, is the “foundation for our growth.” Rivian plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles.

The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it’s limiting production in part to launch 2026 models.

“For Rivian, it’s do-or-die time,” said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. “We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can’t scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.”

Challenges In the Electric Vehicle Market

Sales growth is slowing for EVs in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025’s first half, according to Cox Automotive.

Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. EV sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors’ slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%. By comparison, Rivian had a 3% share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.

But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful startup automaker.

The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But competition now includes Ford’s F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.

After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025’s first half.

At the same time, some automakers’ ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis last week canceled Ram’s electric truck program. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles in suburban Detroit.

“With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian’s favor,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “However, there still is an EV market out there.”

$1.5 Billion in Incentives for 7,500 Jobs

Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can’t benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.

Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, says he wants to make Georgia “the electric mobility capital of America,” but acknowledged that “the road to get here has not been smooth.” He voiced confidence that Rivian can deliver “an innovation revolution” benefitting Georgians.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt. Georgia’s Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.

Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre (800-hectare) site near Social Circle, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology. And then-President Joe Biden’s administration agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.

Despite the Trump administration’s hostility toward EVs, Scaringe said Tuesday that Rivian has built “a very close relationship” with the U.S. Department of Energy and that the company’s goals align with some of Trump’s big ones, including “U.S. manufacturing, U.S. technology, U.S. technology that supports global business, and leading in all those areas.”

Kemp said he has urged Energy Secretary Chris Wright to back Rivian.

Some Neighbours Still Oppose the Plant

Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbour to farms and will pollute the groundwater.

“I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?” asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away. He says his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.

There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Scaringe said the start of construction shows Rivian is working through its challenges.

“These are not the kinds of things you start without having clear sight to be able to fully finish and launch,” he said.

The court reversed the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission’s decision and ordered Hoosier to stop raising prices and to immediately dismiss Duke’s rate increase application. The ruling has been welcomed by several public interest institutions aimed at representing the interests of the average American.

The Indiana Court of Appeals has given the people of the region a win against high prices

Every single American is slowly being subjected to increases in cost across several key sectors of everyday life. The rising cost of living in the United States has seen increases in the cost of everything from cars to eggs, and more in between. In 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency implemented new rules for treating and disposing of toxic coal ash, and Duke has several coal-powered electricity generation plants in Indiana.

They began to spend essential money to try to comply with the new regulations. And have recently put in an application to try to recoup some of those operational costs by increasing prices for customers, which did not go down well, to say the least. Several organizations have reportedly planned to challenge the action. And the court agrees with them.

The Indiana Court of Appeals has reversed the action taken by Duke Energy over the past four years

The court has ruled that Duke’s plan to increase prices over the past four years was considered illegal retroactive ratemaking. Which speaks volumes about the company’s policies and views of their customer base, of which there are millions. Duke Energy operates several sites in the Indiana region, and the apparent price increases amount to a total of around $88 million in costs incurred from 2019 through 2023.

They even had plans to expand their recouperation efforts for the period between 2024 and 2030, claiming $238 million in projected operational costs in that time frame. Judge Paul Mathias delivered the ruling, which his colleagues on the bench agreed with.

“As our Supreme Court has made clear: ‘a statute operates prospectively when it is applied to the operative event of the statute, and that event occurs after the statute took effect,’ – Judge Paul Mathias of the Indiana Court of Appeals

The ruling also encouraged the Citizens Action Coalition to pursue legal action and sue Duke, which creates a split in the energy sector in the region. The Trump administration has led efforts to increase production in the energy sector across the board and will surely see the ruling as a mere speed bump on the way to energy independence for the United States.

“This is a big win. It’s quite simply, from our perspective, retroactive rate making, which is not allowed. The commission should have known better, and now we’re pretty happy with this (decision). Duke challenged our standing in the case and the court rejected those arguments soundly. We’ve seen more and more challenges on standing, so that (decision) was good.” – Kerwin Olson, Executive Director of Citizens Action Coalition

Will the federal government take steps to intervene in the court ruling

In the midst of all these court rulings and supposed interventions from the federal government, the ruling could be a positive one for the customer base, but ultimately, the industry will feel the effects on the levels of production in the downstream sector. The recent news of Nigeria’s struggles with its workforce has accelerated the Trump administration’s job creation efforts in the energy sector, no doubt aiming to avoid any more legal actions. Will the Trump government intervene? Time will tell.

This positions the United States for declining relevance in the industries that will define the rest of this century.","Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.

For most of the past half century, the H1-B visa program has been a conduit for global talent into the American economy. It has not been a minor contribution but a central driver of U.S. leadership in high technology. Scratch most successful firms of the last 50 years, and H1-B holders figure prominently in their intellectual capital and executive leadership.

Year after year, between 65 and 75 percent of H1-B recipients have come from India. The pattern is striking. Indian engineers, computer scientists, and mathematicians have arrived in numbers that transformed entire industries. They filled programming roles in Silicon Valley, built quantitative models on Wall Street, managed semiconductor design in Texas, and supported every stage of the IT services industry.

China has been the second largest source country, contributing engineers in chip design, material sciences, and advanced manufacturing. Canada and South Korea have provided smaller but steady flows of specialists, particularly in artificial intelligence, aerospace, and telecommunications. The Philippines has supplied healthcare professionals and technical staff. Eastern Europe has contributed in mathematics-heavy fields like cryptography and software security. The United States drew selectively and broadly from this global pool, and for decades it reinforced an innovation ecosystem that relied on constant renewal from abroad.

These workers did not settle into one narrow niche. They worked in Microsoft’s Redmond offices writing operating system code. They staffed Google’s Mountain View teams designing algorithms that underpin global search and advertising. At Tesla in Palo Alto, they worked on battery management systems and autonomous driving stacks. They joined biotech labs in Boston, research centers in Austin, and clean energy startups in Colorado and Arizona. They were critical in engineering departments of utilities modernizing their grids. They were present in almost every major R&D center run by multinationals, from automotive OEMs in Michigan to chip designers in California. Universities relied on them as postdocs and assistant professors, who in turn trained the next generation of American students. Without them, many projects would not have been possible at the speed and scale the U.S. achieved.

The $100,000 fee attached to every new H1-B application with Trump’s most recent executive order changes that foundation. Startups, which live on slim budgets and early-stage venture funding, simply cannot absorb such a surcharge. A two-person energy storage startup hoping to bring in one specialist from India would need to raise an additional $100,000 before even paying salary and benefits. Most will abandon the idea and either hire remotely abroad or leave the role vacant. Larger firms have more flexibility, but even there the calculus changes. A multinational automaker might decide to relocate a promising engineer to a German or Canadian subsidiary rather than pay $100,000 to move them to Detroit. The pipeline of foreign graduate students finishing master’s and PhD programs in the United States will find fewer opportunities to stay. They will either return home or find openings in other countries that maintain more welcoming policies.

Layered on top of this immigration barrier, the One Big Beautiful Bill strips away much of the long-term certainty created by the Inflation Reduction Act. Manufacturing credits that were designed to give a decade or more of visibility now cut off in 2027. Critical mineral credits begin phasing out, and even coal is inserted as an eligible “critical” input. Foreign entity restrictions have been tightened and paired with recapture provisions that extend for a decade, raising financing costs and legal risks for investors. Loan guarantee capacity at the Department of Energy has been rescinded. Together, these shifts make clean technology projects in the United States riskier and less attractive. Developers and manufacturers do not make multi-billion-dollar decisions without predictable policy support, and that predictability has been undercut.

The countries that benefit most are those that were already feeding talent and supply chains into the U.S. India is first in line. With seven out of ten H1-B visas historically going to its citizens, India now retains that pool. Engineers and scientists who would have staffed U.S. offices will instead work from Bangalore or Hyderabad. Multinationals that relied on transferring staff into the U.S. will expand their Indian campuses instead. Venture capital that might have funded a Silicon Valley clean-tech startup will increasingly back Indian founders, confident the talent will remain in place. Over time, this compounds into a stronger domestic innovation ecosystem. More patents are filed in India, more startups are born there, and more global clean-tech firms build significant engineering footprints there.

China gains by virtue of its manufacturing scale. The U.S. stepping back from long-term subsidies for batteries, wind, and solar makes China’s factories more competitive. American gigafactories that were planned may stall, but Chinese exports will continue to flow. Solar supply chains that were slowly reorienting toward U.S. manufacturing under the IRA will instead remain anchored in China. The nascent battery manufacturing industry in the USA will find it very difficult to grow and for those factories that already started production, very difficult to stabilize quality. Every year of uncertainty in U.S. policy is another year of entrenchment for Chinese supply dominance.

Southeast Asia stands to pick up more of the middle links in the supply chain. Indonesia has been aggressive in attracting nickel processing and battery production, and higher U.S. visa costs and weaker incentives make that proposition more compelling for investors. Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand, already integrated into electronics manufacturing, will see more orders for modules, components, and subassemblies. As U.S. firms look to reduce risk and cost, they will push more of this work into these countries. Canada and Mexico, with geographic proximity and trade agreements, will also benefit as nearshore alternatives. A U.S. company that cannot afford to bring in foreign engineers may instead set up an R&D center in Toronto or Monterrey, where the visa rules are easier and the costs lower.

Artificial intelligence startups are among the most exposed to these shifts. For years they have drawn from graduate programs where the majority of students are from India, China, and other countries. Those graduates often transitioned to H1-B visas and staffed early teams in San Francisco, Boston, and New York. With a $100,000 surcharge attached to each petition, that pipeline is effectively cut off. Startups running on seed or Series A budgets cannot justify spending that much on a single hire, no matter how talented. Larger firms may still bring in a handful of foreign specialists, but the flow into the early-stage ecosystem will dry up. The result is that intellectual property that might have been created in the United States will instead be created in Bangalore, Toronto, or Berlin, where immigration pathways are open and financing confidence is higher.

The consequences ripple outward quickly. Investors back companies that can access the best people, and they will redirect capital if U.S. startups are constrained. Some American AI firms will register overseas subsidiaries to tap talent abroad, but that complicates intellectual property ownership and weakens the case for scaling in the United States. At the same time, Canada, Europe, and India will benefit from denser AI clusters, richer networks, and faster company formation. Once those ecosystems mature, they will reinforce themselves. For the U.S., the effect is a gradual erosion of relevance in a field that is central not only to economic growth but also to national security and strategic advantage.

The structural problem for the U.S. is that once these shifts occur, they are hard to reverse. Talent pools build density where they are welcomed. If India’s engineers now remain in India, they will start more companies there, join more local firms, and strengthen the ecosystem further. Manufacturing supply chains are sticky. Once a battery plant is built in Indonesia or a module assembly line is set up in Vietnam, it is not likely to move to the United States later. Investors allocate capital based on trust in long-term rules, and trust is slow to rebuild once lost. The rollback of IRA provisions signals that U.S. policy can change rapidly, and the $100,000 H1-B fee signals that the U.S. no longer values incoming talent as it once did. Together, they push money and people elsewhere.

This positions the United States for declining relevance in the industries that will define the rest of this century. Electric vehicles, batteries, wind, solar, grid storage and AI are not side projects. They are the backbone of the global energy and information transition. Countries that build and dominate them will shape trade, employment, and industrial strength for decades. By shutting down its own talent inflows and reducing its investment signals, the U.S. gives away opportunities.

Others will take them. India will grow stronger in technology and clean energy innovation. China will deepen its control of manufacturing. Both countries will end up with stronger AI ecosystems. Southeast Asia will expand its role in critical minerals and midstream processing. Canada, Mexico, and Europe will secure more design and engineering centers. The U.S. will find itself importing more technology and exporting less, a reversal of the pattern that defined its economic strength for the last century.

Reversing this trend will not be simple. Even if a future administration removes the H1-B fee and restores clean energy incentives, the intervening years will have shifted ecosystems abroad. The companies that were not formed in the U.S. will have formed elsewhere. The factories that were not built in the U.S. will already be running overseas. The trust of investors and talent will have been eroded. America can recover in part, but it will be rebuilding against competitors that have gained ground while it stepped back. The risk is not just slower growth, but a lasting decline in relevance in the technologies that matter most for the future economy. It is a choice that reshapes global competition, and one that will be very hard to undo.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Image-Sep-21-2025-06_08_21-PM.png,N,,2025-09-22 01:57:27.248290

This year marks the 237th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution in June, 1788. Story courtesy of Louise Hunt, Regent Turtle Creek Chapter, NSDAR

WARREN COUNTY, OH -- Thomas Jefferson described Hugh Williamson’s role at the Philadelphia Convention as, “He was a useful member, of an acute mind, attentive to business, and of a high degree of erudition.” (That means being learned and scholarly.)

Jefferson may have been too modest describing Hugh Williamson. What Williamson accomplished at the Constitutional Convention was the following: He remained at the convention for the entire time and signed the Constitution for the state of North Carolina. He served on five committees, offered 23 motions, and delivered over 70 speeches. Williamson’s main role at the convention was in proposing and supporting certain compromises that ultimately made ratification a reality.

He proposed an impeachment procedure for the chief executive, endorsed a six-year term for U.S. senators, recommended that a free and slave population census be taken in support of the Three-Fifths Compromise, and favored the extension of slavery until a future date to give all states conditions that they could accept in the Constitution.

Williamson did not approve of slavery and never owned slaves, but he believed it better to have all the states within the Union, rather than excluding some by adopting provisions that everyone knew would not be accepted. His experiences convinced him that only a strong central government could adequately protect and foster the political, economic, and intellectual future of the new nation.

Williamson was a scholar of international renown. He was an educator, mathematician, physician, legislator, merchant, scientist, and scholar. Williamson was born and grew up in Pennsylvania and entered the College of Philadelphia (later to become the University of Pennsylvania) at 18. He received a degree in mathematics. Immediately afterwards, he studied theology and received a license to preach in the Presbyterian Church. After that he began studying medicine and then left for Europe to study in Scotland, London, and Utrecht, the Netherlands, where he received an M.D. degree.

He traveled around Europe and upon his return, was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society. He was drawn into scholarly and scientific circles and traveled in America and Europe conducting experiments. It was in Europe that it is thought he collaborated with Benjamin Franklin. While in Boston before sailing to Europe, Williamson observed the Boston Tea Party and was the first to bring the news to England.

During the Revolutionary War, Williamson was unique in that he contributed his talents in shipbuilding, working in a tannery, being a physician and natural scientist to the American war effort primarily in North Carolina, where he now lived. His important medical and scientific accomplishments included vaccinating North Carolina troops against small pox; at the Battle of Camden, he went behind enemy lines under a truce flag to care for American prisoners and provided medical consultation for a British officer.

In the Great Dismal Swamp, Williamson conducted experiments implementing dietary controls, instituting the use of proper clothing in keeping with local environmental conditions, and establishing specific sanitary procedures. Out of a force of between 500 and 1,200 men during the winter of 1780, only two men died from disease and no one was granted sick leave. Williamson advanced his own funds to the state to purchase medical supplies that would be needed in the event of a protracted campaign.

Hugh Williamson was a hugely influential person in North Carolina during and after the War. At the Second Constitutional Convention at Fayetteville, NC in 1789, Williamson made the initial motion on the floor to adopt the document that he had signed for the state. He served with distinction in state and national government and politics but always kept close ties with North Carolina. He was a true Renaissance Man.

That said, several other DC-coupled solar-plus-storage sites have already been developed in Australia. Western Australia, for example, already has an operational DC-coupled hybrid site in the form of Green Power Generation’s 128MW Cunderdin hybrid solar PV and BESS project, which was inaugurated in early April 2025.

By connecting the battery on the DC side of the plant, the system will share inverters, transformers and a single grid connection with the solar array. This configuration offers several advantages over traditional AC-coupled systems, including improved efficiency, reduced equipment costs and enhanced flexibility in energy dispatch.

The battery component features approximately 10-hour duration capability, positioning it among Australia’s longest-duration grid-scale battery systems currently under construction.

Adam Pegg, country manager for Lightsource bp Australia and New Zealand, emphasised that the project demonstrates how long-duration energy storage (LDES) can firm solar generation, enabling coal plants to retire on or before schedule.

“By demonstrating that long-duration storage can firm solar generation, we can cover the peak periods and enable coal to retire on or ahead of schedule,” Peng said.

The hybrid project received federal backing through the Australian government’s Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS). Specifically, the project received backing in the first tender round, which saw solar PV awarded 2.8GW.

At the same time, the battery component is underwritten by a New South Wales Long-Term Energy Service Agreement (LTESA).",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Wellington-Lightsource-bp.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 21:59:44.654138

The outlet quoted Ahmad as saying: ""As I have always said, it is not a matter of 'if,' but 'when.' I am responsible for fulfilling this directive, and the question now is the method, timing, and approach.""

Several of Malaysia's neighbors have already enacted their own vape bans. They've been banned in Singapore since 2018, and the government recently advanced even tougher enforcement measures. Thailand and Vietnam have also outlawed vaping, with heavy fines and jail time awaiting any violators.

For some, the proposed measures are a cause for concern. Malaysia has around 1.4 million users and a vape industry worth over $1.1 billion annually. According to The Straits Times, some retailers are perplexed by the move to curtail vaping, pointing to equally harmful products that remain perfectly legal, like cigarettes and alcohol.

Still, there's no doubt that vaping involves serious health and environmental consequences.

Disposable vapes are one of the most significant contributors to the growing problem of toxic e-waste that is clogging landfills. In 2023, Americans discarded the equivalent of 5.7 vapes every second.

Research conducted by the UN indicates that around 60-90% of all e-waste is illegally dumped. Fortunately, a better way to deal with most unwanted electronics exists: cashing in on old devices.

As national delegations, activists and other attendees struggle to find affordable places to stay by November, with some deciding not to go at all, Tilvawala, who lives in London, has spent hours working from afar to find lodging in Belem, negotiate prices and contracts and put down deposits. She did all that to create a housing portal specifically for young people who want to be part of the international conference. If not enough people sign up for the housing she’s secured, she might lose some of what she’s put down.

“There’s always a huge number of fossil fuel company representatives there. And who’s going to be there to combat those voices and those negotiating influences?” said Tilvawala, founder and executive director of the global organization Youth Climate Collaborative. “So I was like, ‘We need to be here.’”

With less than two months before this year’s Conference of the Parties, or COP30, only about 36% of the 196 participating countries have confirmed attendance and paid for accommodations, according to a spokesperson for the conference presidency.

Activists and poorer nations are feeling the crunch as hotel prices have skyrocketed and even private homes, love motels and other makeshift accommodation options are charging a minimum of several hundred dollars a night.

The Brazilian government chose Belem because it’s part of the Amazon and to underscore the problems common to growing cities in the developing world, but some prospective attendees are raising questions about how productive the talks will be if they are overshadowed by a big drop in attendance.

Many haven’t confirmed housing yet, and the pressure is on

The Brazilian government has taken steps to address the problem. Climate Minister Marina Silva said 10 to 20 rooms have been made available “at accessible prices” for vulnerable countries. The government has also brought in two large cruise ships that can house as many as 6,000 people.

“Everybody will have access to participate in COP30,” Silva said at a recent press briefing. “Facing climate change must be done by all of us, by all the parties of the convention and especially by those who are already living the consequences of climate change.”

But U.N. Climate Change executive secretary Simon Stiell sent a letter on Sept. 9 asking that agencies in the U.N. system, and related organizations, review how many people they’re sending to COP30 and reduce it where possible.

To add to the pressure, a construction workers’ strike started Sept. 15 and includes areas being worked on for COP30.

A challenge for a city chosen to illustrate climate realities

Belem was initially excited to host the conference, said Arnaldo Vaz Neto, a Brazilian financial adviser who has been working with an organization called the Young Scholars Initiative as an intermediary between locals and COP30 visitors seeking housing. “It’s kind of taught in our childhood to have this behavior of hospitality,” he said.

But that was followed by the realization that the United Nations had high international standards for its guests. It was difficult to manage expectations on both sides, Vaz Neto said.

Belem isn’t the only city hosting a U.N. climate conference where lodging rates have gone far higher than usual. Silva said it’s happened at nearly all such conferences, with prices three or even four times market rates.

“A lot of people here are expecting to charge $1,000 a night but that’s beyond the average,” Hugo Pinheiro, a secretary who works for K Pine Mobile in Belem, and has worked to match delegations with housing and to negotiate on prices.

The “accessible” rooms made available by the Brazilian government will rent for between $200 and $600 a night, according to a COP30 presidency spokesperson.

Brazilian officials have expressed confidence that all 196 nations will find housing and come to Belem. In a statement, the presidency said it expects 50,000 participants and Belem currently offers 53,000 beds. That’s fewer people than recent COPs, even though the Brazil meeting is considered one of the most important negotiations in years because countries have to update and strengthen their carbon pollution plans.

Hard decisions

Still, housing is making it more difficult for people from some poorer countries and Indigenous groups to attend, as well as for those that traditionally attend COP outside of a country delegation, including activists, NGO and nonprofit groups and youth observers. Some organizations that represent them expect to send fewer people.

Hailey Campbell leads Care About Climate, a youth-oriented NGO that was one of the first of its kind to be accredited to attend COP over 10 years ago. Campbell said her group has “never faced such difficulties with access to accommodation.” The group posted about the issue on Instagram with the hashtag “#DontPriceUsOut.”

Many individual attendees have already decided they can’t come. Others are on the fence. Some who will attend are considering options like camping in a tent.

This year Hikaru Hayakawa said he’s heard from more people who have decided not to go than he remembers at this time in years past — already maybe 30 or 40 people, by his estimate.

That’s worrisome because many activists from other countries will now miss out on experiencing the strong civil society culture in Brazil, said Hayakawa, executive director of Climate Cardinals, which translates climate information and trains young people.

“It could potentially be lost opportunity to build these global networks,” he said.

Exmouth trial shows potential for V2G to power homes, reduce power bills

Technology has the potential to manage two-way charging to stabilise electricity grid

Horizon Power has successfully completed a 12-month trial testing technology to facilitate two-way charging of electric vehicles (EVs).

The Exmouth trial demonstrated that Horizon Power's vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology has the potential to manage the two-way flow of energy from EVs charging and discharging into the power network, while ensuring stability and reliability.

The technology enables EVs to act as mobile energy storage systems.

Horizon Power conducted a range of tests exploring the future possibility of using V2G energy flow to power homes, reduce power bills, and stabilise the electricity grid.

It will use the findings of the trial to inform the development of products that will allow customers to get more from their EVs than just getting them from A to B. This could include helping them to power their homes or even earn money by feeding energy back to the grid.

The trial was the first of its kind in Western Australia and was conducted using the regional energy provider's Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS).

DERMS used data from Horizon Power's power systems, connected solar, the EVs and weather forecasts (predicting the availability of solar energy), to successfully balance power system stability with customer needs.

DERMS is already used to ease electricity grid capacity constraints, enabling more regional households to connect rooftop solar.

As part of the Cook Government's Electric Vehicle Action Plan, the trial has enhanced Horizon Power's understanding of how energy flow from EVs can be incorporated into its microgrids, especially in regional and remote towns.

As Horizon Power develops DERMS, EVs have the potential to draw power from the grid to charge but also feed power back into the network when needed - for example, when demands for energy are at their peak or when the flow of energy in the system needs to be stabilised.

Horizon Power partnered with the Gascoyne Development Commission, Shire of Exmouth, Exmouth Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and WA Country Health Service, providing them each with a V2G-compatible Nissan Leaf EV and V2G smart-charging equipment for the trial.

Further information about Horizon Power's V2G trial can be found at www.horizonpower.com.au/evorchestration

Comments attributed to Energy and Decarbonisation Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson:

""The success of this regional trial in Exmouth is an important milestone in our clean energy transition and in testing the technology that could make two-way charging a possibility in Western Australia.

""The findings confirmed for Horizon Power that its technology can manage EV charging and discharging intelligently, helping it to keep the grid stable while paving the way for flexible, customer-led energy products.

""Electric vehicle batteries are powerful. As well as helping to stabilise the grid they have the capacity to power homes and reduce energy bills.

This coverage is made possible through a partnership between Grist and WABE, Atlanta's NPR station.

While any election brings ads, events, door-knocking and other efforts to remind people to get to the polls, this year campaign workers concerned with Georgia's Public Service Commission races have another hurdle: education.

Climate and environment organizers gathered in Atlanta recently to strategize about how to mobilize voters ahead of November's election for two seats on the Georgia commission. Dubbed ""Watts at Stake,"" the event brought together organizers, community leaders and influencers to hear about the importance of the somewhat obscure state agency — a message the speakers view as critical this election cycle.

""If you ask most people, they don't know what the PSC is,"" Russell Armstrong with Black Futures Lab, a group focused on leveraging Black electoral power, told Grist.

But, Armstrong and others said, voters care about what the commission does, once they understand it.

The commission regulates utilities in Georgia, including overseeing Georgia Power's plans and rates — and power bills are climbing. That motivates voters, according to strategists across the political spectrum.

""That's a galvanizing, dare I say energizing, message that will get Georgia voters out,"" said Carmen Bergman, an adviser to the campaign of incumbent Republican commissioner Fitz Johnson.

Experts and advocates elsewhere are also invested in the commission because while power bills are going up nationwide, Georgia is one of only 10 states that directly elects the utility commissioners who have final say over electricity rates.

""There actually is more power for the consumer in a state like Georgia than in any other state because they vote for their regulators,"" Charles Hua, founder of the utility advocacy and education group PowerLines, told reporters ahead this month's organizing event. ""The challenge is how do we get that education and awareness in front of as many folks as possible?""

One of the biggest jobs for the Georgia PSC is regulating Georgia Power. That includes how power is made — which has an impact on climate change because power plants are a major source of emissions — and how much energy costs, which affects the millions of Georgians who get their electricity from the company.

There are five statewide elected commissioners who serve staggered terms. Currently they are all Republicans. This year, Tim Echols and Fitz Johnson are up for election. Johnson is running against Democrat Peter Hubbard, and Echols is facing Democrat Alicia Johnson.

Helping voters make the connection between their power bills and the two seats on the ballot this year is proving to be an all-out, statewide effort. Groups like Georgia Conservation Voters, one of the organizers of the organizing event, said they are holding both virtual and in-person town halls to educate voters. Black Futures Lab has volunteers knocking on doors and is holding a series of events in South Georgia.

""The main thing is showing people that, hey, we hold the power, we hold the keys to this election and every other election from here to come,"" said Omega Calhoun, who spearheads their efforts in Valdosta.

Bergman said the Johnson campaign is taking an ""all of the above"" approach to getting the word out, including events, canvassing and ads.

""There's going to be no stone left unturned to make sure voters know that there is a difference on the ballot,"" she said.

This kind of effort is pretty novel for a down-ballot race in Georgia, according to Georgia State University public policy professor Tammy Greer. Voters would benefit from more education and engagement in other races, too, she said, including lieutenant governor and the commissioners of insurance, labor and agriculture.

""These spaces have so much policy implications over people in the state that we really don't pay attention to,"" Greer said. ""If we paid closer attention to their platforms then perhaps we can start electing individuals that are looking out for all of our best interests.""

This is also an unusual year for a typically low-profile election because the commission seats are the only statewide races on the ballot, but there are local elections in some of the major cities, including Atlanta. So while Georgia's Republican-leaning rural areas often carry state elections, without a governor's race or even mayoral race to get many rural voters to the polls, Greer said, Democratic voters in cities could decide the races.

""And I think that the folks on the commission understand that,"" Greer said. ""They understand the tide is changing.""

She pointed to the commission's unanimous vote earlier this year to temporarily freeze power rates as a sign the five current commissioners know that high power bills are driving voters and that what Greer called ""a bit of dissent"" could soon join the currently all-Republican commission.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2025/09/23/103789765_20250611-AMX-US-NEWS-BIG-ELECTION-WITH-TINY-TURNOUT-1-AT_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-09-21 18:59:24.622454

Under the proposed bill, the president would lose the ability to remove permits with an executive order and would need congressional approval.
In a speech on the House floor, arguing for the bill, Congresswoman Fedorchak said, “The Keystone XL pipeline should have never been cancelled.","BISMARCK, ND (KXNET) — North Dakota congresswoman Julie Fedorchak introduced H.R. 3062, the Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act. The goal behind the bill is to streamline the permitting process for cross-border energy projects.

The bill passed the House with bipartisan support in a vote of 224-203. Seven Democrats joined all voting republicans to pass the bill, with five members not voting.

The bill’s primary focus is to standardize and streamline the permitting process for the import and export of oil, natural gas, and electricity transmission. This would be a boon for oil-rich states near the US border.

The new law would require congressional approval to remove permitting for cross-border pipelines. That portion of the law is in response to President Joe Biden’s executive order removing permitting for the Keystone XL pipeline, an infrastructure project that stalled for more than 12 years before being canceled after then-President Biden’s executive order.

Under the proposed bill, the president would lose the ability to remove permits with an executive order and would need congressional approval.

In a speech on the House floor, arguing for the bill, Congresswoman Fedorchak said, “The Keystone XL pipeline should have never been cancelled. Yet on his first day in office, President Biden used the stroke of a pen to shut it down,” Fedorchak continued, “by passing my legislation, the House has taken a critical step to end years of regulatory uncertainty and partisan games that have delayed energy infrastructure projects, crushed good-paying jobs, and undermined America’s energy security.”

The bill now awaits a hearing from the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. It will face a slightly tougher audience in the Senate with Republicans’ razor-thin margin. The bill is not exempt from a filibuster requiring 60 votes, meaning republicans would need to pick up seven Democratic senators.",https://www.kxnet.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2020/05/0e8023061a7f4ed9b18e6556a4782571.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-21 17:59:30.574566

The agency will oversee $350 million in state funding aimed at developing nuclear energy projects across Texas.

The appointment comes as Texas seeks to expand beyond fossil fuels and attract new nuclear development. With federal support growing for nuclear power, the state is aiming to capture a share of the emerging advanced reactor market.

“The State of Texas continues to build the world’s most robust and diverse energy sector,” said Abbott. “Texas will lead the nuclear renaissance.”

Shaffer currently serves as a budget and policy advisor in Abbott’s office. His background includes stints with the Texas House Committee on State Affairs, the state transportation department, and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

The Texas Advanced Nuclear Office (TANO) emerged from legislation Abbott signed in June. House Bill 14 established both the office and its $350 million development fund.

The fund will provide financial incentives to nuclear developers choosing Texas for their projects. TANO will also work to streamline regulatory processes that have historically slowed nuclear development.

Shaffer’s appointment comes as several states compete to attract advanced nuclear projects. These next-generation reactors promise safer, more efficient designs than traditional nuclear plants.

“To highlight independent filmmakers, to celebrate their work, to gather together in a communal space, to connect and reflect on the stories we all have inside of us.”","American actor and filmmaker Robert Redford died Sept. 16 at the age of 89. While best known for his work on the big screen, earning four Academy Award nominations throughout his career, Redford’s legacy beyond Hollywood deserves greater recognition.

Elevating journalism

In one his most iconic acting roles in the 1976 film, “All the President’s Men,” Redford stars as investigative journalist Bob Woodward, working alongside fellow reporter Carl Bernstein, played by Dustin Hoffman, to uncover the Watergate scandal.

Redford played a crucial role in portraying a positive representation of journalism and embodying an icon in the industry. While his acting stands out, Redford’s lasting impact on journalism through the Oscar-nominated film is often overlooked.

In addition to acting, Redford was heavily involved in the production of the film, helping turn the story into an on-screen experience while highlighting Woodward and Bernstein’s work in a noble light. The duo’s investigative reporting sparked a rise in journalism trends throughout the United States. Journalism student enrollments soared by 93% between 1970 and 1975, per the New York Times, which can largely be accredited to the journalistic work of Woodward and Bernstein.

The release of “All the President's Men” in 1976 coincided with a 72% public trust in media that year across the United States according to a survey conducted by Gallup — the highest since the company began asking this question in 1972. This surge in trust underscores the substantial impact that Woodward and Bernstein’s investigation — and Redford’s production of the story and acting in the film — had on elevating the power of journalism.

Championing environmentalism

Since the beginning of the modern environmentalist movement, which began in the late 1960s and early ‘70s, Redford used his public persona to push for environmental causes.

Over the last five decades of his life, Redford worked closely with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) as a trustee.

He also consistently advocated for environmental justice. In the late ‘70s, Redford advocated for the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, which expanded the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge — a more than 19 million-acre protected home to an abundance of wildlife.

Most recently, Redford publicly supported clean energy legislation, which turned into the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 — the largest climate and clean energy bill in United States history.

“The environmental movement has lost a giant,” NRDC president and CEO Manish Bapna said in a press release. “Nobody has done more to shine a light on the most important environmental issues from the dawn of the environmental movement in the ‘70s through the biodiversity and climate crises of today. We must continue to honor his vision in the difficult environmental landscape we face today.”

Empowering independent filmmakers

Despite receiving numerous Academy Award nominations and epitomizing the classic Hollywood movie star, perhaps Redford’s most defining traits were his significant contributions to independent filmmakers and the indie film industry.

In 1969, Redford purchased land to open the Sundance Mountain Resort in Utah, which he later fostered into a space for the Sundance Institute — a nonprofit organization dedicated to celebrating and cultivating independent filmmakers. Despite his success in acting and directing, Redford recognized that smaller creative minds lacked the opportunities and attention they deserved.

The institute hosts the annual Sundance Film Festival, which has helped launch some of the biggest director names in Hollywood, including Quentin Tarantino and Wes Anderson.

Brittany Friesner, managing director for the Indiana University Cinema, worked with Sundance in theater operations from 2008-2015 and remembers the feelings surrounding Redford within the organization.

“It was electric to have him in the building and there to remind everyone of the heart and soul and original intent of the festival,” Friesner said. “To highlight independent filmmakers, to celebrate their work, to gather together in a communal space, to connect and reflect on the stories we all have inside of us.”",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/ids/d5ff2322-a3f2-48ec-a298-2b95511b960c.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&h=600,N,,2025-09-21 17:59:52.106177

Scientists and engineers are hard at work trying to figure out how to build nuclear reactors better and more cheaply than ever before.
One of the biggest focuses of nuclear innovation is the development of small modular reactors (SMRs) which will make nuclear power more scalable and streamlined, lowering up-front development costs.
Just this week, Donald Trump signed a flurry of nuclear deals with the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer, amounting to multiple billions of dollars to expand nuclear energy power production capacity across both nations.","The United States is the single-largest producer of nuclear power in the world, accounting for approximately a third of global output. But the domestic nuclear sector is in severe decline, and the nuclear fleet is rapidly aging, with many of the nation’s reactors scheduled to be retired in the coming years. Reviving the sector could be a huge boon to national energy security and global climate goals, but building new plants is prohibitively expensive.

In the past few decades, the United States has only built one new nuclear power plant, Waynesboro, Georgia’s Plant Vogtle. Vogtle has the distinction of being the most expensive infrastructure project of any kind in U.S. history, clocking in at a whopping $35 billion after years of delays. First approved in 2009, the last reactor finally came online in April of last year.

The project is considered by most to be a bloated disaster, with the potential to derail momentum toward a nuclear renaissance in the United States. “But there are two ways to interpret the cautionary tale presented by Vogtle,” Oilprice reported as the project was wrapping up last year. “ Either you think that the lesson is not to build new reactors, or that the lesson is to build nuclear reactors better.”

A number of labs and startups across the United States have opted for the latter. Scientists and engineers are hard at work trying to figure out how to build nuclear reactors better and more cheaply than ever before.

One of the biggest focuses of nuclear innovation is the development of small modular reactors (SMRs) which will make nuclear power more scalable and streamlined, lowering up-front development costs. These smaller reactors can be mass-produced offsite in a factory setting and then assembled onsite, avoiding the extremely costly design and permitting process of traditional nuclear plants. Already, two SMR models have been approved for rollout in the United States, and many more are in the pipeline.

Meanwhile, Oak Ridge National Laboratory is working on integrating cutting-edge technologies into nuclear plant design for more efficient and effective designs and processes, including 3-D printing and artificial intelligence. The Tennessee-based National Laboratory says it has “successfully developed and validated large-scale, 3D-printed polymer composite forms for casting complex, high-precision concrete structures that would be technically challenging and costly to produce using conventional methods.”

The use of these 3-D printed composite forms can considerably cut down on production times. Typically, the casting of “complex structural components with unique geometries” can take weeks, but with these molds, nuclear projects can cast the parts on-site in a matter of days and with greater precision. The design of the 3-D molds has been tested and validated as part of the construction process for the Hermes Low-Power Demonstration Reactor at Kairos Power’s Oak Ridge campus.

“At ORNL, we’re showing that the future of nuclear construction doesn’t have to look like the past,” says Ryan Dehoff, director of the lab’s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility. “We’re combining national lab capabilities with MDF’s legacy of taking big, ambitious swings — moonshots that turn bold ideas into practical solutions — to accelerate new commercial nuclear energy.”

The timing is right – nuclear is a rare bipartisan priority in the United States and the current policy climate is bullish on a homegrown nuclear revival. At COP28, during the Biden administration, the United States was one of more than 20 countries that cooperated to launch the Declaration to Triple Nuclear Energy. And so far, anomalously, the Trump administration has shown no signs of walking back that pledge. Just this week, Donald Trump signed a flurry of nuclear deals with the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer, amounting to multiple billions of dollars to expand nuclear energy power production capacity across both nations.

The expansion, managed by the Kenya Electricity Transmission Co., will ease pressure on strained power lines, replace costly gas turbines, and help ensure reliable electricity for homes and businesses from an unlimited underground energy source.

Geothermal energy taps heat from beneath the Earth's surface to generate electricity. Unlike fossil fuels, it produces virtually no harmful carbon pollution, making it a game changer for public health and the planet.

By diversifying its energy grid with this abundant and clean energy resource, Kenya is cutting pollution, curbing climate threats, and saving money on fuel imports. Kenyans will benefit from lower energy costs, as these plants produce steady, low-cost electricity that will stabilize the national grid, fostering community and economic growth.

The project is a $120 million investment to expand Kenya's transmission network, with additional lines planned nationwide. Officials recently approved the Olkaria VII power station, adding another 80 megawatts of clean capacity.

The move has drawn praise as a model for sustainable growth and reflects the government's focus on green energy development.

Kenya Electricity Generating Co. CEO Eng. Peter Njenga said in a press release: ""We are conscious about our carbon footprint and that is why we are deliberate about our focus on green energy projects, which are not only climate-sensitive but are also sustainable.""

While geothermal is taking center stage in Kenya, households everywhere can contribute to clean energy. Installing solar panels is the ultimate home energy hack, bringing costs down to nearly zero. EnergySage offers a service that allows for easy comparison of quotes from vetted local installers to save as much as $10,000 on solar installations.

Going solar also makes other efficient appliances cheaper, such as heat pumps, which use a similar operating principle to geothermal energy. Mitsubishi offers affordable pumps with high-quality options to help you choose one.

Since 2017, the state has retired 2,500 megawatts of reliable power plants, including coal and nuclear.

Some states, like Kentucky, are ensuring utilities maintain “steel in the ground” — the dispatchable power plants capable of meeting customer needs at any hour.
A reliable grid is the foundation of our national security, economic strength, and technological leadership.","Americans often take for granted that when we flip a switch, the lights turn on.

But behind that simple act is one of the most complex machines ever built — the electric grid. In the eastern United States, PJM Interconnection is the grid operator that coordinates electricity for 65 million people across 13 states and the District of Columbia. PJM’s mission is clear: keep the power flowing reliably and affordably. But today, that mission is being jeopardized by political interference.

Several governors within the PJM footprint are attempting to alter its governance, blaming PJM for higher electricity costs instead of acknowledging the consequences of their own state energy policies. Maryland and New Jersey, for example, are pushing for changes to PJM’s Board of Managers, while governors in Pennsylvania and Virginia are trying to force political nominees onto PJM’s governing body. But PJM is not a government agency. Allowing politicians to dictate who serves on the PJM board would fundamentally change how the grid operates and inject politics into decisions that must remain firmly apolitical.

For decades, the electric grid has been governed by organizations like PJM that prioritize reliability, engineering, and market economics, not political agendas. When politics takes priority, reliability becomes the first casualty.

This has been evident in many of the same states that have criticized PJM. These states have adopted policies that undercut electric reliability, including the premature shutdown of reliable power sources like coal and nuclear plants, the establishment of unrealistic renewable mandates, and the failure to require new industrial loads like data centers to secure sufficient generation resources. The result is a tighter market, rising costs, and growing threats to reliability. These state-level mistakes were compounded by federal policies under the Biden administration that accelerated baseload plant closures and weakened the resilience of the grid.

Take New Jersey, for example. Since 2017, the state has retired 2,500 megawatts of reliable power plants, including coal and nuclear. Offshore wind projects meant to replace that capacity have collapsed, forcing New Jersey to import roughly 35 percent of its electricity while residents’ bills soar by 20 percent. Maryland has followed a similar path, closing 16 coal plants in just over a decade. The state now imports 40 percent of its electricity and is blocking a critical transmission project that would improve reliability throughout the region.

Instead of accepting responsibility for their reckless policy decisions, these governors are blaming PJM and even threatening lawsuits. Lawsuits, however, won’t keep the lights on. Nor will state policies that attempt to micromanage PJM’s wholesale markets or impose artificial price caps. These short-sighted measures only discourage investment in new, reliable generation.

PJM’s most recent capacity auction, designed to ensure there are enough power plants to meet future demand, fell short of its reserve reliability target for the first time. Demand is expected to continue rising, which could lead to shortfalls as early as 2026 and 2027, driven largely by data center growth. Meanwhile, reliable power plants continue to be retired faster than they can be replaced. This is a dangerous recipe for rolling blackouts.

PJM is sounding the alarm on the need to keep existing resources, like coal, online longer, and is also prioritizing reliable, always-available projects like natural gas and nuclear. But states must do their part. They control siting, permitting, and the integration of new loads. Some states, like Kentucky, are ensuring utilities maintain “steel in the ground” — the dispatchable power plants capable of meeting customer needs at any hour.

Others, however, are simply leaning on PJM’s wholesale market while refusing to expedite the permitting and build-out of the resources needed to keep the system operating.

PJM’s customers cannot afford for it to become a political football. If governors are allowed to bend PJM’s governance to their whims, the consequences will ripple across the 13-state region. Politicizing PJM will not build a single new power plant, nor will it lower prices. It will only erode investor confidence and jeopardize the market principles that have delivered reliability for decades.

Coal and other dispatchable resources should not be viewed as obstacles to the energy transition. They are the bridge that ensures reliability until other resources can provide the 24/7 power needed to sustain our economy. Europe’s recent blackout in Portugal and Spain is a stark warning: When policymakers ignore reliability, grids fail. The United States cannot afford to follow that path.

A reliable grid is the foundation of our national security, economic strength, and technological leadership. To protect it, PJM’s governance must remain independent and free from political manipulation so that it can correctly value always-on, dispatchable resources. And states must step up to secure sufficient generation within their borders.

Because when the lights go out, politics won’t matter — reliability will.",https://delawarevalleyjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/bigstock-Energy-And-Power-Industrial-Co-340749886-300x300-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 15:59:30.965823

With backing from both the federal government and state officials, along with support from Volkswagen and a multibillion dollar federal loan, Rivian is making a bold bet on scaling up. The facility is not just about new concrete and steel; it is about preparing for the launch of next-generation models like the midsize R2 SUV and R3 crossover, and expanding Rivian’s reach across the U.S. and international markets.

This announcement comes at a time when Rivian’s momentum has seen some bumps. Sales of existing models have cooled since their 2023 peak, and the company is facing challenges like rising competition, shrinking EV tax credits, and ongoing losses. Still, the stock is up over 5% after the groundbreaking news, building on steady gains of nearly 23% over the past year after a rocky prior stretch. The market seems keen on the idea that production scale and new vehicles could reignite growth, though real certainty is still a ways off.

So here is the real question: with the Georgia plant promising fresh capacity and new models on the horizon, is Rivian stock trading below its true value, or is the market already pricing in all the future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 2.4% Overvalued

The current consensus among analysts views Rivian as slightly overvalued, with the share price just above the estimated fair value according to their latest projections.

Rivian is positioned to benefit from the anticipated long-term acceleration of EV adoption, supported by expanding addressable market and increasing consumer demand for sustainable products. As the R2 platform enters the market at a competitive price point, these drivers should lift future vehicle deliveries, overall revenue, and market share.

Want to know why analysts believe Rivian’s future could rewrite the rules on auto margins and growth? Their forecasts are built on a bold blend of surging demand, major cost breakthroughs, and scalable new models. How do these ambitious projections stack up, and what underlying figures might surprise you?

Result: Fair Value of $14.04 (OVERVALUED)

However, persistent cash burn and policy changes remain significant risks. Any setbacks on these fronts could potentially challenge Rivian’s optimistic growth path.

Another View: Discounted Cash Flow Perspective

The sector has plans to increase the percentage of power generation that solar provides in the United States.

– Ralph Nader (Implicitly supports solar power) “Energy is essential for development, and sustainable energy is essential for sustainable development”.","The EIA or US Energy Information Administration has revealed the substantial importance that solar will provide the American energy sector as it forecasts increased energy demands for the years to come. The United States has seen a rise in solar power generation, thanks in no small part to the rise in solar power production in Texas. The US is on track to increase energy demands, thanks to an increase in population density and new and innovative tech sectors becoming more dominant in the United States.

The EIA states that solar is key to America’s plans for energy independence

As the energy demands worldwide are on an upward trajectory, several countries have made significant investments in the renewable energy sector. And the most dominant force in the renewable energy sector is, without a doubt, solar. Solar power has been apart of the American energy sector for nearly thirty years and still serves as a crucial energy provider.

US Energy Information Administration has announced that during the first half of 2025, developers added 12 gigawatts (GW) of new utility-scale solar electric generating capacity in the United States. The sector has plans to increase the percentage of power generation that solar provides in the United States. If those plans become a reality, they could add another 21 GW in the second half of the year.

New records could be set for capacity additions if all 64 GW come online in 2025

The previous record for U.S. generating capacity additions was set in 2002, when developers added an astonishing 58 GW to the grid. The vast majority of that addition came from natural gas, which is where this new record differs. The solar sector could set a new record if all units come online this year, as the renewable sector finds a more substantial foothold in the energy sector worldwide.

Texas has played a crucial role in the rise in solar usage in the energy sector in the United States. Texas surpassed California as the state with the most utility-scale solar capacity only last year, and projections are that Texas’s fondness and proclivity for solar is only going to grow as energy demands rise in the United States. Kansas has seen recent discoveries of cast troves of hydrogen that could accelerate the US energy independence efforts.

Temperatures reached a worldwide high in 2024, research revealed, following on from the record set in 2023. The UK this year had its hottest spring and summer since records began in 1884, with multiple heatwaves causing droughts and wildfires .

In his inaugural state of climate and nature speech, the secretary of state for energy security and net zero, Ed Miliband, cited research that the UK had become one of the most “nature-depleted countries in the world”. He said: “These are uncomfortable, sobering facts, and we should make no mistake: we must act on the climate and nature crisis … because no sector or part of our society is immune from those risks.”

Outside of the UK, attitudes are different. Donald Trump’s scepticism has seen green initiatives rolled back, while reliance on fossil fuels has increased. Yet Florida just had the worst drought in 24 years, with almost the entire state affected, and the LA fires in January displaced thousands of people as their homes were destroyed and hundreds also lost their lives.

Even the Nordic countries have experienced extensive heatwaves this summer and scientists believe the rapid loss of Antarctic sea ice is accelerating the problem to tipping point, with potentially irreversible global consequences.

It may sound like a dismal state of affairs, but there’s always hope, as Sir David Attenborough revealed in his Ocean documentary that the ocean can regenerate itself. Aside from the broadcaster, there’s a whole host of people dedicating their lives to improving the environment before it’s too late, and making others see that we need to change our ways.

You’ll find many of them in the second edition of The Independent’s Climate 100 List, following on from the success of our first edition last year.

The list isn’t in order of importance, nor does it compare or rank one change maker against another.

1. Abi Daré

Winning the first Climate Fiction prize in May of this year, British-Nigerian writerAbi Daré’s novel And So I Roar documents how the climate crisis also triggers social crisis. She unravels the effects of this on rural Nigerian communities, especially women and girls, deepening the inequality that already exists.

On winning, she told The Independent ,""it shows that stories from all over the world, from Africa, from Nigeria, matter. And that people have heard the voices of the girls because they were roaring in the book, as the title says. That means a lot to me.""

It also gives a voice to Africa’s climate narrative and that of the Global South too. As the continent contributes an estimated 4 per cent of global emissions, yet it bears a disproportionate brunt of the impacts of the crisis.

And So I Roar is the sequel to The Girl with the Louding Voice. In 2023, she launched The Louding Voice Foundation, which supports educational scholarships and empowerment programmes for women and girls in underserved Nigerian communities.

2. Edward Burtynsky

Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky has used most of his photography career to powerfully track humanity’s disastrous environmental footprint. His work provides the urgent environmental commentary many can’t convey with words alone.

He focuses on sites such as oil fields, mines, quarries, and those that have suffered from droughts or deforestation and uses his lens to stir much-needed conversations of human impact. His images are often stark and positioned from a bird’s eye view, encapsulating the sheer size, made more damning by often including tiny human figures for scale.

Sometimes, his pieces might look like a study of colour or pattern, until it becomes clear it’s actually something much more shocking, like the remnants of an extracted copper mine and huge craters in the land and varying rusty colours.

His recent exhibition at New York’s International Center of Photography (ICP), The Great Acceleration, portrays the effects on glacier retreats, coastal erosion and industrial landscapes.

3. Arizona Muse

British-American model Arizona Muse is the founder of the charity Dirt, a non-profit organisation aiming to change the fashion industry by tackling its many problems from the ground up, literally.

Her focus is on soil health and regenerative farming and growing methods, after witnessing the fashion industry’s impacts from within. Muse now speaks out about the hidden costs of fashion on the environment and communities, including ethical and sustainability-related problems associated with exploitation. When she first started her campaigning, she says she lost a lot of followers, but set about engaging her audience in her message. She has spent the past decade highlighting the importance of regenerative organic agriculture, especially for growing the raw materials needed to make our clothes.

Muse is working to convince the larger fashion houses and brands to change how they work, and to not only prioritise revenue. Her vision is to bring the industry more in line with the food and wine sector, which has certifications and standards for produce made following environmentally conscious practices. As there’s nothing like it, Muse is working on her own set of standards.

4. Aziza Chaouni

Architect, activist and professor Aziza Chaouni – the first Moroccan national to study architecture at Harvard University – addresses climate resilience, ecological sustainability, and social empowerment through design.

Chauni’s most prominent project has been creating earthquake-resistant buildings in Morocco, following a devastating earthquake in 2023 that claimed the lives of around 3,000 people.

Remote areas in the Atlas mountains, where buildings were made from unreinforced brick and masonry, were the worst affected by the 6.8-magnitude disaster. Chaouni’s designs are not only affordable, but are built with compressed bricks made of 95 per cent earth that are interlocked with mortar and vaulted brick roofs reinforced with steel rods, while wastewater is filtered to be reused.

The project exemplifies the need for climate-sensitive, socially responsible architecture, and for her work Chauni was awarded the 2024 IMA “Impact” Design Award in October.

5. Livia Giuggioli Firth

Livia Giuggioli Firth’s environmental contribution was almost entirely rooted in fashion, until she spent the lockdown on her twin brother’s organic farm in Umbria. Now she has moved to working on the sustainable and regenerative farm project known as Quintosapore (meaning fifth taste).

For decades, Firth committed to raising awareness on sustainability in the fashion industry. In 2010, she founded the Green Carpet Challenge, bringing sustainability to the forefront by encouraging celebrities and designers to choose eco-friendly materials and follow ethical practices on the red carpet, spotlighting the environmental costs of fast fashion.

Her 2015 documentary, The True Cost, highlighted the hidden environmental and ethical toll of fast fashion, largely on women in the Global South. Through her activism, she has influenced major fashion brands to adopt more sustainable practices and sparked a movement towards greater transparency and accountability in the industry. Last year, she closed her longstanding consultancy business, Eco-Age, after 17 years.

6. Natsai Audrey Chieza

Fashion has a pollution problem, but Zimbabwe-born Natsai Audrey Chieza found an unlikely solution in biology. Most of the textile industry’s ecological damage happens near the end of the process at the dyeing stage, as it requires a huge amount of water and many chemicals used are petroleum-based. Chieza came across a solution in the pigment found in mould, which she harnessed to create a toxin-free dye, creating a groundbreaking alternative technique.

It’s just one achievement out of her design, research and development studio Faber Futures. Set up in 2018, it designs at the intersection of nature, tech, science and sustainability, using biology to address problems caused by the climate crisis. Her work within the biodesign sector not only reduces the environmental impact of textile production but also promotes a broader dialogue about the role of biology in sustainable design.

Her success led her to co-found Normal Phenomena of Life (NPOL), a pioneering biodesign brand aiming to change the fashion industry’s over-reliance on petrochemicals. Instead it offers grown-to-order products such as bacterially dyed garments, algae-ink prints, and microbial bioconcrete. It’s part of working towards her future vision that all materials, whether for our clothes or construction, will be made from living organisms.

7. Stella McCartney

Even before sustainability became a buzzword, Stella McCartney’s name had long been associated with sustainable fashion as she used her status and following to speak out on environmental issues. Inspired by her mother Linda, an animal rights activist, McCartney has become one of the most influential figures in fashion, refusing to use any kind of animal products, and encouraging the reuse and recycling of materials, as well as the reduction of waste.

She launched her eponymous fashion line in 2001 and has been committed to ethical and environmentally conscious practices since. She has recently gone on to champion regenerative farming practices in her supply chain and has expanded the use of bio-based materials.

Earlier this year, she launched her most sustainable collection yet, made from 100 per cent cruelty-free materials, using materials such as fungi-based vegan leather and yarns from seaweed. She’s also partnered with materials company, Balena, to create a completely biodegradable shoe sole in a bid to reduce waste.

8. Greg Jackson

Paving the way for modern energy companies in the UK is the founder and CEO of Octopus Energy, Greg Jackson. With a long-standing interest in the climate from a young age and a member of Greenpeace aged 16, he went on to create Octopus in 2016, which sources a large portion of its energy from renewables. Jackson has turned green tech into a formidable force and wants to make renewable energy smart, affordable, and undeniably consumer-friendly.

Octopus is currently the UK’s largest energy supplier, thanks to Jackson’s attitude of not being afraid to shake things up, mainly with its dynamic pricing. It is investing heavily in wind and solar, where most of its renewables also come from, and it uses a tech platform to incentivise customers to use energy when more renewables have been generated, or when it’s at its cheapest and cleanest. For his services to the energy industry, he was awarded an OBE last year.

9. Scott Strazik

Scott Strazik is the CEO and president of GE Vernova, one of the largest producers of electricity in the world. Since being named to run the power division of General Electric when it was spun off into a separate company in the spring of 2024, Strazik has presided over a more than fourfold gain in the company’s stock price.

GE is one of the biggest players in the renewable energy business, managing sizeable operations in wind, nuclear, hydropower, and electricity generation. It has become a favourite of investors who are looking to cash in on the booming business for AI and in particular powering data centres for technology giants.

Strazik is a career GE executive, having previously run both its gas power business and aviation commercial engine business. GE Vernova is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

10. Andrew Forrest

Andrew Forrest is one of Australia’s richest men, having founded the Fortescue Metals Group 20 years ago, and is now a philanthropist and green energy advocate using his billions to help mitigate climate change.

Forrest’s fortune is estimated by Forbes to be above $17bn (£12.8bn), much of which he has ploughed back into his privately held Squadron Energy venture, which he founded in 2022. The company paid around $2.6bn that year for Australia’s biggest wind energy company, CWP Renewables.

Among other philanthropic endeavours, he has pledged to help rebuild Ukraine into a clean energy giant once the war with Russia is over. Forrest is known for railing against oil executives and the markets-based system of measuring corporate performance by quarterly earnings or half-year earnings, which he said is too short a timespan to allow companies to invest in meaningful change.

11. Eva Zabey

Eva Zabey is the CEO of Business for Nature, a Geneva-based group of more than 100 organisations seeking to work with business and policymakers on behalf of the environment. The group refreshed its ambitious plans to achieve a nature-positive economy for all by 2030 earlier this year to focus, among other things, on national deep dives with local partners in places such as South America, Africa and Asia. Within this plan, she is calling for it to become mandatory for all companies to report on their impact on nature, part of the Target 15 initiative.

Before joining Business for Nature, Zabey was a senior member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development for 15 years. As an ecologist, she has long been associated with work to reverse the loss of important natural systems, as well as biodiversity initiatives.

12. Jonathan Maxwell

The British investment banking entrepreneur Jonathan Maxwell created Sustainable Development Capital LLP almost 17 years ago to seek opportunities in the booming market for energy efficiency. Since then, it has been at the forefront of creating value from wasted heat and gas.

Maxwell notes that up to a third of global emissions are caused by the construction sector, from cement and steel to inefficient lighting and air conditioning systems. Whether it’s steel mills in the US to olive presses in Spain, the company works with large commercial operations to find ways for them to save energy by reducing waste.

In the past year, Maxwell has hit the television news circuit in the UK and US to alert viewers to the dangers of cuts to climate funding in both places and to promote his book, The Edge: How Competition for Resources is Pushing the World, and its Climate, to the Brink – and What we Can Do About it. Sustainable Development also did a major deal with equity firm General Atlantic to sell a minority stake to one of the investment giant’s climate funds.

13. Carole Bamford

As the founder of Daylesford and her eponymous brand, Bamford, Carole Bamford champions not only British farming, but sustainable food production and the benefits of organics. She has undeniably been a key driving force in making ethical and sustainable everyday living attractive to the general public. At Daylesford pubs and cottages, all run from 100 per cent renewables, reducing waste is essential, whether it’s turning spent coffee grounds into body scrubs, fermenting glugs of produce, or turning beeswax into beauty products.

Last November, she was a prominent voice in criticising the government’s controversial family farm tax, which she says will threaten farm sustainability.

This year, she has just hosted Daylesford’s inaugural event, Down To Earth: The Daylesford Nature Summit, which saw 150 leaders across food, farming, fashion and sustainability come together to discuss important topics such as land stewardship and organic innovation.

14. Scott Tew

Scott Tew knows better than anybody the opportunities – and risks – inherent in fighting climate change. Tew is managing director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Sustainability at Trane Technologies, one of the world’s largest industrial cooling and heating companies.

In a world in which record temperatures are being set every month, there is arguably no better position to be in than working at an air conditioning company. Tew is one of the environmental, social and governance (ESG) world’s most prominent corporate innovators, drawing large audiences when he discusses how companies need to develop sustainability cultures.

Trane is based in North Carolina but domiciled in Ireland, and its stock is among the best performers on Wall Street of any clean tech stocks of the last few years. It has continued its run so far in 2025, up more than 17 per cent through June. With 15 per cent of emissions coming from inefficient heating and cooling systems, and another 10 per cent from food transportation, Tew and Trane are in a strong position to influence how the world reacts to global warming, and how companies can prepare.

15. Stefania Di Bartolomeo

Stefania Di Bartolomeo is the founder of Physis Investment, a Boston-based asset manager with an all-woman executive team dedicated to making investing in the fight against climate change profitable and transparent.

A Harvard graduate who grew up in Italy, she became focused on sustainable finance in her early twenties after taking a call from an investor asking how her money, specifically, was making a difference.

Di Bartolomeo conceived a software portfolio package that would show investors not just how much money they were making or losing on a stock, but also how that company uses money on things like water security, energy efficiency, corporate philanthropy, or to increase the number of women in its senior management ranks.

Physis, a fintech company whose name is Greek for nature or law of nature, is dedicated to advocating the position that there are important metrics to investing in companies beyond just profit and loss. Over the last year, it became one of the first sustainable investing companies to incorporate AI into its algorithm for picking stocks in a transparent manner that would benefit the environment and be good investments.

16. Nick Mabey

As the founder of global think tank Leading E3G, (which stands for Third Generation Environmentalism), Nick Mabey has been the CEO since 2006 and has steered the company in climate policy and diplomacy to work towards transitioning to a greener future. He was also an early adopter of the idea that the climate crisis poses serious risks to national and global security, back in the 1990s.

As part of this, he launched the annual London Climate Action Week event in 2019, in partnership with the Mayor of London, which is now held every June. Since then, it’s gone on to become one of the world’s largest independent climate-focused events.

He has also authored and co-authored several books and reports, including Argument in the Greenhouse: The International Economics of Controlling Global Warming back in 1996. He was awarded an OBE in 2022, for his climate leadership and role in supporting the UK Cop26 in Glasgow, where he served as a “Friend of Cop26”, advising the UK COP presidency.

17. Yvon Chouinard

Yvon Chouinard is one of the most influential businessmen in the climate world. A rock climber, environmentalist and philanthropist, he became a billionaire after founding Patagonia, the California-based maker of outdoor recreation clothing, in 1973.

In 2022, Chouinard stunned both the environmental and corporate worlds by donating all of Patagonia’s investing stock (while keeping control of its voting stock) to a trust to ensure that future profits are used to address the climate crisis. Since then, the trust has directed more than $71m (£56m) to environmental causes, including a campaign in the last year to encourage its outdoor enthusiast customers to vote for climate candidates in local and national elections.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Chouinard was a well-known mountain and ice climber in Europe and the US, and started out making steel pitons (spikes) for climbing. In the 1970s, when he learned that the steel pitons were cracking the rock faces in Yosemite National Park, he changed the material to aluminium and, in the process, invented what is now called “clean climbing”.

18. Michael Bloomberg

Billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York and founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies, has a two-pronged approach to fighting the climate crisis – policy advocacy and financial innovation.

During his 11 years as mayor, he reduced the city’s carbon footprint by 13 per cent. Since leaving politics, he has continued to call for the phasing-out of coal power and through Bloomberg Philanthropies, created a $500m (£372m) fund dedicated to closing coal plants and transitioning to cleaner energy sources.

In January, Bloomberg said his philanthropies arm would step in to cover US funding for the United Nations’ climate budget after President Trump said he would end the country’s international climate funding and withdraw from the terms of the Paris Agreement.

19. Kathryn Murdoch

Kathryn Murdoch isn’t just funding climate action, she’s also playing a part in reshaping it and is able to push for systemic environmental change. As co-founder of the Quadrivium Foundation, along with her husband James Murdoch – son of media mogul Rupert – she backs science-backed initiatives that drive climate action, strengthen democracy, and promote ocean health. A former strategist at the Clinton Climate Initiative, Murdoch has spent over a decade pushing for better climate solutions.

She sits on the boards of the Environmental Defense Fund, Climate Central, and the Climate Leadership Council, informing high-level climate strategy. In 2023, she co-launched Futurific Studios to tell hopeful, solutions-focused stories about the planet’s future, including the PBS docuseries A Brief History of the Future, showing what a better world could actually look like.

NGOs, Non-Profits & Philanthropists

20. Jennifer Morgan

Jennifer Morgan has been a central figure in international climate policy for over two decades, contributing to the climate crisis response through activism, diplomacy, and leadership in global climate negotiations.

She became Germany’s special envoy for international climate action in 2022, the first person to hold the role, and now steers Germany’s climate policy on the world stage, where she’s working towards a faster shift to renewable energy sources.

She’s incredibly experienced in the sector and has held previous roles at some of the industry’s biggest hitters, including working at the Climate Action Network in the Nineties, leading the WWF’s Global Climate Change Program and then taking on the role of global climate change director for the think tank E3G.

She is also the former CEO of Greenpeace International. Recently, after protests at Cop29 in Baku, she spoke out about how she thinks the events are essential, as every country in the world has a seat at the table.

21. Bill Gates

Though best known for founding Microsoft and his philanthropy through the Gates Foundation, Bill Gates is pouring a significant amount of his time and wealth into tackling the climate crisis. He founded the investment firm Breakthrough Energy in 2015, which backs tech companies focused on climate solutions.

His approach to net zero is grounded in his tech world background. In an interview with Fortune he said “planting trees will not solve the climate problem” and added that “doing climate policy by brute force will not work either”.

He believes the answer is to “invest in new technologies for carbon removal, clean energy, and electric vehicles and to implement policies like carbon taxes that could fund future green technologies”. Over the past few months, Gates has tailored his climate efforts less toward investing, given the headwinds against climate action from the Trump administration, and more towards encouraging climate entrepreneurship to lay the seeds for future innovation.

In his 2021 book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, he outlined a comprehensive plan for reaching net zero emissions, emphasising the importance of global cooperation and innovation.

22. Rita Maria El Zaghloul

With just 17 per cent of the world’s land and a mere 8 per cent of its oceans under formal protection, the planet remains acutely vulnerable to biodiversity loss and ecological collapse. Rita Maria El Zaghloul is working towards changing that.

As the 2024 Earthshot prize winner in the Revive Our Oceans category, El Zaghloul is at the forefront of a global push to protect at least 30 per cent of the world’s land and oceans by 2030. She leads the High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People, an alliance focused on preserving carbon sinks, boosting ecosystem resilience, and halting destructive practices like illegal overfishing and the extraction of resources.

Under her, it has already secured support from over 120 countries, and now she’s pushing for accountability, ensuring commitments are turned into tangible action. Progress is visible though, as nearly 50 member states have begun strengthening conservation laws, like Chile’s expansion of marine protected areas to around 1.5 million square kilometres.

El Zaghloul’s work is essential for creating a coordinated defence of the planet’s remaining wild spaces, before they’re gone.

23. Alice Ruhweza

Alice Ruhweza is one of Africa’s most respected voices in sustainable development, with nearly three decades of experience working at the intersection of climate, agriculture, and economic policy. In March, she took on one of the most influential roles in African agriculture as president of AGRA (the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa), an organisation that drives climate-resilient and inclusive farming systems.

Her appointment comes at a critical time, as Africa faces the converging crises of climate shocks, food insecurity, and biodiversity loss. She previously led WWF Africa’s regional work on regenerative agrifood systems and spearheaded data-driven environmental policy as co-director of the Vital Signs Program at Conservation International.

At UNDP, she mobilised an estimated $1bn (£743m) for green projects in more than 40 African countries. Now at AGRA, Ruhweza’s focus is to champion homegrown solutions, empower smallholder farmers, and ensure Africa’s agricultural transformation is both just and ecologically sound.

24. Mithika Mwenda

Mithika Mwenda is the co-founder and executive director of the Pan-African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), a collection of more than 70 non-governmental organisations that have come together to address problems around the climate crisis.

Mwenda has worked in the climate sector for a decade and has a strong influence over climate policy. He advocates for sustainable solutions that are specifically tailored to the needs of African countries rather than those of the Western world, while also ensuring Africa’s development.

At Cop29 last year in Baku, Azerbaijan, Mwenda delivered a powerful appeal, rejecting the burden of loans on African nations and advocating instead for grant-based, equitable climate finance. He stressed the importance of justice for accessible, affordable funding for the communities who are most vulnerable to climate risk.

In 2023, the PACJA criticised the decision to appoint oil executive Sultan al-Jaber to lead Cop28, a move it called the “lowest moment” for the UN. In May last year, the PACJA hosted the UN Civil Society Conference in Kenya – the first time the event has been held there – as a precursor to the Summit of the Future at the UN in New York this month.

25. Ann Lee

Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, which reached a magnitude of 7 and tragically killed more than 220,000, Ann Lee co-founded a crisis relief organisation, Community Organized Relief Effort (Core), along with actor Sean Penn.

Lee has been the CEO since 2015, and has led the relief efforts across the world including, the Ukraine invasion, the Sudan War, Covid-19 Pandemic, Pakistan floods and Hurricane Helene.

She works on preparedness efforts with communities around the world to help them bolster against climate-driven disasters, such as watershed management, agroforestry, biodiversity protection, and soil conservation, where Lee and Penn often highlight the role human impact plays a part in the increasing disasters.

They work in disaster-prone regions like North Carolina which suffers from hurricanes and Northern California that's prone to wildfires, working alongside local communities to strengthen infrastructure and reduce vulnerability to extreme weather exacerbated by climate change. Earlier this year, Core focused its emergency response efforts on the Los Angeles wildfire.

26. Boyan Slat

Boyan Slat is a Dutch inventor and entrepreneur who founded The Ocean Cleanup in 2013 when he was just 18 years old, after he went scuba diving off the coast of Greece and noticed more plastic in the ocean than fish.

The project centers around a giant plastic tube with a thick nylon screen that can trap plastic as small as a millimeter in size but won't ensnare any sea creatures.

Slat, now aged 31, recently announced a project that plans to stop some of the plastics entering the ocean in the first place. He will deploy the technology to the rivers of around 30 cities to catch plastic as it makes its way out toward the oceans.

The Ocean Cleanup, a non-profit based in the Netherlands, announced this past spring that it has captured more than 11.5 million tonnes of plastic this year, more than all the previous years combined.

27. Mafalda Duarte

Mafalda Duarte is executive director of the Green Climate Fund, which claims to be the largest multilateral climate fund in the world, with a portfolio of $18bn (£13.3) in approved funding for projects.

Born in Portugal, Duarte has spent her career working in more than 30 developing countries on climate projects. She also managed the Climate Investment Funds, a pool of more than $8bn being put to work in more than 70 developing countries. Before that, she worked at the African Development Bank and World Bank.

She recently spoke about the potential for Brazil to play a major role in developing climate finance and is expected to be a key player at the United Nations climate summit, Cop30, in Belem, Brazil in November.

28. Inger Andersen

Inger Andersen is a Danish economist who leads the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep). Her recent achievements include leading global negotiations on plastic pollution, which have been moving ever closer towards an international, legally binding deal to tackle a burgeoning global problem, both for the environment and public health. However, negotiations have failed in the past few months to finalise a treaty. Europe wants to reduce the creation of plastic, while oil states such as Russia want to increase recycling programmes instead.

“To stop plastic pollution, we need to start at the start and end at the end,” she said at an event last year. “This means crafting an instrument that ensures we use fewer virgin materials and less problematic plastic. That we design for circularity. That we use, reuse and recycle resources more efficiently. This is the instrument we need to protect human and ecosystem health – while ensuring a just transition and space for the private sector to thrive in a new sustainable economy.”

Though there have been deadlocks, there's hope to regroup to review the treaty.

29. Juan Carlos Jintiach

Ecuadorian-born Juan Carlos Jintiach has dedicated his life to ensuring indigenous communities’ voices are heard on the frontlines of the climate movement. He is a member of the Shuar People of the Ecuadorian Amazon, and is calling for world leaders to listen to them, emphasising that the crisis stems from a broken relationship with nature and says indigenous people's knowledge is integral to the solutions.

As executive secretary of the Global Alliance of Territorial Communities (GATC), he represents 35 million people managing vast swathes of forests across 24 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. He believes Indigenous communities are the best stewards of their territories, having lived in harmony with nature for generations.

The GATC have established Shandia, which is a platform that is dedicated to supporting and directing Indigenous funds, and ensuring accurate tracking of them. He is also a technical adviser for the Coordinator of Indigenous Organisations of the Amazon Basin (COICA), a major Amazonian Indigenous federation. For his work, in 2023 he was shortlisted for the Nobel Peace Prize.

30. Dame Lisbet Rausing

As heiress to Sweden’s Tetra-Pak business, a science historian, co-founder of philanthropic foundations Arcadia and the Lund Trust, and a landowner in Scotland, Dame Lisbet Rausing has many strings to her bow. Collectively, they all play a part in her environmental work.

Dame Lisbet owns the 57,000-acre Corrour Estate in the Scottish Highlands, and since 2015 has worked on environmental projects including deer management, planting native woodlands, restoring peat bogs and reintroducing red squirrels.

The Arcadia Fund, which Dame Lisbet co-founded, has donated more than $1.3bm (£996m) to environmental causes and this year received a damehood for her philanthropic work.

Last year, Corrour Estate joined Loch Abar Mòr, a nature preservation partnership that already included the National Trust for Scotland, Glenaladale Estate, The Woodland Trust, Glen Nevis Estate and the Nevis Landscape Partnership. Together, they will restore a large part of the Lochaber area in the Highlands to make it more ecologically diverse and so more resilient to the effects of the climate crisis over the next 50 years.

31. MacKenzie Scott

An author and philanthropist, MacKenzie Scott is still perhaps best-known for who she used to be married to – Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. But since 2019, she has emerged as a major force in environmental giving.

She has given $19.2bn (£14bn) via more than 400 grants in the past five years, including almost 200 grants worth $2bn last December alone.

Scott has donated $15m to Global Fishing Watch, an independent nonprofit that creates and shares data on the ocean to increase the transparency of fisheries and help improve marine resilience. She has also donated $20m to Blue Ventures, which supports coastal communities and small-scale fishing operations.

Scott’s approach to funding is unique: her grants are “unrestricted”, which gives organisations more autonomy and helps empower grassroots groups living and working on the frontline of environmental issues.

32. Rena Lee

As Singapore’s Ambassador for Oceans and Law, Rena Lee advocates for the vital but often overlooked relationship between ocean health and climate. Her work shows ocean governance is essential to climate resilience to protect the planet’s largest, yet most neglected, climate regulator, the ocean.

Lee played a pivotal role in the landmark United Nations High Seas Treaty in 2023, the first-ever international agreement to protect biodiversity in international waters, covering nearly two-thirds of the world’s oceans. This treaty represents a major breakthrough, enabling the creation of protected marine areas beyond national jurisdictions and offering a lifeline to the ocean’s ability to regulate the climate. For her work on this, she was recognised as one of Time's 100 most influential people.

In late 2024, she spoke at the International Court of Justice, urging world leaders to take their legal duties on climate change seriously.

33. Helen Clarkson

After tackling humanitarian crises while working for Médecins Sans Frontières in countries including Sudan and Pakistan, Helen Clarkson moved her career focus to the planet’s wellbeing.

Now she's the CEO of the Climate Group, a non-profit driving businesses towards net-zero emissions, which also runs the annual Climate Week event, held every September in New York. Clarkson is responsible for taking Climate Week from its humble beginnings in 2009 as a panel discussion to the globally important, myriad of events it is now. She advocates for systemic change, pushing for ambitious climate policies and fostering collaboration between businesses and governments.

Clarkson emphasised that energy affordability and climate action must be addressed together. In 2022, she was awarded an OBE for services to environmentalism and supporting the UK’s presidency of Cop26.

Food & Agriculture

34. Doug McMaster

Claiming to be the world’s first zero waste restaurant is a lofty claim, but it’s one that owner and chef Doug McMaster can attain to as there aren’t bins in his restaurant.

Silo first opened in Brighton in 2014, and later moved to east London’s Hackney Wick. Everything in the restaurant is reused or recycled. Beyond the food, the furniture is upcycled or recycled and tables are made from recycled plastics too.

His most recent project is using koji, a traditional Japanese mould, to ferment hard-to-reuse food scraps giving them new life to produce misos and fermented sauces like shoyus and garums, which can be used as flavour enhancers for dishes in the restaurant.

McMaster’s work is not just about food, it’s about creating a scalable solution to hospitality’s food waste and he’s a pioneer in how waste can be drastically limited and reused within the industry.

35. Chantelle Nicholson

One of just 36 UK chefs awarded a Green Michelin Star, Chantelle Nicholson is a leader in regenerative practices in the food world. At her Mayfair restaurant Apricity, her regenerative ethos runs through everything, as Nicholson believes in going beyond simply “sustaining” to actively regenerating.

She’s a powerhouse for championing seasonal and local produce, innovatively minimising food waste and excess packaging, and avoiding unnecessary energy use, down to details like using rechargeable candles instead of single use and switching off unused fridges, preventing energy waste, which is rife in busy working kitchens.

This year Nicholson is expanding her vision and branching out from London with a new project, Fjora a restaurant in the 1 Hotel in Copenhagen. It follows her regenerative ethos with a Nordic-inspired menu that’s deeply rooted in her connection to nature.

36. Caroline Bennett

After struggling to source sustainable and ethically caught fish for her sushi restaurant, Moshi Moshi in London’s Liverpool Street station, Caroline Bennett took a leap of faith, and did it herself.

Setting up Sole of Discretion in 2016, an ethical online fishmonger, she connected the dots between fishers in Plymouth harbour with not only her London restaurant, but also people at home who could buy quality British fish, knowing exactly where it came from. Supporting small-scale, low-impact fisheries, she works with small day boats that don’t have the same damaging impact on the ocean as industrial boats do. Each fish is traceable, labelled with information on where it was caught, the method, the name of the skipper and the boat, as for too long, all of this information was lost at port.

This year, she’s working with Scottish charity, Open Seas, on its #DivedNotDredged Campaign, which is amplifying the intense desolation dredgers cause to the ocean bed, which can take up to 10 years to recover after just one dredge. Instead it champions the far less impactful hand-dived scallops. It also reflects the important message of Sir David Attenborough’s seismic documentary Ocean, which focuses on this very issue.

37. Andy Cato

Andy Cato, former electronic musician and half of Groove Armada, made an unexpected shift from music to farming almost two decades ago. After selling his music rights, he bought a farm in France and became deeply invested in soil health, biodiversity, and access to better food systems. This led him to become a voice for regenerative agriculture, where he advocates for the importance of farming regeneratively, looking after soil and water health, and food security.

Cato brought this message to a mainstream audience through a guest appearance on Clarkson’s Farm, where he successfully encouraged Jeremy Clarkson to trial regenerative practices, which he’s continued.

In 2018, Cato co-founded Wildfarmed with former broadcaster George Lamb and finance expert Edd Lees. The company now works with over 150 farms across the UK and France, all adhering to a set of agreed regenerative methods Wildfarmed laid out, including maintaining crop cover, integrating livestock, and avoiding synthetic pesticides.

Wildfarmed produces flour and bread for both wholesale and consumers, aiming to make regenerative food systems affordable and accessible to all, and so is available in supermarkets. Their work blends innovation, ecological responsibility, and social equity in the quest for a healthier food future.

38. Dr Mariangela Hungria

Dr Mariangela Hungria, a Brazilian agronomist and microbiologist, was named the 2025 World Food Prize Laureate, an honour often referred to as the Nobel Prize for Agriculture. The award recognises her four decades of pioneering research into biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) as a sustainable alternative to synthetic nitrogen fertilisers.

Working with Brazil’s Embrapa (Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation), Dr Hungria has developed innovative microbial inoculants that enable crops, particularly soybeans, beans, and other legumes, to naturally absorb nitrogen from the atmosphere. Her work has transformed tropical agriculture, improving soil health, reducing input costs, and minimising environmental damage.

Today, her BNF methods are applied to more than 40 million hectares of Brazilian farmland, saving farmers up to $40bn (£30bn) annually and avoiding more than 180 million metric tons of CO2 emissions each year. Her research also supports global climate goals by reducing dependence on fossil fuel-derived fertilisers and increasing long-term agricultural resilience.

39. Vandana Shiva

A former physicist, Dr Vandana Shiva became an activist in the 1970s and has gone on to focus her work on protecting seeds and food sovereignty, which she’s regarded as the leading voice on. She famously campaigned against laws that would prevent farmers saving, sharing, or replanting seeds, which would give big corporations ownership of seeds and destroy traditional farming. To protect them, she set up more than 150 seed banks in India.

In her work, she also advocates for ecology, environmentalism and eco-feminism – a branch of the movement that combines feminism with political ecology. A key part of that is the “invisible” work women do that goes unnoticed, but is key to protecting the environment, such as water collection.

She believes an intersectional approach is key to climate adaptation and justice, which she sees as a biodiverse women and community-led approach to agriculture, especially in more climate-vulnerable regions. To promote this, she set up her own NGO, Navdanya.

40. Nidhi Pant

Combating food waste, rural poverty and gender inequality – three of the Indian farming community’s biggest issues – is S4S Technologies, which was co-founded in 2013 by Nidhi Pant and six university friends.

It creates pioneering solar-powered dehydrators, which are used to prevent food waste. By drying food out without using electricity, it enables rural smallholder farmers to financially benefit from being able to sell their entire crop. Previously around 30 per cent could be lost due to bad weather, being misshapen or market price fluctuations. It’s a life-changing move for rural farmers living in poverty.

Since it began, S4S Technologies has helped provide sustainable incomes for around 300,000 rural farming women across 400 villages, vastly improving gender inequality in the process. Pant was awarded the Earthshot Prize in 2023 by Prince William. The team has prevented 60,000 tonnes of food waste and averted 300,000 tonnes of C02 emissions.

41. Sean Sherman

Chef Sean Sherman, a member of the Oglala Lakota Sioux tribe, wanted to preserve his own heritage, so he founded The Sioux Chef, which promotes food sovereignty and educates others on Indigenous cultures and the importance of their environmental stewardship.

His ethos is to source local, wild and heirloom ingredients and follow the sustainable practices that Indigenous communities have used for generations.

This November, he’ll be publishing his latest cookbook, Turtle Island, which is the Indigenous name for North America. He’s also working on a new hub for indigenous food culture, Wóyute Thipi (meaning ‘food building’ in the Dakota language), which is set to open in Minneapolis later this year.

In 2021 Sherman and restaurateur Dana Thompson founded the restaurant Owamni (which translates to the place of falling, swirling water) in Minneapolis. The following year, it won the James Beard Award for Best New Restaurant. It’s mostly staffed by Indigenous people and serves Indigenous dishes without ingredients introduced by Europeans, such as butter and sugar. Since 2023, it has been run as a non-profit. For his work, Sherman won the prestigious Julia Child Award in 2023.

Activists

42. Pua Lay Peng

Nicknamed the Erin Brockovich of Malaysia, former chemist Pua Lay Peng became an activist after realising her community in Jenjarom, in the state of Selangor, was suffering from the devastating effects of the increased amount of plastic being illegally dumped there.

The crisis escalated after China banned plastic waste imports in 2018. Illegal plastic recycling factories opened, emitted toxic fumes with an acrid smell in the air, polluted waterways, and left residents suffering from respiratory issues and fatigue.

To combat it, she co-founded the Kuala Langat Environmental group (Persatuan Tindakan Alam Sekitar Kuala). Peng has rallied everyone in the community to push for action from local authorities, and has even faced death threats for it.

She’s been successful in shutting down more than 300 illegal recycling factories by visiting sites, filming it and posting it to YouTube, but more are beginning to reappear again. They’ve improved both the air and water quality and empowered communities to succeed in regional action, not only in her community but across the country too.

43. Ayisha Siddiqa

At just 26 years old, Ayisha Siddiqa has achieved a lot as a climate justice and human rights advocate. She campaigns for Indigenous people’s rights and the rights of women, who she recognises are disproportionately affected by floods and other devastation caused by the climate crisis.

Born in Pakistan, she moved to Brooklyn as a child, and believes solutions to the crisis are too often developed from a global North perspective, which doesn’t work for many of the countries worst affected.

At just 14, she saw the effects of climate change not only on the environment, but also on humans, after family members in Pakistan became ill from polluted river water. This led her to get involved in climate activism, and she went on to found her university’s branch of Extinction Rebellion in 2019 and lead a strike involving 300,000 people. In 2020 she co-founded Polluters Out, a global youth movement, and helped create an activist training course, the Fossil Free University.

She is also a climate advisor to the UN secretary general and UN youth envoy. This year she’s studying law at UCLA in Los Angeles, where she’s gearing up to tackle the climate crisis not just in the streets, but in the courtroom, to push for systemic change.

44. Bill McKibben

Author, environmentalist and activist Bill McKibben has been a key climate protest organiser for decades and has made many contributions to the fight, including being awarded the Gandhi Peace Award in 2013. In 1989, he wrote The End of Nature, which is widely recognised as the first book for a general audience about climate change and is still in print in 24 languages.

This year, his key driving message is that solar energy is the path to a greener future, and is pushing for the clean energy source to be more widely adopted. He has organised the inaugural Sun Day, a national day calling for action, on 21 September, chosen as it’s one of two solar equinox days. It’s also the subject of his new book, Here Comes the Sun: A Last Chance for the Climate and a Fresh Chance for Civilization, published this month.

He co-founded the global grassroots organisation 350.org in 2008, which aims to end our reliance on fossil fuels. The name is an ode to climate scientist James Hansen, who warned that any atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide above 350 parts per million (ppm) was unsafe. Currently, the planet’s concentration is over 420ppm. In 2021, he founded Third Act, an activist group for older environmentalists, with the support of big names including Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and Jane Fonda.

45. Greta Thunberg

Aged just 22, Greta Thunberg has dedicated her life to the climate crisis and already achieved what other activists have struggled to do by bringing the severity and urgency of the climate crisis into homes across the world. So impactful has she been, it’s been dubbed the “Greta effect”.

To reduce her carbon footprint, she became vegan and refused to travel by aeroplane, aged just eight. In 2018, Thunberg inspired a global movement after holding her first school climate strike outside the Swedish parliament, which called for the end of reliance on fossil fuels. She was just 15 and inspired thousands of students around the world to join her Fridays for Future strikes.

Since then, she’s consistently called out world leaders in her sharp speeches for their inaction on climate change, including last November when she protested Cop29 being held in Baku, Azerbaijan, saying the authoritarian petrostate was given a chance to greenwash its human rights abuses.

Thunberg was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize every year between 2019 and 2023. In 2019, she became the youngest person to be named Time magazine’s Person of the Year. In 2022, she published The Climate Book, a “book of the year” for many top publications. She has also inspired others with Asperger’s (which she calls her superpower) to feel included and take a stand.

Since finishing her schooling in 2023, Thunberg ramped up her activism, including in the past year in support of Gaza. Last year, she was acquitted of charges of blocking an oil conference. After the verdict, she said: “We must remember who the real enemy is.”

46. Nemonte Nenquimo

She is the first woman president of the Waorani people of Pastaza and co-founder of the Indigenous-led, non-profit organisation, Ceibo Alliance, which is the first of its kind between four ancestral nations within Ecuador, Peru and Colombia.

She won a case against the Ecuadorian government in 2019, protecting half a million acres of Waorani ancestral land in the Amazon rainforest from oil drilling. It set a landmark legal precedent to protect a further seven million acres from planned oil auctions. But now, it’s under threat once again.

She told The Independent last year: “I’ve often thought that it must be easy to destroy what you don’t understand,"" which is why she co-wrote her debut book last year, We Will Not Be Saved, with her husband Mitch Anderson. The memoir is one of hope and resistance and was well reviewed by critics.

She was the first Indigenous woman to be included on the Time 100 list, and she was one of six environmental leaders to be awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize. In 2020, the United Nations Environment Programme awarded her its Champions of the Earth award in the category Inspiration and Action.

47. Neeshad Shafi

Qatar regularly experiences some of the world’s highest temperatures, which regularly hit 44C, but can reach as high as an unbearable 50C.

As co-founder of the Arab Youth Climate Movement Qatar (AYCM), Neeshad Shafi has created a first-of-its-kind study on public perceptions of climate change in his home country, as he says “global warming” is over and the period of “global boiling” has begun.

Through his work, Shafi attempts to change the minds of the proportion of people in Qatar who don’t believe in the climate crisis, by showing them how the effects will impact them. One of the biggest battles Shafi has faced is some people’s belief that they can’t do anything to help change the situation, and countering that view is a major focus for him. In June this year, he was involved in the Doha Climate Talks, which focused on demanding action to address the crisis.

48. Julia Olson

Julia Olson is the founder and executive director of Our Children’s Trust, a not-for-profit law firm which empowers young people to hold governments accountable for their climate inaction.

It has won several landmark cases against state and local governments over the right to a healthy environment, including high-profile cases suing the US government for prioritising fossil fuels over ensuring a safe climate for future generations. Cases have been won across Montana, Colombia, Germany, and South Korea.

Last year, the US Supreme Court rejected a petition to review a constitutional climate lawsuit against the US government after a lower court rejected it. Attorneys in the case of Juliana vs United States vowed to fight on in other legal avenues.

Olson, an attorney, founded the trust in 2010 while pregnant with her second child and after watching Al Gore’s climate documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, where it dawned on her that future generations could be left with a near-devastated world without drastic action.

49. Wawa Gatheru

Kenyan-American climate activist Wawa Gatheru is the founder of Black Girl Environmentalist, which supports women of colour and gender expansive people. Its aim is to create a representative and inclusive climate movement, and to champion Black women as the leaders they already are. It is now one of the biggest Black youth-led climate organisations in the US, making her a powerful voice for underrepresented communities.

Last year, she spoke at The Independent’s inaugural Climate 100 event and told the audience, “There’s no such thing as a perfect environmentalist,” hitting back at the idea that people who care about the climate crisis must be perfectionists.

She was aware of the climate crisis while growing up, but came to the realisation that those most affected by it – people of colour – were generally not the same people making the decisions. She saw that the narrative for people of colour was more likely to be “victim” than “problem solver”, and also recognised that women had even less of a voice. Instead, she works to ensure Black voices are also at the centre of the climate movement too.

50. Desmond Alugnoa

Climate activist and co-founder of the Green Africa Youth Organization (GAYO), a Ghana-based NGO, is Desmond Alugnoa, who is tackling waste, air pollution, and environmental injustice. In 2024, GAYO won the Earthshot Prize in the “clean our air” category for its Zero Waste Model, an innovative community-based system that reduces landfill use, stops open waste burning, and creates dignified green jobs for waste workers.

The organisation’s work not only improves public health and air quality but also helps build local, circular economies and climate-resilient communities.

The Earthshot recognition came with £1m in funding to scale the project, and Alugnoa is aiming to reduce air pollution by up to 70 per cent and divert thousands of tonnes of waste by 2030.

51. Raoni Metuktire

Spending his lifetime protecting the Amazon, the chief of Brazil’s Kayapo tribe, Raoni Metuktire is now 93 years old, and hasn’t slowed down yet. One of Brazil’s most influential people, he’s often referred to as the most effective protector of the Amazon, yet growing up following a nomadic lifestyle in the Amazon, he didn’t encounter the outside world until age 22.

Even a decade ago, as reported by The Independent, Metuktire said the developed world was intent on “destroying everything” and urged its citizens to fundamentally change the way they think. At last year's New York Climate Week, he called on global leaders to reflect on their responsibilities to help end extractive and illegal mining and logging, which are making way for increasing droughts and wildfires.

He became famous after campaigning with pop star Sting (also in this list) and his wife Trudie Styler in the late 1980s, to prevent hydroelectric dams being built on the Xingu River, a major tributary of the Amazon.

His memoir, Memórias do Cacique (The Chief’s Memoirs) was published in July, where he claimed Brazil's previous right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro, wanted to exterminate the country’s Indigenous people. This year, he met with Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and warned him of the devastating effects of oil drilling. Here, Metuktire was also awarded the Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit, Brazil’s highest civilian honour, recognising his lifetime of defending the environment and Indigenous rights.

Entertainment, Royalty & Sport

52. Billie Eilish

Multi-award-winning singer-songwriter Billie Eilish is the epitome of a Gen Z’er using their platform (she has a whopping 125 million followers on Instagram alone) to spread their message.

As a vegan since the age of 12, she ensures that only vegan food is sold at her gigs, though this has been controversial lately for some fans. She also asks the venues to encourage fans to come with reusable water bottles and makes sure there are refill stations to avoid plastic waste.

She ran her own climate event, OVERHEATED, in both London and Berlin this year, and will be debuting in the US soon. It’s based on the 2022 documentary she released of the same name, and brings together activists, musicians and designers discussing the biggest issues surrounding the climate crisis and calling on people to take action.

At her concerts, she also has “Eco Villages”, which is described as a hub to raise awareness of the climate crisis, and inspires fans to connect with environmental groups, learn more about a plant-based diet and to understand the detrimental effects of fast fashion.

53. Don Cheadle

Actor and Goodwill United Nations Ambassador Don Cheadle has previously asked, “What is more important than food and clean air?” Such a simple sentence, which gets to the crux of what we’re fighting for, serves as a simple reminder of the key issues at stake.

He was one of the founders of the humanitarian Not On Our Watch Project in 2008, which has since merged with The Sentry organisation, involving other celebrities including George Clooney and Matt Damon. The organisation urges leaders to protect vulnerable, marginalised and displaced communities, such as those in Darfur in Sudan. For this work, he and Clooney were awarded the Summit Peace Award.

Cheadle also worked with actor Harrison Ford to create Years of Living Dangerously, a documentary TV series tackling climate issues.

He’s a member of the board of directors for the Solutions Project (co-founded by actor Mark Ruffalo, also in this list), which has supported more than 300 community organisations fighting for climate justice in 45 states, and highlights racial and gender inequities.

Last September, as part of the Our Kids’ Climate initiative, Cheadle combined his parental role with his climate action work, urging the importance of protecting the planet for future generations. He signed an open letter along with more than 150 other parents including actors Emma Thompson and Julianne Moore.

54. Jessie Diggins

As a board member of POW, (Protect Our Winters), one of the world’s largest climate advocacy groups, American cross-country skier Jessie Diggins vocalises how increasingly warming winters are changing not only winter sports, but also the lives of the communities who live on and around the snow and have a reliance on it.

As a two-time cross-country World Cup champion who has been competing for 15 years, she says she’s seen winters change dramatically and speaks about the severity of winter environments disappearing before our eyes. In an interview last November, she said: “I will not shut up and ski,” highlighting the importance of the voices of people who see climate issues first hand too.

Ahead of the Nordic World Championships in Trondheim in February, Diggins and her teammates debuted race suits featuring images of melting glaciers, an impactful visual no one could ignore. She also endorsed the ban on PFAS chemicals in ski wax on the World Cup circuit, marking a major step toward reducing the environmental footprint of snow sports.

55. Jane Fonda

Activism has long been an important part of life for Jane Fonda. Many years since her days of anti-Vietnam war campaigning in the 1960s, the 87-year-old Oscar-winning actor now channels her energy into climate activism.

Earlier this year, Fonda became involved in the conservation of the Amazon rainforest, aligning with Amazon Frontlines and the Ceibo Alliance, an Indigenous-led coalition representing multiple tribes (also featured in this list under Nemonte Nenquimo’s entry), to protect their ancestral lands. The aim is to convince Ecuador’s Constitutional Court to enshrine the rights of Indigenous people, which allows them to decide what happens in their home, and means they must be informed before any action is taken. It follows Ecuador’s president Daniel Noboa’s plans to auction off more than 8 million acres of Amazonian Indigenous lands to oil companies.

Fonda has been arrested five times for civil disobedience while marching and protesting in recent years. In 2019 alongside Greenpeace, she launched Fire Drill Fridays, a series of weekly protests in Washington DC to urge political leaders to take stronger action on climate change. These protests, inspired by Greta Thunberg, galvanised public support and then became educational virtual events that educated people about climate justice, sustainability, and environmental policy, until it ended last year.

She also founded the Jane Fonda Climate Political Action Committee in 2022, which raises money to defeat the fossil fuel industry’s influence on US politics and elect climate champions across government.

56. Lewis Pugh

British-South African former maritime lawyer Lewis Pugh is an endurance swimmer and prominent speaker on the effects of the climate crisis on our rivers and oceans. He completes long-distance swims in some of the planet’s most vulnerable and challenging waters – including the Arctic and Antarctic – to highlight the importance of marine conservation.

In May, he took on a 62-mile swim in 8C waters around Martha’s Vineyard, an island off the coast of Cape Cod. It’s known as the filming location for Jaws, which turned 50 this year, and was tied into his event’s aim to raise awareness for the critical need for shark conservation, and to change the public’s perception of them as vicious, cold-blooded killers. He was the first person ever to achieve this.

In 2023, he swam all 315 miles of the Hudson River and wrote an opinion piece about it for The Independent to highlight the importance of clean rivers. He also became the first person to swim the full length of the River Thames in 2006. The previous year, he swam 100 miles across the Red Sea to underline the impact of climate change on fragile coral reefs. He is a United Nations Patron of the Oceans, and part of the 30x30 campaign, which aims to protect 30 per cent of the world’s oceans by 2030. His work, and epic swims, are inspiring global efforts to safeguard marine ecosystems.

57. Mark Ruffalo

The anti-fracking movement’s most famous face, actor Mark Ruffalo has been an environmentalist for years, and uses the term “fractivists” to describe this particular branch of activism.

In 2016 he, Colin Firth and the late Vivienne Westwood wrote an open letter to then prime minister David Cameron to oppose fracking. In 2013, he co-founded The Solutions Project, an organisation committed to promoting 100 per cent renewable energy. In February 2024, Ruffalo worked with politicians to ban a new type of fracking, which swaps the use of water for pressurised carbon dioxide to get at methane trapped in shale. Fracking companies say this is a carbon-neutral fuel operation, but “fractivists” disagree.

Last October, he urged people to sign a petition to prevent the Irish Green Party from passing a “bill to fast track building liquid natural gas terminals that would import fracked gas from the United States”, he said in a video he posted to his Instagram. He’s also joining fellow members of SAG-AFTRA (Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) in calling for their pension fund to divest more than an estimated $100m (£74m) from fossil fuel stocks, and instead reinvest in green funds.

58. Sting

A British singer and an Amazonian tribal chief may seem unlikely friends, but environmentalism brought Sting and Chief Raoni Metuktire (also included in this list) of the Brazilian Kayapo tribe together.

After Metuktire asked for Sting’s help in protecting their Indigenous land and people, he and Sting, along with his wife Trudie Styler, founded the Rainforest Foundation Fund, a charity dedicated to raising awareness of deforestation and the rights of Indigenous people. For nearly four decades, the fund has donated to projects that have saved 28 million acres in 20 different rainforest countries.

More recently, in January, Sting performed at FireAid in LA, the concert held to raise money for those affected, following the devastating wildfires that burned through the area, destroying more than 22,000 homes and 40,000 acres. The set included a rendition of the repurposed song, Message in a Bottle – a powerful call for action on climate change. The newer version was aimed at world leaders attending Cop26 that year in Glasgow, urging them to “do something now” for the planet.

59. King Charles III and Prince William

Since he was a young man, King Charles III has been a green champion, long before sustainability became the buzzword it is today. It’s a trait that appears to have been passed down to his son and heir, Prince William, who has picked up the baton and launched his own initiative to tackle the climate crisis.

The king was head of the Duchy Estate for seven decades (a role now passed to Prince William), and he has been a tireless champion of organic food and agriculture.

For his unwavering focus on green issues, Tony Juniper, chair of Natural England and former director of Friends of the Earth, praised the king as “possibly the most significant environmentalist in history”. It is something that he has continued since ascending to the throne, installing the first solar panels on Windsor Castle and using biofuel in royal cars as he strives to reach net zero within the palace walls.

Prince William, who has followed in the footsteps of his environmentalist father and philanthropist mother, used his speech at the celebrations for the Queen’s platinum jubilee in 2022 to talk about the crisis. Although we have “increased our awareness of the impact humans have on our world, our planet has become more fragile”, he said, adding “the pressing need to protect and restore our planet has never been more urgent”.

This year, he supported Dartmoor peatland restoration and the planting of hundreds of saplings in Wistman’s Wood there too. He also launched a documentary series, Guardians, spotlighting wildlife rangers working in perilous conditions across habitats like the Amazon, Himalayas, and Africa.

His flagship initiative is the Earthshot Prize, launched five years ago. It supports young innovators from around the world in their ambitious attempts to solve our biggest environmental problems, from ocean pollution to poor air quality, by awarding five winners with £1m each.

60. Arnold Schwarzenegger

The former bodybuilding champion, movie star and politician, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has long been a proponent of fighting the climate crisis, which he said is an ineffective term that should instead be called just pollution.

He formed the Schwarzenegger Climate Initiative in 2017 to “terminate pollution” and has been actively campaigning for smart solutions to mitigate climate change and for less political rhetoric.

Speaking in June at the Austrian World Summit, which he helps organise each year and is a key event in the climate calendar, Schwarzenegger challenged world leaders and climate advocates to “stop whining” and to focus on doing something in terms of workable solutions to help battle global warming.

During his time as governor of California two decades ago, Schwarzenegger was one of the first politicians to advocate transitioning to clean energy and finding ways to cut harmful carbon in places such as San Diego.

Politics & Government

61. Mark Carney

As prime minister of Canada, Mark Carney faces a climate challenge far bigger than in any of his previous roles, which included governor of the Bank of England and before that, governor of the Bank of Canada.

A long-time advocate for using the financial industry to help fight global warming by leading a transition to renewable energy, Carney was a mainstay on the global environmental conference circuit.

Since he was elected prime minister, Carney now runs one of the largest oil producing nations. He must balance his enthusiasm for a green energy transition in Canada and around the world with the energy politics in his country.

Carney scrapped an unpopular consumer carbon tax soon after being elected. He is considering imposing a carbon border tax to impose on importing countries with weaker environmental rules but so far that is still being studied.

62. Ed Miliband

As the former leader of the Labour Party, Ed Miliband's commitment to finding solutions to the climate crisis has run deep through his career. As the secretary of state for energy security and net zero, the role is similar to the one he held 15 years ago when Labour was last in government, where he played a pivotal role in shaping the UK’s Climate Change Act in 2008.

Shortly after he was re-appointed to the role following Labour's win last year, Miliband lifted the offshore wind ban and increased the renewable energy budget to a record figure of more than £1.5bn.

More recently, he's brought in the Great British Energy Act, which became law in May and aims to speed up the UK’s shift to renewable energy. He also delivered the first of what he plans to be an annual speech on Climate Crisis and Nature Decline, where he stated the two crises are inseparable. In the speech, he warned: “We must act on the climate and nature crisis to protect our British way of life, because no sector or part of our society is immune from those risks.”

63. Claudia Sheinbaum

Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, is a climate scientist with a strong background in renewable energy projects. She has contributed to the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and as mayor of Mexico City she worked to put solar panels in public places and electrify the city's transportation system.

Her presidential campaign included a commitment to invest more than $13bn (£10.4bn) in clean energy by 2030, but now that she is president she faces challenges in weighing her climate-fighting desires against the importance of Mexico's oil-producing legacy. In particular, she must tread lightly in her handling of Pemex, the state-owned energy company, which is a national leader in fossil fuel production.

Sheinbaum has also been a force behind designing a 30-year water plan for the country, to help manage water supply for its vital agricultural industry.

64. Sir Sadiq Khan

London mayor Sir Sadiq Khan, who is now in his third term, was the first mayor to be knighted in the New Year's List 2025. Throughout his tenure, he’s put the climate crisis at the forefront and has made significant strides in reducing the city’s carbon footprint. He's focused on tackling air pollution with Ulez (Ultra Low Emission Zone) and 20mph areas, and has just announced that one of the city's busiest shopping areas, Oxford Street, will become pedestrianised.

This year, he's opposed London Heathrow's proposed third runway, citing pollution concerns and the impact it could have on Britain's climate targets. He's also launched a £12m Green Roots Fund to support community-led projects that enhance parks, wetlands and rivers, improving urban biodiversity.

In an opinion piece for The Independent’s Climate 100 series last year, he called London’s air pollution the “gravest environmental threat to human health… with our poorest citizens and minority ethnic communities suffering the worst effects”.

Under new Ulez rules, roadside nitrogen dioxide levels have been halved since 2016, pollution has been cut by over 20 per cent in outer London, and the capital’s “air quality is improving at a faster rate than the rest of England’s average,” he says.

65. Mary Robinson

After serving as Ireland’s first female president, Mary Robinson, a lifelong champion of human rights, has established her own climate group, Project Dandelion, which pushes for women to be prioritised within the climate crisis response. The group launched a short film, We Are Dandelions, which premiered at the virtual Unite for Climate Solutions: A Women-Led Summit event, ahead of Cop28.

As well as advocating for women, she also emphasises the need for inclusive solutions that properly serve the needs of marginalised communities. For her work, she has become one of the most highly respected people in the climate conversation.

In her humanitarian work, she has been vocal in speaking out against Israel's aid block and has been to the Rafah Crossing as a member of The Elders, (which was founded by the late Nelson Mandela in 2007). The group is made up of a group of global leaders working together for peace, justice, human rights and a sustainable planet, which she is the chair of.

In an interview with The Independent in 2023, she explained that she thinks the US, which is responsible for the largest share of historic greenhouse gas emissions, could do more in the fight against the climate crisis.

66. Lord Deben (John Gummer)

The Tory peer John Gummer, has been a steadfast advocate for environmentalism for decades. He served as Conservative Party chairman under Margaret Thatcher and as environment secretary in John Major’s government. More recently he was chair of the UK’s Climate Change Committee (CCC) between 2012 and 2023. In this role he played a crucial part in shaping the nation’s climate policies and guiding the UK towards its goal of net zero emissions by 2050.

Despite the CCC being the government’s own watchdog on climate, Lord Deben has spoken out about worries the previous government would not meet its climate targets. In June 2023, he said it had been “too slow to act”.

This year, though he supports increasing the UK’s onshore renewable efforts, he has spoken out against Lionlink energy cables going through the countryside. Instead, he says, cables should be taken under the sea, which he argues has the least impact on biodiversity, and brought onshore to brownfield sites.

For The Independent’s Climate 100 series last year, he wrote that, despite the crisis surging on, it is still within our collective power to mitigate its effects.

67. Marina Silva

Earlier this year, the Brazilian environment minister Marina Silva, warned that we’re already at the limit of liveable climate.

As a native Amazonian from a rubber-tapping family, Silva is serving as environment minister for the second time, having also held the role from 2003 to 2008. Back then, she implemented policies that significantly reduced deforestation rates, and she is continuing that work now, as well as being a staunch defender of Indigenous rights and biodiversity.

Silva is regarded as one of the most influential ministers in Brazil thanks to her work to rebuild the country’s capacity to halt rampant illegal deforestation in the Amazon. She believes protecting the Amazon rainforest, almost two thirds of which is in Brazil, is key to staving off the worst effects of the climate crisis.

In July, however, this came under threat following what has become known as the “devastation bill”, signed by President Lula, which stripped powers from Silva’s ministry. It allows companies to self-license for big construction projects such as building new roads, which will have devastating effects on the environment.

Silva has described the passing of this bill as a “death blow”, saying it threatens the country’s pledge to eliminate deforestation by 2030.

68. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva

As president of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, known as Lula, is arguably on the hottest climate change seat in the world this year.

Brazil plays host in November to the annual United National climate summit, this year dubbed Cop30, and Lula’s government has promised to host the tens of thousands of expected delegates in Belem, a small city on the Amazon Basin.

Lula and his team want to spotlight the damage being done to the Amazon – generally acknowledged to be the world’s largest natural carbon sink, for the ability of its trees and jungle to suck harmful carbon out of the atmosphere – by fossil fuel interests and cattle ranching.

The logistical challenge of bringing so many people to Belem and finding rooms is just one of the headaches Lula must deal with as he seeks to keep his country on track to fight global warming after four disastrous years of pollution and land clearing by his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro.

How Lula performs this year and in coming years will largely cement his legacy as either a climate advocate or a politician who was unable to control the vast oil and cattle interests that dominate his country.

69. Mia Mottley

Mia Mottley is a woman of many firsts, including, in 2018, becoming the first female prime minister of Barbados, and also the first prime minister to serve after Barbados became a republic in November 2021. The following year, she announced her landmark Bridgetown Initiative, which proposes to entirely reform how global debt works.

The plan calls for wealthier nations to contribute far more financially to the global climate fight, as poorer nations are bearing the physical and financial brunt of the crisis despite having contributed the least to it. It’s her central call, and one she spoke about at Cop29 in Baku last year, emphasising the need for global financial architecture reforms as the planet was “hurtling towards catastrophe” with increasing extreme weather events.

After floods, hurricanes or droughts, poorer nations struggle to financially rebuild due to their high debt. This can be as much as 12-14 per cent in poorer nations, compared to 1-4 per cent for wealthier countries. Mottley argues that if these high repayment interest rates are not paused or even cancelled – as was done for some countries after the Second World War – then they could be a death sentence for countries like hers.

Last December, Barbados benefitted from its first “debt for climate resilience swap”, meaning it replaced expensive debt with more affordable financing, generating $125m (£93m) in savings, which has been turned into a water and sewage project to help mitigate the effects of climate change.

70. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

A rising Democrat star and congressional representative from New York, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez quickly established herself as a lightning rod for climate change criticism after she was first elected in 2018 at the age of 29.

Also known as AOC, she was a co-sponsor of a bill called the Green New Deal, which called for a series of initiatives to combat global warming and housing inequality to support a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.

The Green New Deal became an attacking point of President Trump in his first term and remains so to this day, even though it has largely been put aside by Democrats. AOC, now a seasoned insider on Capitol Hill, is still is a leading spokesperson for environmental efforts and has positioned herself as one of the greatest critics of Trump’s policies to attack renewable energy in his second term.

She also continues to search for ways to incorporate parts of the Green New Deal into other legislation or programs to help mitigate the worst effects of global warming, both in New York and around the country.

71. Kathy Hochul

Kathy Hochul is governor of the state of New York and from the beginning of her leadership she has fought climate change, making herself a prominent target of President Trump’s efforts to thwart climate control.

In December, Hochul signed a Climate Superfund Act that requires fossil fuel companies to help finance climate adaptation projects in New York, particularly around low-carbon infrastructure. She has led state investments of more than $1bn (£743) in renewable energy projects and campaigned for social justice tied to environmental practices.

Her most controversial act was to implement traffic congestion pricing in New York City in January to slash traffic into Manhattan and lower carbon emissions, following a lead from London and other cities. President Trump has ordered her to reverse the order and threatened to withhold federal funding from New York state if she does not.

By May, the city reported more than $200m in new revenue from the pricing plan, which is set to be used to update and replace its aging public transportation system.

72. Ursula von der Leyen

As President of the European Commission in Brussels, Ursula von der Leyen has made climate change a central focus of her efforts since she was first elected in 2019.

Working toward a European Green Deal with other like-minded members of the EU, she pushed through policies and legislation designed to reduce harmful carbon emissions on the continent by 90 per cent by 2040 and completely by 2050, which would make Europe the first carbon-neutral continent.

But since last year’s EU elections, when a wave of right-wing members were elected as part of a backlash against rising energy prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, von der Leyen has faced rising challenges implementing green policies.

In June, she was forced to cut out large parts of the European Green Deal in order to push it through, which will affect most of her ambitious timelines.

73. Pope Leo XIV

Since Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost became Pope Leo XIV in May, he has quickly adopted climate change and the environment as one of his major focuses, as did his predecessor, Pope Francis, who was known as the “climate pope”.

Leo has actively addressed the destruction of the environment and in particular its effects on the poor. He has celebrated “green masses” to emphasise the Church’s responsibility to the Earth, and is even attempting to build a solar farm in the Vatican.

Shortly after becoming Pope, he celebrated the 10th anniversary of Francis’s Laudato si’, a 184-page letter to bishops that tied climate change to the Church’s social mission and condemned the destruction of the environment for financial gain, asking for a “relationship of reciprocity” with the environment.

74. Eric Garcetti

As mayor of Los Angeles from 2013 to 2022, Eric Garcetti fought to make the city a global leader in mitigating climate change, committing to carbon neutrality by 2050 and establishing preventative measures to fight California’s growing trend of destructive wildfires.

In June, Garcetti was named ambassador for global climate diplomacy for the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. His new role will help him represent other cities and mayors in global climate leadership talks, particularly those arranged by the United Nations.

The leadership of cities has become a battleground in the fight against global warming as federal policies in the US and regional policies in the EU have shifted against green transition plans after a pushback over rising energy prices.

Climate advocates are focusing their attention on how each individual city can fight to protect itself and limit its carbon output despite the broader attack on climate policies. Garcetti will be a key figure at Cop30 this November in Belem, Brazil.

75. António Guterres

Under the leadership of Secretary General António Guterres, the United Nations has intensified efforts to push for ambitious climate action, urging countries to meet and exceed the goals of 2015’s legally binding Paris Agreement, which was enforced the following year.

Guterres frames the climate crisis as the defining issue of our time, and has championed the need to transition to renewable energy, reduce carbon emissions and protect vulnerable communities.

He continues to push for global net zero by 2050, though he now thinks richer nations should aim for 2040, and calls for greater international cooperation to address biodiversity loss and environmental degradation. His advocacy often runs into conflict with governments – such as in the US this year – that are hostile toward investing in climate mitigation or providing money to nations hit hard by global pollution.

Guterres faces a defining moment this November when the UN hosts its 30th annual climate summit, Cop30, in Brazil, whose portion of the Amazon Basin is threatened by logging and agriculture interests. Climate scientists say loss of the Amazon, one of the world's largest carbon sinks, would be devastating throughout the region. Guterres will deliver his message to delegates from countries that have moved decidedly away from sustainability in recent years because of costs and a global energy crisis.

76. Al Gore

After leaving public office as US vice president in 2001, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Al Gore has become one of the best known leaders of the climate fight.

In 2006 he founded the Climate Reality Project, which has trained more than 3.5 million people worldwide, empowering them to devise climate solutions for their communities. The same year, Gore’s documentary An Inconvenient Truth brought the realities of climate change to the fore and sparked a global conversation.

This past spring, Gore was a headline speaker at San Francisco Climate Week, where he blasted the Trump administration for its attack on government subsidies for renewable energy and for its attempts to override Congress on its traditional taxing and spending powers.

He also kicked off an international tour in March in Paris for his nonprofit Climate Reality Project, to use training centres and youth programs in other countries to expand public support for renewable alternatives to oil and gas. Gore said the strategy is designed to help support climate activism in parts of the world where there is still motivation to mitigate extreme heat and weather, despite setbacks in the US.

77. Sarah Johnson

As the head of peatland nature recovery at Lancashire's Wildlife Trust (LWT), Sarah Johnson has spent decades championing the need to restore peatlands.

Thanks to her, she's responsible for saving and recovering thousands of acres of upland and lowland peatlands, which are huge carbon sinks. The dense areas have the ability to lock away carbon for long periods of time, which are thought to be twice as effective as forests.

She's working to help protect the peatlands, which are vastly unprotected and have been heavily drained since after the Second World War. It's only recently that the UK has realised their importance, resulting in around 80 per cent of them being damaged. To do this, she works closely with local farmers to ensure wetter lowlands areas can both help farming and wildlife.

Part of this collaboration includes encouraging farmers to plant bullrushes to create an environmental filler for puffer jackets and pioneering carbon farms establishing new coverings of sphagnum moss to trap carbon.

78. Robbie Macpherson

Robbie Macpherson is a vocal advocate for driving the national economy away from oil and gas and transitioning to a green future to reduce harmful emissions and mitigate the worst effects of climate change. .

A graduate of the University of Sheffield, he was until last year the senior political adviser to the All-Party Parliamentary Group on climate change in the UK Parliament. Macpherson has written for national newspapers and appeared on broadcast media to discuss and advocate ways the government can better speed the climate transition.

In October, 2024, Macpherson was given a Churchill Fellowship, named after Winston Churchill, to study what lessons the UK can learn from countries such as Denmark and Colombia in their efforts to transition away from oil and gas to sustainable energy economies.

79. Ben von Wong

Canadian visual artist Ben von Wong's most recent installation sat outside the Plastic Treaty negotiations at Geneva’s Palais des Nations, where talks were held.

The 20ft structure, known as 'The Thinker's Burden', highlighted the reliance of plastics and the problem of microplastics. The traditional looking stone sculpture, which symbolises mother earth, was almost drowning in plastic waste, which he'd been adding to for weeks, and was designed to encourage people to think about and recognise the health problems plastic causes, not just for us, but future generations.

His work covers social and environmental issues, such as e-waste (discarded electronics) where he created The Skull of Satoshi in collaboration with Greenpeace in 2023 to raise awareness of the environmental damage Bitcoin mining creates. While in 2018 his 'Strawpocalyps' piece won him a Guiness World Record as the largest installation created from drinking straws to raise awareness about the damage they cause in the ocean.

80. Frances Fox

Frances Fox is the founder and UK director of Climate Live, a five-year-old group dedicated to using music festivals and concerts to bring climate activism to a new generation.

A long time music fan and graduate of the University of East Anglia, Fox is passionate about using music to spread the message of environmentalism. Fox was responsible for creating the solar-powered pink bus stage and music stall at music festivals across the UK and at climate events in as many as 30 other countries to spread the word. She is an active public speaker and writer.

This past summer, she appeared on the Drowned in Sound podcast to discuss her evolution from music fan to climate activist, and why music festivals themselves are under threat from climate change.

81. Sarah Small

While cycling over 4,500km this year, Sarah Small also had her 4ft wood instrument in tow, strapped to the back of her bike. It wasn't an endurance event, instead, she was on tour – taking the slow road. By travelling on two wheels around the UK, she highlighted the environmental impact of the traditional way of touring for musicians, usually reliant on flying or cars or coaches.

Playing the Viola da Gamba (also known as a viol), which was popular during the Renaissance period, she gave 31 performances and also wanted to perform at music venues outside of the main cities.

She began in May and finished at the end of July, traversing a large loop of most of the UK sticking to the coastlines of England and Wales, and much of Scotland, including the western isles.

82. Sir David Attenborough

No one has been a greater force in raising awareness of the climate and environmental crises than Sir David Attenborough. The British documentarian and naturalist is behind dozens of TV series, beaming unforgettable portraits of animals and plants in their natural habitats into the homes of millions around the world, while also painting a very vivid picture of the disastrous realities the planet faces at the hands of humans. His enthusiasm and respect for our uniquely diverse planet has inspired generations of scientists, academics, conservationists and activists.

Known as “the voice of nature”, Sir David is still working and broadcasting with his signature eloquence at the age of 99. He has reported from some of the world’s toughest environments, and at every opportunity, uses his platform to advocate for immediate action to combat environmental degradation through programmes including Natural World, Wildlife on One and the Planet Earth series. The Blue Planet is regarded as having drawn attention to the global problem of plastic pollution, and The Life of Mammals explored the threat humanity has posed to every other species on Earth.

This year, he has already launched two documentaries, Parenthood and Ocean with David Attenborough. The latter was released on his 99th birthday – one critic called it the “greatest message he’s told” – and it described the startling effect dredging has on the ocean floor, and how important the oceans, which he calls “our life support system and our greatest ally against climate catastrophe”, are to the future of our world

83. Gretchen Goldman

Gretchen Goldman is an American environmental scientist and president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a non-profit advocacy group that uses scientific research to push for solutions to environmental problems.

Before that, she was director of climate change research and technology at the US state department after holding a leadership role at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under President Biden.

In her current role, which she assumed in February, Goldman intends to be a leading voice among scientists increasingly concerned by President Trump’s anti-environmental policies and attacks on renewable energy.

As the Trump administration seeks to limit environmental data and in some cases remove research from government websites, more and more pressure will build on scientists to find new ways to promote fact-based environmental research.

84. Dr Ayana Elizabeth Johnson

Ayana Elizabeth Johnson is an American marine biologist and co-founder of the nonprofit Urban Ocean Lab, a think tank for policy on coastal cities. She has long promoted ocean conservation and co-authored the Blue New Deal, a plan for including the oceans in climate policy. She has also been involved with environmental policy, written books and articles on the subject, and co-hosted the podcast How To Save A Planet.

Adding to her long history of climate work, last year she published her own book, What If We Get It Right? Visions of Climate Futures, which one critic called “a much-needed antidote to ‘climate grief’”. The book is a collection of essays, poems and musings on potential climate futures by people working in areas ranging from farming to architecture. It promotes the idea that there may be many different solutions to the climate emergency – not just one sole plan of action.

85. Fatih Birol

Fatih Birol is executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), which helps countries to form energy policy. He is known for championing the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon future, and has emphasised the need for urgent, coordinated global efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C.

Renewables grew rapidly in the past few years and Birol has said the IEA expects renewable energy use to increase by 2.5 times by 2030, but that that would still fall short of the tripling that nations agreed at the Cop28 climate summit two years ago. He added that the goal is still reachable, though success hinges on increasing funds for clean energy in developing countries.

He also previously said the war in Gaza has proven that “oil and gas are no longer safe choices”, and that the Middle East crisis could accelerate the move to clean energy.

In January at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Birol singled out India as a developing country on the right track, noting its 40 per cent surge in renewable energy investment in 2024. Later this year, Birol will help preside over the critical Cop30 climate summit in Brazil, which will focus on ways to contain damage to the Amazon basin, among other things.

He must also navigate increasing pressure from the fossil fuel industry and from governments such as the US that want to drill more. He has said existing oil and gas fields do require investment but that must not detract the world from its mission to transition from oil and gas to clean energy.

86. Dr Jane Goodall

Jane Goodall’s name is synonymous with her groundbreaking work on the study of chimpanzees, which she began in 1960. She is a renowned conservationist and ethologist (the study of non-human animal behaviour) who at 91 continues to show an unwavering commitment to conservation.

Through the Jane Goodall Institute, her work focuses on education and community conservation projects. In 1991, she set up Roots & Shoots, supporting young people to work on environmental, conservation and humanitarian issues. In 2023, Goodall launched the Trees for Jane campaign, promoting tree planting and forest preservation worldwide.

Speaking in London at the South by Southwest festival in June, Goodall reflected on the horrors of Gaza and Ukraine and the damage the environment has suffered from them. However, she added that she is still hopeful that the younger generation, who make up a large section of her supporters, will change things while there is still time.

She also commented on the surge in AI usage and said it was a tool whose impact on the world will depend on how it is used by society.

87. Dr Kimberley Budil and team

For 70 years, scientists have attempted to replicate the energy process that powers the sun. Three years ago, a team in California finally managed to do it after 13 years of trying.

Physicist Kim Budil is the director of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. She is the first woman to hold the position, and it was under her leadership that her team made its historic breakthrough in nuclear fusion.Since then, investors have poured money into fusion technologies and companies purporting to be on the cusp of a breakthrough to scale the process. The Trump administration recently said the US was committed to all forms of nuclear energy, including fusion.

Nuclear fusion offers the promise of providing nearly limitless clean energy, which could revolutionise efforts to meet the world’s energy needs sustainably, changing the trajectory of the climate crisis. Known as a “net energy gain” – producing more energy in a fusion reaction than was used to ignite it – the experiment delivered 2.05 megajoules of energy to the target, resulting in 3.15 MJ of energy output.

88. Michael Mann

For Michael Mann, climate scientist, author and professor of climate science at the University of Pennsylvania, the problem of climate denial has been at the heart of a major libel case that has continued for 12 years.

In February 2024, Mann, who is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences, was awarded damages after winning a case against two writers who, in a blogpost for the libertarian think tank Competitive Enterprise Institute, compared Mann’s depictions of global warming to child molestation but against data, which Mann says damaged his reputation. After the verdict was announced, Mann said: “It’s a good day for us. It’s a good day for science.” The case has become a symbol of upholding of s","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/09/18/13/29/climate100100herosplitNEW.jpeg?trim=0,1,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-09-21 15:00:39.825707

WGF is submitting detailed comments opposing the EPA’s proposed rule (Federal Register Number 2025-14572). WGF’s comments were prepared by subject matter experts on climate change and are available on the WGF website here. The EPA’s public comment period on this topic closes on September 22nd, 2025.

In a 2007 US Supreme Court decision, the nation’s highest court ruled that greenhouse gases qualified as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The US EPA subsequently issued the 2009 Endangerment Finding. It stated that: 1) that greenhouse gases threaten public health and 2) that motor vehicles contribute to greenhouse gas pollution. These findings are the basis for emissions standards that aim to reduce pollution and protect public health. There have been no new developments, particularly no peer-reviewed scientific studies, that cast doubt on the reliability of the 2009 Endangerment Finding or challenge its assumptions. Counter to the EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment, the EPA is ignoring or misconstruing the science and the obvious facts: climate change is a grave existential threat to human health and welfare.

We now have nearly 15 years of additional experience and data to support the Endangerment Finding more thoroughly and with greater confidence. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the past 10 years have been the 10 warmest years on record since 1850. Additionally, nine of the top 10 years for extreme one-day precipitation events have occurred since 1995. This is not a random coincidence.

These changes impact Wisconsin directly, too. According to the 2021 Assessment Report from the Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts (WICCI), “In the last decade, nearly every region of our state has experienced extreme rainfall events that led to flooding of roads, homes, businesses, and farm fields.” The August 2025 flooding in Milwaukee and other parts of southeastern Wisconsin is just one example of a 1000-year rainstorm. From 1980 to 2024, NOAA documented 44 severe storms in the Midwest, including Wisconsin. In a similar time frame from 1988 to 2023, there were nine droughts. Droughts are associated with health risks like heat stress. Furthermore, droughts can cause widespread crop losses to economically important crops like corn and soybeans. Life-threatening weather events are becoming almost annual in our region.

Beyond weather events, greenhouse gases endanger public health by lowering the air quality. Emissions from vehicles and other sources create smog. Warm temperatures accelerate those smog-creating conditions. Smog harms human health, resulting in acute respiratory symptoms that lead to reduced productivity (missed school and work days), hospitalizations, and premature death.

Warming temperatures and changing weather patterns also bring increased risks of vector-borne disease like Lyme disease, West Nile virus, dengue fever, and Zika virus. According to BioMed Research International, since 2009, cases of dengue have been documented in Florida for the first time in 75 years. The warmer and wetter conditions caused by global warming will make some areas of the US more conducive to the spread of mosquitoes and ticks that spread these dangerous diseases.

The climate factors occurring today, including temperature increases, changing precipitation patterns, changes in humidity and other factors are different in one dramatic and devastating regard—the rapid rate of change. Thousands of species of birds, fish, mammals, amphibians, trees, coral reef species, and others are threatened with extinction. In 2020, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) assessed that climate change was the biggest factor leading to extinction.

Page 36292 of the Federal Register entry (Vol. 90, No. 146 / Friday, August 1, 2025) describes the various documents, reports, proceedings, and other materials reviewed and considered by the EPA Administrator (Mr. Zeldin) in pursuing this rulemaking to rescind the Endangerment Finding. The first document listed on that page was a report from the Department of Energy (DOE) entitled “A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate.” As published in ScienceAdvisor, Science Feedback, and elsewhere, many scientists referenced in this report have quickly denounced the report for cherry-picking data, mischaracterizing findings, and sometimes coming to the opposite conclusion their research papers actually support.",https://www.wisbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-21 14:00:15.386777

For New Pittsburgh Courier

In August 2025, the Black unemployment rate surged to 7.5 percent —about twice the rate for White workers (3.7 percent) and well above the national average of 4.3 percent. Washington, D.C., and Michigan had the highest Black unemployment rates in the second quarter of 2025, at 10.3 percent and 10 percent, respectively.

These numbers are not mere statistics—they signal families set back, dreams delayed, and communities left more vulnerable each time the economy falters. For Black Americans, downturns hit harder, and recovery is slower. In these moments, only true wealth infrastructure—assets, homeownership, savings, and entrepreneurship—can anchor families and offer a genuine path forward.

As federal layoffs accelerate and key industries shed workers, families without assets face a familiar crisis: unemployment that threatens not just monthly bills, but housing stability and children’s futures. Black workers bear the heaviest burden, losing jobs first and finding new ones last each time the economy turns.

The Promise of the Family Self-Sufficiency Program

One model stands out: the Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program, HUD’s proven approach for helping low-income families turn rental assistance into long-term wealth. As participants’ incomes rise, so do their savings—thanks to an innovative escrow account that captures what otherwise would have gone toward higher rent. By graduation, many families have enough for a down payment, tuition, or even a small business venture. With $141 million in federal appropriations for 2025, FSS is a rare example of scalable, bipartisan anti-poverty policy—yet it faces perennial funding threats that put its gains at risk.

Asset-building programs like FSS, which Congress has protected even as recent budgets have targeted them for cuts, are essential to help families weather unemployment, avoid eviction, and create security that income alone cannot guarantee. In the wake of these disruptions, Black wealth infrastructure isn’t just important; it is essential for community and generational resilience. The effects are visible in lives transformed.

Take Marisabel, who entered the FSS Homeownership Track in Massachusetts as a renter struggling to get ahead. Through steady work, saving, and coaching, she bought her first home —turning uncertainty into lasting security for her family. Likewise, Tanisha Durrett, a single mother, became the proud owner of a bookkeeping business after completing FSS, crediting the program’s financial coaching for her leap into entrepreneurship.

Closing the Racial Wealth Gap

However, even diligent saving can’t close the racial wealth gap alone. The pathways to prosperity increasingly run through new engines of economic growth —like clean energy, a $23 trillion market by 2030, expected to generate over a million jobs in the coming years. Yet Black Americans currently hold only 8 percent of jobs in the sector and own less than 1 percent of its companies. Even as industry leaders clamor to hire—“We need to hire 500,000 people in the next decade,” says Jason Grumet of the American Clean Power Association—systemic barriers persist.

Chief among these obstacles is unpaid training. As CEO Carla Walker-Miller notes, “If you want [Black people] to be trained, pay us… We need to be paid while we’re trained.” Without paid opportunities, participation remains limited—no matter how dire the labor shortage. For those who do break in, union positions offer real security: 8–19 percent higher wages and strong benefits. Most new roles require no college degree, making these jobs especially valuable for displaced workers.

Business ownership—vital for family and community wealth —remains out of reach for many. Fewer than a quarter of Black-owned clean energy companies get bank financing, compared to nearly half of White-owned firms. This persistent financing gap prevents Black entrepreneurs from scaling up and sharing new opportunities.

Programs like FSS, the Dearfield Fund for Black Wealth, and D.C.’s Black Homeownership Fund reveal what’s possible. These efforts turn passive hope into asset-building action, helping families achieve homeownership, launch businesses, and stabilize entire neighborhoods.

To create lasting resilience, we must do three things:

Expand asset-building programs like FSS and down payment supports nationwide so every hardworking family can own a home and build security.

Open pathways to emerging industries with paid training, union jobs, and fair business opportunities.

Reform lending and homeownership systems with targeted community investments and strict anti-discrimination rules.

If policymakers act with purpose—grounded in evidence —Black families will not only weather economic storms, but thrive: launching businesses, sending children to college, and building communities with enduring strength. True wealth infrastructure is more than a safety net—it’s the foundation for real and lasting mobility. There is no Black mobility without Black sustainability.

They’re making a false argument that increasing methane production and exporting liquified natural gas (LNG) worldwide will somehow help meet Global Methane Pledge goals.
Methane still offers a tremendous opportunity to make climate progress, provided we make tremendous progress on actually cutting methane emissions.","U.S. energy policy stinks because it accelerates rising methane emissions, which accelerate climate change. The Trump administration is attacking renewable energy, most recently taking a whole-of-government approach to savaging wind power, while aggressively pushing dirty natural gas production and LNG exports, and even threatening countries that try to decrease reliance on fossil fuels.

This is a recipe for disaster. Fossil fuel extraction and infrastructure inevitably release methane, a greenhouse gas more than 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide over 20 years. Methane has likely caused 40-50% of all warming in the past 20 years. Cutting it is our best chance to slow warming, but we’re blowing it. Methane emissions continue to climb with “no foreseeable slowdown,” a new study in the journal Nature finds.

We can’t change this trajectory unless we stop drilling for oil and gas. “Overall emissions will remain high as long as the industry is drilling new wells…That’s just the nature of the beast,” a petroleum expert told ProPublica this month, as it reported on how permits for Texas wells to vent and flare their natural gas (i.e., methane) are rubber stamped, with 99.6% approved. In fact, in Texas and some other states, oil well methane emissions are so normalized that some permits are issued automatically, without applications.

The industry literally can’t exist without pollution, because oil and gas operations must release methane and other pollutants to regulate equipment pressures, which is why they routinely get air pollution permits. The problem is much bigger than accidental leaks. In a 2022 report, the industry itself admitted only 6% of its methane emissions were leaks, the rest were intentional releases.

The Permian Basin in Texas alone emits more than 256,000 kilograms of methane per hour (about 2.2 million metric tons a year) the climate equivalent of 161 natural gas-fired power plants. And even in purportedly low-emitting oilfields, we know emissions are grossly underestimated.

So as leaders gather at Climate Week NYC to discuss solutions, they should start there: methane emissions are required for oil and gas production, “clean” natural gas is a scam, so to stop methane emissions we must stop drilling new wells.

We already agree on the need to stop methane. I was at the 2021 COP26 climate summit in Glasgow when the Global Methane Pledge to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030 was launched. So far 159 countries including the United States have signed it. But as I said then, “A pledge is not a plan.” Today, roughly halfway to the 2030 deadline, global methane emissions are up, not down, by some 40 million tons, largely from growing energy sector emissions — the equivalent of building 296 new coal-fired powerplants.

Meanwhile, oil and gas executives advertise flashy new emissions controls and misleading performance metrics to justify more production, even as methane emissions rise. They’re making a false argument that increasing methane production and exporting liquified natural gas (LNG) worldwide will somehow help meet Global Methane Pledge goals.

Their playbook is to ignore lifecycle emissions, cherry pick certain examples, and peddle the notion that natural gas can be “clean,” even though natural gas is methane and venting and flaring it is endemic.

But LNG is not “clean;” studies show it is 33% worse for the climate than coal. Leading environmental scientist Bob Howarth calls LNG “the worst of any fossil fuel.” Besides the methane emissions required in all natural gas production and transmission, LNG involves liquifying the gas, transporting it on boats, then more processing to make it usable in the destination countries, all of which causes massive additional emissions.

But we can still reverse the trend and bring methane levels down. Since it has a short lifespan in the atmosphere, the International Energy Agency points out that “sharp cuts in methane can deliver a net cooling effect within a relatively short period,” giving us time to “pursue lasting reductions in carbon dioxide.”

Although the Global Methane Pledge hasn’t delivered actual methane reductions yet, the IEA’s fundamental logic is correct. Methane still offers a tremendous opportunity to make climate progress, provided we make tremendous progress on actually cutting methane emissions. But accomplishing this will take more than non-binding pledges and fossil fuel industry spin. It will take putting a stop to oil and gas expansion.

No amount of emissions gadgets or performance certifications can fix an industry that must pollute to exist. Once we admit that, we can finally move from pledges to actual plans, and from methane-intensive energy to renewables.",https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1392949973.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-09-21 15:59:43.981298

“… It’s important to note that Duane Arnold Energy Center operated safely for decades, providing reliable, emissions-free energy to Eastern Iowa homes and businesses.
Linn County’s outdoor sirens, originally installed by Duane Arnold, were donated to Linn County and its communities when the plant closed.","PALO — At Whiskey River Grill, a bar and restaurant that sits a couple miles from the decommissioned Duane Arnold Energy Center, co-owner Lacey Christiansen remembers when the lunch crowd was steady, fueled by technicians and operators coming off shifts at Iowa’s only nuclear plant.

“When we first opened six years ago, they were still up and running, and there was just a lot more lunch business,” Christiansen said. “We definitely saw a decline after it all closed down.”

Now, with plant owner NextEra Energy weighing a plan to restart operations at Duane Arnold by the end of the decade, Christiansen sees reason for optimism.

“I haven’t heard anything negative about it,” she said. “We hear, you know, 1,000 people can be coming to work. … And that's exciting for us, right? You know, because these people are going to be coming right through here to go to work every day and going home every day. So that's a big deal for a small business like us.”

Her reaction is echoed across rural Linn County, where residents and business leaders are bracing for an economic revival spurred by the prospect hundreds of high-wage jobs, a multiyear construction surge, and new housing demand.

Palo and Center Point businesses, union leaders and city officials say the economic ripple would be significant.

Impact of decommissioning

Duane Arnold, a single-unit boiling water reactor, entered service in 1975. It was decommissioned in 2020, after more than four decades of producing around 600 megawatts of power and supplying about 8 percent of Iowa’s electricity.

The decision was driven by a combination of economic factors — with Alliant Energy, the plant’s primary electricity customer choosing to exit its power purchase agreement years early — and was hastened by the August 2020 derecho, which caused “extensive” damage to the facility’s cooling towers.

Officials for both Alliant and NextEra at the time said the declining market value of energy from sources like wind, which had dropped below the cost of nuclear generation, prompted the decision to close Duane Arnold.

Alliant Energy customers were projected to save nearly $300 million in energy costs over 21 years — or about $42 a year for residential customers, starting in 2021 — due to the plant’s closure, The Gazette reported at the time.

Since then, NextEra says recommissioning is needed to meet surging electricity demand driven by data centers and other energy-intensive growth.

For nearby communities like Palo and Center Point, the loss was felt both in jobs and in identity.

“I think the biggest impact was more of, ‘Oh no, the nuclear plant shut down. That sucks,” said Palo Mayor Eric Van Kerckhove. “That's kind of been part of Palo’s identity” for a long time.“

Though Palo has grown with new homes and businesses, the mayor said reduced foot traffic and spending were noticeable.

In Center Point, Mayor Traer Morgan saw the closure more directly. His neighbor lost his job at the plant.

“There are people who had to find work elsewhere since the decommissioning,” Morgan said.

City Administrator Joe Taylor described the loss as a “gradual impact” typical of large employer closures.

“You have a negative impact that’s gradually felt, as opposed to just an immediate shock,” he said.

Businesses wait for return

Restaurants and small businesses reported declines in daytime customers once the plant went offline.

“The lunch rush just hasn’t been the same,” Christiansen said of Whiskey River.

Anticipation for new activity has been building since NextEra confirmed it is exploring recommissioning. The project could bring a thousand or more of temporary construction workers and eventually several hundred permanent employees back to the site.

In Center Point, Taylor said the prospect has already sparked some interest from developers.

“We're examining the aspect now of conducting a hotel study,” he said. “They had attempted to do one about 10 years ago, and the numbers just really didn't jive — didn't validate any forward movement past the initial phase,” but the potential bringing a thousand or more temporary construction workers to the area over three to four years changes the tone and urgency.

“They are going to need places to stay, places to eat, places to do (things),” Taylor said. “And so, you know, where our population and our development is already headed that way, something like this obviously spurs some interest from (developers) who are like, ‘Oh, well, you know, there's a possibility to capitalize on something and go from there,’ and with our position on (Interstate) 380 it makes sense, right?”

Economic stakes

A 2014 economic study by the Nuclear Energy Institute estimated Duane Arnold’s operation pumped $246 million annually into Benton and Linn counties, supported 978 jobs locally, and contributed $25.6 million in tax revenue across federal, state and local levels.

At its peak, the plant directly employed nearly 600 workers, with average wages in Linn County topping $82,000 — far above the county average of $45,690 at the time.

Ron Corbett, vice president of economic development for the Cedar Rapids Metro Economic Alliance, said restarting could restore that kind of economic engine.

He said NextEra is working on an updated economic impact study.

“We know the impact will be substantial,” Corbett said. “ … We are thrilled there is a chance to bring these jobs back with the reopening of the nuclear power plant.”

He said the average wage at Duane Arnold before closing was over $100,000.

Housing demand

New demand for housing is a near certainty, according to local officials. Palo has seen a wave of new single-family homes, and developers are preparing for more.

“My hope is that we'll see a lot of homes sell pretty quickly and be in the situation where we need to build more faster,” Van Kerckhove said.

The Palo mayor also expressed excitement about the broader opportunities for new industry in and around Palo. While he said he could not share any specific companies that Palo hopes to attract with the potential restart of the Duane Arnold nuclear plant, Van Kerckhove said a recommissioned plant could attract companies that require significant clean energy, such as data centers and manufacturers.

Center Point has annexed land across Interstate 380 in anticipation of growth.

“Even in my short tenure here — I got here in September of 2021 — land that was in essence considered pretty much off limits … is now for sale,” Taylor said, noting developers are already positioning for new demand.

He said the “sweet spot” for growth remains homes priced at $350,000 or below, which he now considers the affordable range for new construction. If the plant returns, he expects a wave of new neighborhoods to follow.

“At that price point, you could have a pretty good boom on your hands,” Taylor said.

A recently built 42-unit apartment complex is already full, with some tenants working on new data centers or on early Duane Arnold-related projects.

“That’s a direct impact,” Taylor said.

Union’s perspective

For labor unions, Duane Arnold’s potential restart represents more than jobs — it’s about stability and growth.

“It was a huge deal for us,” said Jon Van Zante, business manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 204. At its height, the plant employed more than 350 of his members.

Even if staffing levels today are smaller — perhaps 150 to 200 permanent union jobs — Van Zante said the ripple effects across trades would be significant.

“These are highly skilled jobs that pay extremely well,” Van Zante said, estimating wages could exceed $120,000 annually. “That’s long-term employment, not just a project.”

Beyond the permanent workforce, the project would draw hundreds of contractors and tradespeople during construction and scheduled maintenance. Electricians, plumbers, carpenters and other skilled laborers would see steady demand, echoing the plant’s past role as a major source of work for union members across Iowa, he said.

The facility previously paid nearly $3 million annually in property taxes, supporting schools and county infrastructure. Van Zante said reopening would restore that revenue stream, strengthening local services and community projects.

Local businesses would also benefit from increased foot traffic and disposable income. Restaurants, health clubs and service providers once thrived on plant workers and could again, Van Zante and city officials said. Housing demand is expected to rise as workers and families move closer to the site, fueling new construction and boosting property values.

Former employees have expressed interest in returning, Van Zante added. Some transferred to Alliant Energy’s Prairie Creek Generating Station in Cedar Rapids or other nuclear plants nationwide, he said.

“Some of them (who have left and went to work at other nuclear facilities elsewhere in the United States), even still have houses here,” Van Zante said. “And so they would love the option to be able to come back. So I think it creates a lot of good potential.”

And with the state’s growing energy needs driven by data centers and other industries, he said Duane Arnold’s return would ripple well beyond Linn County, supporting suppliers and utilities across the region.

The union also sees a chance to train the next generation.

“I tell my 18-year-old son, there’s never been a better time to go into the trades,” Van Zante said. “I’ve never seen growth like this in 28 years.”

Ripple effects

Beyond jobs and wages, local leaders expect a cascading economic effect.

Restaurants, gas stations, auto shops and retailers all stand to benefit from increased daily traffic, Van Kerckhove said

“You’ll see more people coming in for lunch, getting their oil changed, buying groceries,” he said.

For Center Point, the benefit could extend to schools.

“Good-paying jobs mean stronger school districts,” Taylor said. “... It’s the rising tide that lifts all boats.”

The 2014 study quantified that ripple: for every $1 of output from Duane Arnold, the local economy generated $1.23, while the state economy produced $1.27.

NextEra’s plans

While no final decision has been made, Duane Arnold Energy Center spokesperson Bill Orlove said the company is conducting engineering studies, recruiting licensed nuclear operators and working with potential customers.

If the project moves forward, Duane Arnold would add 600 megawatts of power generation, contributing to the Trump administration’s target of 5,000 megawatts of new nuclear energy by 2030. NextEra said a restart would bring “hundreds of permanent, high-quality, well-paying jobs” back to Linn County and generate millions in tax revenue for schools and local governments.

The company stressed safety remains the top priority, noting Duane Arnold had operated safely for decades before its 2020 closure.

“Restarting a nuclear power plant is a serious undertaking,” Orlove said in a statement. “… It’s important to note that Duane Arnold Energy Center operated safely for decades, providing reliable, emissions-free energy to Eastern Iowa homes and businesses. The health and safety of the public is always our top priority. Highly trained experts run America’s nuclear plants. With the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s oversight and layers of safety precautions, a nuclear plant is one of the safest industrial environments in the United States.

“As we continue to go through this process, we are committed to remaining engaged with local and state stakeholders.”

From Palo’s vantage, Van Kerckhove said, “It feels more like when, not if.” He expects construction could take about three years once approved, bringing a surge of temporary workers.

NextEra has historically invested in community amenities, from donating a splash pad in Palo to supporting local fire departments. Leaders expect that outreach to continue if the restart proceeds.

Safety and community response

Unlike contentious solar projects that sparked opposition in Linn County, leaders say the nuclear restart has drawn little pushback.

“We haven’t heard any complaints,” Taylor said. “It’s been excitement.”

Van Kerckhove agreed: “I’ve heard nothing but positive remarks. People see it as putting Palo back on the map.”

Emergency planning, once tied closely to the plant, also will return. Palo’s fire department still uses equipment donated when the plant closed. Linn County’s outdoor sirens, originally installed by Duane Arnold, were donated to Linn County and its communities when the plant closed. Officials expect those partnerships to be reactivated.

“The community is very familiar with it,” Morgan said. “It’s not new. It’s been here for 40 years.”

A sense of identity

Palo City Council member Jen Welton said the town has long identified with the plant.

“I think a lot of people would consider Palo as the home of the Duane Arnold power plant, and they take great pride in that,” Welton said. “… There was a sense of loss when it was decommissioned. People really felt strongly about the power plant and felt that it brought a lot of great things to the community over the years for us.”

Welton said residents view the possibility of bringing back hundreds of high-paying jobs as “absolutely great for economic development,” benefiting not only Palo but surrounding communities such as Cedar Rapids, Hiawatha and Marion. The plant’s return, she added, could also spark interest from industries looking for clean power and encourage further housing and business development.

“I haven’t met one person that hasn’t really found this to be a positive,” she said. “It was really hard when the plant closed. When it becomes part of who you are as a community, to lose something of that size and magnitude is tough.”

At Whiskey River, Christiansen sees that identity translating into customers again.

“It’s exciting,” she said. “These are good jobs, good people, and they’re going to be coming right through here every day.”

For union members, it’s a chance to reestablish a pillar of the local labor economy.

“I don’t see anything but positives,” Van Zante said. “It makes our union stronger, and it makes the community stronger.”

And for Center Point’s administrator, the restart could mark a turning point.

“We’re very happy,” Taylor said. “This isn’t new. It’s familiar, it’s proven, and it’s good-paying jobs. We welcome it.”

What’s everyone think about the EV tax credit going away? Do you see manufacturers rolling out bigger rebates to keep sales moving, or will prices just crash harder? Will this kill EV demand, or could it actually push used EV values down even more?

I own a dealership that exclusively sells used EV’s.. (in a very red state).. my experience says those that are interested in EV’s will buy them either way as long as they are affordable. Most my customers are buying around the $15-$20k mark as an affordable way to test an EV for their lifestyle. That’s the biggest barrier to entry for most in the new car sector. Until the last year we’ve really lacked “affordable” new EV’s with logical use range… Even with the tax rebate. With the new Leaf coming out, Chevy’s Equinox doing well, and whatever Ford has planned.. we are seeing that change.

On the flip side.. manufacturers like Cadillac who have rolled out a phenomenal line of EV’s… Most their customers aren’t going to qualify for the rebate and they seem to only be picking up momentum with some ridiculously big number like 80% of their EV buyers being new to the brand. They are showing that if you build attractive EV’s that feel and look worth the money.. there’s a market.

From the used side.. we actually stopped utilizing the rebate this last week out of fear we might not get paid as it wraps up this week (which talking to other EV dealers.. that seems to be the case)… We still had our best week in 2 months.

I do expect to see a bigger spread in pricing on used EV’s. We won’t see vehicles with 50k miles priced so close to vehicles with 100k miles since they won’t be trying to stuff every price under the $25k threshold of the used EV credit.",,N,,2025-09-21 15:00:10.732368

The move is part of a broader strategy to stimulate local demand for green technologies and respond to external trade pressures.

Policy Shift Aims to Boost Domestic Consumption

The tax cut applies to a range of equipment used in the renewable energy sector, including solar panels, , and related components. By lowering the tax burden, the government seeks to make these technologies more affordable for domestic consumers and businesses. This is expected to encourage investment in clean energy projects and accelerate India’s transition toward renewable sources.

The reduction comes as part of a series of fiscal adjustments aimed at supporting the country’s energy infrastructure goals. By reducing the cost of imported and locally manufactured equipment, the policy is intended to enhance the competitiveness of India’s renewable energy market.

Strategic Response to External Trade Developments

While the government has not explicitly referenced trade dynamics, the timing of the tax cut is seen as a strategic move to offset the impact of potential external tariffs. The policy change is expected to cushion the Indian manufacturing and energy sectors against the financial implications of higher import costs that could stem from foreign trade barriers.

The adjustment also reflects the government’s commitment to promoting self-reliance in the energy sector. By making renewable energy equipment more accessible, the policy is expected to support domestic manufacturing and encourage the adoption of green technologies across industries.

Implementation Set for Mid-September

, giving businesses and consumers time to adjust to the new fiscal environment. Industry stakeholders have welcomed the move as a positive signal for the sector, with expectations that the reduced tax rate will translate into faster project approvals and increased investment.

The government has emphasized that the change will be applied uniformly across the relevant product categories. Importers and local manufacturers will both benefit from the lower tax rate, which is expected to improve margins and reduce the overall cost of renewable energy infrastructure.

Sector Readiness and Future Outlook

With the tax cut now in place, the focus will shift to how quickly the market adapts to the new framework. The government’s policy has the potential to reduce the cost of setting up solar and wind projects, making it more attractive for private sector participation. .

The move underscores the government’s continued support for the renewable energy sector as a key pillar of India’s energy strategy. By reducing financial barriers, the policy aims to create a more favorable environment for long-term investments in clean energy infrastructure. {}",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd2643784bc002.png,N,,2025-09-21 15:59:26.778114

CID Gulf LLC, an Omani-Moroccan engineering consultancy firm, has announced that it has secured a prestigious contract to provide design consultancy services for the establishment of Oman’s first wind turbine manufacturing project at Duqm SEZ. The client is Mawarid Turbines — a subsidiary of Oman’s integrated energy powerhouse, OQ Group.

Muscat-based CID Gulf is a joint venture established by Khonji Engineering Consultancy, a member of Mohamed & Ahmed Alkhonji LLC (MAK), a leading Omani tech-based products and services holding company and Conseil, Ingénierie et Développement (CID), a Moroccan consultancy engineering firm operating across the African continent and the Middle East.

“This project represents a cornerstone in the Sultanate of Oman’s move towards clean energy, local industrialisation and long-term sustainability. We are honoured to contribute to this national initiative alongside key government and private sector stakeholders”, CID Gulf noted in a post on Friday.

The award underscores a fast-track approach to the implementation of Mawarid Turbines — a landmark bid to localise wind turbine manufacturing to cater to the large domestic market as well as regional demand. Oman’s requirement for wind turbines to support the country’s energy transition — spanning grid-connected clean energy generation and the ambitious green hydrogen sector — is estimated in the thousands over the next couple of decades.

Phase 1 of the facility, to be developed on a sprawling 550,000 m² site in the SEZ, entails an investment of around RO 70 million. The wind turbine manufacturing capacity of this phase is projected at around 1,100 MW per year, focusing on the production of two turbine models — the 6.25 MW and the 9.6 MW. Technology for the project will be licensed from Shanghai Electric Group, a major player in China’s clean energy equipment manufacturing sector.

Among the first recipients of the turbines — covering not only nacelle hubs housing the generators but potentially other components as well — are grid —connected, wind-based Independent Power Projects planned in Al Duqm, Mahout and Sadah. While these projects will be developed by international developers (supported by their local consortium partners) selected through a competitive tender managed by Nama Power & Water Procurement (Nama PWP), OQ Alternative Energy (OQAE) — a wholly-owned subsidiary of OQ Group — has been assured a stake in them. This stake commitment, consistent with OQAE’s mandate as the national champion for renewable energy, covers an equity share of up to 25 per cent in all future renewable energy projects procured by Nama PWP, starting with the Ibri III Solar PV project — a 500 MW scheme slated for implementation in Al Dhahirah Governorate. In the case of the wind projects planned in Al Duqm, Mahout and Sadah, OQAE’s investment — in the form of locally manufactured wind turbines and potentially other contributions — will correspond to an equivalent stake in the respective project companies, it is learnt.

Phase 1 of Mawarid Turbines is expected to come on stream by late 2026 or early 2027.",https://www.omanobserver.om/omanobserver/uploads/images/2025/09/21/thumbs/600x600/3135108.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 13:00:34.929370

The Trump administration has signed into law several executive orders aimed at reducing the standing of renewable energies in the United States. The Trump administration has implemented a new approach to the energy sector that sees the traditional gas and coal sectors being favored instead of the wind and solar power sectors that have become more popular in recent years.

U.S. Wind alleges federal officials were under pressure from the Trump administration

A recent court filing has revealed that the Trump administration filed a request to a federal court to vacate a permit approved for US Wind’s proposed Maryland Offshore Wind project. The project could have a significant impact on the energy sector in the United States and has the capacity to provide enough electricity to power 718,000 homes. So why the filing from the Trump administration, you ask?

That filing states that US Wind’s project could create issues with search and rescue operations and commercial fisheries. If that sounds like a stretch to you, you are not alone. Several key players in the energy sector have come out to state their disapproval with the court filing by the Trump administration, claiming the only reason the current administration made the filing was because the project gained approval from the Biden administration.

The action was filed in the US District Court for the District of Maryland in Baltimore, and the Trump administration has been hard at work trying to find a feasible reason for asking the court to cease the approval process. The filing stated that the previous administration misinterpreted the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which enabled the government to manage several key projects in federal waters across the country.

US Wind fights back against the recent action taken by the Trump administration

US Wind is not going to sit by and watch one of its most promising projects being taken away by the Trump administration, and has filed motions to dismiss parts of the suit and requested extensions for responses to the amended complaint.

“Political pressure was applied to the Federal Defendants’ decisionmakers, and the pressure caused those decisionmakers to rely on improper factors,” U.S. Wind alleged in the filing.

The company has claimed that the suit is a part of the Trump administration’s coordinated efforts to repeal any and all projects set up during the previous administration. U.S. Wind received approval to begin construction for the Maryland project in December 2024 and took pride in the fact that the project was the 10th commercial-scale wind project approved in the U.S. The evidence suggests that Trump has a personal vendetta against large wind farms.

The suit has local politicians split as to whether this is the right move for the energy sector in the United States. In August of this year, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced it was pulling $679 million from offshore wind projects nationwide. Maryland House Republicans praised the administration’s decision to revoke the permit and stated the project was “a bad idea that was never going to come to fruition.”

Overall, this UAW report is an all-too-rare example of a union getting serious about a vision for industrial policy and putting real legislation on the table.","A consensus is emerging across the political spectrum around the need for industrial policy. Whether in the form of the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act under Joe Biden in 2022 or the haphazard tariff policy of Donald Trump implemented earlier this year, political leaders on both sides of the aisle are clearly searching for answers regarding how to revive the United States’s flagging manufacturing base.

While the Trump administration places a lot of rhetorical emphasis on bringing back industrial jobs, its policies so far have displayed a profound lack of seriousness or coherence. Trump’s tariffs have not been focused on strategic industries or paired with the investment and planning required to make jobs actually materialize. Attacks on agencies like the Department of Energy will make it difficult to build out even those energy sources that Trump claims to favor, like nuclear.

At the same time, the “abundance” debate, kicked off by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson’s book of the same name, has drawn additional attention to the need for increased state capacity to make things and deliver improvements for ordinary people. This, the book’s authors argue, is the way to revive both the American economy and the Democratic Party. The discussion, fraught and flawed as it is, has captured the attention and imagination of liberals who don’t usually make a habit of thinking about industrial policy.

But there’s one constituency whose voice is missing and sorely needed in that debate: industrial workers and their unions. A new report from the United Auto Workers (UAW) Region 6 titled “Organize, Industrialize, Decarbonize: A Pro-Worker, Green Industrial Policy for California” takes up the challenge, providing a compelling example of how labor can weigh in on the reindustrialization conversation.

The report presents a vision for how the state can deploy a range of industrial policy tools to expand clean energy industries like offshore wind, electric vehicle batteries, and heat pumps. The same strategies would ensure that jobs created in this build-out become high-quality union careers. It’s precisely the kind of forward-thinking approach labor needs to take on industrial policy.

Trump’s return to office has effectively killed the momentum behind pro-labor clean energy investment that built up under Biden. Even while the current administration has expressed support for nuclear and geothermal development, its lack of appetite for competent state capacity throws serious doubt on its ability to follow through on a build-out.

In this bleak federal context, states can partner with trade unions to lead on industrial policies that show how a clean energy transition can create good jobs. The more progress is made on forming these coalitions now, the better positioned they’ll be when a more favorable national political climate emerges.

The Industrial Policy Tool Kit

The UAW Region 6 report begins by outlining the dilemmas that presently make carrying out a clean energy transition so challenging, especially if left up to private industry and markets. While working-class families are already reeling from inflation, private utilities are paying for climate investments by raising rates for consumers. Meanwhile, the oil and gas industry remains a rare source of good blue-collar union jobs, and workers are rightfully concerned about their disappearance.

But the UAW believes that California’s rich research ecosystem and advanced manufacturing experience puts it in a strong position to be able to build out clean energy technologies. The report helpfully breaks down a range of industrial policy tools, from public procurement to enabling institutions, that the state can employ to favor union labor.

California already uses many of these tools successfully in different contexts. For example, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority has a public procurement provision that gives preference to bidders who create jobs within the county. The PowerForward ZEV Battery Manufacturing grant program incentivizes grant recipients to enter a card check neutrality agreement, have a collective bargaining agreement, and offer comprehensive benefits to their workers.

Enabling institutions, a designation that refers to government entities that carry out research and coordination between public and private institutions, are on the more ambitious side of the policy menu. These represent the building of actual state capacity instead of mere regulation. Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry is an example of such an enabling institution and played a crucial role in crafting Japan’s postwar economic boom.

UAW Region 6 is focusing its legislative campaigning on Senate Bill 787, which would create a state-level enabling institution in California to facilitate the growth of zero-emission vehicles and batteries (ZEVs), offshore wind, and heat pump manufacturing. It would require state agencies to coordinate funding in line with the goals of supply chain development and energy affordability.

A Pro-Worker Abundance

California contains the natural wealth to make this vision possible. The Lawrence Berkeley National Lab has estimated that up to eighteen million metric tons of lithium exist in the state’s Salton Sea Region in the Imperial Valley. This is enough to build 375 million EV batteries. The report advocates expanding EV battery recycling capacity in order to create a fully self-sufficient supply chain.

Two hundred gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind potential exists off California’s coast, and the state already has the highest density of non-aircraft turbine manufacturing in the country. Just last year, voters approved a bond measure that earmarked $475 million for offshore wind port infrastructure. The UAW believes these conditions make the industry ripe for expansion in the state with the right level of planning. The report recommends that California seek to round out the supply chain by also producing component parts like generators, cells, and power converters.

With the Trump administration launching an all-out attack on offshore wind, it’s even more important for states like California to develop their own capacities to build out the industry and integrate the supply chain. Public projects can be financed over a longer term and better withstand the volatility of national energy policy than strictly private alternatives. For example, Golden State Wind is a joint venture between Ocean Winds and Reventus Power, which is owned by the national public pension plan in Canada. They plan to deploy 2 GW of wind capacity in the state.

Heat pumps are HVAC systems that use electricity instead of gas to heat and cool buildings. They get less attention as a clean energy technology, but they will play a vital role in reducing building emissions. Demand for heat pumps is projected to grow, and California has set a goal of six million installations over the next five years. UAW Region 6 argues that this is a perfect opportunity to use public procurement to create local, unionized employment.

Overall, this UAW report is an all-too-rare example of a union getting serious about a vision for industrial policy and putting real legislation on the table. While other important clean energy sources like nuclear power and geothermal are left out, the policy proposals play to California’s natural strengths and build on already existing successful initiatives.

Many on the Left have wholly dismissed the abundance concept as repackaged neoliberalism. But others have begun to thoughtfully argue that a chief concern of the Left should be increased state capacity to create good jobs and deliver improved lives. If we don’t offer a compelling vision for how to do this, others will.

The authors of the UAW report conclude by stating that they “wholeheartedly agree with authors Derek Thompson and Ezra Klein” on the need for “increased state capacity, empowered public authorities, and investments in innovation.” The UAW’s fight for SB 707 could be an important first step towards a pro-union abundance agenda.",https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20114054/uaw-green.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 12:03:56.716048

The European Union has taken another major step towards cleaner skies with the announcement of €945 million in funding for a new wave of research and demonstration projects under its Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking.

Approved on 9 September, the investment will support 12 projects that promise to push the boundaries of propulsion, systems, and aircraft design.

This third call for proposals represents the largest single package to date under the Clean Aviation programme, which falls within Horizon Europe. It is designed to accelerate the development of next-generation regional and short-medium range aircraft capable of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by at least 30% compared with 2020 technology.

Work on the projects is due to start at the beginning of 2026, with first flight tests expected in the 2028–2029 timeframe. By laying the groundwork for new aircraft entering service around 2035, the initiative is a central pillar of Europe’s aviation decarbonisation roadmap.

The €945 million pot combines EU grants with industry contributions and in-kind support. It has been divided between large demonstration programmes for regional and short-medium range aircraft, a set of “Fast Track” enabler projects, and transversal studies into aircraft concept integration and environmental impact.

“The results of Call 3 show the variety of innovative technological concepts to boost the entry-into-service of highly efficient aircraft by 2035,” says Axel Krein, Executive Director of the Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking. “These projects have high potential to make major advancements towards climate neutrality and sustainability.”

Collectively, the 12 winners represent a blend of established OEMs, engine makers, electrical specialists, and smaller innovators, all aligned behind the EU’s climate ambitions.

The EU Clean Aviation chosen dozen

TAKE OFF

Led by Safran Aircraft Engines, TAKE OFF – Technology And Knowledge for European Open Fan Flight – will push forward open fan architecture engines. This disruptive engine design promises significant improvements in propulsive efficiency and is one of the most visible bets on how the next generation of single-aisle aircraft might take shape.

LEIA

Airbus Operations GmbH is coordinating LEIA, the Large scalE Integration demonstrator of hybrid electrical Architecture. The programme will explore how large-scale hybrid-electric power architectures can be integrated into commercial aircraft, bringing together multiple propulsion and energy systems in a single demonstrator.

UNIFIED

Rolls-Royce plc is taking forward UNIFIED, or Ultra Novel and Innovative Fully Integrated Engine Demonstrations. The project will develop and integrate advanced propulsion technologies into a next-generation powerplant concept, paving the way for more efficient and lower-emission short-medium range aircraft.

PHARES

PHARES – Powerplant Hybrid Application for Regional Segment – is coordinated by Pratt & Whitney Canada. It combines a turboprop engine derived from the PW127XT with a powerful electric motor and optimised gearbox. The ambition is to cut regional aircraft fuel burn by around 20%, with a consortium that also includes ATR and Collins Aerospace.

DEMETRA

ATR leads DEMETRA, the Demonstrator of an Electrified Modern Efficient Transport Regional Aircraft. The project will create a flight demonstrator as part of ATR’s broader Evo programme, advancing its ambition to deliver hybrid-electric aircraft to the market in the next decade.

OSYRYS

Safran Electrical & Power is behind OSYRYS – On-board SYstems Relevant for hYbridization of Regional aircraftS. The project will focus on developing and testing the electrical systems required to make hybridisation feasible on regional aircraft, from power distribution to thermal management.

CRYOSTAR

CRYOSTAR, led by the Università degli Studi della Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, will concentrate on the certification roadmap for cryogenic liquid hydrogen tanks. By investigating crashworthiness and safety methodologies, it aims to clear a critical regulatory hurdle for hydrogen-powered aviation.

MODABAT

Germany’s Fraunhofer Gesellschaft will run MODABAT – Modular, scalable and technology-Open Design for future Aviation BATteries. This fast-track project will look at ways of designing modular and scalable battery systems that can be adapted for different aviation applications.

POWER4AIR

Spanish SME Skylife Engineering leads POWER4AIR, which targets the challenges of arc fault detection, electromagnetic interference and reliability in high-voltage power electronics. These are essential elements for making electric and hybrid-electric propulsion safe and certifiable.

LIME

French start-up Ascendance Flight Technologies will coordinate LIME – Lithium based Innovation for Modular Energy. The project is expected to explore lithium-based modular energy systems that can be scaled and integrated into aircraft designs.

HERACLES

HERACLES – Hybrid Electric Regional Aircraft Concept for Low EmissionS – is another ATR-led project. Unlike DEMETRA, which is demonstrator-focused, HERACLES will concentrate on conceptual design and environmental assessment of hybrid-electric regional aircraft, providing the analytical foundation for future models.

ACI&I

Finally, Airbus is also responsible for ACI&I, or Short Medium Range – Aircraft Configuration Integration and Impact. This project will examine how various new propulsion and airframe technologies integrate in short- to medium-range aircraft, evaluating the performance and environmental impact of different configurations.

What happens next

Although the projects have been selected, their official launch depends on finalising grant agreements, expected by the end of 2025. Work will formally begin in early 2026, with development efforts running into the latter part of the decade.

The most ambitious undertakings, including PHARES, DEMETRA and TAKE OFF, are aiming for flight testing between 2028 and 2029.

The road ahead is steep. Hybrid-electric propulsion introduces complex systems integration and certification questions, hydrogen storage requires entirely new safety standards, and advanced batteries must meet aviation’s uncompromising performance and reliability demands. By pooling public funding, industrial expertise and fresh thinking from smaller players, Clean Aviation hopes to overcome these hurdles.

If the programme delivers on its ambitions, Europe could see the first genuinely climate-friendly regional and short-medium range aircraft entering service by 2035. That would not only bring the sector closer to its net-zero targets but also help secure Europe’s place at the forefront of global aerospace innovation.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/plane-flight-sky-travel-aircraft-sunset-1575625-pxhere.com_.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 12:04:00.778600

As national delegations, activists and other attendees struggle to find affordable places to stay by November, with some deciding not to go at all, Tilvawala, who lives in London, has spent hours working from afar to find lodging in Belem, negotiate prices and contracts and put down deposits. She did all that to create a housing portal specifically for young people who want to be part of the international conference. If not enough people sign up for the housing she’s secured, she might lose some of what she’s put down.

“There’s always a huge number of fossil fuel company representatives there. And who’s going to be there to combat those voices and those negotiating influences?” said Tilvawala, founder and executive director of the global organization Youth Climate Collaborative. “So I was like, ‘We need to be here.’”

With less than two months before this year’s Conference of the Parties, or COP30, only about 36% of the 196 participating countries have confirmed attendance and paid for accommodations, according to a spokesperson for the conference presidency.

Activists and poorer nations are feeling the crunch as hotel prices have skyrocketed and even private homes, love motels and other makeshift accommodation options are charging a minimum of several hundred dollars a night.

The Brazilian government chose Belem because it’s part of the Amazon and to underscore the problems common to growing cities in the developing world, but some prospective attendees are raising questions about how productive the talks will be if they are overshadowed by a big drop in attendance.

Many haven’t confirmed housing yet, and the pressure is on

The Brazilian government has taken steps to address the problem. Climate Minister Marina Silva said 10 to 20 rooms have been made available “at accessible prices” for vulnerable countries. The government has also brought in two large cruise ships that can house as many as 6,000 people.

“Everybody will have access to participate in COP30,” Silva said at a recent press briefing. “Facing climate change must be done by all of us, by all the parties of the convention and especially by those who are already living the consequences of climate change.”

But U.N. Climate Change executive secretary Simon Stiell sent a letter on Sept. 9 asking that agencies in the U.N. system, and related organizations, review how many people they’re sending to COP30 and reduce it where possible.

To add to the pressure, a construction workers’ strike started Sept. 15 and includes areas being worked on for COP30.

A challenge for a city chosen to illustrate climate realities

Belem was initially excited to host the conference, said Arnaldo Vaz Neto, a Brazilian financial adviser who has been working with an organization called the Young Scholars Initiative as an intermediary between locals and COP30 visitors seeking housing. “It’s kind of taught in our childhood to have this behavior of hospitality,” he said.

But that was followed by the realization that the United Nations had high international standards for its guests. It was difficult to manage expectations on both sides, Vaz Neto said.

Belem isn’t the only city hosting a U.N. climate conference where lodging rates have gone far higher than usual. Silva said it’s happened at nearly all such conferences, with prices three or even four times market rates.

“A lot of people here are expecting to charge $1,000 a night but that’s beyond the average,” Hugo Pinheiro, a secretary who works for K Pine Mobile in Belem, and has worked to match delegations with housing and to negotiate on prices.

The “accessible” rooms made available by the Brazilian government will rent for between $200 and $600 a night, according to a COP30 presidency spokesperson.

Brazilian officials have expressed confidence that all 196 nations will find housing and come to Belem. In a statement, the presidency said it expects 50,000 participants and Belem currently offers 53,000 beds. That’s fewer people than recent COPs, even though the Brazil meeting is considered one of the most important negotiations in years because countries have to update and strengthen their carbon pollution plans.

Hard decisions

Still, housing is making it more difficult for people from some poorer countries and Indigenous groups to attend, as well as for those that traditionally attend COP outside of a country delegation, including activists, NGO and nonprofit groups and youth observers. Some organizations that represent them expect to send fewer people.

Hailey Campbell leads Care About Climate, a youth-oriented NGO that was one of the first of its kind to be accredited to attend COP over 10 years ago. Campbell said her group has “never faced such difficulties with access to accommodation.” The group posted about the issue on Instagram with the hashtag “#DontPriceUsOut.”

Many individual attendees have already decided they can’t come. Others are on the fence. Some who will attend are considering options like camping in a tent.

This year Hikaru Hayakawa said he’s heard from more people who have decided not to go than he remembers at this time in years past — already maybe 30 or 40 people, by his estimate.

That’s worrisome because many activists from other countries will now miss out on experiencing the strong civil society culture in Brazil, said Hayakawa, executive director of Climate Cardinals, which translates climate information and trains young people.

“It could potentially be lost opportunity to build these global networks,” he said.

As tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google race to build energy-hungry data centers, utilities are saying that the billions needed for new power plants and grid upgrades could drive up bills for residents and small businesses.

What's happening?

Driven by the explosive growth of artificial intelligence, the number of massive data centers across the country is soaring. These facilities now consume more than 4% of the nation's electricity, with analysts warning that figure could triple to 12% in just three years.

To keep pace, utilities are being asked to spend billions on new power plants and grid upgrades. Those costs are traditionally passed on to everyone, meaning residents and small businesses could see higher bills even if they aren't using more energy, according to a report from The New York Times. In Ohio, households are already paying about $15 more per month because of data centers.

Why are data centers concerning?

Nationally, electricity rates for residents have already jumped more than 30% since 2020, and experts say data center demand could supercharge those increases. A joint study from Carnegie Mellon and North Carolina State projects that average household power bills could rise by another 8% by 2030 — and even more than 25% in states like Virginia, where data centers are proliferating.

Regulators warn that utilities are being pushed into ""extremely new territory,"" with projects being greenlit faster and on a larger scale than ever before. Consumer advocates are worried that homes and small businesses will be stuck paying for Big Tech's massive expansion. ""Our wallets cannot be strained anymore,"" wrote one resident to state regulators, per the Times. ""Make them pay their own bills like we do!""

What's being done to protect everyday consumers?

Some regulators are pushing back. Ohio recently ruled unanimously against a proposal from Amazon, Microsoft, and Google that would have shifted more costs onto regular folks, instead requiring data centers to cover a larger share of their own expenses. Similar debates are underway in Virginia and other states where data centers have multiplied.

At the same time, companies like Amazon argue they are investing in renewable power and efficiency, including electric delivery vans and wind and solar farms. Still, those efforts may be overshadowed by the immense energy demand.

For consumers, watchdog groups recommend staying engaged with local authorities and supporting policies that ensure large corporate users pay their fair share. On a personal level, adopting energy-efficiency upgrades at home could help offset rising costs. Even so, the larger battle will depend on whether regulators hold Big Tech accountable for the true cost of its growth.

Frequent power outages caused by wildfires, storms, and aging infrastructure have created demand for reliable, safe, and long-lasting storage, which flow batteries can provide.

Europe

European countries such as Germany, the U.K, and France are expanding wind and solar capacity, leading to higher variability in power supply. Flow batteries help store excess renewable energy and deliver it during peak demand, supporting grid stability.

The EU’s Clean Energy Package and Electricity Market Design reform enhance storage integration and grid access. National mandates such as the UK’s Fit-for-55, Italy’s capacity auctions, and Germany’s grid-scale tenders are creating bankable markets for flow batteries, thus driving the Europe’s market growth.

Asia Pacific

Asia Pacific is the dominating region and has largest flow battery energy storage market share. Rapid solar and wind deployment across China, Japan, Australia, and Southeast Asia is creating significant demand for long-duration storage to balance grid supply and demand. China's five-year plan mandates energy storage for solar and wind projects, driving large-scale deployments such as the 400 MWh Dalian Vanadium flow battery.

Rest of the World

In rest of the world, Latin America is deploying vast amounts of solar and wind, nearly 319 GW of utility-scale projects by 2030, to diversify energy sources. This renewable surge is creating high demand for long-duration energy storage sources for smooth intermittent supply. Moreover, Gulf nations such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE are aggressively rolling out solar and wind projects as part of national clean energy targets (Saudi 50 % by 2030, UAE 44% by 2050). Battery energy storage, including flow batteries, is essential to integrate intermittent renewables into the grid by storing excess energy and dispatching it when needed.

But according to Takuya Eashiro, head of the Fukue fishing cooperative in Goto, the wind project was imposed ""from the top"" and presented as ""a done deal"".","GOTO, Japan: Close to a small fishing port in southwestern Japan, the slim white turbines of the country's first commercial-scale floating wind farm glimmer offshore, months before a key project in Tokyo's green-energy strategy begins.

Still heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels, Japan has declared offshore wind energy a ""trump card"" in its drive to make renewables its top power source by 2040, and reach carbon neutrality a decade later.

That's despite rising project costs and fears over inadequate infrastructure to produce turbines en masse.

Floating turbines are particularly well suited to Japan as its deep coastal waters make fixing them to seabeds tricky, while the country is also prone to natural disasters.

""Floating structures are relatively stable even in the case of earthquakes or typhoons,"" said Kei Ushigami, head of marine renewable energy for construction company Toda, a key player in the project.

The eight turbines, sitting 5km off the coast of the Goto Islands in waters up to 140m deep, will officially start turning in January.

It's hoped they'll aid the archipelago in reaching ambitious new targets laid out this year that should see wind's contribution to the energy mix soar to between four and eight per cent by 2040, up from around one per cent today.

But it's a long, hard road ahead for resource-scarce Japan - the world's fifth-largest carbon dioxide emitter - to wean itself off fossil fuels.

In 2024, 65 percent of its electricity needs were met by coal and hydrocarbon-powered thermal plants, while just over a quarter came from renewables, according to Japan's Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies.

HERCULEAN TASK

Costs are also rising sharply, and at the end of August Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi pulled out of three key wind power projects deemed no longer profitable.

Other project operators have asked for better support from the government.

""It is important for the government to address shortcomings in the current bidding system, which failed to anticipate rapid global inflation after bids were awarded,"" said Yoko Mulholland from the think tank E3G.

The streamlining of regulatory processes and easing construction restrictions would ""shorten lead times and also lower capital expenditure"", she told AFP.

Hidenori Yonekura, from the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, sees the nascent floating wind energy as a path to eventually lower costs, by installing more turbines in Japan's vast Exclusive Economic Zone of 4.5 million square kilometres.

The task, however, appears Herculean: to meet the 2040 wind target, around 200 15-megawatt turbines a year need to go up.

But ""the infrastructure is not yet in place"", warned Yonekura. ""Japan lacks turbine manufacturers and large production sites.""

FISHERS' LIVELIHOODS

Construction companies also face technical challenges with these still-novel systems: defects discovered in the floating structure of a wind turbine at Goto meant Toda had to make replacements, delaying the project by two years.

Coexistence with local industries, especially fishing, is also crucial.

Toda said it had conducted an environmental assessment and found a pilot project had ""no negative impact on fish"".

Fishermen also receive part of the revenue from electricity sales and some of the property taxes generated by the project, while some have been hired to monitor the construction site with their vessels.

But according to Takuya Eashiro, head of the Fukue fishing cooperative in Goto, the wind project was imposed ""from the top"" and presented as ""a done deal"".

Nevertheless, ""fishermen understand the importance of such a project for Japan"", he said.

The National Federation of Fisheries Co-operative Associations protested to the government after Mitsubishi withdrew, reminding them that fishermen had worked with these projects, hoping for positive economic impacts.

As fishing becomes less viable owing to warming sea temperatures, ""some hope their children or grandchildren will find jobs in wind turbine maintenance"", said Eashiro.","https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--0i4eQ_EP--/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2023-11:afp_watermark_14112023,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2025/09/21/000_68xh3x3.jpg?itok=N8haSEgM",N,,2025-09-21 10:59:11.574696

Key Takeaway Oklo and NuScale are riding a nuclear revival, fueled by regulatory breakthroughs and AI’s energy hunger.","A Nuclear Surge Ignites Investor Frenzy

On Friday, shares of Oklo (NYSE:OKLO) and NuScale Power (NYSE:SMR) blasted over 20% higher, electrified by the U.S.-U.K. Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy, signed ahead of President Trump’s recent London visit.

This game-changing deal aligns the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission with the U.K.’s regulator, reducing SMR licensing timelines from about three to four years to roughly two years. U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright — a former fossil fuels executive — called it a “nuclear renaissance” and plans similar pacts with Poland, Romania, and others to power AI data centers and end Russian nuclear material reliance by 2028.

The agreement unlocks billions of dollars for SMR projects, like U.K. data centers in Nottinghamshire. With Oklo skyrocketing 537% year-to-date and NuScale up 160% in 2025, investors are wondering if these nuclear stocks are still a buy, or has the uranium train left the station?

Oklo (OKLO)

Oklo is a Santa Clara startup founded in 2013 by MIT alumni Jacob and Caroline DeWitte that is redefining nuclear power with its Aurora microreactors. These 15 to 50 megawatt electrical (MWe) fast-fission units — that are scalable to 100 MWe — run on recycled nuclear waste, offering meltdown-proof safety, passive cooling, and a 10-year fuel cycle.

Targeting off-grid clients such as data centers, military bases, and remote communities, Oklo sells power via long-term contracts, not reactors, and produces radioisotopes as a bonus. Backed by Sam Altman, Oklo has secured strategic partnerships with companies like Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) for data center power and is prepping a 2027 debut in Idaho.

The U.S.-U.K. deal easing licensing requirements sparked Friday’s 28.8% surge to $135.23 per share by promising faster Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval — Oklo was denied a combined license for its Aurora microreactor in 2022 — and European pilots. Oklo’s 537% YTD gain reflects AI energy demand, its February Atomic Alchemy acquisition for isotope tech, and Trump’s May executive orders to quadruple U.S. nuclear capacity to 400 gigawatts by 2050.

Yet, because Oklo is pre-revenue with a $30.7 million cash burn against guidance for $65 million to $80 million in annual cash use, Oklo’s $20 billion market valuation is a bet on execution. Because it is trading on its potential rather than operational performance, it is best-suited for risk-tolerant investors. Dips below $100 per share could yield 50% to 100% upside if global SMR deals materialize, but expect a volatile ride getting there.

NuScale Power (SMR)

NuScale Power leads the SMR race with its VOYGR plants that are 77 MWe modules scalable up to 924 MWe per plant. As the only NRC-certified SMR design since 2022, NuScale’s factory-built approach cuts costs for utilities, industrials, and hyperscalers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google.

NuScale’s compact reactors are just 65 feet tall and use simplified pressurized water systems, reducing construction timelines and risks compared to traditional plants. Its 2025 wins include Romania’s Doicesti plant, where it will help deliver 462 MW of installed capacity, a 6 gigawatt (GW) Tennessee Valley Authority deal, partnering with ENTRA1 to commercialize its SMR technology inside ENTRA1’s power plants, and talks for a Polish project by 2029.

The U.S.-U.K. pact drove Friday’s 22% jump to $46.77 per share, bringing it within 12% of its all-time high of $53.50 per share hit in July. Its 160% YTD surge ties to revenue in Q2 that surged to $8.1 million from $1 million a year ago, DOE’s $400 million SMR funding, and AI hype.

Because NuScale is the only NRC-certified SMR operator and has a global pipeline, it provides the nuclear stock with a wide competitive moat, making SMR a strong buy. At almost $47 per share, it’s undervalued with 30% to 50% upside on international deployments, meaning you haven’t missed out on the opportunity to have your portfolio radiate stellar gains.

Key Takeaway

Oklo and NuScale are riding a nuclear revival, fueled by regulatory breakthroughs and AI’s energy hunger. Supply chain risks and fuel costs linger, but Secretary Wright’s global push signals a trillion-dollar SMR market. These stocks still have room to glow for bold investors.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/OKLO-Reactor.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 10:00:32.293276

The Japanese manufacturer will produce two new electric vehicle models in the country. This move aims to reduce costs and avoid the effects of tariffs.

This move takes place in a context of trade tensions. Donald Trump's policies imposed a 25% tax on cars manufactured abroad. Now Toyota is speeding up the production transition within the United States.

Two new electric vehicles will be manufactured in the United States

The stars of this announcement will be the electric versions of the RAV4 and Land Cruiser. Both models are brand benchmarks and will have three rows of seats, reinforcing their profile as family vehicles. The strategy aims to keep the essence of the best-selling SUVs, but with a sustainable focus.

The production of these models will be concentrated at the Georgetown, Kentucky plant. In addition, Toyota is strategically reorganizing its capacity at the Kentucky and Indiana plants. This opens the door to more future announcements about new vehicles manufactured in the United States.

The decision also secures jobs in Kentucky. The factory had lost workload after the next-generation Lexus ES returned to Japan in 2021. With these new models, Toyota strengthens its commitment to local employment and to an increasingly competitive market.

A direct response to tariffs

The strategy is part of a broader move among manufacturers. The Trump administration imposed tariffs with the intention of forcing brands to produce on U.S. soil. General Motors, Honda, and BMW had already announced similar plans to strengthen their domestic manufacturing.

Those who didn't adapt passed the costs on to consumers. In fact, Ford raised prices by two thousand euros on vehicles produced in Mexico. Meanwhile, Volkswagen and Subaru also applied considerable percentage increases to several of their models.

The effect on the market has multiplied. Used car prices remain high after the semiconductor crisis between 2020 and 2023. The shortage of new models reduced the supply of second-hand vehicles and raised repair costs, with an 8.5% (8.5%) increase in September.

Consumers bear the bill

Analysts warn that tariffs will keep pushing prices up. Michael DeLong, from the U.S. Consumers Federation, pointed out that the taxes don't benefit the buyer. According to him, costs are rising in all segments, including cars imported by individuals.

There is no shortage of examples. An Arizona resident had to pay six thousand euros just to re-enter the country with his own car. In addition, insurers project a nationwide increase of at least 8% in premiums for 2025, reaching up to 13% in some states.

In this context, Toyota's strategy is not only industrial but also competitive. The brand avoids price increases on its electric SUVs and strengthens its presence in the United States. The move aims to secure customers who increasingly value cost stability in a volatile market.",https://estoesatleti.es/filesedc/uploads/image/post/2025/07/toyota-coche-estados-unidos_1200_800.webp,N,,2025-09-21 10:59:50.279020

Emobi and ElectricFish Partnership Combines Speed, Compatibility

The partnership merges Emobi’s patented JustPlug technology with ElectricFish’s microgrid-scale energy storage and fast charging systems. Together, they address two of the biggest barriers to EV adoption — charging speed and grid infrastructure limitations.

Emobi’s JustPlug technology enables 80% of existing EVs and chargers—lacking native Plug & Charge features—to access seamless automatic charging. It also strengthens security with encryption and certificate authentication.

ElectricFish’s 350Squared system delivers 133% faster charging than traditional hardware while reducing grid upgrade costs by up to 90% through advanced power electronics and battery integration.

Traditional EV charger installations often face delays of up to two years and costs exceeding $100,000 due to required grid upgrades. The Emobi and ElectricFish partnership removes these barriers by enabling grid-independent fast charging. Operators gain interoperability, enhanced security, and the ability to offer Plug & Charge capabilities without costly hardware replacement, the companies said.

That means people who want to take advantage of them before they disappear have to act quickly.

""There is still time, but the clock is ticking,"" said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we've got some tips on how to maximize savings.

WHAT ARE THESE TAX INCENTIVES?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren't capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

WHEN ARE THE CREDITS EXPIRING?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that ""as soon as you hear this message.""

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it's also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. ""You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,"" she said.

The car doesn't need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

WHAT SHOULD I PRIORITIZE FOR MY HOME?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

""That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,"" she said. ""Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.""

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

""We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn't mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,"" Pierce said.

""Experts estimate that takes 16 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that's quick,"" said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. ""You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it's even possible.""

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

WHAT IF TAX CREDITS EXCEED WHAT I OWE?

OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren't allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects -- think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage -- could be carried forward if you didn't get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

Rewiring America said it's not clear if that will continue given the accelerated expiration dates, and recommended consumers check with their tax adviser.

Katie Muth toured a small data center in her suburban Philadelphia district this May, she was mostly impressed by what she found. It was quiet and impeccably clean–a largely unintrusive presence even in a wealthy enclave where some of the closest neighbors live in million-dollar homes. But in one corner of the facility, Muth found the source of growing concern in the state.

""The engineer that worked there showed us this cabinet farm that was kind of lightly shaking. It was very warm,"" Muth said. ""And he said it was an AI cabinet farm and that at certain times of the day, this sucker is just revving up.""

The copious amounts of power such AI servers require are already driving up energy bills for consumers in the state. Since her visit, Muth has announced plans to introduce the ""Pennsylvania Ratepayer Protection Act,"" just one of at least a dozen proposed or planned bills in Pennsylvania's legislature addressing the hottest industrial issue in the commonwealth.

Some of the bills aim to further ramp up data center development by modifying permitting and zoning procedures. Other legislation, including a package of bills under the banner of Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro's ""Lightning Plan,"" seeks to combine permitting reform with policies focused on clean energy and consumer costs.

Whether any of them will find their way through the morass of Pennsylvania's divided government remains to be seen.

Proponents of AI development view the technology's arrival as the dawn of a new industrial era in this resource-rich state, following booms of iron, coal, natural gas and, more recently, e-commerce warehouses. Speaking at a Pennsylvania Senate hearing in August, Merle Madrid, senior manager of public policy for Amazon Web Services, said his company's $20 billion investment in the state would create at least 1,250 new ""high-skilled"" jobs, support thousands of others and provide other benefits to host communities.

""Our investment in the commonwealth isn't just financial, it's also in the people and future of Pennsylvania,"" Madrid said.

Others–such as John Quigley, a former secretary of the state's Department of Environmental Protection and now senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania–view likening AI to major industries of the past as a cautionary tale. The state has a long legacy of unresolved industrial pollution, and some of the economic promises have fallen short.

""Pennsylvania's history is, we roll out the red carpet for every industry, regardless of whether its impacts are known or unknown,"" Quigley said. ""Then we find out later we made a mistake. … I don't see too much indication we're not on the same track.""

Muth is most interested in addressing the state's swiftly rising energy costs, a dynamic playing out across a 13-state territory overseen by electric grid operator PJM Interconnection. Stretching from Chicago to Jersey to eastern North Carolina, it's the nation's largest grid and includes all of Virginia and Pennsylvania, which consulting firm Wood Mackenzie ranks second and third among all states for announced data center development.

On June 1, many Pennsylvanians saw their electricity rates increase between 5 and 12 percent–and some as much as 40 percent–according to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. And more is on the way. Each year, PJM holds ""capacity auctions"" for energy generation, which influence consumer costs by effectively balancing electricity supply against projected demand. Quigley notes that this summer's auction was a record-setting $16 billion, more than seven times the total from just two years ago.

PJM predicts the latest auction will cause energy bills to rise by another 1.5 to 5 percent next year. While the organization says costs are increasing for several reasons, including electrification and regular economic growth, its independent market monitor cites data centers as the primary and ""unprecedented"" cause, accounting for about $9.3 billion of this year's prices.

Muth's upcoming legislation is focused on yet another factor in costs: transmission. New industrial facilities that use copious amounts of electricity, like data centers, often require new power lines and other energy infrastructure to operate. In Pennsylvania, that's the domain of transmission companies like PECO and PPL, which pass along the costs of building new distribution lines to customers.

Muth said her bill is modeled on existing policies in Oregon that require ""high-load"" customers to fully cover the costs of infrastructure created for their benefit.

""I think the general public, all party affiliations, don't want to pay these increased utility bills. They can't afford them,"" Muth said. ""I can remember my own grandmother saying, 'I don't want to turn on the air conditioner because I don't want my electricity bill to go up.' And I hate to think that people have to make those decisions and sit there and suffer.""

But garnering the support of her colleagues will likely prove difficult. The state's politics are increasingly acrimonious: The Republican-controlled Senate and Democrat-occupied House and governor's office have butted heads, most recently over a state budget that is now more than two months overdue. Some in the state capital of Harrisburg, such as Elizabeth Marx, executive director of the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project, doubt there's much room for compromise.

""I do not see the Pennsylvania General Assembly breaking gridlock on any energy issues anytime soon,"" Marx said. ""While there are some common threads of agreement that we need to protect consumers from increased rates as a result of data centers, there is not agreement on the 'how.'""

Still, others say AI-related legislation is important to track, as it shapes the policy landscape in which a future deal may be forged. And some kind of action may become unavoidable as consumer costs–and anger–rises, said Katie Blume, political and legislative director of the nonprofit advocacy group Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania.

""We need to socialize these ideas with the legislature, with the public, and we need to make sure that people are brought into conversations who are going to be impacted by these things,"" Blume said. ""And I think the Senate Republicans who always say, 'We don't want to do anything on energy right now,' are going to be in between a rock and a hard place before too long.""

Power Plays

On the surface, there does appear to be at least some common ground among Pennsylvania lawmakers on AI data center development: getting more of it.

In Pittsburgh in early July, U.S. Senator Dave McCormick, a Pennsylvania Republican, convened an Energy and Innovation Summit that drew both President Donald Trump and Shapiro. All three expressed excitement over what McCormick says is more than $90 billion in investments announced by tech companies in the state.

The legislature has previously found its way to a deal in the space. In 2021, a tax bill that included a measure to strengthen an existing tax credit for purchasing servers and other equipment for large data centers in the state passed with wide bipartisan support. The incentive currently costs the state about $43 million in tax revenue a year, and Shapiro's office projects it will eclipse $50 million annually by the end of the decade. But politicians, including Shapiro himself, have cited it as key to growing the industry in the state, with a spokesperson for the governor telling Spotlight PA that it will ""generate hundreds of millions of dollars in new tax revenue for state and local governments.""

Shapiro's Lightning Plan is a package of six bills that, altogether, seek to create a new ""streamlined"" permitting process for key energy projects, create new tax incentives for diverse energy sources, create a cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions, bolster renewable energy and attempt to address energy costs in rural and low-income communities. Although the package does not directly address the buildout of AI data centers, it focuses on spurring new energy generation needed by the power-hungry sector and is similar to some other bills specifically addressing AI.

Many of the Lightning Plan measures, such as the carbon program, are supported by Democratic rank-and-file members seeking effective climate policy. But those focused on permitting reform bear similarities to AI bills introduced by Republicans. Senate Bill 939, introduced by Republican state Sen. Greg Rothman with at least one Democratic co-sponsor, proposes creating a ""Commonwealth Opportunity Zone"" that would create a fast-track permitting process for data centers, as well as a ""regulatory sandbox"" encouraging deregulation.

""This innovative, collaborative framework will enable industry leaders to work directly with state agencies to identify and remove unnecessary and outdated regulations, thereby streamlining the development process and accelerating innovation,"" Rothman's office, which did not respond to inquiries from Inside Climate News, stated in a press release announcing the proposal.

A Republican colleague in the House, Rep. Jason Ortitay, introduced a bill to create a ""Keystone Artificial Intelligence Authority"" to similarly ""streamline and coordinate"" permitting through a new, centralized process. Other Republicans say they are preparing to introduce measures also designed to accelerate data-center permitting and create new tax incentives, with some bipartisan support.

Asked to comment for this story, Shapiro's office touted a focus on permit reform, noting the governor already established an Office of Transformation and Opportunity ""as a one-stop-shop for businesses looking to grow in the Commonwealth."" In 2024, his administration also launched the PA Permit Fast Track Program, which it calls an innovative permitting system to ""expedite major economic development and infrastructure projects,"" including a data center campus in Northeast Pennsylvania.

""Governor Shapiro is laser-focused on getting stuff done and taking real action to lower Pennsylvanians' energy costs through his commonsense, all-of-the-above energy plan to build more power in the Commonwealth, create a more reliable, affordable energy grid, and position the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come,"" his office said in a prepared statement.

Among the points of conflict: Several Harrisburg insiders say Shapiro and Republican Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman are at loggerheads on energy policy over the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a cap-and-trade program spanning 10 neighboring states. Shapiro's predecessor, Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, joined the program in 2022, but Pennsylvania's participation is tied up in the commonwealth's courts.

Shapiro's administration has defended the initiative in court but has floated PACER–the bill in the Lightning Plan that would create a state-run ""cap-and-invest"" program–as a preferred alternative.

Pittman's office did not respond to requests for comment. But the senator previously told Spotlight PA the pending RGGI case leaves his caucus ""very limited"" in considering energy-related legislation, a dynamic that others say remains the status quo.

A Call From Inside the House

Some of Shapiro's policies also face opposition from members of his own party, particularly RESET, another Lightning Plan bill. The legislation's primary sponsor, state Rep. Mandy Steele, says it would create a ""central cohesive authority"" to approve siting applications for large energy-generating facilities.

Muth said that opposition to the bill from some southeast Pennsylvania Democrats crystallized in June when the House Energy Committee held a hearing on the legislation. A bevy of environmental groups came out against it for fear the new state board could support new fossil fuel infrastructure while local officials objected to losing authority over siting.

The bill has the support of several Democratic committee members, labor organizations and environmental groups. The Natural Resources Defense Council and the Nature Conservancy think the board will boost clean energy buildouts.

Muth says she's seen some potential Republican support percolating for the bill, which leads her to believe that deals could be coming, perhaps in next year's budget negotiations, if not in the one still ongoing.

""My fear is we're going to have this dumped into something,"" Muth said. ""It could happen tomorrow.""

Quigley, the energy expert and former DEP secretary, believes that if something does emerge from the legislature, it will likely focus primarily on deregulation and industry incentives, rather than consumer costs or environmental protection. Both the state's powerful natural gas lobby and trade unions support AI development, he notes.

""There's this rush to deregulate, to accommodate this industry that no one is prepared for,"" Quigley said.

State Rep. Greg Vitali, another Southeast Pennsylvania Democrat and chair of the House Environmental & Natural Resource Protection Committee, is also concerned environmental considerations could be overlooked in the push for more AI and energy to feed it.

He notes that both the cap-and-trade bill PACER, as well as a PRESS bill that would require more renewables to be added to the state's energy mix, have stalled even in the Democratically controlled chamber. The latter bill, he believes, has been held up after fossil fuel lobbyists convinced some House Democrats that a measure diminishing waste coal's status in the energy mix would be harmful.

Vitali adds there's also little to no activity in the House grappling with any climate or environmental harms directly generated by AI data center development. Natural gas may end up powering much of the nation's data-center growth, and many of the tech promises to the contrary are short on details.

""When the governor announces his $20 billion deal with Amazon, you don't hear any discussion of climate impacts. … It just seems to be one of the things people forget about,"" Vitali said. ""I think legislators are discouraged from talking about any issue in terms of climate because it's almost become like a poison pill in anything you want to get through the Senate.""

Quigley says history has shown that ""legislators always play catch-up"" to new industries, and believes that will be the case with AI as well.

""These data centers can potentially use millions of gallons of water a day … and nobody's raised the issue, nobody's planned for it,"" Quigley said, adding that millions of Pennsylvanians rely on groundwater wells for drinking water.

In an email, Amazon Web Services says its company is focused on efficiency and sustainability, with ongoing plans to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 and be ""water positive"" by 2030, returning more water to communities than it uses.

""Amazon is continually improving water efficiency, using advanced cloud services, such as internet of things technologies, to analyze real time water use, identify and fix leaks, and gain other efficiencies,"" the company said in its statement. ""Amazon is further improving operational efficiency to reduce cooling water use in many facilities for most of the year, instead by relying on outside air.""

Mind Your Ps and Queues

In the absence of legislative action, policies set by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission and PJM could have an outsize effect.

The PUC is a quasi-independent state agency whose directors are appointed to terms by the governor. In April, the commission held a hearing about a potential ""model tariff"" on AI data center development, which Marx said could help ensure ""large load"" customers like data centers pay for any transmission costs they generate. The PUC could also facilitate rate assistance programs requiring companies to help low-income residents afford their energy bills, Marx said.

The release of a model tariff is expected soon: PUC spokesperson Dave Hixson told Inside Climate News that the commission is drafting a proposal with a goal to issue it ""in the near future.""

Quigley adds that PJM is also taking steps to consider new policies, including measures that would require data centers to ""bring their own power"" to the grid instead of eating into existing capacity.

""So there's two positive things,"" Quigley said.

Jackson Morris, director of state power sector policy for the Natural Resources Defense Council, notes that, like the Pennsylvania legislature, PJM has also been subject to criticism over gridlock. Its new power generation queue remains backed up and renewable energy projects buried. He thinks something will have to give way to the pressures of the new AI paradigm.

""You've literally got governors running for office talking about PJM capacity, market reforms. Two, three years ago, you never heard a governor say the letters PJM,"" Morris said. ""We're not living in that world anymore.""",https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/AI_data_centers_PA.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 10:00:48.044597

The kind of utility-scale solar and wind farms that will be necessary to meet internationally binding climate goals require huge amounts of undeveloped land.
Figuring out how to provide solar panels and crops with optimal sunlight on the same land is not so simple.
Researchers from Aarhus University have developed a full-scale solar plant that uses vertically mounted solar panels for optimal output for solar energy and crops alike.
""Our measurements show that wheat and grass-clover mixtures grow just as well between vertical solar panels as in open fields.","In 2023, world leaders pledged to triple global renewable energy capacity by the end of this decade at the COP28 climate conference in Dubai. Meeting this goal will require an unprecedented buildout of renewable energy projects, both in speed and in scale. And all of those projects are going to require a whole lot of land, presenting serious challenges for land use strategies.

The kind of utility-scale solar and wind farms that will be necessary to meet internationally binding climate goals require huge amounts of undeveloped land. “Utility-scale solar and wind farms require at least ten times as much space per unit of power as coal- or natural gas–fired power plants, including the land used to produce and transport the fossil fuels,” says a 2022 report from global consulting powerhouse McKinsey & Company. “Wind turbines are often placed half a mile apart, while large solar farms span thousands of acres.”

And, while the vast land tracts that these projects are targeting are undeveloped, it doesn’t mean that they are unused or unpopulated. “These developments often intersect with agricultural zones, conservation areas and Indigenous territories,” explains Renewable Energy Magazine in an article released earlier this year. Plus, the rural areas that have the most undeveloped land are often the most resistant to large-scale renewable energy projects, leading to tense political flare-ups and litigious gridlock that can keep projects tied up in court for years.

Finding land-use agreements that allow for mixed-use plots will be essential to achieving the renewable energy buildout we need without compromising agricultural production, rural livelihoods, and food security. Some farmers have rented out their land to solar developers, but this practice can be risky, with grave consequences for the topsoil. Solar farms, if they clear the land of all vegetation, can create prime conditions for erosion, making that land unsuitable for agriculture more or less permanently. “The reality is that it takes thousands of years to create an inch of fertile topsoil,” warns National Geographic, “but it can be destroyed in minutes.”

But marrying solar power and agriculture on the same land at the same time could provide a win-win for both sectors. The practice, called agrivoltaics, is not a new concept, but it hasn’t reached a commercial scale since its conception in the 1980s. Figuring out how to provide solar panels and crops with optimal sunlight on the same land is not so simple. “A pressing question is how AV technology can maximize crop productivity and energy generation while minimizing plant water loss and irrigation needs,” Phys.org wrote in a 2023 report. “That's a lot to ask for on a piece of land.”

But a new pilot project in Denmark seems to have cracked the code. Researchers from Aarhus University have developed a full-scale solar plant that uses vertically mounted solar panels for optimal output for solar energy and crops alike. ""Our measurements show that wheat and grass-clover mixtures grow just as well between vertical solar panels as in open fields. At the same time, the panels produce electricity in a daily pattern that better matches energy demand. It's a win-win,"" Marta Victoria, lead author of the study and Associate Professor at the Department of Mechanical and Production Engineering, Aarhus University, told Tech Xplore.

Critically, the solar panels only took up about 10% of the land, allowing for successful metrics from both the agricultural and the photovoltaic sides of the agrivoltaic model. The study, recently published in the scientific journal Energy Nexus, yielded excellent results in full sun as well as with conditions of some shade. ""Even with some shade, the yield per square meter is almost the same. The crops don't seem to mind the presence of solar panels and they like the wind protection that they provide,"" explains Professor Uffe Jørgensen from the Department of Agroecology.

Evans isn’t the only Coloradan participating in Problem Solvers; GOP Rep. Jeff Hurd and Democratic Rep. Brittany Pettersen are members of the caucus.","The bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus is hoping to have lightning strike twice.

The group, which released a framework for infrastructure that eventually became law under the Biden Administration, has released a new policy plan — this time an approach to permitting reform that they think has a chance of getting through Congress.

“One of the things that we've been trying to get rolling in our group is the generation of two-party solutions on some key areas that we think are going to determine the success or failure of our country over the next decade,” said co-chair Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican from Pennsylvania. “Energy and permitting reform is at the top of that list.”

Colorado GOP Rep. Gabe Evans co-led the working group that developed the framework with California Rep. Scott Peters.

Evans said they had one goal in mind: to streamline the process to get new energy projects — from fossil fuels to renewables — up and running faster.

“We have to make sure that we can navigate our own regulatory environment to be able to build these things here in the United States with some of the best and most environmentally and socially responsible guidelines, really anywhere on the planet,” said Evans.

The framework includes five key goals, starting with cutting red tape and depoliticizing the permitting process. It also seeks to meet the nation’s fast-growing energy demand, reform NEPA requirements, set clear and enforceable permitting deadlines and strengthen domestic supply chains.

Peters noted that other legislators have been introducing bills aimed at many of these goals, including one from the chair of the House Natural Resources Committee called the SPEED Act, which reforms NEPA. “I think ultimately this probably all comes together as a big package, because everyone wants to make sure they’re covered.”

Evans added that having a framework, as opposed to lawmakers introducing specific bills, allows for “greater flexibility to be able to work with all the different stakeholder groups to make sure that we’re getting that input early, that we’re getting that buy-in earlier on.”

This approach, he added, also helps ensure there is a large coalition to support getting the permitting reform package through Congress, where it will need backing from members in both parties to garner the minimum 60 votes to pass the Senate.

The Problem Solvers Caucus pointed out that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law started out just like this.

“Started as a framework, then became a bill. Got endorsed by the group, and it was ultimately a bipartisan coalition that got it over the finish line,” said Fitzpatrick. “And our country is better for that bill. We hope this can be following in those footsteps.”

The group has an aggressive timeline. The SPEED Act could hit the House floor by the end of the year and the group is hopeful they can get a package together by then. One bill they mentioned for inclusion in the package, and that meets the guidelines of the framework, is a Senate permitting reform bill introduced in the last Congress by Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso and former West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin.

Among other things, that bill, the Energy Permitting Reform Act, proposed shortening timelines on litigation for projects, provided two pathways for transmission development and accelerated leasing and permitting decisions for all types of energy projects.

Periodic exposure to dust storms leads to long-term health risks, including cardiovascular disease and lung conditions like asthma.
Last year, the U.N. General Assembly declared 2025 to 2034 as the Decade on Combating Sand and Dust Storms.
So big dust storms are happening earlier and later in the season than they used to, he said.
The Great Plains region faces an increased risk of dust storms and possible desertification, Hallar said.","Dust storms have always swirled through parts of North America, but they are becoming more unexpected and destructive and landing in places unfamiliar with the danger, scientists warn.

In May 2023, a dust storm stalled over parts of central Illinois, disorienting more than 80 motorists on Interstate 55 who crashed into each other, leaving eight people dead and 37 hospitalized. In March this year, Kansas found itself swallowed in a dusty rush of wind that covered Interstate 70, killing eight people in a 71-car pileup. A few months later, Chicago was engulfed by its first torrent of throat-choking dust since 1985. No one was injured in that May storm but visibility was near zero for hours.

In all these cases, the dustups followed a similar script. Thunderstorm winds churned up soil from plowed-open fields and carried it for a short distance. Dust billowed violently, giving people little warning. Scientists from the region are now reviewing and pursuing research to consider whether the ruptures are the start of a new normal for parts of the Midwest.

Agriculture practices have been slow to adapt or anticipate the risks of climate change and particularly droughts, some studies have shown. Dry-tilled fields, notably before spring plantings, are vulnerable to more intense seasonal winds. Kansas knows from history the wreckage of harsh and relentless gusts. A hundred years ago, parts of the Plains states lived through the disastrous Dust Bowl before agricultural irrigation and adaptations were in place.

Will this generation, across the Midwest, have to reckon with a new dust risk rooted in climate change?

Drivers of Dust

Both 2023 and 2025 storms in Illinois happened early in the growing season. In 2023, the winds swept up dust from open fields, just south of Springfield. As it moved eastward, the wind speed rose to roughly 60 mph. Nearby Interstate 55 was in its path.

Eliot Clay, director of the Association of Illinois Soil & Water Conservation Districts, lives near Interstate 55. He was worried shortly before the disaster. “I remember a couple days prior noticing how much dust was in the air, like you could see it,” Clay said. “I remember thinking if this wind shifts and it goes from west to east, there is a major interstate right there. And sure enough, all of that happened a couple days later.”

Complex factors caused the Interstate 55 storm, said Jonathan Coppess, director of the Gardner Agriculture Policy Program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and former administrator of the Farm Service Agency at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. A cold spring season coincided with drought, creating a lot of dust in the fields. The planting season started late and high winds descended. Then there was a bit of bad luck.

Coppess and a team of researchers from the University of Illinois, Texas A&M University and Cornell University studied the 2023 incident and described how the dust storm crossed I-55 and collided with a tree line—a defense often planted close to highways to prevent dust storms and blizzards.

But there was only one tree line along this part of the highway and it, unfortunately, was on the wrong side of the road for this storm.

“If the wind had come from the other direction, there would have been no accident simply because that windbreak would have worked,” Coppess said. “The most interesting to me is how that clump of trees, which is designed basically as a windbreak, ended up concentrating dust right in the accident spot.”

Thomas E. Gill and a team of colleagues in Texas have calculated that the economic risk of such storms is rising and that the U.S. could be losing around $154.4 billion annually due to wind erosion and dust, according to a review of data from 2017.

That number, which includes losses in agriculture and renewable energy, health costs, car accidents and other factors, was based on the limited data they could gather. Gill, an environmental scientist at the University of Texas at El Paso, said the real toll is likely higher.

Gill is one of the leaders at the Dust Alliance for North America, an inter-university partnership that aims to promote more dust-related research and its practical application across the United States and other countries. The accident in Illinois isn’t the only recent dust storm that caused blinding loss of visibility and car crashes, Gill said.

Accidents increasingly have been recorded across the Great Plains and the Pacific Northwest.

Growing dust storms aren’t necessarily warning of a repeat of the Depression-era tragedy, he said. “Rather than seeing a large wholesale dust bowl over a lot of the plains like happened in the 1930s, you might see a bunch of mini dust bowls here and there in various different states and regions,” said Gill, who has published several studies on atmospheric dust.

The United States has better soil and water protection efforts than a century ago. But, he said, “there’s no question that climate change is one of the major drivers of dust.”

Drought and Gusts

So how does a dust storm erupt?

Air is constantly filled with soil and sand particles that move around, playing a key role in spreading minerals. Plants in North and South America are partly dependent on the dust carried all the way from the Sahara Desert by Atlantic winds. But droughts and strong winds can complicate dust movements, leading to serious harm.

A dust storm is an occurrence that reduces visibility to less than one kilometer, according to the World Meteorological Organization, a United Nations agency that promotes international cooperation on atmospheric science, climatology, hydrology and geophysics. Periodic exposure to dust storms leads to long-term health risks, including cardiovascular disease and lung conditions like asthma.

Last year, the U.N. General Assembly declared 2025 to 2034 as the Decade on Combating Sand and Dust Storms. With this initiative, U.N. officials are trying to raise awareness of dust threats and urge more international cooperation.

Dust formation is a mechanical process. It usually happens in two ways, said Barry Baker, a physical research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Air Resources Laboratory.

Wind can make a large dust particle roll on the ground, forming the particles into larger masses. That formation is called a creep.

The other process is called impaction, where the wind is high enough to raise particles off the ground until they fall to earth with calamity. “Whenever it crashes, it throws a bunch of other particles up in the air,” Baker said, “and that then basically cascades more and more and more.”

The increased unpredictable heavy rains and extreme droughts create potential for more dust events, Baker said. These events happen in spring and fall, when the soil is often barren, but now they have started to “even out” throughout the year, he added. So big dust storms are happening earlier and later in the season than they used to, he said.

“When we see dust storms happen, that is the top soil that has taken thousands of years to build up, literally blowing away.”

— Eliot Clay, Association of Illinois Soil & Water Conservation Districts

U.S. farmers have protected their soil with cover crops over the years, notably after the 1930s and in recent decades. But strong spring winds have arrived before planting in the past couple of years, not just confusing drivers on Illinois’ interstate but confounding farmers. The quality of soil is at risk.

“The soil is so good [in Illinois] because it had thousands of years of perennial tall grass prairie on it,” said Clay, who represents the 97 soil and water conservation districts in Illinois. “And that system that existed naturally meant we had root systems that were going deep into the ground.”

“When we see dust storms happen, that is the top soil that has taken thousands of years to build up, literally blowing away,” Clay said.

Altering the Landscape

Anna Gannet Hallar, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Utah, was part of a research team that in 2020 examined space satellite data of expanded farmland within the Midwest/Great Plains region. They explored how climate change and land use has been “altering the landscape, producing increases in windblown dust.”

Hallar said most observed dust increases were significant, linked to land being tilled more often. The Great Plains region faces an increased risk of dust storms and possible desertification, Hallar said.

“We saw doubling [of dust in the air] over 20 years, and we were able to show that that doubling was associated with changes in land use,” Hallar said.

Evan Thaler, a soil health researcher at Oregon State University, said 30 percent of the top-level soil in the Midwest has been lost. “What’s driving the majority of erosion across the landscape is just the mechanical movement of soil by people plowing over and over and over,” Thaler said. “If we’re tilling a lot, it makes the soil susceptible to any type of erosion.”

As the climate crisis accelerates across the planet, it creates conditions for multiyear droughts in many regions, including the United States. Such droughts endanger both plants and soil—which simply doesn’t have enough time to regenerate. Some multiyear droughts turn into megadroughts—among the most severe in centuries.

The U.S. Southwest is currently going through its most intense megadrought in 1,200 years.

Zack Leasor, director of the Missouri Climate Center at the University of Missouri and the state climatologist, said multiyear droughts can lead to much more devastating effects than a one-time event. It takes time for water reservoirs, plants and industry to recover. With a year-after-year drought, they get no break, he explained.

After the Dust Bowl, the Great Plains agriculture industry recovered and relies now on irrigation from underground water sources, Leasor said. That irrigation system helps confront droughts, but the increasing number of megadroughts as climate change worsens will test that adaptation, Leasor warned.

“While groundwater can be kind of a Band-Aid to get you through a drought, it can also turn into a long-term water supply problem,” Leasor said. Groundwater is used up much faster than it can be replenished, he said, and repetitive drought lets less and less moisture from rain reach down into natural underground reservoirs.

While existing irrigation technologies can help, they aren’t going to solve the growing drought problems, Leasor said.

Gill and his research colleagues, meanwhile, found that human casualties from dust storms are roughly on the same level as casualties from hurricanes, thunderstorms or wildfires. Frequently that’s happened in deserts and farm country—places that don’t receive a lot of press coverage.

“A lot of the deleterious effects of dust, of the casualties, as you say, caused by dust, are out of sight, out of mind,” Gill said. “I don’t think we yet really understand or realize as a society in the United States the full risks that dust poses.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WFO-Chicago.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 08:00:06.675962

Wind farms are becoming more common in Indiana. The state already boasts the fourth largest ""farm"" in the U.S. and produces more than 3,500 megawatts of wind energy.

The towering windmills reaching up to the sky produced 10% of all the electricity used in the state in 2023. That's enough to power more than 1 million homes, according to the American Clean Power Association.

With more projects in the works, wind power is likely to continue to grow across the state. And with the increasing presence of the conspicuous energy generators comes some curiosity.

So, for this edition of Scrub Hub, we chose a question from Teresa, who asked: Why are the wind turbines not turning right now?

It’s possible for the blades on wind turbines to reach up to speeds of 200 mph, so it may seem odd when some are spinning very quickly while the blades on others nearby are not moving.

We dug around in some state, federal and industry reports and reached out to academic experts in energy technology to determine why some turbines in a wind farm spin while others remain still.

Short Answer: The turbine is down for maintenance

Wind turbines, like all machines, need both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance. In some instances that explains why some are operating but not others.

The basic components of a wind turbine are the visible tower and rotor blades, as well as the gearbox and generator located at the top of the tower.

Scheduled maintenance helps prevent wear and tear from breaking parts and unscheduled maintenance occurs when the turbine experiences any of a number of failures.

Regular preventative maintenance can include periodic equipment inspection, oil and filter changes, calibration and adjustment of various parts, as well as replacing brake pads and seals. General housekeeping and blade cleaning can also temporarily keep a turbine from spinning.

In larger wind farms, several turbines on a circuit can be inoperable and not spinning because they are all down for maintenance, said John Roudebush, program chair of Ivy Tech College’s Energy Technology program.

Long answer: Curtailment, congestion and wind speed

Energy transmission in Indiana is run through the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, commonly known as MISO. The group manages the flow of electricity by balancing demand versus what’s being generated, which means there are times where excess electricity is being produced.

“(Sometimes) we don’t need the power as demand is down or another power plant is selling power to the customers instead,” Roudebush wrote in an email. “Power plants compete on the grid. A coal plant, a natural gas plant, or a wind farm will all bid to sell power during some part of the day and MISO will pick the cheapest bid for the day. Generally, wind is the cheapest but not always.”

John Hall, assistant professor at the University of Buffalo’s Engineering and Applied Sciences, focuses his research on the technical aspects of wind energy. While some wind turbines will operate normally, he said others may be stopped to match production with grid demand.

“Basically, you have the utility company distributing power and buying and selling in real time,” Hall said. “Based on how much they need, wind farms would turn turbines off accordingly.”

The industry calls a wind turbine that is not spinning “parked,” Hall said, and this is done with a braking system that holds the rotor in place. Once energy demand rises, the brake is released and almost immediately the turbine starts delivering electricity to the grid again.

Another obvious answer to why the turbines may not be spinning is that the wind speed is not high enough.

Generally, turbines can generate power with wind speeds as low as 5 mph. If speeds fall below that, there just isn’t enough to turn the sometimes massive blades.

On the other hand, wind that is too fast can cause damage to the turbines, so operators of wind farms will park the rotors until the wind calms down. Turbines generally shut down when wind speeds hit about 55 mph.

“The system is not designed for that, so they shut it down,” Hall said. “That’s OK because we rarely get winds over that speed, and it would not be worthwhile to design for that for the few instances.”

To help improve the efficiency of wind farms, Hall said banking excess power is a huge research area right now.

“There are studies on new battery technology and super capacitors and different ways to get around that issue,” Hall said.

Another solution for storing excess electricity is by making hydrogen, Hall said. Wind farm operators would be able to create hydrogen and store it for use later when the grid demand increases.

While fossil fuel plants may be more responsive to the constantly moving supply and demand for electricity, Hall said the future depends on renewables.

""If folks are concerned about climate and want a better future for the next generation and everything, renewable energy like wind and hydro-electric and tidal power are all really not just sources of energy but vital to perhaps our existence,"" Hall said.

What Tesla got changed Tesla objected to permit requirements that it said would have cost millions of dollars across a facility’s lifespan.","Tesla successfully fended off proposed environmental regulations in Nevada late last year that would have applied more stringent rules on its battery production operations, according to records obtained by The Nevada Independent.

As the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) sought to create a new regulatory framework governing an array of hazardous materials, the company pushed back — and quickly got its way.

Tesla, which builds battery packs and energy-storage products at its massive Gigafactory east of Reno, argued that regulations proposed by NDEP staff would threaten Nevada’s leading position in a nascent industry that is crucial to diversifying the state’s economy beyond gaming and tourism. The proposed rules would put Nevada “at a disadvantage when competing with other states to grow the lithium-ion battery recycling industry,” a Tesla executive wrote to NDEP in a late October letter.

The proposals would have required companies including Tesla to obtain more onerous permits (which require ongoing compliance reports and could lead to federally mandated spill cleanups but are generally not required for recycling facilities) for certain operations. It also would have required companies to continue following more stringent federal waste regulations related to the handling of hazardous materials, which include scrap metals or sludges that can be ignitable, corrosive, reactive or toxic.

Two days after Tesla wrote NDEP, the company’s lobbyist sent the same letter to Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office, which four days later participated in a meeting with officials from NDEP, Tesla and Redwood Materials, a Northern Nevada battery recycling company started by a co-founder of Tesla. One day after the meeting, held in the governor’s chief of staff’s office and on Microsoft Teams, an updated version of the regulation was sent by NDEP to participants with everything Tesla had asked for in the letter.

“Thank you very much for actioning the industry feedback so swiftly,” a Tesla official emailed the day after receiving the updated regulation.

A panel of state lawmakers later adopted the new rules without controversy.

The previously unreported series of events, revealed in documents obtained from the governor’s office through a public records request, brings into question the role battery companies should have in developing environmental regulations that are designed to keep workers, the public and the environment safe.

Tesla did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Its Nevada lobbyist told The Indy in an email that the company does not comment on media inquiries “as a general rule.”

The governor’s office said in a statement that it “has focused on streamlining regulations and implementing regulations that simultaneously support industry safety standards and pro-business policies,” and that it “regularly works” with industry associations and state agencies to shape regulations.

In an interview with The Indy, NDEP officials said that the governor’s office has no defined role in the regulatory process, but it sometimes is involved.

“Because of the growth of this economic sector, they’re interested in what’s going on,” NDEP Administrator Jennifer Carr said. “The governor’s office did not get involved in our process. … We never feel pressure to do anything from the governor's office.”

State agencies typically oversee the regulatory process, but on rare occasions, the process can involve the governor’s office, according to a former high-ranking state official granted anonymity to speak candidly about internal state regulatory dynamics. However, the source noted it is uncommon for a company to immediately get what it wanted from state officials, and that more back-and-forth could have occurred outside of what the public records revealed.

The governor’s office declined to make Lombardo’s chief of staff or its liaison to NDEP available for an interview, but it did respond to The Indy’s written request for comment.

NDEP received almost 70 comments regarding the proposed regulations, which the agency replied to as part of the normal regulation process. Agency officials told The Indy that it did not intend to make its rules more stringent than federal ones, but realized it had done so after meeting with industry officials.

Similar to many other businesses, Tesla has contracted with a lobbying firm in Nevada (Rowe Law Group) and has also engaged in lobbying efforts in other states, such as when CEO Elon Musk hired a dozen lobbyists in Texas this year to pass legislation advantageous to Tesla and another one of his companies, SpaceX.

Nevada officials across the political spectrum have embraced Tesla and the broader battery industry as a surefire way to expand the state’s tourism-dependent economy. State legislators approved a $1.25 billion tax incentive package for Tesla in 2014 — an unprecedented deal in the Silver State — and in 2023, state officials approved $330 million in additional tax breaks for a corporation valued at more than $1 trillion.

These investments are part of the state’s efforts to create a “lithium loop,” with the goal of encompassing all aspects of the process, from lithium extraction to its processing and eventual recycling.

“Our state has the components to be world leaders in battery development,” Lombardo said last year.

The Nevada Independent is continuing to report on the state’s battery industry. Please fill out this form if you have any information to provide.

What the regulation means

The newly crafted regulation will likely lead to a system where fewer types of hazardous materials in Nevada are designated as waste, meaning there will be fewer requirements for certain companies that deal with hazardous materials.

The regulation was part of a broader effort to create a new framework in Nevada governing “hazardous secondary materials,” which are manufacturing byproducts that are not subject to certain federal waste regulations if they are legitimately recycled and meet other federal criteria. The state must validate that a company is meeting this criteria. .

Corrado DeGasperis, CEO at Comstock Inc., a Northern Nevada-based company that was involved in the battery recycling industry but has since pivoted to solar panel recycling, said under the new framework, companies will be incentivized to recycle their products. Disposing them as waste triggers more government oversight.

“Nevada’s way, way, way better off with these materials being recycled,” DeGasperis said.

In an interview, NDEP Deputy Administrator Jeffrey Kinder said the agency did not intend for the state’s hazardous secondary materials rules to be more stringent than the federal ones. It was only after input from industry officials that the agency recognized its proposed regulation would have been overly restrictive.

“We do sometimes ask for more stringent regulations through our own state process if we think there's a gap in what the federal program does,” he said. “But … that didn't exist. [It] is a fairly robust federal program that's been operating for a number of years in a number of states.”

Six facilities, including Redwood and Tesla, have notified the state they have applied to handle these secondary materials, according to NDEP.

Discarded lithium batteries are typically designated as hazardous waste because of their ignitability and reactivity, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). But because the industry is still in its infancy, the recycling chain for lithium ion batteries is still being developed, according to Nevada lithium experts.

Top NDEP officials said, during their tenure, they have never been tasked with drafting regulations for a sector as large and rapidly evolving as the lithium recycling industry.

What Tesla got changed

Tesla objected to permit requirements that it said would have cost millions of dollars across a facility’s lifespan. These permits require ongoing compliance reports, and the EPA is able to issue orders or file lawsuits to these permitted facilities to require cleanups of spills.

These requirements, according to Tesla’s letter last year to state environmental regulators, could lead some lithium recyclers to “be forced to choose between losing ground to competitors in other states” or “ceasing business altogether.” Battery facilities have long eyed Nevada for its business-friendly environment, particularly the lack of state income tax.

Additionally, under the initial regulation, some materials would have still been classified as hazardous waste — and subject to stricter oversight — because the state did not intend to adopt certain federal rules. However, Tesla said in its letter to regulators that the decision to not adopt these rules “effectively advantages select recyclers, while disadvantaging others.”

Under the revised regulations, NDEP will now be solely responsible for validating whether battery facilities are meeting the requirements for legitimate recycling.

The agency has seven employees overseeing all hazardous waste compliance and enforcement for the entire state — not just for the battery factories.

NEW DELHI — Hitting back at Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav for criticising the Congress for opposing the Great Nicobar infrastructure project, party leader Jairam Ramesh on Sunday said drawing the nation’s attention to an imminent “ecological and humanitarian disaster” is not “negative politics” but an expression of grave concern.

Ramesh said, the minister is simply unable to answer basic questions that Congress has been repeatedly raising on the project, PTI reported.

“The Union Minister of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change Shri Bhupender Yadav has accused the Indian National Congress of doing what he calls ‘negative politics’ on the Great Nicobar mega infrastructure project.

Drawing the nation’s attention to an imminent ecological and humanitarian disaster is NOT ‘negative politics’. It is an expression of grave concern,” Ramesh said on X.

The minister is simply unable to answer basic questions that the INC has been repeatedly raising on the project, he said and asked whether the Great Nicobar Mega Infra Project, which requires the diversion of lakhs of trees, violate the National Forest Policy, 1988 which states that “tropical rain/moist forests, particularly in areas Andaman & Nicobar Islands should be totally safeguarded?”

“Compensatory afforestation is always a poor substitute for old-growth forests but the afforestation planned in this project is farcical.

How can afforestation in distant Haryana, with a completely different ecosystem, be considered a genuine offset for the loss of old-growth rainforest unique to Great Nicobar? Why has the Government of Haryana already freed up 25 per cent of this land for mining instead of reserving it for the afforestation?” Ramesh said.

Why was the National Commission on Scheduled Tribes not consulted before the Nicobar project was approved, he asked.

“Why are the concerns of the Tribal Council of Great Nicobar regarding this project being ignored? Why is the Shompen Policy of the Islands, which explicitly calls for the integrity of the community to be prioritised in all projects, being disregarded?” Ramesh said.

Why does the “Social Impact Assessment” conducted as part of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (RFCTLARR) ignore the existence of the Shompen and the Nicobarese, the Congress leader further asked.

“The Forest Rights Act (2006) holds the Shompen as the sole legally empowered authority to protect, preserve, regulate, and manage the tribal reserve.

Why does the Project’s approval process fail to recognize the same?” Ramesh said.

He pointed out that the island harbours endangered species, including leatherback turtles, megapodes, saltwater crocodiles, and rich coral systems. Won’t this project drive these species closer to extinction, he asked.

“Why are critical documents relating to this project, including the reports of the ground-truthing exercise conducted to reclassify the location of the planned transshipment port from CRZ1-A, not being published in the open?” Ramesh said.

Given the island’s history of severe subsidence during the 2004 tsunami and its location in a high-seismic zone, can the sustainability of this project be assured, he further asked.

“Over twenty years ago, a valuable book was published.

It was called ‘Supreme Court on Forest Conservation’ and it was authored by Ritwick Dutta and Bhupender Yadav.

Sadly the first author has had investigative agencies unleashed against him for his environmental activism – but happily the second author has had a much better fate. When will that Bhupender Yadav awake?” he said.

Yadav last Thursday hit out at the Congress for opposing the Great Nicobar infrastructure project, accusing it of spreading confusion and indulging in “negative politics”.

Speaking at an event organised by The Public Affairs Forum of India here, Yadav asserted that the mega project is crucial for national security and strategic connectivity in the Indian Ocean Region.

Yadav said only 1.78 per cent of Great Nicobar’s forest area will be used for the project.

His remarks came days after Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi, in an article in The Hindu, termed the Rs 72,000 crore project a “planned misadventure” that threatens the survival of the Shompen and Nicobarese tribes, destroys one of the world’s most unique ecosystems and is highly susceptible to natural disasters.

Gandhi alleged the project was being pushed through by “making a mockery of all legal and deliberative processes”.

“The ancestral villages of the Nicobarese tribals fall in the project’s proposed land area.

The Nicobarese were forced to evacuate their villages during the 2004 tsunami.

This project will now permanently displace this community, ending its dream of returning to its ancestral villages,” Gandhi had said.

She had also argued that the Shompen face an even greater threat as the project denotifies a significant part of their reserve and will bring a large influx of people and tourists to the island.

In response, Yadav recently authored a column in the same newspaper, defending the project as one of strategic, defence and national importance.

He had said the plan is designed to transform Great Nicobar into a major hub of maritime and air connectivity in the Indian Ocean Region, with an international container transhipment terminal, a greenfield international airport, a 450 MVA gas- and solar-based power plant and a township over 16 sq km.",https://clarionindia.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-20-at-2.16.10-AM-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-09-21 06:57:55.232397

Stating that it will host public hearings on the matter following an influx of requests to extend the deadline for comments. The EPA has been through a tough few years recently, with the Trump administration stating that the agency is essentially not needed and even going so far as to suggest closing the agency altogether. Regardless, the public hearings are set to take place on 12 September 2025.

The EPA recently published one direct rule and one proposed rule for the sector

On July 22, the Environmental Protection Agency published a direct final rule (90 FR 34358) and a proposed rule (90 FR 34409) entitled “Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals From Electric Utilities; CCR Management Unit Deadline Extension Rule.” And the backlash from those new rules, both direct and proposed, has seen several requests for an extension to make comments on the rules.

The original deadline to submit comments was August 21, 2025; however, since then, the EPA has been overwhelmed by several requests to extend that initial deadline, and it appears that they have heard the calls, as they have now stated that an online public hearing will take place to offer people and companies a chance at making their voices heard.

One must commend the EPA for doing its job and fulfilling its purpose. Despite the overwhelming negative relationship with the current administration. The hearing will allow oral statements that are limited to 5 minutes per person, as well as pose initial questions to the statements made by the parties in attendance. Although it will not make any formal statements at the hearing.

The EPA will receive written comments until September 15 on the matter

The EPA has stated that they will accept any and all written comments on the proposed rules right up until the hearing takes place. It provided a 30-day notice of the hearings to the relevant stakeholders, so there is ample time for the parties involved to consider their comments and how to submit them to the agency. Expectations are that the agency will take every comment seriously and submit formal responses once the hearings have concluded.

“The scope of the proposed rule is limited to establishing an additional option for owners or operators of active CCR facilities or inactive CCR facilities with a legacy CCR surface impoundment to comply with the facility evaluation report (FER) Part 1 requirements and to extending compliance deadlines for the remaining CCRMU provisions published in the Federal Register on May 8, 2024.” – Environmental Protection Agency

Whether or not there will be any changes to the direct and proposed rules is yet to be determined. As to how this might affect the downstream sector is anyone’s guess. But that would be speculative at best at the moment. With several major refineries closing their doors, the sector is facing an uncertain future. Once the hearings have been completed, we expect to see formal responses from the EPA as they need time to assess the concerns of all affected by the rule changes.

What might the outcome of the online public hearings be, and how will it affect the rules

The public hearings are designed to offer the relevant stakeholders the chance to voice their concerns as to how the rules might affect their bottom line. While some parts of the world are seeing several companies expanding their downstream projects, this might force the companies in the region to reevaluate their long-term plans. With the United States aiming to revitalize its energy sector, thanks to several executive orders by the President, the impact of the hearings will only be felt after the 15 September date.

TVA and Type One Energy to Build 350 MW Fusion Plant

TVA has issued a Letter of Intent (LOI) to Type One Energy regarding the utility’s interest in the potential deployment of Type One Energy’s fusion power plant technology at its former Bull Run Fossil site once it is commercially ready. The LOI also covers potential future use of the prototype facilities as an operator and maintenance training facility for the Infinity Two workforce.

Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and Type One Energy have expanded their cooperative agreement to develop a 350 MWe fusion pilot power plant called “Infinity Two” at TVA’s former Bull Run Fossil Plant near Oak Ridge, TN, targeting deployment by the mid-2030s. The partnership represents the first commercial contracts signed for a utility-scale fusion power project in the US

It will utilize Type One Energy’s stellarator fusion technology to provide baseload generation capacity. This collaboration positions TVA as the leading U.S. utility in advanced nuclear innovation, addressing growing energy demands from AI and data centers while advancing fusion commercialization timelines.

Infinity Two is a first-generation 350 MWe baseload power plant utilizing Type One Energy’s stellarator fusion technology. According to the press statement by Type One, the stellarator has demonstrated stable, steady-state operation with high efficiency, characteristics which are important for TVA and others in the industry who need to reliably generate on-demand power at competitive prices.

Type One Energy is developing Infinity Two using existing materials and fundamental fusion technologies to support near-term deployment of the technology.

Final decisions and definitive agreements regarding the funding and construction of Infinity Two, as well as any agreements to purchase the energy output, are subject to TVA Board approval, regulatory review, and alignment with TVA’s least-cost planning processes.

Type One leaders told local news media at the announcement event they hope to start constructing Infinity One, the prototype stellarator, in 2026. The prototype is designed to verify aspects of the design and serve as a training platform.

Type One’s lead scientist told Knox News in March that company won’t need a scientific revelation to move the stellarator design forward. As CEO Chris Mowry put it, “This is not a science project.”

“This is an actual commercial fusion power plant that we are embarking on here.”

The Knoxville News reports that TVA’s role as a partner will include development of machining and fabricating some of the components of the stellarator.

TVA CEO Don Moul said the collaboration between the utility and Type One will be educational.

“We have a lot of learning to do. I think that’s the value of being able to have the stellarator here, having our power services shop provide some of the fabrication capabilities and, quite frankly, having some of our staff here help with the operational input with some of the designers so that we make this practical, but also as forward moving as possible.”

Executives from Type One and TVA made the announcement alongside state and local officials at the former Bull Run Fossil Plant site in Clinton, which TVA retired in 2023.

Proxima Fusion Extends Series A to €200M Total Funding

Proxima Fusion announced an extension to its Series A round with new funding from CDP Venture Capital (Cassa Depositi e Prestiti Group), Italy’s largest venture capital operator, the European Innovation Council Fund (EICF), and Brevan Howard Macro Venture Fund, associated with one of the world’s leading asset managers known for investing in global economic shifts.

The €15 million Series A extension brings the company’s total funding to €200 million ($230M). The EICF equity investment is the latest European public fund to back Proxima, following earlier investments from the DeepTech & Climate Fonds (DTCF) and High–Tech Gründerfonds (HTGF) – both backed by the German Ministry of Economics and Energy – as well as Bayern Kapital, owned by LfA Förderbank Bayern, and the non-profit Max Planck Foundation, which exclusively supports research across the institutes of the Max Planck Society. The new investment from the EICF follows a €2.5 million grant previously awarded to Proxima.

“CDP Venture Capital believes firmly that Europe’s deep tech ecosystem has a key role to play in developing future energy solutions” said Alessandro Scortecci, Chief Investment Officer, Direct Investments at CDP Venture Capital.

Just three months after announcing Europe’s largest-ever fusion round, Proxima has already grown by another 20% to 100 employees and is rapidly converting its new capital into industrial action to anchor its long-term roadmap. With the new capital in the bag, Proxima placed large-scale purchase orders for:

High-temperature superconducting (HTS) tape to secure long-term supply for the mission-critical HTS magnet program;

The manufacturing of structural support plates for its first HTS non-planar magnet, the Stellarator Model Coil (SMC);

Its own in-house cable manufacturing line to accelerate R&D capabilities and produce its first long length SMC cables;

Full size and weight dummy coils and prototype vacuum vessel sections to demonstrate hardware design, manufacturing capability and development of assembly processes for stellarators.

This latest funding will accelerate the company’s engineering progress toward the SMC, which will de-risk major elements of HTS magnet technology for stellarators. Proxima’s ambitious target: bring SMC to life in 2027. In addition, the team is simultaneously completing the design of its net energy gain demo stellarator, Alpha, while evaluating potential building sites across Europe.

About Proxima Fusion

Proxima Fusion spun out of the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP) in 2023 to build the first generation of fusion power plants using QI-HTS stellarators. Proxima has since assembled a team of scientists and engineers from leading companies and institutions including the IPP, MIT, Harvard, SpaceX, Tesla, and McLaren. The firm is taking a simulation-driven approach to engineering that leverages advanced computing and high-temperature superconductors.

About Kyoto Fusioneering

Kyoto Fusioneering launched the FAST (Fusion by Advanced Superconducting Tokamak) project in November 2024, taking on the role of project leader. FAST represents a private-sector-driven, industry–academia collaboration with the ambitious aim of proving fusion electricity generation within the 2030s in Japan. The initiative brings together leading researchers and companies, both in Japan and worldwide, to tackle the critical engineering challenges of fusion and to accelerate the transition from experimental reactors to practical, commercial-scale energy systems.

FAST’s mission is to prove that a complete fusion power generation system is possible by integrating plasma generation and control through D-T*3 fusion reactions, energy conversion, and fuel systems.

UNITY-1: At the core of this effort is the “UNITY-1” project, which aims to demonstrate how a fusion heat cycle system harnesses and utilizes energy produced by fusion reactions. UNITY-1 has now reached the final stage of validating its power generation technology through a liquid metal loop. The project is on track to achieve a world first: successfully demonstrating power generation technology using a simulated fusion plant*2.

UNITY-2: In addition, the fusion fuel cycle system, which continuously supplies fuel, is undergoing performance testing of individual devices and systems at the company’s new R&D facility, established adjacent to its headquarters in January this year. In 2026, Fusion Fuel Cycles Inc., a joint venture between Kyoto Fusioneering and Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, will begin an integrated demonstration of a fuel cycle system in Canada, under the project “UNITY-2.”

Gyrotron Systems: Kyoto Fusioneering’s plasma heating system—the gyrotron system—has recently been adopted by Tokamak Energy Ltd. in the UK*4, further expanding its footprint in global fusion initiatives.

Oxford Spin-out First Light Fusion Seeks Backing for Inertial Fusion Demonstrator

First Light Fusion believes it can drive down the costs of nuclear fusion but it needs £150m for a demonstration facility.

First Light Fusion (FLF) has outlined plans for an inertial fusion energy test facility, a £150 million project pitched as a faster, cheaper route to commercial fusion power. The University of Oxford spin-out outlined the company’s concept for high-gain fusion, known as fusion via low-power assembly and rapid excitation, or FLARE.

Gain refers to a process where more energy is converted from the fusion reaction than energy delivered to the fuel, and has long been a barrier to commercial fusion. FLF said its modelling shows the FLARE concept could produce an energy gain of up to 1,000, far higher than the current experimental levels achieved.

Founded in 2011, FLF has attracted more than £78 million in backing from a consortium including IP Group, Oxford Science Enterprises, Salica and Host Plus.

And as the UK prepares to invest £2.5bn into a different kind of fusion reactor, FLF urged the government “not to put all its eggs in one basket”.

Professor Jeremy Chittenden, co-director of the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial College London, said the FLARE concept combines well-established and extensively studied concepts.

“What makes First Light’s approach different is the way in which these concepts have been combined. In addition, the adaptation of First Light’s proven amplifier technology to cylindrical implosions means that the required fusion conditions can be realised using low voltage pulsed power, significantly reducing the cost of both the driver and the fusion targets.”

FLF said its approach differs from the conventional approach to inertial fusion energy (IFE), which is to compress and heat fuel at the same time to achieve ignition. By contrast, FLF’s approach splits this process into two parts. First, it compresses the fuel in a controlled manner and then uses a separate process to ignite it. This generates a “massive surplus of energy”, FLF said, in a process known as a ‘fast fusion’.

The company said this method has “long been researched”, but that it is “now made practical for the first time” using its technology. FLF claims its approach would underpin the design for future commercial reactors, allowing partners to build the systems using FLF technology as the fuel.

FLF said an experimental gain facility using its technology would cost between $100-$200 million, or just 5% of the $5.3 billion (£3.9bn) NIF in California.

The company said it expects to achieve gains above today’s records by the early 2030s, with the demonstrator facility not required for “several years”.

While the company is not seeking funding from the UK government at this stage, FLF said “any government support would be welcomed”.

With the UK government committing £2.5bn towards the STEP fusion project, which uses a process known as magnetic confinement fusion, FLF said the country should “not put all its eggs in one basket” when it comes to fusion energy.

General Atomics to Build a National Data Ecosystem Aimed at Accelerating Commercial Fusion Power

The multi-institutional project secures four-year DOE funding to unify fusion data and workflows into an accessible nationwide resource

Scientists at General Atomics (GA) announced this month that they will be leading a multi-institutional initiative to create a unified data system for fusion energy research in the United States—called the Fusion Energy Data Ecosystem and Repository (FEDER).

The project will be funded through the U.S. Department of Energy’s Fusion Innovative Research Engine (FIRE) Collaborative, a multimillion-dollar initiative designed to fast-track fusion development, support American innovation and bolster U.S. leadership in the energy sector.

Researchers plan to use FEDER to create a shared, standardized platform that links experimental results, simulation outputs and workflows from national laboratories, universities and private companies, turning today’s disconnected datasets and workflows into a unified community resource that speeds up discovery and brings commercial fusion power closer to reality.

“Fusion research advances fastest when data flows freely and securely rather than remain trapped in isolated silos, proprietary formats, and disconnected analysis tools,” said Dr. Raffi Nazikian, director of Fusion Data Science at General Atomics.

“FEDER will break down barriers between institutions and disciplines, integrating datasets, computational models and research workflows. We will be able to capture new data in FEDER’s living commons and make them available for immediate reuse in the next experiment or simulation.”

GA is joined in the FEDER initiative by a coalition of leading institutions: the San Diego Supercomputer Center at UC San Diego; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; Idaho National Laboratory; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Plasma Science and Fusion Center; Hewlett Packard Enterprise; UCLA; and West Virginia University.

ogether, their experts in plasma physics, fusion engineering, materials science and high-performance computing will collaborate with other FIRE Collaboratives and research teams nationwide to build the community-driven platform.

“FEDER is an important step toward turning today’s scattered fusion datasets into a unified resource for realizing the full potential of fusion energy,” said Tom Gibbs, developer relations lead for NVIDIA.

“By making siloed data readily accessible and linking it with resources such as National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource and the DOE Integrated Research Infrastructure, the research community can develop the advanced AI models needed for full-scale digital twins that will support the emerging commercial ecosystem.”

In addition to improving reproducibility, transparency and interdisciplinary collaboration, FEDER will integrate cutting-edge platforms—including the Fusion Data Platform, Open Science Data Federation and the National Data Platform—into a powerful, user-friendly service.

“We already have the building blocks. Now it’s time to connect them,” said Dr. Ilkay Altintas, chief data science officer at the San Diego Supercomputer Center.

“Within the first year, FEDER will weave these tools together and offer an accessible, scalable service that will grow into a lasting national resource.”

Fact-checkers at Carbon Brief debunked some of the most common myths about solar that can negatively influence public perception and hinder the adoption of renewable energy.

One of the most prominent claims about solar is that it doesn't produce reliable energy since it only generates power when the sun shines, and therefore, reduces grid stability and safety.

While that might be a valid concern if solar were the only form of energy produced, that isn't the case, as solar complements other clean sources of electricity such as wind, nuclear, geothermal, and hydropower.

Moreover, with more battery storage systems being installed both commercially and residentially, they provide backup power during outages and reduce energy costs by storing cheap power for later use at night or during peak hours.

The International Energy Agency estimated that global electricity generated by solar will quadruple by 2030 and surpass coal, gas, nuclear, wind, and hydro to become the world's leading source of energy by 2033, revealing that solar is indeed capable of powering societies on a large scale.

Another popular critique of solar and wind energy is that they're expensive, but according to a report from the International Renewable Energy Agency, more than 90% of renewable energy projects are now cheaper than comparable dirty fuel alternatives.

According to EnergySage, solar is still a great investment for homeowners, even though tax credits are expiring at the end of the year. Prices per watt are at all-time lows, and since systems last at least 30 years, that translates to decades of reduced electric bills and more energy independence.

Using EnergySage's free tools, you can access solar installation estimates and compare quotes, making it a convenient way to go solar while finding a system to suit your budget.

The company's free services, which include a mapping tool that allows users to view the average cost of a system and available tax incentives in their state, can help you secure the best price for rooftop solar panels and even save an average of $10,000 on installations.

By pairing solar energy with other energy-efficient appliances, such as heat pumps, you can further reduce your energy bills. EnergySage also offers a free heat pump quotes comparison tool, allowing you to find the right installer and model for your needs and making it easy to take care of multiple home improvement projects in one place.

Make sure to act fast to take advantage of the 30% federal tax credit for home solar and heat pump installations; they will expire by the end of 2025.

As Carbon Brief explained, misinformation about solar power can be incredibly harmful, and some of ""these narratives are having real-world consequences."" Some online anti-wind and solar groups even encourage local opposition to clean energy projects in rural communities across the U.S.

Armed with the right information, it's much easier for citizens to make informed decisions about home solar and for policymakers to pass laws that will continue promoting safe, affordable energy for all.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/solar-powerimage-recCs8TXbww9RNaNI.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 04:00:23.059907

Ramesh questioned the minister’s inability to answer basic queries repeatedly raised by the Congress, highlighting potential violations of the National Forest Policy, 1988, which calls for the protection of tropical rainforests, especially in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. He also criticised the project’s compensatory afforestation plan, noting that planting trees in Haryana cannot offset the destruction of Great Nicobar’s unique old-growth forests.

""The Union Minister of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change Shri Bhupender Yadav has accused the Indian National Congress of doing what he calls 'negative politics' on the Great Nicobar mega infrastructure project. Drawing the nation's attention to an imminent ecological and humanitarian disaster is NOT 'negative politics'. It is an expression of grave concern,"" Ramesh said on X.

Ramesh raised concerns over the project’s impact on endangered species such as leatherback turtles, megapodes, saltwater crocodiles, and the island’s coral ecosystems. He also questioned the sustainability of the project in a high-seismic zone with a history of severe tsunami subsidence. He called for transparency, asking why critical documents, including the ground-truthing exercise reports for the proposed transshipment port, were not publicly available.

Yadav had accused Congress of indulging in “negative politics”, asserting that only 1.78 per cent of Great Nicobar’s forest area would be used for the Rs 72,000 crore project, which he described as essential for national security and strategic connectivity in the Indian Ocean Region. He defended the plan as a transformative initiative, featuring an international container transshipment terminal, greenfield airport, 450 MVA gas- and solar-based power plant, and a township spanning 16 sq km.

Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi had earlier described the project as a “planned misadventure”, warning it threatens the survival of the Shompen and Nicobarese tribes, destroys a unique ecosystem, and risks natural disasters. She highlighted that ancestral villages of the Nicobarese, evacuated after the 2004 tsunami, would face permanent displacement, while the Shompen reserve would be denotified and subjected to large-scale human influx.

Ramesh concluded by urging the government to heed environmental and tribal safeguards, emphasising that ecological integrity and community rights cannot be sidelined in the pursuit of infrastructure and strategic goals.

Editorial | ​Nicobar triangle: on the ₹72,000-crore project on Great Nicobar Island

Mr. Yadav last Thursday (September 18, 2025) hit out at the Congress for opposing the Great Nicobar infrastructure project, accusing it of spreading confusion and indulging in ""negative politics.""

Speaking at an event organised by The Public Affairs Forum of India in New Delhi, Mr. Yadav asserted that the mega project is crucial for national security and strategic connectivity in the Indian Ocean Region. Mr. Yadav said only 1.78% of Great Nicobar's forest area will be used for the project.

His remarks came days after Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi, in an article in The Hindu, termed the ₹72,000 crore project a ""planned misadventure"" that threatens the survival of the Shompen and Nicobarese tribes, destroys one of the world's most unique ecosystems and is highly susceptible to natural disasters.

Confusion over clearances for Great Nicobar project persists

Ms. Gandhi alleged the project was being pushed through by ""making a mockery of all legal and deliberative processes.""

""The ancestral villages of the Nicobarese tribals fall in the project's proposed land area. The Nicobarese were forced to evacuate their villages during the 2004 tsunami. This project will now permanently displace this community, ending its dream of returning to its ancestral villages,"" Ms. Gandhi had said.

She had also argued that the Shompen face an even greater threat as the project denotifies a significant part of their reserve and will bring a large influx of people and tourists to the island. In response, Mr. Yadav recently authored a column in the same newspaper, defending the project as one of strategic, defence and national importance.

He had said the plan is designed to transform Great Nicobar into a major hub of maritime and air connectivity in the Indian Ocean Region, with an international container transhipment terminal, a greenfield international airport, a 450 MVA gas- and solar-based power plant and a township over 16 sq km.",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/id8taw/article70051985.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/27_JAIRAM_RAMESH_01_05_DELHI.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 04:58:15.014236

Focus Keyword: Coal mine closure

The decision to shut down coal mines has emerged as a critical issue shaping the future of energy, economy, and environment globally. As we approach 2025, coal mine closures mark a pivotal reflection of shifting energy paradigms. However, these closures bring not only environmental benefits but also complex economic and social challenges—issues that are particularly significant in regions heavily dependent on mining for their livelihoods and local development.

This comprehensive article explores the multifaceted impacts of coal mine closures in 2025, focusing on economic and social transitions, environmental restoration and reclamation, government and policy strategies, and the vital role of technology-enabled transition—offering actionable, future-oriented insights for communities, regions, and stakeholders.

“Over 200 coal mines worldwide are scheduled for closure by 2025, affecting millions in surrounding communities.”

Why Coal Mine Closure in 2025? Shifting Paradigms Explained

As global urgency to address climate change intensifies, coal—the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel—faces declining demand and increasingly stringent environmental regulations. In 2025, the movement to close coal mines is propelled by several key factors:

Stringent regulations on emissions and air quality driving policy-led transitions.

Rapid advancement and cost-competitiveness of renewable energy systems.

An urgent need for environmental restoration of degraded lands and ecosystems.

Financial firms and national governments divesting from carbon-heavy industries.

Changing expectations of investors and communities towards sustainable development.

Together, these shifting paradigms create both immense challenges and transformative opportunities. Understanding the full scope requires examining the economic, environmental, and social implications of coal mine closure.

Economic Impact of Coal Mine Closure on Communities

Coal mines have historically served as economic pillars in many regions, providing direct employment to tens of thousands of workers—while supporting ancillary industries such as transport, equipment manufacturing, and local businesses. The loss of this economic engine through mine closures can be devastating:

Increased unemployment: Tens of thousands face job loss, with ripple effects across local economies.

Business decline: Ancillary businesses (repair shops, equipment suppliers, restaurants) suffer reduced demand.

Regional GDP impacts: Drops in income, spending, and investment.

Uncertainty and poverty: Communities may witness population decline and deeper poverty levels.

In 2025, these challenges grow more acute, especially in regions and communities heavily dependent on coal mining. Governments and industry stakeholders are thus increasingly focusing on “just transition” frameworks. Such frameworks are aimed at cushioning the social impact of coal mine closure through re-skilling programs, economic diversification, and comprehensive social welfare measures.

Community Livelihoods: From Mining Pillars to Diversification

The future of community livelihoods in a post-coal world depends on the success of diversified transitions. Coal mine closure disrupts not only workers but entire local economies. In response, progressive policy and community strategies are:

Investing in alternative industries: Green energy manufacturing, sustainable agriculture, and eco-friendly tourism offer viable opportunities for new employment.

Supporting re-skilling programs: Training for workers to adapt to new, in-demand sectors.

Developing local entrepreneurship: Initiatives to support small businesses and innovation.

Leveraging satellite solutions for transition monitoring.

For instance, advanced fleet management can help local logistics businesses optimize remaining resources and adapt to changing infrastructure usage after mine closure.

However, the success of such transitions varies widely. Areas lacking infrastructure or investment can struggle to sustain economic recovery and may experience population decline and poverty. Therefore, coordinated interventions at local, national, and international levels remain crucial, ensuring that the costs of transition do not deepen disparities.

The Challenge of Just Transition Frameworks After Coal Mine Closure

“Just transition” refers to policies that prioritize social welfare, equity, and economic opportunity as societies move from coal-based industries toward sustainable alternatives. In 2025, examples of just transition challenges include:

Uneven readiness: Some communities lack access to resources or support, exacerbating disparities.

Intergenerational impacts: Family and cultural ties to coal mining increase the psychological impacts of closure.

Financing gaps: Without adequate investment in education, infrastructure, and new industries, transitions stall.

Long-term planning: Ensuring that short-term welfare programs evolve into sustainable, future-proof solutions.

The ability to create new employment and develop alternative industries hinges not simply on funding, but on proactive policy coordination, community engagement, and real-time monitoring of the effectiveness of interventions.

Environmental Restoration & Land Reclamation Following Coal Mine Closure

Coal mining is long associated with widespread environmental degradation: deforestation, soil erosion, water pollution, and habitat destruction. The closure of mines presents a unique opportunity for environmental restoration and land reclamation. In 2025, this opportunity is more urgent—and technologically advanced—than ever.

Key Environmental Implications & Opportunities

Restoring degraded land: Stabilizing and enriching soil using native plant cover and bioengineering.

Improving water quality: Treating mine tailings and contaminated runoff to protect local waterways.

Mitigating carbon emissions: Through carbon sequestration in reclaimed land and new forestry projects.

Rebuilding biodiversity: Reforestation and habitat recreation support wildlife and ecosystem recovery.

Many decommissioned mine sites are now transformed into renewable energy projects, including large-scale solar farms and wind energy installations—turning the liability of former mines into productive assets that directly contribute to regional energy needs.

“Coal mine closures in 2025 could reduce regional CO2 emissions by up to 350 million tons annually.”

Best Practices in Mine Land Reclamation for 2025

Active community involvement: Local input ensures culturally relevant land use and long-term stewardship.

Real-time monitoring: Using satellite-based technologies—like those provided by Farmonaut’s remote sensing platform—to track land healing progress, soil health, and water quality.

Adaptive management: Reclamation plans are iteratively improved based on on-the-ground and satellite data, maximizing ecosystem restoration.

Transparency: Traceability and reporting (powered by modern blockchain technology—see Farmonaut Product Traceability) assure stakeholders of environmental compliance and progress

With these practices, environmental restoration after coal mine closure becomes a vehicle for climate action, sustainable land use, and regional economic regeneration.

Renewable Energy & Repurposing Decommissioned Sites After Coal Mine Closure

With coal mine closure, there is an unprecedented chance to repurpose land and existing infrastructure toward sustainable energy systems and new industries:

Solar and wind energy “upcycling”: Many decommissioned open-cast mines are well suited for large-scale solar or wind power installations.

Eco-industrial development:

Repurposing transport corridors, equipment facilities, and mine housing for green manufacturing, advanced material recycling, or logistics hubs.

Urban renewal and tourism: Converted mines in some regions foster recreational parks, biodiversity conservation areas, and eco-tourism, revitalizing regional socio-economic life.

Continuous environmental monitoring: Tools like Farmonaut’s carbon footprinting solutions allow authorities and companies to measure and optimize project sustainability over time—key for compliance and climate impact verification.

Repurposed infrastructure thus not only restores landscapes after closure, but also helps ensure regions remain future-ready and economically viable.

Policy, Security & Strategy in Coal Mine Closures

The movement toward coal mine closure is inherently political and strategic. Governments and policy-makers face the formidable task of balancing energy security, national interests, social welfare, and climate imperatives. Some of the central issues and challenges include:

Strategic decommissioning: Ensuring mines located near critical infrastructure or defense sites are safely closed without jeopardizing national security.

Coordinated infrastructure transition: Repurposing or safely dismantling transport, equipment handling, and processing infrastructure to minimize risk and maximize future utility.

Dynamic policy frameworks: Adapting to rapid technological, market, and environmental shifts with flexible policies that support effective transitions.

International cooperation: Harmonizing closure approaches across countries and supporting transnational climate targets.

Ongoing monitoring & compliance: Leveraging satellite-based oversight and real-time environmental tracking for transparent reporting and enforcement.

Stakeholders increasingly recognize that the path toward successful coal mine closure rests on integration, transparency, and readiness for new energy, industry and environmental realities.

In some of the areas losing talent in greatest numbers, there are not only state income taxes, but also substantial local taxes and particularly hefty levies on high-income individuals.
Momentum builds momentum.
Good opportunities attract talent, which helps businesses expand and create yet more opportunities.","A large, growing, and well-qualified workforce is essential to ongoing economic expansion. Texas has an advantage over many areas in that our population is younger and, hence, has more people in childbearing age ranges. Additionally, the state has long been attracting workers from other parts of the country (and, indeed, the world). A recent report by Lightcast, a global labor market intelligence firm, illustrates just how well Texas is doing.

Lightcast’s Talent Attraction Scorecard ranks states on seven components. The analysis looks at overall job growth over the past five years at an occupational level, then becomes more specific by delving into the numbers in high-earnings categories and blue-collar categories. Growth in the college-educated population and prime-age (25-54) population is considered, as well as people arriving with incomes above $25,000 per year. How an area is performing as a result of competitive advantages rather than overall national trends is also part of the ranking.

Texas had three of the top 10 large (250,000+ residents) metropolitan areas. Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington topped the list by a very large margin. Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos was second, and Houston-Pasadena-The Woodlands was sixth. All other metro areas on the list were in Florida (which led Texas slightly on an overall statewide basis). At the other end of the spectrum were the greater Los Angeles (ranked last at 196), New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, and Boston areas.

A variety of factors influence in-migration. One is a dynamic economy. Texas has been a growth leader for a number of years, generating jobs across a broad spectrum of industries. These opportunities attract skilled workers, and the state’s sustained economic momentum is clearly a factor. Another advantage is the cost of living. It’s no coincidence, for example, that the states where people are attracted have no state income tax. In some of the areas losing talent in greatest numbers, there are not only state income taxes, but also substantial local taxes and particularly hefty levies on high-income individuals. When combined with higher costs for housing and other necessities, the financially rational decision can quickly shift toward Texas, Florida, and other less expensive places to live.

Momentum builds momentum. Good opportunities attract talent, which helps businesses expand and create yet more opportunities. Texas has been dominating major locations and expansions for well over a decade. The state is also attracting workers needed for continued growth. There are daunting challenges going forward, including providing adequate educational opportunities, electric power, water, and other infrastructure to facilitate further expansion, and overcoming perceptions discouraging some knowledge workers from coming to or remaining in the state. For now, however, Texas is well positioned to remain one of the most dynamic economies in the nation.

Louise CullenAgriculture and environment correspondent, BBC News NI

People living near renewable energy projects may get a discount on their electricity bills in future, under a proposal in a new Stormont scheme.

Known as the Renewable Energy Price Guarantee (REPG) scheme, it could also lead to lower electricity bills for all.

The REPG is designed to encourage investment in wind, solar and energy storage projects to help meet the goal of generating 80% of our energy from renewable sources by 2030.

Renewable sector leaders welcomed the announcement but added that ""ambition must now be matched by delivery"".

'Deliver lower costs'

Economy Minister Caoimhe Archibald said the scheme would ""boost renewable generation and deliver lower electricity costs to households than they are paying today"".

She added that it would ensure local communities benefit from the transition to net zero.

The final scheme design, published by the Department for the Economy, acknowledges that the success of the 2030 target ""will depend on the availability of a sufficient pipeline of renewable projects and the development of electricity infrastructure to support additional generation"".

Capacity limits in the electricity grid have led to wind power having to be switched off – known as ""dispatching down"" – to protect infrastructure.

Scheme will 'power economic growth'

The chair of RenewableNI said the announcement would create jobs and attract investment, creating ""stability"" for consumers.

""It is one of, if not the, most directly beneficial actions the executive has taken to power economic growth here, particularly in rural areas,"" said Tamasin Fraser.

""We've seen over the last numbers of years the impact that the war in Russia/Ukraine has had on bills by relying on imported fossil fuels.

""We can harness our own clean, green, indigenous resources and that will help hedge against that volatility.""

She added that reaching the 80% renewable generation target would deliver ""approximately £110 million net benefit annually to the consumer"".

Under the Programme for Government (2024-27), the Northern Ireland Executive has committed to supporting industry to increase renewable generation by another 40%.

The first auction to award generation contracts under the scheme will be held in early 2027.

It will aim to secure from 750 gigawatt hours per year to 1,250Gwh/year of power.

The price for that power will be agreed at the auction.

To fund the scheme, a fixed levy will be added to electricity bills under a new two-way payments' system.

When prices drop below the agreed contract level, renewable energy generators will receive a payment from the electricity companies.

Conversely, when prices rise, excess payments will be collected from the generators, returned to the electricity companies and then passed on to consumers.

Over time, as renewable generation increases and fossil fuel dependence declines, this will result in lower and more stable electricity prices.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3ace/live/75c536d0-9595-11f0-b72b-7959ebab31f0.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 02:58:04.700756

Stellantis is successfully testing a revolutionary approach to electric vehicle battery design that could reshape its EV architecture. The Intelligent Battery Integrated System (IBIS) integrates the inverter and charger functions directly into battery modules, eliminating the need for separate charging hardware that typically adds weight and complexity to electric vehicles.

The IBIS system uses software control to manage these integrated functions, reducing vehicle weight by 88 lbs on average, freeing up space and reducing charging time by 15%. The innovative battery technology is also 10% more efficient than conventional EV systems with the same-sized battery pack, potentially extending range without increasing battery capacity. Each battery module operates independently through sophisticated software, creating a more flexible and responsive power management system.

Game-Changing Benefits for Stellantis Brands

The integrated battery system represents a significant advancement in EV technology that could benefit multiple Stellantis brands across North America. Jeep's current 4xe lineup, including the Grand Cherokee 4xe with its 26-mile electric range and Wrangler 4xe offering 21 miles of electric-only driving, could see meaningful improvements with IBIS technology implementation.

A 10% efficiency boost would translate to approximately 2.6 additional miles of electric range for the Grand Cherokee 4xe and over 2 miles for the Wrangler 4xe. While these gains might seem modest, they represent meaningful improvements where every mile of electric range reduces reliance on gasoline. The weight reduction of 88 pounds also improves overall efficiency. Dodge's Charger EVs could also benefit from up to 30 miles of additional range and space savings, while Ram's recently shelved electric pickup truck could have leveraged the faster charging capabilities and reduced complexity.

Too Little, Too Late?

Traditional EVs use separate onboard chargers that convert grid AC power to DC for battery storage, while onboard inverters convert battery DC power to AC for electric motors. By consolidating these functions into the battery pack itself, Stellantis creates opportunities for simplified vehicle assembly, reduced manufacturing costs, and improved reliability. The technology also improves Stellantis' position against Tesla and Ford in the rapidly evolving EV market.

The IBIS technology could prove valuable as Stellantis accelerates its electrification timeline across brands like Dodge, which plans to transition its performance lineup to electric power. The system's ability to provide faster charging and higher efficiency while maintaining smaller packaging requirements addresses two critical consumer concerns about EV adoption. Stellantis says the technology should see production before 2030, but really, it can’t come soon enough.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/autoblog_arena_articles_145/ca6b1986e2fcd5473ee29a8863c258a9,N,,2025-09-21 12:04:30.455845

The organization is stifling the development of clean energy, setting the rules for the capacity market, forcing energy prices up and continuing to marginalize the voice of the very states it serves.

Pinsky is the director of the Maryland Energy Administration, to which he was appointed by Gov.","“Turn the lights off” is a common refrain in homes across America. But keeping the lights on is what PJM Interconnection, the regional transmission organization, attempts to do. PJM (standing for Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland) is the Mid-Atlantic states’ regional transmission organization. It acts like a traffic cop to facilitate the transfer of electricity across state borders.

Why should this organization and its actions matter? Because the prices of energy are rapidly rising for most of the 65 million people it serves. And, unfortunately, PJM’s role is growing — in the wrong direction. The organization is stifling the development of clean energy, setting the rules for the capacity market, forcing energy prices up and continuing to marginalize the voice of the very states it serves.

PJM serves 13 adjoining states and Washington, D.C., covering over 65 million people. It directs electrons from power plants to end users, like us, who use the electricity necessary for everyday life. Currently, the key stakeholders in the organization are the entrenched power industry insiders, including generators, transmission developers and utilities — and herein lies the rub. Even though PJM was created to organize energy transfers among states, these very same states feel they have little voice in the structure and policy-setting of the operation.

Case in point: PJM has closed the queue to bring new, additional energy onto the grid for the last two and a half years. During this period of limited supply, not surprisingly, energy costs have risen. Not so ironically, much of the energy awaiting approval is solar and battery storage. While fossil fuels make up most of the current PJM mix, the organization declares itself “energy-source neutral.” Its policy? Block new, clean energy and keep the current fossil fuels, major contributors to climate change, running at full blast.

Recently, the governors of nine states, including my own Maryland Governor Wes Moore, wrote to PJM with a complaint: The states being served have little or no voice in it. This leaves the interests of ratepayers — the residents they serve — out in the proverbial cold.

When two board seats recently opened, the states’ governors formally asked for representatives who might be sympathetic to states’ ratepayers, the vast number of whom are working families.

The governors recommended two candidates. One was the outgoing chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), who previously served as chair of Virginia’s Public Service Commission. The second was another former FERC commissioner. Both had been originally nominated for their positions by a U.S. president and subsequently received approval by the U.S. Senate.

The PJM nominating committee rejected both of these outstanding candidates, ignoring the governors’ plea for a voice and, for all intents and purposes, told the governors to go pound sand.

Unfortunately, virtually all of the members of the PJM Members Committee are energy insiders who get to decide who leads them and what their policy should be. So, of the eight members of the committee directed to fill the vacancies, none represented ratepayers. What a surprise!

Sadly, neither of the proposed candidates suggested by the governors to give a voice to consumers appears to have been seriously considered.

As a follow-up, on Aug. 21, 2025, PJM explained that if the governors wanted to pursue any changes to the nominating process, it would require a change in PJM’s Operating Agreement.

And how would states do that? You guessed it: It requires the support of the very same Members Committee that shaped the nominations committee. It appears the process was built to make states chase their tails. Until states have a real voice at PJM, the threat of ever-rising energy prices and distribution costs will continue ravaging families across the 13 states and D.C.

Mark Christie, the outgoing chair of FERC, said it best at a recent national conference. He ended his speech with this exhortation: “The two most important questions in utility regulation are: ‘Who pays?’ and ‘Who profits?’”

Until states have a significant voice at the PJM table, ratepayers will be at the mercy of the companies generating, supplying and distributing this important resource.

While Frederick Douglass was not referring to energy when he discussed power, his posit stands just as appropriate today: “Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never has and it never will. Find out the exact measure of injustice and wrong that will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted.”

Saturday morning, the Sierra Club, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, local lawmakers, community members and more came together to voice their opposition to the EPA's effort to eliminate the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. They say it's an issue that will have an impact from the mountains to Commerce City and beyond.

""We're facing lower snowpack in the Mountain West, where, every year, we're seeing a few less days of skiing,"" said Pitkin County Commissioner Jeffrey Woodruff.

""It's our community that has dealt with issues of cancer because they've been forced to drink the water and lead pipes and so many other pollutants,"" said Commerce City Council Member Renee Chacon.

""I am the wife of a firefighter, and since I've been here and with my husband, the number of fires has increased exponentially. And it's not just, 'Oh, it's on a mountain. Oh, it's out and some bushland.' It's in our neighborhoods. It's in our communities. We see the smoke every day. I have a four-year-old who can't go outside and play on certain days because of the wildfire smoke,"" said Danielle Abrams with the Sierra Club.

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program requires reporting of greenhouse gas data from large greenhouse gas emission sources, fuel and industrial gas suppliers and CO2 injection sites. The EPA says the GHGRP costs companies money they could use to improve environmental controls at their facilities.

In a press release issued by the EPA back on September 12, they said, ""Unlike mandatory information collections under the Clean Air Act, the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is not directly related to a potential regulation. It has no material impact on improving human health and the environment.""

The EPA under the Trump administration also says that if it gets rid of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, it could save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs.

Environmentalists who oppose the measures say that corporate profits should not be made on the backs of America's citizens.

Chacon says if regulations like the GHGRP are repealed, it's people like those in her community who will pay the price because they will see the negative health effects first, like they are now.

""They're paying even higher health costs when it comes to inhalers or even missing school,"" said Chacon.

Abrams is urging all of Colorado to reach out to the EPA through public comment and tell them what they think.

A substantial majority of ENTEK’s revenue is supported by long-term contracts, enabling the company to strategically scale its operations and capitalize on the burgeoning market opportunities within the U.S. battery sector. This is particularly relevant given the current uncertainties within the global battery supply chain and a policy environment that emphasizes the onshoring of strategic manufacturing capabilities.

The Terre Haute project will be executed in collaboration with Clayco, a reputable firm serving as the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contractor, and the Brueckner Group, a recognized leader in biaxial stretching equipment vital to the production process. The facility will have a remarkable production capacity, initially set to manufacture 1.4 billion square meters of wet-process lithium-ion battery separators annually during its first two development phases, with design plans to expand this capacity to 2.1 billion square meters in subsequent phases.

This level of production positions ENTEK uniquely in the marketplace, as it will be the only U.S.-based supplier capable of meeting the sourcing requirements that qualify battery manufacturers for the 45X production tax credits, aligning with the content stipulations under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the amendments introduced by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). Such advantages will greatly benefit battery manufacturing customers seeking to maximize their credits under the OBBBA framework.

In connection with the Department of Energy’s loan of up to $1.3 billion, the project has successfully secured more than $200 million in 48C advanced manufacturing tax credits specifically for Phase One, and it will also become eligible for the ongoing 45X production tax credits during Phase Two, further enhancing the financial viability of the project.

The completion of this deal is anticipated to proceed following the necessary regulatory approvals, marking a significant milestone in the development of U.S.-based battery manufacturing capabilities and advancing the nation’s energy independence goals.

In a conversation with WIBC’s Tony Katz, Braun responded to growing concerns about the cost and environmental impact of large-scale data centers, including a proposed Google facility on the east side of Indianapolis.

“There’s a ton of capital investment and a construction multiplier effect,” Braun said. “But those jobs dissipate once it’s done. After that, it uses a ton of electricity and a decent amount of water to boot.”

He pointed out that in rural counties, where assessed value is often limited, data centers can help expand the tax base. Still, Braun said Indiana isn’t handing out automatic approvals.

“I’m going to measure it based upon what I told you. It’s not a categorical yes or no,” he said. “We want to be open for business, anyone that wants to come here and invest, but if it’s going to have impact, and it’s not along with high-paying jobs, you’ve got to abate many of these out of the gate to where they don’t even get the benefit of local property tax revenue.”

Braun highlighted a new law that requires data centers to pay for 80 percent of the cost of new electricity generation if they haven’t already started construction. He said that’s meant to protect ratepayers from covering the cost of infrastructure needed by energy-hungry facilities.

“That’s where we start,” Braun said. “Then it’s going to be up to the data centers and the utility companies to make the case that it’s going to be neutral in terms of impacting the cost of electricity for everyone else.”

He also weighed in on public frustration over rising utility bills. AES Indiana recently asked for a rate hike, but the state’s consumer counselor pushed back with a recommendation to lower rates instead.

“That rate hike has been too commonplace without taking the other side of the equation into consideration,” Braun said. “It’s mostly to show that you’re not a juggernaut that gets everything you want without discussion.”

Indiana currently generates around 20 gigawatts of electricity, which Braun said is barely enough to keep up with demand. Some data centers, he noted, can consume up to one gigawatt each.

“Demand for electricity was flat as a pancake, and now one of these centers can use up to a gig,” he said. “We’ve got to be careful, especially when it takes four to five years to bring any new generation online.”

Braun also expressed doubts about wind and solar, calling them unreliable and saying grid operators don’t count them as baseload power. Instead, he’s pushing for small modular nuclear reactors and wants to delay shutting down existing fossil fuel plants.

“They check off so many things that make sense in terms of baseload,” Braun said. “That’s going to be there whether the sun’s shining or not, or the wind’s blowing.”

While major cities across the United States embrace “cool roof” standards to combat rising urban temperatures, the Pacific Northwest has yet to implement any policies that could reduce local temperatures, and one woman is trying to change that.

Studies show lighter-colored roofing materials reflect more sunlight compared to dark surfaces, which absorb more heat and contribute to what scientists call an urban heat island.

Katie Kaku is the senior technical director for Global Heat Reductions and is trying to bring awareness to this process and encourage meaningful change in the Pacific Northwest.

“We all know, we’ve all experienced black asphalt on hot summer days and we know it’s hot to the touch. And this is because it’s absorbing the incoming sunlight and rereleasing it as heat,” said Kaku.

Cities can experience as much as 15 degrees hotter than surrounding rural areas due to their built environments, a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect.

Katie uses Seattle neighborhoods as an example.

“You can see the temperature differences from neighborhood to neighborhood. A city with lots of trees by the water, such as Ballard or Magnolia, you find that on a hot summer day, if that temperature hits 80 degrees, an area such as Renton or Auburn or Kent within the industrial corridor that has fewer trees and much more black surfaces, those regions can be 11 degrees warmer,” she said.

A “cool roof” can lower the temperature both inside and outside a home, reducing cooling bills for entire communities and cities.

Research from the Environmental Protection Agency shows if “cool roof” standards are implemented, the temperature inside a home can be lowered anywhere from about 2 to 6 degrees.

While many major cities, including Los Angeles and New York, have cool roof standards in place for flat (typically industrial) roofs, Atlanta passed a bold city-wide ordinance in June of 2025 requiring all roofs, both industrial and residential, to comply with these standards.

The city-wide temperature in Atlanta is expected to be lower by 2.4 to 6.3 degrees because of these changes.

As summers get hotter in the Pacific Northwest, Katie would like to see similar standards or guidance from officials.

""To the best of my knowledge, neither Washington nor Oregon have any cool roof ordinances or guidelines in their building code,” she said.

The Cool Roof Rating Council is a nonprofit that aims to bring information related to cool surfaces to critical discussions, and when asked about any cool roof standards in the PNW, a spokesperson shared that:

“The Evergreen Sustainable Development Standard (ESDS), which is the building performance standard that governs affordable housing projects funded through the Washington State Housing Trust Fund program, includes cool roof provisions as part of its heat island reduction credit. This is currently the only standard in the PNW that includes cool roof provisions, though cool roofs are included for heat island mitigation in nation-wide and global voluntary green building programs such as LEED and Green Globes.”

Katie believes the only con to a lighter colored roof would be the aesthetic.

We asked roofing expert Mike Tappert, who owns Upper West Exteriors.

“Black is the most popular I think due to the aesthetic,” said Tappert, adding that if someone wanted to choose a lighter colored roof, “They’re generally all within a couple dollars of each other.”

He said that simply choosing a lighter colored shingle in the northwest would help lower the temperature of your home and community, but an even more powerful “cool roof” shingle has been developed and is sold in warmer climates, which can double those temperature impacts.

“It’s a logical conclusion to come to that if you’re wearing a black t-shirt and you feel warmer versus wearing a nice light white t-shirt in the sun, you’re going to feel a little cooler. It makes sense it would apply to rooftops also which are going to be a huge square footage impact from that heat absorption from the sun,” said Tappert.

Owens Corning, the company that produces the cool roof shingle, could transport to the northwest, there just might be a shipping fee or slight delay for shipping.

Tappert said the only con to using those cool roof shingles in the northwest is that those shingles to not have any built-in algae resistance, which most shingles he sells in Washington have, and that would be the only trade for the cool roof shingles.

However, he said the algae-resistant shingles do have lighter shades that would be beneficial for lower temperatures.

For Kaku, the solution is both homeowners stepping up to choose lighter colors when redoing a roof or building a new home, plus asking city leaders to issue guidance.

""By changing the color choices slightly, we can make meaningful action and address urban heat island effects and reduce temperatures of cities by as much as 2 degrees,"" she said. ""This is a change we can implement right now.

The grants covered the majority of the streetscape project and the entire cost of the $2.2 million geothermal system.
In addition to geothermal heating and cooling, deep, hot-rock geothermal projects that generate steam for electricity production are also seeing increased interest.
“It was years ahead of its time,” said Larry Leliefeld, former president of the Iowa Geothermal Association, an industry group, and the current service provider for the West Union geothermal system.","WEST UNION, Iowa—From the billboard on the edge of town to the limestone monument on Vine Street, the signs are hard to miss: “West Union, Deeply Connected.” It’s a motto that could apply to many tight-knit farm towns across the Midwest where families date back generations.

But in this town of 2,500, the words have additional meaning.

Buried beneath the front lawn of the county courthouse and town square are 132 boreholes, each 300 feet deep. Pipes connected to the bores run below the surrounding blocks, providing downtown businesses with year-round geothermal energy. The high-efficiency, fossil-fuel-free heating and cooling system owned by the town was one of the first municipal thermal networks in the country when it began operating in 2014.

For Steve Fate, the president of West Union District Energy, which oversees the system, its appeal is simple.

“It saves us money, and will continue to save us money,” Fate said, emphasizing the financial benefits of the geothermal system.

In 2023, the U.S. Department of Energy highlighted West Union as having one of the highest-performing geothermal networks among a small but growing number of similar systems in operation nationwide.

“It’s sort of a celebrity among thermal energy networks because it was constructed very early,” said Jessica Silber-Byrne, the thermal energy networks research and communications manager for the Building Decarbonization Coalition, a nonprofit organization working to eliminate the use of fossil fuels in buildings.

The library, county courthouse, a law office, two banks, an insurance company and a shoe store are among the twelve buildings connected to the geothermal system. Each user is part of the energy district, the group that oversees its operation.

The system has underground boreholes that serve as a thermal equalizer. A mixture of water and glycol circulates through pipes in each hole, where underground temperatures remain at approximately 50°Fahrenheit year round. As the water travels through the vertical bores, it is warmed or cooled by the surrounding rock and sediment until it stabilizes at 50 degrees, a temperature well-suited for cooling on hot summer days and a great starting point for heating buildings in the winter months.

A loop of horizontal pipe running beneath six blocks of West Union’s downtown then circulates the ground-temperature water to buildings connected to the system. Heat pumps in each building use compressors and fans to further warm or cool the buildings, depending on the time of year. These water-source heat pumps work the same way as air-source heat pumps that draw on outdoor air for heating and cooling, but are more efficient.

The high-density polyethylene pipe used in the bores and distribution loop is the same type of pipe used by water, sewer and gas utilities. It is expected to last 80 years or more, based on an independent analysis of the West Union network conducted in 2021. The heat pumps located in each building have a life expectancy of up to 24 years according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

In community spaces like the library, the heating and cooling is a public service, Fate said.

“It’s going to be warm today and humid, and we’re going to have community members just coming in here for the day,” said Fate, who is also the president of the West Union Community Library Board of Trustees, during a visit in late June when temperatures would reach 89° Fahrenheit outside. “On our winter days, when it’s 20 below zero, we have people that come in, off and on all day long, because there’s a warm spot to be.”

Perfect Timing

Geothermal heating and cooling is just one of several sustainability projects that West Union completed in the early 2010s as part of a revitalization project that included a complete reconstruction of its downtown streets. Other initiatives included replacing the existing asphalt with porous pavement that lets water seep into the ground and bioswales or rain gardens that slow and filter stormwater runoff. The city worked closely with the Iowa Economic Development Authority, which was looking to fund sustainable pilot projects in towns across the state. The state agency brought outside experts to West Union to discuss options with residents.

“We just basically brainstormed ideas—even if they were off the wall and seemed ridiculous,” said Jon Biederman, a civil engineer who was part of the town’s redevelopment planning team. “Some of those were taken off the table right away, but one that kind of hung on was geothermal.”

Biederman and others in town were familiar with small-scale geothermal energy. Some had ground-source heat pumps connected to one or two boreholes that provided heating and cooling for their homes. Another small-scale system, completed in 2007, provided heating and cooling for the high school’s performing arts center.

During the brainstorming sessions, someone mentioned a much larger thermal energy network in Holland, Michigan, that used waste heat from a nearby power plant to fuel a snowmelt system for streets and sidewalks across much of the city’s downtown.

West Union didn’t have a power plant and the waste heat that comes with it, but its residents decided to pursue geothermal on a similar scale to provide heating and cooling to the town’s business district. The decision was made easier in part by plans to rip up and replace most of the streets downtown. With the ground already exposed, it would be less costly and disruptive to bury water pipes connecting the borefield to nearby buildings.

The town was able to secure state and federal grants driven by stimulus funding following the Great Recession of the late 2000s. The grants covered the majority of the streetscape project and the entire cost of the $2.2 million geothermal system.

“The timing was just right for making the geothermal happen,” Biederman said. “I don’t know that it would have ever happened before that, or probably since. It was just absolutely perfect for timing.”

For the buildings connected to the system, the savings are significant.

Biederman estimated that his engineering firm’s office building saves a few hundred dollars a month with geothermal energy compared to what they would otherwise pay today if they kept their prior heating and cooling systems.

Fate, the library board president, calculated that the building’s costs for heating and cooling have decreased by 25 percent per square foot since the geothermal system was first installed.

Pat Dillon, a local attorney who connected his West Union office building to the town’s geothermal network several years ago, saw his winter heating bill drop nearly in half from $350 to $180 per month.

“It provides consistent, nice heat in the wintertime, and it’s cool in the summertime,” Dillon said. “It’s meeting all of our objectives.”

Learning Curve

As one of the first communities in the country to own and operate such a system, there were challenges early on.

“There weren’t good examples to fall back on, like ‘How do we bill everybody? What does that look like?’” said Robin Bostrom, the former head of the West Union Chamber of Commerce’s Main Street program, an economic revitalization and historic preservation initiative. “They had to kind of wade through that and figure it out.”

Users of the network formed their own limited liability corporation and hired a geothermal service provider to monitor and maintain the system. Initially, costs were high, and the savings from switching to geothermal were minimal. However, a new service provider hired in 2021 provided the same services at a fraction of the cost. The change has allowed the user group to reduce the amount they pay for thermal energy from $14 per ton of heating and cooling capacity in 2021 to $9 per ton today.

When the project was first completed, it was anticipated that it would be a model for the nation. In the early years, the town received a lot of calls about the streetscape and its permeable pavers, but there was little interest in the geothermal system, Biederman said.

That’s beginning to change.

“We used to get a call every once in a while. Now it’s really consistent,” Fate said, noting a group recently visited from Vermont.

Hot water from thermal springs has been used in district heating systems in the U.S. for 150 years, but the West Union network was the first ambient temperature system owned by a municipality, Silber-Byrne of the Building Decarbonization Coalition said.

There are now dozens of neighborhood-scale networks and district energy systems that tap geothermal energy for heating and cooling in operation in the United States, research from the organization indicates. Dozens of additional systems are currently under development.

In addition to geothermal heating and cooling, deep, hot-rock geothermal projects that generate steam for electricity production are also seeing increased interest. New, enhanced geothermal systems that draw on hydraulic fracturing techniques developed by the oil and gas industry and other advanced drilling methods are quickly expanding geothermal energy’s potential.

Silber-Byrne said legislation that allows, or in some cases requires, utilities to install geothermal systems is partly responsible for the uptick in the heating and cooling networks. Twelve states, including those on the West Coast, Midwest, Northeast as well as Colorado and Texas, have passed laws related to geothermal heating and cooling in recent years, according to the organization.

Tax incentives introduced during the Biden administration and largely preserved in the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act are also driving interest in the networks, Silber-Byrne said.

Interest from utilities and communities in using geothermal energy instead of gas as a means to meet their climate goals and protect against natural gas price spikes during periods of peak demand is also spurring new projects.

The biggest challenges to adoption remain unfamiliarity with the systems and their high upfront cost, Silber-Byrne said. While the West Union system was financed entirely by federal grants, some in the community were initially opposed to, and spoke out against, a largely unproven system.

“Either they didn’t have the information they needed, or they were afraid, or we didn’t communicate well enough from the start,” said Dick Woodard, a retired insurance agent who has owned two buildings connected to the system.

“It was years ahead of its time,” said Larry Leliefeld, former president of the Iowa Geothermal Association, an industry group, and the current service provider for the West Union geothermal system. “What it lacked was bringing [people] along and helping them understand it.”

Now, as the West Union geothermal network enters its second decade of operation and its user rates decrease while gas and electric rates climb, more local businesses are considering connecting their buildings to the existing network, Fate said.

The local elementary school in West Union recently installed its own geothermal system.

“It’s kind of like church,” Woodard said. “If you want to change the hymns, then you are going to have somebody squawking about it. That’s the way it was here. You get past it.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Iowa-Geothermal_Deeply-Connected1_McKennaJPG-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 21:59:34.279504

Its ability to generate electricity without emissions and reduce dependence on fossil fuels makes it a key player against climate change. However, behind each wind turbine lies a complex engineering work that seeks to balance efficiency, stability, and sustainability.

For decades, the three-blade model dominated the industry by offering an adequate compromise between aerodynamics, mechanical resistance, and reliability. Each additional blade provides less performance, and adding more than three generates overweight and wind resistance, reducing efficiency. That is why manufacturers have opted for the triad as a worldwide standard.

From a mechanical point of view, three blades allow for distributing loads evenly, reducing vibrations, and extending the lifespan of the equipment. Wind turbines also have Yaw brakes, systems that orient the rotor towards the wind and protect it from extreme gusts, providing an extra layer of safety.

On the other hand, designs with one or two blades historically faced stability and durability issues, requiring additional parts that increased costs and complicated manufacturing. However, recent innovation is challenging this trend and opening up new possibilities to diversify turbine models.

Wind energy.

The challenge of two blades: innovation and efficiency

The company Envision Energy surprised the sector by presenting a two-blade (2B) wind turbine that has managed to overcome traditional obstacles. With over 500 days of stable operation, it achieved levels of availability and operating hours comparable to three-blade models.

This advancement is due to a modular and lightweight design that reduces structural mass and simplifies assembly logistics. It also integrates active controls, lightweight materials such as carbon fiber shafts, and advanced technology to ensure dynamic stability. Thus, the vibration and wear issues that previously limited bi-blade turbines seem to be a thing of the past.

The two-blade model offers clear economic advantages. By reducing the rotor’s weight by 15–20%, manufacturing and transportation costs decrease. It is even possible to mount the rotor and the nacelle together, simplifying operations in remote areas. Although its aerodynamic efficiency may be up to 5% lower, the cost-benefit balance makes it attractive for projects in complex environments.

In emerging markets, where logistical conditions hinder the installation of conventional turbines, this design can make a difference. Its adaptability makes it a strategic option to accelerate the expansion of wind energy in isolated regions and support global commitments to decarbonization.

The environmental benefits of wind energy

Beyond technological innovation, the true value of wind energy lies in its environmental impact. By generating electricity from the wind, it avoids the burning of fossil fuels responsible for greenhouse gas emissions. Each operational wind turbine can offset thousands of tons of CO₂ throughout its lifespan.

Another key benefit is the reduction of air pollution. Unlike thermal plants, wind energy does not produce smoke, particles, or toxic waste, contributing to improving the quality of life in nearby communities. Moreover, as a renewable and inexhaustible source, it offers energy security in the long term.

The installation of wind farms also promotes local development, creating jobs and fostering more sustainable regional economies. In combination with other clean energies, wind power emerges as one of the most effective solutions to mitigate climate change and build a more just and balanced energy future.",https://storage.googleapis.com/media-cloud-na/2025/09/turbina.webp,N,,2025-09-20 22:59:34.512649

American ratepayers have seen electricity prices rising at a faster pace than U.S. inflation over the past three years. These increases are set to outpace the rate of inflation through 2026, the Energy Information Administration says.

At the same time, the United States has never produced more energy than now, with a record amount in 2024 and rising output of oil and natural gas in 2025, too.

The abundance of energy could help lower electric utility bills for consumers—if there is enough gas linked to powering data centers and manufacturing, the primary growth drivers of U.S. power demand.

Eventually, the spiking energy costs will lead to the various U.S. states approving additional gas infrastructure, EQT Corp, one of America’s top natural gas producers, reckons.

“We’ve never produced more energy than we’re producing now, but Americans’ energy bills are up over 35%,” EQT’s chief executive Toby Rice said during BloombergNEF’s ‘Barrel of Tomorrow in the Age of AI’ summit in Houston this week.

“That’s the catalyst that’s going to get people asking questions,” the executive added.

His opinion that additional infrastructure, most of all gas, will help bring down elevated consumer energy bills was shared by Cynthia Hansen, Executive Vice President & President, Gas Transmission & Midstream at pipeline giant Enbridge, and Chris James, founder and chief investment officer at Engine No.1, an investment firm.

These banks are designed to empower local communities by providing them with the tools and resources necessary to harness renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and biomass. By establishing a decentralized energy system, CBREBs not only promote sustainability but also enhance energy security and economic resilience within communities.

This innovative model encourages local participation, fosters collaboration, and ultimately leads to a more equitable energy landscape. The concept of CBREBs is rooted in the belief that communities should have control over their energy resources. By engaging local stakeholders in the planning and implementation processes, these banks can tailor solutions to meet the specific needs of their communities.

This localized approach not only increases the likelihood of project success but also builds a sense of ownership among community members. As a result, CBREBs can serve as a catalyst for broader social and economic development, paving the way for a sustainable future.

Overview of the Current Energy Landscape

The current energy landscape is characterized by a growing demand for clean and sustainable energy sources. As climate change continues to pose significant threats to our planet, there is an urgent need to transition away from fossil fuels and embrace renewable energy alternatives. However, many communities, particularly those in rural or low-income areas, face barriers to accessing these resources.

High upfront costs, lack of infrastructure, and limited technical expertise often hinder their ability to adopt renewable energy solutions. Moreover, traditional energy systems are often centralized, leaving many communities vulnerable to fluctuations in energy prices and supply disruptions. This reliance on external sources can exacerbate existing inequalities and limit opportunities for local economic development.

In contrast, CBREBs offer a decentralized model that empowers communities to generate their own energy, reducing dependence on external providers and fostering self-sufficiency. By leveraging local resources and knowledge, these banks can create a more resilient energy system that benefits all community members.

Objectives and Goals of the Grant Proposal

The primary objective of this grant proposal is to establish Community-Based Renewable Energy Banks in targeted communities to promote sustainable energy practices and enhance local resilience. Specifically, we aim to achieve the following goals: 1. Increase access to renewable energy sources for underserved communities by developing localized energy production systems.

2.

Foster community engagement and participation in the planning and implementation of renewable energy projects.

3. Provide training and capacity-building opportunities for community members to develop technical skills related to renewable energy technologies.

4. Promote economic development by creating green jobs and stimulating local economies through the establishment of CBREBs.

By focusing on these objectives, we aim to create a sustainable energy model that not only addresses immediate energy needs but also contributes to long-term community development.

Implementation Plan for Community-Based Renewable Energy Banks

The implementation plan for establishing Community-Based Renewable Energy Banks will involve several key phases. First, we will conduct a comprehensive needs assessment in the target communities to identify specific energy challenges and opportunities. This assessment will involve engaging with local stakeholders, including community members, local government officials, and potential partners, to gather input and build support for the project.

Once the needs assessment is complete, we will develop a tailored project plan that outlines the specific renewable energy technologies to be implemented, such as solar panels or wind turbines. We will also establish partnerships with local organizations and experts to provide technical assistance and training throughout the project lifecycle. Community workshops will be organized to educate residents about renewable energy options and encourage their active participation in the project.

The next phase will involve securing funding and resources for the project implementation. This may include applying for grants, seeking donations from local businesses, or exploring crowdfunding options. Once funding is secured, we will begin the installation of renewable energy systems in collaboration with community members.

Throughout this process, we will prioritize transparency and communication to ensure that all stakeholders are informed and engaged.

Budget and Funding Requirements

To successfully implement Community-Based Renewable Energy Banks, a detailed budget will be developed outlining all anticipated costs associated with the project. This budget will include expenses related to equipment procurement, installation, training programs, community engagement activities, and ongoing maintenance of renewable energy systems. We estimate that the total budget for establishing CBREBs in our target communities will be approximately $500,000.

This figure includes costs for solar panels, wind turbines, batteries for energy storage, training materials, and personnel expenses for project coordinators and trainers. To secure funding for this initiative, we will pursue various avenues such as government grants, private foundations focused on renewable energy or community development, and partnerships with local businesses willing to invest in sustainable initiatives. In addition to external funding sources, we will explore opportunities for community contributions through volunteer labor or small financial investments from residents who wish to participate in the project.

By fostering a sense of ownership among community members, we can enhance the sustainability of the CBREBs while also building local capacity.

Expected Impact and Benefits of the Project

The establishment of Community-Based Renewable Energy Banks is expected to yield significant positive impacts on both the environment and the local economy. By increasing access to renewable energy sources, we anticipate a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a decrease in reliance on fossil fuels within the target communities. This shift towards cleaner energy will contribute to global efforts to combat climate change while also improving air quality and public health.

Economically, CBREBs have the potential to create green jobs in areas such as installation, maintenance, and operation of renewable energy systems. By providing training opportunities for community members, we can equip them with valuable skills that enhance their employability and contribute to local economic growth. Additionally, by generating their own energy, communities can reduce their utility costs and redirect those savings towards other essential services or initiatives.

Socially, the project aims to foster greater community cohesion by encouraging collaboration among residents and local organizations. As community members work together towards a common goal of sustainable energy production, they will build stronger relationships and develop a sense of pride in their collective achievements. Ultimately, CBREBs can serve as a model for other communities seeking to adopt similar approaches to renewable energy.

Evaluation and Monitoring Plan

To ensure the success of Community-Based Renewable Energy Banks, a robust evaluation and monitoring plan will be implemented throughout the project lifecycle. This plan will include both qualitative and quantitative measures to assess progress towards our objectives and goals. We will establish key performance indicators (KPIs) related to energy production levels, community engagement rates, job creation figures, and participant satisfaction with training programs.

Regular data collection will be conducted through surveys, interviews, and focus groups with community members to gather feedback on their experiences with the project. Additionally, we will conduct periodic assessments of the renewable energy systems’ performance to ensure they are operating efficiently and meeting community needs. This ongoing monitoring will allow us to identify any challenges or areas for improvement promptly.

By maintaining transparency in our evaluation process, we can build trust with stakeholders and demonstrate the impact of our efforts.

Conclusion and Next Steps

In conclusion, Community-Based Renewable Energy Banks present an innovative solution to address the pressing energy needs of underserved communities while promoting sustainability and economic development. By empowering local residents to take control of their energy resources, we can create a more resilient and equitable energy landscape. As we move forward with this grant proposal, our next steps will involve finalizing partnerships with local organizations, conducting needs assessments in target communities, and developing a detailed project timeline.

We are committed to engaging community members throughout this process to ensure that their voices are heard and their needs are prioritized. With your support, we can turn this vision into reality and pave the way for a brighter future powered by clean, renewable energy for all.

In contrast, Iraq currently produces around 28,000 megawatts of electricity, with nearly 8,000 megawatts sourced from Iranian natural gas used in domestic power plants.
In March, Washington revoked a sanctions waiver that had allowed Iraq to purchase electricity directly from Iran, although another waiver remains in place for natural gas imports.
Iran’s own worsening energy shortages have further hampered its ability to supply Iraq, exacerbating the latter’s power crisis, according to Al Jazeera.","Iraq is preparing to inaugurate its first industrial-scale solar power plant in Karbala as part of broader efforts to tackle a chronic electricity shortage that has led to repeated nationwide blackouts, Al Jazeera reported.

According to Iraqi media cited by Al Jazeera, the facility—set to open on Sunday—will be the country’s largest solar power plant and is expected to eventually produce up to 300 megawatts of electricity at peak capacity.

The plant is located on approximately 4,000 dunams (1,000 acres or 400 hectares) in the al-Hur desert region of Karbala, southwest of Baghdad. The site features tens of thousands of solar panels arranged in systematic rows.

Nasser Karim al-Sudani, head of the national solar energy team in the Iraqi prime minister’s office, said additional projects are already in the pipeline. A second solar plant under construction in Babil province is expected to generate 225 megawatts, while a much larger 1,000-megawatt project is planned for the southern province of Basra.

“These initiatives are part of a broader vision to meet a portion of Iraq’s energy needs through large-scale solar power, easing the strain on the national grid while also reducing harmful gas emissions,” Al Jazeera quoted officials as saying.

Deputy Minister of Electricity Adel Karim stated that Iraq currently has solar energy projects with a combined capacity of 12,500 megawatts in various stages of development—from implementation and approval to negotiation. Excluding the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, these projects could potentially supply up to 20 percent of Iraq’s total electricity demand, he added.

Despite its abundant oil and gas reserves, Iraq has faced persistent electricity shortages for decades, driven by years of conflict, widespread corruption, and poor infrastructure management. This summer, national power consumption surged to nearly 55,000 megawatts, while temperatures in parts of the country exceeded 50 degrees Celsius (122°F), Al Jazeera reported.

In contrast, Iraq currently produces around 28,000 megawatts of electricity, with nearly 8,000 megawatts sourced from Iranian natural gas used in domestic power plants. However, these imports have frequently been disrupted—partly due to U.S. sanctions on Tehran. In March, Washington revoked a sanctions waiver that had allowed Iraq to purchase electricity directly from Iran, although another waiver remains in place for natural gas imports.

Iran’s own worsening energy shortages have further hampered its ability to supply Iraq, exacerbating the latter’s power crisis, according to Al Jazeera.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-09-at-14.15.06_c23652d7.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 04:00:10.654750

Donald Trump’s justice department has asked a judge to shut down a Vermont law which holds major polluters financially responsible for climate damages.
Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, said her organization would “continue to defend the state’s climate superfund law meant to protect the wallets of Vermont’s families and businesses.
In an April executive order, Trump instructed the justice department to “stop the enforcement” of climate superfund policies.

Donald Trump’s justice department has asked a judge to shut down a Vermont law which holds major polluters financially responsible for climate damages.

In a brief filed on Monday in a federal court in Burlington, the administration said the policy was “unlawful on its face” and pushed the court to “end Vermont’s lawless experiment.”

“The Court should deny the motions to dismiss, grant the United States’ motion for summary judgment, declare the Superfund Act unconstitutional and unenforceable, and permanently enjoin Defendants from taking any actions to implement or enforce it,” Riley Walters, counsel to an acting assistant attorney general, wrote in the motion.

Passed in 2024, the Vermont policy — known as the Climate Superfund Act — requires major polluters to pay for their carbon emissions, which have warmed the planet and increased the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, such as the floods which wreaked $1 billion in damage on the state last year. New York passed a similar measure in December.

“This law is about holding Big Oil accountable for a portion of the damage it has already brought to Vermont’s farms, businesses, homeowners and communities,” said Paul Burns, executive director of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, one of the organizations that helped to pass Vermont’s climate superfund law. “Vermont is well within its rights to protect its people in this way.”

The filing comes four months after the Department of Justice and Environmental Protection Agency sued Vermont and New York over the laws. In August, the state and two nonprofits who were granted intervenor status, the Conservation Law Foundation and the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont, asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuit.

Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, said her organization would “continue to defend the state’s climate superfund law meant to protect the wallets of Vermont’s families and businesses.

“Let’s be clear: This law is not a sweeping effort to regulate global greenhouse gas emissions, punish fossil fuel companies, or set federal policy on climate change,” she said. “This is Vermont using its legal right to raise revenue and protect the health, safety, and well-being of its residents from the ruinous, inescapable consequences of climate change.”

The motion is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to quash climate accountability efforts and environmental regulations. In an April executive order, Trump instructed the justice department to “stop the enforcement” of climate superfund policies.

In July, the administration proposed undoing the 2009 “endangerment finding,” which says planet-warming emissions endanger public health and should therefore be regulated under the Clean Air Act – the most audacious of more than 150 environmental rollbacks launched since Trump retook office in January.

Jamie Henn, director of the anti-fossil fuel nonprofit Fossil Free Media, which backs the superfund laws, said Trump’s assault would not deter efforts to bring about financial accountability for global warming. Legislators in at least a dozen states are looking to introduce or reintroduce climate superfund bills in 2026, he said.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/VermontFlooding.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-09-20 20:01:33.469502

Diamond Green Diesel, Darling Ingredients, Valero Energy, Southwest and JetBlue did not reply to multiple requests for comment, including detailed questions about the Brazilian tallow supply chain.
Reuters also interviewed over a dozen people involved in each step of the beef tallow supply chain, including traders, truck drivers, prosecutors, auditors and regulators.
In 2023, Araguaia exported $4.4mn worth of beef tallow from the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, according to trade data from Import Genius.","A Texas refinery that supplies green fuel to US airlines has been purchasing animal fat from cattle raised on illegally cleared lands in the Amazon rainforest, according to a Reuters review of government tracking data, interviews and eyewitness accounts.

Louisiana-based Diamond Green Diesel, a joint-venture between biofuels producer Darling Ingredients and petroleum refiner Valero Energy, has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into a refinery in Port Arthur, Texas that turns cattle fat — called tallow — into a cleaner alternative to petroleum-based jet fuel and diesel.

Diamond Green Diesel is a major player in the US sustainable fuels market. It has collected over $3bn in US tax credits for producing biofuels since 2022, according to filings.

But interviews and documents show at least two Brazilian factories that supplied Diamond Green Diesel with tens of thousands of tons of cattle fat since 2023 are sourcing some of it from slaughterhouses that have bought animals from illegally deforested ranches in the Amazon rainforest.

Carriers such as JetBlue and Southwest Airlines, which struck deals with Valero to use the “green” jet fuel, can claim credit for lowering their emissions because Diamond Green Diesel’s plant is certified under a United Nations agreement curbing the impact of aviation on the climate called CORSIA.

The global market for sustainable jet fuel is small, about $2.9bn in 2025 according to analysis firm SkyQuest Technology Group, compared to the $239bn global market for conventional aviation fuel. But government incentives are expected to help the market grow exponentially, pumping more resources into the Brazilian cattle industry, the leading driver of the destruction of the Amazon rainforest.

Pedro Piris-Cabezas, an economist at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said any additional demand “could result in the expansion of herds and directly or indirectly drive deforestation and forest degradation.”

It could also violate Brazilian law. “Companies that profit from raw materials originating from a supply chain that involves deforestation, are also responsible for these illegalities,” said Ricardo Negrini, a Brazilian federal prosecutor who has opened a number of government investigations into the cattle industry.

Diamond Green Diesel, Darling Ingredients, Valero Energy, Southwest and JetBlue did not reply to multiple requests for comment, including detailed questions about the Brazilian tallow supply chain.

To track the tallow trade from illegally deforested ranches in the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, Reuters partnered with the nonprofit investigative outlet Reporter Brasil, which helped review court documents that link slaughterhouses to the tallow plants, corporate filings, trade data, and government cattle tracking records.

Reuters also interviewed over a dozen people involved in each step of the beef tallow supply chain, including traders, truck drivers, prosecutors, auditors and regulators.

Diamond Green Diesel sources tallow from multiple countries, and Reuters was unable to determine how much of it came from ranches in illegally-cleared land in the Amazon.

In 2022 Darling Ingredients CEO Randall Stuewe announced the $557mn acquisition of several plants in Brazil, including four in the Amazon region, that would supply “waste fats to be used in the production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel,” according to a statement issued at the time.

Reuters found one of those rendering plants in Para state, called Araguaia, sourced cattle fat from at least five meatpackers that failed a May 2025 audit conducted by federal prosecutors for slaughtering 20,000 cattle from illegally deforested areas.

In 2023, Araguaia exported $4.4mn worth of beef tallow from the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, according to trade data from Import Genius.

In June, a Reuters journalist saw a truck with an Araguaia logo inside the Sao Francisco slaughterhouse, which failed an audit for buying cattle from farms on illegally deforested land.

The driver of the truck, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters he had been picking up carcasses at the Sao Francisco slaughterhouse and delivering them to the Araguaia plant for two years. Two other drivers and two Sao Francisco employees confirmed the slaughterhouse was an Araguaia supplier.

Sao Francisco didn’t confirm or deny that it is a supplier of the Araguaia plant. It said it has been cooperating with federal prosecutors since 2018 and that it hired an outside firm to monitor its supply chain.

Sao Francisco sources some of its cattle indirectly from Vale do Paraiso, a farm that had been blocked from grazing cattle since 2006 because 15 square miles of trees had been illegally razed, according to Brazil’s environmental protection agency, Ibama. Cattle tracking data shows that the cattle was moved from Vale do Paraiso to a farm with a clean record before it reached the slaughterhouse.

The agency unblocked Vale do Paraiso last year because a court determined that the statute of limitations had expired, but its owner Antonio Lucena Barros still owes over $3mn in fines for the deforestation there, according to government documents.

Barros’ lawyer Calebe Rocha said in a statement that his client is fighting the fines in court and has been granted an injunction that suspends the payment of the fine. He also said that no animals were sold from the part of Vale do Paraiso that Ibama had blocked due to deforestation.

Another plant owned by Darling Ingredients sourced fat from a slaughterhouse that confirmed to Reuters that it bought hundreds of cattle in 2022 and 2023 from rancher Bruno Heller, who Brazil’s Federal Police has described as possibly the Amazon’s biggest deforester in a 2023 investigation.

In a statement, Heller’s lawyer Vinicius Segatto said Brazil’s environmental law is “excessively rigorous” and that the criminal case against his client is ongoing.

Airlines have been under pressure to buy more green jet fuel, which is now produced in tiny quantities, to meet industry targets of net-zero emissions by 2050.

Supporters of the use of tallow as a biofuel assert that demand for it alone is unlikely to push ranchers to clear rainforest to grow their pastures because of its economic value — less than 3% of what slaughterhouses get for each animal.

’ imports from Brazil were certified as sustainable by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), a third-party certification body that approved Diamond’s plant for CORSIA.

To be eligible, biomass used for fuel cannot come from land that was deforested after 2008 or protected areas, but the ISCC told Reuters it did not investigate Diamond’s supply chain because it considers tallow a “byproduct” of the beef industry under CORSIA.

Three experts who helped design CORSIA told Reuters that the program allows producers to omit the score for carbon emissions and deforestation of the Amazon rainforest because it assumes demand for tallow is unlikely to push ranchers to grow their herds.

The International Civil Aviation Organisation declined to comment when asked about whether it viewed deforestation in the tallow supply chain as a violation of its sustainability standards.

However, the agency said it is “constantly monitoring the compliance” of third-parties responsible for certifying sustainable aviation fuel producers and welcomes information on “any potential deviations” for further evaluation. — Reuters",https://www.gulf-times.com/gulftimes/uploads/images/2025/09/20/359481.JPG,N,,2025-09-20 19:00:53.059269

Game-Changing Benefits for Stellantis Brands

The integrated battery system represents a significant advancement in EV technology that could benefit multiple Stellantis brands across North America. Jeep's current 4xe lineup, including the Grand Cherokee 4xe with its 26-mile electric range and Wrangler 4xe offering 21 miles of electric-only driving, could see meaningful improvements with IBIS technology implementation.

A 10% efficiency boost would translate to approximately 2.6 additional miles of electric range for the Grand Cherokee 4xe and over 2 miles for the Wrangler 4xe. While these gains might seem modest, they represent meaningful improvements where every mile of electric range reduces reliance on gasoline. The weight reduction of 88 pounds also improves overall efficiency. Dodge's Charger EVs could also benefit from up to 30 miles of additional range and space savings, while Ram's recently shelved electric pickup truck could have leveraged the faster charging capabilities and reduced complexity.

Too Little, Too Late?

Traditional EVs use separate onboard chargers that convert grid AC power to DC for battery storage, while onboard inverters convert battery DC power to AC for electric motors. By consolidating these functions into the battery pack itself, Stellantis creates opportunities for simplified vehicle assembly, reduced manufacturing costs, and improved reliability. The technology also improves Stellantis' position against Tesla and Ford in the rapidly evolving EV market.

The IBIS technology could prove valuable as Stellantis accelerates its electrification timeline across brands like Dodge, which plans to transition its performance lineup to electric power. The system's ability to provide faster charging and higher efficiency while maintaining smaller packaging requirements addresses two critical consumer concerns about EV adoption.

The bill would designate physicians working for the Veterans Affairs (VA) Department as temporary traveling workers to care for VA patients in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories and possessions. King-Hinds said creating the special category of physicians “directly addresses the critical shortage of specialized medical care in remote and underserved areas” away from the U.S. mainland.

Memorializing Veterans

The House on Sept. 16, by a unanimous vote, passed the Honoring Our Heroes Act (H.R. 2721), sponsored by Rep. Timothy Kennedy (D-N.Y.), to require the Veterans Affairs Department to adopt a pilot program for putting up burial markers at national cemeteries for military veterans who died between December 1941 and November 1990. Kennedy said: “The quality of a veteran’s memorial should not be based on when they die but, rather, every memorial must provide dignity, respect, and lasting recognition for all who wear the uniform.”

Criminal Law in Washington, D.C.

The House on Sept. 16, by a 240-179 vote, passed the DC Criminal Reforms to Immediately Make Everyone Safe Act (H.R. 4922), sponsored by Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), to make several changes to criminal sentencing law in Washington, D.C., including not allowing those 18 years or older to be tried as youth offenders. Donalds said: “It is time for Congress to step up, adhere to our constitutional duty, and firmly address crime in the nation’s capital.” An opponent, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), said “there is never justification for Congress to legislate on local D.C. matters.”

Juvenile Crime in Washington, D.C.

The House on Sept. 16, by a 225-203 vote, passed a bill (H.R. 5140), sponsored by Rep. Brandon Gill (R-Texas), to lower to 14 the age at which juveniles charged with violent felonies can be tried as an adult in Washington, D.C., courts. Gill said it “restores order and common sense to the laws of our nation’s capital. The American people and every visitor in D.C., as well, deserve nothing less.” A bill opponent, Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), said juveniles should not be prosecuted on the same level as adults, and that “youth charged as adults are more likely to reoffend than youth that go through the juvenile courts.”

Judges in Washington, D.C.

The House on Sept. 17, by a 218-211 vote, passed the District of Columbia Judicial Nominations Reform Act (H.R. 5125), sponsored by Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), to end the District of Columbia Judicial Nomination Commission, which has recommended candidates for two D.C. court systems for nomination by the president. Sessions said giving the president more control and authority over judicial nominees in the District would “go back to a process that works.” A bill opponent, Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), said it “does nothing to improve the judicial system. It strips away one of the few tools D.C. residents have to shape their courts, and it erodes judicial independence.”

Policing Washington, D.C.

The House on Sept. 17, by a 245-182 vote, passed the District of Columbia Policing Protection Act (H.R. 5143), sponsored by Rep. Clay Higgins (R-La.), to end restrictions, enacted in 2022, on the authority for District police officers to conduct vehicular pursuits of fleeing criminal suspects. Higgins said: “My bill stands on the side of the citizenry of D.C. in an effort to enforce the law by fully empowering the police officers of D.C. to engage criminal conduct and enforce the law.” An opponent, Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), said “these decisions are best left to our communities to write the laws of when these police chases should actually go into effect.”

Cross-Border Energy Projects

The House on Sept. 18, by a 224-203 vote, passed the Promoting Cross-border Energy Infrastructure Act (H.R. 3062), sponsored by Rep. Julie Fedorchak (R-N.D.), to establish procedures, including a deadline, for reviewing permitting applications to develop international energy infrastructure between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Fedorchak said: “By creating a consistent statutory framework that protects all existing requirements and environmental reviews, we can provide the regulatory certainty energy developers need to invest, hire, and build.” A bill opponent, Rep. Jennifer McClellan (D-Va.), said the State Department should be involved in the project review process, and McClellan predicted that the bill “could also drive up costs for consumers at a time when many Americans are already facing rising costs.”

Coal Industry Council

The House on Sept. 18, by a 217-209 vote, passed the National Coal Council Reestablishment Act (H.R 3015), sponsored by Rep. Michael Rulli (R-Ohio), to re-establish the Council, which had expired in 2021, and permanently authorize its existence as a non-governmental advisory committee to the Energy Department. Rulli said bringing the Council back would help “make sure that national security, which is our grid, because if our grid melts down, there is no security.” A bill opponent, Rep. Doris Matsui (D-Calif.), called coal “the dirtiest form of energy and also one of the most expensive,” and Matsui said the U.S. should pursue “cheaper, cleaner options” for supplying power to the electrical grid.

Grid Interconnection Requests

The House on Sept. 18, by a 216-206 vote, passed the Guaranteeing Reliability through the Interconnection of Dispatchable Power Act (H.R. 1047), sponsored by Rep. Troy Balderson (R-Ohio), to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to make a rule governing the process for approving requests to place dispatchable power resources onto the electrical grid. Balderson cited estimates that power generation projects must wait years to connect to the grid and said fixing that problem is necessary “if we want to keep American businesses running and ensure uninterrupted power for our constituents.” A bill opponent, Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.), said it “will give polluting gas plants an unfair and costly shortcut to the electric grid while doing nothing to protect working families from rising energy costs.”

Michael Lawler (R-17, including Philipstown) voted yes

Pat Ryan (D-18, including Beacon) voted no

Along with roll call votes, this week the House also passed these measures:

The Courthouse Affordability and Space Efficiency (H.R. 3426), to limit the construction of new courthouses under certain circumstances;

The Protecting Veteran Access to Telemedicine Services Act (H.R. 1107), to authorize certain heath care professionals employed by the Veterans Affairs Department to deliver, distribute, or dispense certain controlled medications to veterans via telemedicine;

The Servicemember Residence Protection Act (H.R. 2334), to pre-empt state laws that establish squatter’s rights for premises owned by a servicemember when the premises is occupied by a squatter during a period of military service by the servicemember;

The Modernizing All Veterans and Survivors Claims Processing Act (H.R. 3854), to direct the Veterans Affairs Department to submit a plan to expand its use of certain automation tools.

SENATE

Reviewing Nominees Slate

The Senate on Sept. 15, by a 51-44 vote, passed a resolution (S. Res. 377), sponsored by Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), for the en bloc consideration of a set of 48 nominees for executive branch positions, including several ambassadorships and an array of senior roles in the military and other federal agencies. Thune said en bloc consideration was necessary because Democratic senators had, unprecedentedly, refused to confirm any of the president’s nominees by unanimous consent or voice vote, and the resulting need to invoke cloture and have recorded votes on each nominee “ties up the Senate floor, preventing us from considering important legislation.”

Federal Reserve Board

The Senate on Sept. 15, by a 48-47 vote, confirmed the nomination of Stephen Miran to be a member of the board of the Federal Reserve banking system for a term ending in early 2026. In March, Miran became chairman of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers. He was a policy advisor at the Treasury Department during the first Trump administration, then a strategist at a private investment firm and fellow at the Manhattan Institute. An opponent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), said confirming Miran would allow President Trump “to succeed in this next phase of his very public, very obvious, months-long campaign to stack the Fed with loyalists who will prioritize Trump’s personal whims over America’s long-term economic health.”

Indiana Power Plant Emissions

The Senate on Sept. 16, by a 51-47 vote, rejected a motion to consider a resolution (S.J. Res. 60), sponsored by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), that would have nullified and voided an Environmental Protection Agency rule issued in May that increased allowed levels of nitrogen oxide emissions from Indiana power plants during the summer months. Whitehouse said the rule, by clearing the way for coal-fired power plants to remain in operation, would endanger public health by increasing levels of smog, which “causes lung disease, it causes cardiovascular problems, and it even causes reproductive issues.” A resolution opponent, Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), called the rule “merely a housekeeping correction that lines up the state limit with active generation so unrealistic, retroactive costs aren’t forced on power plants and ultimately the ratepayer.”

Their signs and reasons for taking to the streets were diverse, but many said the march highlighted a common theme behind the issues they stood for: that a small, elite class of the wealthy and powerful consistently prioritized profits over people's lives.

“I don't see them as movements. I don't see them as organizations. I just see humanity. We are all on this Earth. This is our mother,"" said Mahaishuwea, whose name means Eagle Woman in the language of the Hidatsa tribe, which is based in North Dakota.

As marchers gathered, she spoke about her personal experiences growing up on the Fort Berthold Indian reservation, where she survived cancer. Standing in front of investment management company Blackstone's headquarters, she connected the violent history of colonization and resource extraction on Indigenous lands to the present-day greed of the powerful. “They have a sickness,” she said.

Demonstrations have been planned around the world this week ahead of the United Nations General Assembly and New York Climate Week. Despite years of international conferences, negotiations and treaties, countries have continued to increase their emissions of carbon dioxide and other planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, fueling more frequent and intense extreme weather events. 2024 was the hottest year on record, and the Trump administration has been working to roll back foundational environmental rules. This has freed the way for oil and coal industries to pollute more while presenting more roadblocks to wind and solar energy development.

Tamika Middleton, managing director of the Women's March, said that although it sometimes can be challenging to bring together people who are passionate about different causes, this year the intersections between them felt clearer. “The climate crisis, economic fights and immigrant fights are all really one big fight,” she said.

The crowd stretched for over four city blocks and passed by luxury stores like Louis Vuitton, Bergdorf Goodman and Tiffany & Co. Some carried enormous papier-mache puppets of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. Several grabbed the edges of a 160-foot “climate polluters bill” calling out the economic damages wrought by extreme weather events made worse by the carbon emissions of major polluting companies.

Others dressed as the Statue of Liberty, rang cowbells and waved flags with the Star Wars character Princess Leia or homemade signs inked in sharpie and paint. One simply read: “Free Kimmel.”

Tatiana Cruz was one of the people holding up the puppet of Elon Musk. “Eat the rich, that's the main message,” she said, smiling. But she also explained that this was her first year actively protesting more after two of her friends were deported after being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Since then, she has gotten more involved in movements for migrant rights, Palestinian liberation and fighting climate change.

“The monster up top is similar in a lot of different scenarios,” she said.

Julia Donahue-Wait had come out from the South Bronx with a group of families who had started organizing together and also described the many causes present at the march as interconnected. Her six-year-old daughter Eurydice has grown up on picket lines and helped with the poster painting. Behind her, another protester held a sign: “Our work is love,"" it read.

“It's all people without power taking it back,” Donahue-Wait said. “What we say to the kids is, we have safety and we need to stand up for people who don't have safety.”

Mahaishuwea said although many people are scared, she thought it was important to show up.

Her 12-year-old daughter is back at home. But she wants to teach future generations how to speak up, and “to show people we're not afraid,” she said.

At the end of the march, protesters held a five-minute moment of silence during which they sat in front of the Trump International Hotel and Tower.

President Biden's administration promised a transformative infrastructure push, including a sprawling network of fast-charging stations to blanket the nation. Yet, as of mid-2025, that vision remains more mirage than reality. The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocated $7.5 billion for EV chargers, aiming for 500,000 stations by 2030. THAT, never happened, Man, was THAT a fail of EPIC proportion!

Compounding the frustration is the charging experience itself: a touch-and-go ordeal that turns road trips into endurance tests. Imagine pulling into a station after hours of white-knuckled range monitoring, only to find half the stalls occupied by gas-guzzlers or malfunctioning units spitting error codes. Surveys from AAA in 2024 revealed 60% of EV owners report anxiety over charging reliability, with downtime averaging 20% during peak times. It's not just inconvenient; it's a buzzkill for the eco-warrior fantasy.

Then there's the lineup of EVs themselves. Where's the sizzle? Tesla's Cybertruck and Rivian's R1T were supposed to ignite lust, but high prices—often north of $80,000—keep them niche and in our opinion, neither is a MUST-HAVE.

Mainstream models like the Chevy Bolt refresh or Ford Mustang Mach-E updates feel iterative, not revolutionary. Consumer Reports' 2025 EV satisfaction index shows a dip: Only 45% of buyers cite ""excitement"" as a factor, down from 62% in 2022. Without jaw-dropping designs or must-have features—like affordable sub-$30,000 options or seamless autonomy—EVs risk blending into the beige sedan crowd. Sales reflect this: EV market share stalled at 7.6% in Q2 2025, per Cox Automotive, as hybrids steal the spotlight.

So, how does the EV shake off this 'meh' funk?

Innovation is the spark. Automakers need to deliver crave-worthy rides: But NONE are coming that we can see to turn this around.

Until, they figure it out which we don’t think they will, we’re all stuck idling and Tesla is running further and further away.

By investing in widespread adoption of distributed energy now, North Carolina can build a stronger, more dependable energy system that is flexible in a crisis and able to help avert prolonged outages.
And because distributed energy sources are decentralized, they can be scaled to meet the unique needs of North Carolina, from mountain towns in the west to coastal cities in the east.
Hurricane Helene was a wake-up call for communities that assumed that their distance from the coast protected them from hurricanes.
After Hurricane Helene, this microgrid supplied power to Hot Springs for six days before the main grid was restored.","In Mills River, community members recently came together for AMPlify Appalachia to celebrate — with live music and craft beer — their energy and resilience since Hurricane Helene swept through North Carolina nearly a year ago.

After the hurricane caused 108 deaths and more than $60 billion in damage, AMPlify Appalachia offered people a space where they could process a year filled with heartbreak and uncertainty. It also highlighted a growing community that is committed not only to recovery but also to building a more resilient future.

In the wake of Hurricane Helene, creation of reliable energy systems was both an urgent necessity and long-term challenge. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, distributed energy resources (DERs) proved vital in delivering lifesaving power to remote, storm-ravaged areas in the western mountains of North Carolina, where downed lines were difficult to access and repair. Thanks to organizations such as the Footprint Project, a solar microgrid at a fire station was used to run refrigerators, freezers, and communications; an atmospheric water generator was set up to keep relief teams hydrated without relying on single-use bottled water; and portable power stations were established to help residents in need of emergency medical care.

Distributed energy, which can generate, store, and deliver electricity independently from the main grid, is a highly effective way to keep electricity flowing and mitigate the risk of outages. DERs, which include battery storage, solar panels, electric vehicles, and smart thermostats, allow households, schools, hospitals, and communities to produce and store their own energy without relying solely on distant power plants. These consumer- and community-based energy resources ease strain on the central grid and can operate when storms knock the grid out.

Today, more than 60 operational DER projects support communities across Western North Carolina, proving that these weren’t one-time fixes — they are the building blocks of long-term resilience. But there is more to do. By investing in widespread adoption of distributed energy now, North Carolina can build a stronger, more dependable energy system that is flexible in a crisis and able to help avert prolonged outages. And because distributed energy sources are decentralized, they can be scaled to meet the unique needs of North Carolina, from mountain towns in the west to coastal cities in the east.

Hurricane Helene was a wake-up call for communities that assumed that their distance from the coast protected them from hurricanes. It was also a sobering sign of what’s to come.

Extreme weather events like Helene are expected to become more frequent and more destructive. Just weeks ago, the remnants of Tropical Storm Chantal caused flash flooding that closed Interstate 40, damaged homes and businesses, killed six people, and prompted numerous water rescues.

At the same time, energy demand in North Carolina is rapidly growing, not only among individuals and households but also from data centers and other commercial users. Our electricity grid is at risk of being overwhelmed. According to consulting firm ICF International, electricity demand in the United States is projected to grow 25% by 2030 —the fastest rate in over 70 years.

Because the grid is not built for this double threat, we can expect more disruptions, longer blackouts, and higher monthly energy costs for the average North Carolina resident. But fortunately, the Tar Heel State has been planning for a future with new, reliable, affordable energy options. For example, Duke Energy’s microgrid in the mountain town of Hot Springs offers a model for resilience that is similar to the work done through the Footprint Project. In 2023, Duke installed a solar and battery storage microgrid at the utility’s substation to serve as backup power for the town. After Hurricane Helene, this microgrid supplied power to Hot Springs for six days before the main grid was restored.

State officials, utilities, and local leaders have an opportunity — and a responsibility — to prioritize policies and programs that create a more reliable and affordable electric system through the use of distributed energy as they plan for North Carolina’s energy future.

The road to recovery in Western North Carolina is long, but with tools such as solar and battery storage, this region is leading the way, not just in rebuilding, but in redefining what resilience looks like.

My mom and dad didn't drink or smoke but both died from cancer before their 70th birthdays. When I asked their oncologist in Pittsburgh why they might have contracted cancer, his reply was, “They grew up in the Ohio River Valley when air and water pollution were unregulated.”

During the 1940s, the Ohio River was used as an industrial sewer and smoke blanketed the Ohio River Valley; at times even blocking out the sun.

President Nixon recognized the need to address these issues, saying we should “make peace with nature and begin to make reparations for the damage we have done to our air, land, and water.” He signed into law several environmental regulations, including: the National Environmental Policy Act, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Air Act of 1970, the creation of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Endangered Species Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and the creation of the Legacy of Parks program. The life-saving policies of Nixon’s administration are being eroded away by an administration that denies science and scientific studies.

On March 12, Trump’s head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lee Zeldin, announced the “most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history.” Thirty-one acts of legislation that were created to protect human health and the environment are now being abolished in favor of industry profits. One of the rollbacks includes the 2009 Endangerment Finding which states that the EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act and that these gases pose a significant danger to human health.

The 2009 Endangerment Finding is backed by an overwhelming amount of scientific evidence. Last week, Trump’s EPA announced it will no longer require polluting industries to report their air emissions and is tossing out PFAS limits that protect drinking water.

Ohio’s politicians also fail to protect Ohioans as they continue to ignore the documented health and environmental effects from fracking. Citizens question the ability of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources to protect drinking water from toxic brine injected into Class II wells. Now Ohio communities are being targeted for data centers, which will be powered by fracked gas. This means more destruction of ecosystems and communities in SE Ohio, as well as the communities that will host these enormous water-hogging, energy-hogging data centers.

Our home is located less than a mile from a fracking operation. We spent the better part of the summer listening to the sound of drilling and fracking; the sounds of nature were obliterated. Additionally, roads surrounding the well pad saw a steady barrage of sand, water and toxic radioactive brine trucks.

Governor DeWine is fooling himself if he thinks fracking state parks won't affect tourism or the health of local communities; it has and will continue to do so.

What's happening?

Cox Automotive exclusively shared data with Reuters that revealed Tesla's U.S. market share has dipped to its lowest level in nearly eight years at 38% — a far cry from the 80% share it once held.

This is the first time Tesla's share has fallen below 40% since 2017, when the Model 3 became its first mass-market car and inspired a greater number of consumers to switch to EVs.

""I know they're positioning themselves as a robotics, AI company. But when you're a car company, when you don't have new products, your share will start to decline,"" Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox's director of industry insights, told Reuters.

Why is this important?

While CEO Elon Musk has remained bullish on his robotics and AI aspirations, Tesla's talent exodus and Musk's history of overpromising and underdelivering have spooked investors.

Musk's political involvement also caused a segment of consumers to associate Tesla with Musk's personal views rather than the EVs, contributing to declining sales numbers. Other EV makers had already been attracting buyers away from Tesla, but they have also benefited from this upheaval, leaving Tesla with a smaller piece of the pie.

What does this mean for the EV market?

Even though Tesla — whose name is synonymous with EVs — is facing reputational challenges, Cox's data showed that new EV sales leaped 24% month over month in July, per Reuters. The following month, as Tesla's growth lagged at 3.1%, the EV market grew by 14%.

Hyundai, Honda, Kia, and Toyota were key automakers turning up the heat on Tesla, offering more robust incentives to consumers scrambling to purchase EVs before October.

In addition to helping make cities healthier because they don't release tailpipe pollution, EVs offer long-term savings on energy and maintenance. This makes EVs attractive to consumers, regardless of their opinion about the brand largely responsible for making them mainstream.

""These legacy manufacturers are all benefiting from this sense of urgency, and they're able to have attractive offerings for their vehicles — and it's working,"" Streaty told Reuters.

The project, the largest of its kind in China, was put into full operation in the city of Hami on Thursday.

A 100-megawatt molten salt solar thermal section of the project has adopted advanced Linear Fresnel technology — one of the most advanced solar thermal power generation methods, using the principles of light reflection and refraction to convert solar thermal energy into electricity. It can generate 148 million kilowatt-hours of clean power annually, which will reduce carbon emissions by 1.3 million tonnes.

“Through this technology, molten salt acts like a super ‘power bank,’ storing heat collected from 260,000 mirrors under the sun during the day and generating power at night, enabling continuous electricity generation and lowering costs,” said Huang Longfei, a deputy manager of the project’s solar thermal section.

Xinjiang, the largest provincial-level administrative region in China, has abundant solar and wind resources.

As China has been striving to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, an increasing number of Chinese companies are developing clean energy in Xinjiang, driving the region’s green development, bringing employment and contributing to the country’s dual-carbon goals.

According to a white paper issued last year, clean energy accounted for 26.4 percent of China’s total energy use in 2023 — up from 15.5 percent in 2013 — and the share of coal in its energy consumption has dropped by 12.1 percentage points over the past decade.

Electricity generated from clean energy has accounted for more than half of the increase in the country’s total electricity consumption over the past decade, demonstrating the growing share green energy has in its energy mix.

Eyeing the potential for the wind power industry in the region, wind turbine manufacturer Yuexin Green Energy Group has invested 4 billion yuan (about 562 million U.S. dollars) to build an assembly line and a blade production base in Xinjiang’s Turpan City.

According to the group’s general manager Qiu Yong, the city’s central location within Xinjiang’s major wind power zones helps cut transport costs.

Qiu also highlighted the company’s strategic focus on Central Asian markets. “We received an order for 200 wind turbines from Kazakhstan soon after construction of the blade production base began last year,” he said, adding that the two facilities have opened some 2,000 jobs.

After graduating from university, local resident Maraba Mahmut works as an administrative specialist for the company, earning about 6,000 yuan a month.

Their signs and reasons for taking to the streets were diverse, but many said the march highlighted a common theme behind the issues they stood for: that a small, elite class of the wealthy and powerful consistently prioritized profits over people’s lives.

“I don’t see them as movements. I don’t see them as organizations. I just see humanity. We are all on this Earth. This is our mother,” said Mahaishuwea, whose name means Eagle Woman in the language of the Hidatsa tribe, which is based in North Dakota.

Standing in front of investment management company Blackstone’s headquarters, she connected the violent history of colonization and resource extraction on Indigenous lands to the present-day greed of the powerful. “They have a sickness,” she said.

Demonstrations have been planned around the world this week ahead of the United Nations General Assembly and New York Climate Week. Despite years of international conferences, negotiations and treaties, countries have continued to increase their emissions of carbon dioxide and other planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, fueling more frequent and intense extreme weather events. 2024 was the hottest year on record, and the Trump administration has been working to roll back foundational environmental rules. This has freed the way for oil and coal industries to pollute more while presenting more roadblocks to wind and solar energy development.

Tamika Middleton, managing director of the Women’s March, said that although it sometimes can be challenging to bring together people who are passionate about different causes, this year the intersections between them felt clearer. “The climate crisis, economic fights and immigrant fights are all really one big fight,” she said.

The crowd stretched for over four city blocks and passed by luxury stores like Louis Vuitton, Bergdorf Goodman and Tiffany & Co. Some carried enormous papier-mache puppets of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. Several grabbed the edges of a 160-foot “climate polluters bill” calling out the economic damages wrought by extreme weather events made worse by the carbon emissions of major polluting companies.

Others dressed as the Statue of Liberty, rang cowbells and waved flags with the Star Wars character Princess Leia or homemade signs inked in sharpie and paint. One simply read: “Free Kimmel.”

Tatiana Cruz was one of the people holding up the puppet of Elon Musk. “Eat the rich, that’s the main message,” she said, smiling. But she also explained that this was her first year actively protesting more after two of her friends were deported after being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Since then, she has gotten more involved in movements for migrant rights, Palestinian liberation and fighting climate change.

“The monster up top is similar in a lot of different scenarios,” she said.

Julia Donahue-Wait had come out from the South Bronx with a group of families who had started organizing together and also described the many causes present at the march as interconnected. Her young daughter Eurydice has grown up on picket lines and helped with the poster painting. Behind her, another protester held a sign: “Our work is love,” it read.

“It’s all people without power taking it back,” Donahue-Wait said. “What we say to the kids is, we have safety and we need to stand up for people who don’t have safety.”

Mahaishuwea said although many people are scared, she thought it was important to show up.

Her 12-year-old daughter is back at home. But she wants to teach future generations how to speak up, and “to show people we’re not afraid,” she said.

At the end of the march, protesters held a five-minute moment of silence during which they sat in front of the Trump International Hotel and Tower.

US President Donald Trump’s administration is on a mission to weaken China’s global network of ports and bring more strategic terminals under Western control, according to three sources familiar with the plan.The drive is part of the most ambitious effort to expand US maritime influence since the 1970s and is designed to address growing fears in Washington that it would be at a disadvantage to China in the event of a conflict.Trump administration officials believe the US commercial shipping fleet is ill-equipped to provide logistical support for the military in time of war and Washington’s dependence on foreign ships and ports is excessive, the people said.Options the White House is considering include supporting private US or Western firms to buy Chinese stakes in ports, the three people said. They did not mention any specific firms other than to cite BlackRock’s proposed deal to buy the port assets of Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison in 23 countries, including by the Panama Canal, as a good example.The sources asked not to be named because they are not authorised to discuss the matter publicly.The White House and US Treasury did not respond to requests for comment.Besides Panama, US officials and lawmakers are concerned about Chinese maritime infrastructure holdings in places including Greece and Spain, the Caribbean, and US West Coast ports, according to the sources.China conducts normal co-operation with other countries within the framework of international law, a spokesperson with China’s diplomatic mission in Washington said.“China has always been firmly opposed to illegal and unjustifiable unilateral sanctions and so-called long-arm jurisdiction and moves that infringe on and undermine other countries’ legitimate rights and interests through economic coercion, hegemonism and bullying,” the spokesperson said.Officials in Beijing did not respond to a request for comment.“The US government sees Chinese investments in global ports as a huge threat to its national security,” said Stuart Poole-Robb, founder of risk and intelligence advisers KCS Group.“The concern is that China could leverage its control over these assets for espionage, military advantage or to disrupt supply chains during geopolitical crises,” he said, citing conversations with US security counterparts.Greek Port in focusThe US intends to look at Chinese interests in the Greek port of Piraeus, the three sources said. Situated in Athens, in the eastern Mediterranean, Piraeus is a pivotal hub on the trade route linking Europe, Africa and Asia.COSCO, one of China’s biggest port and shipping groups, holds a 67% stake in the Piraeus Port Authority company.Some Chinese investors are concerned Washington may want to target COSCO’s operations in Greece, a source close to Chinese investors involved in Greek shipping said.COSCO and the Greek government did not respond to requests for comment. Greek officials have told Reuters previously that they have not been informed about any plans to change control of Piraeus.Washington already has COSCO in its sights.The Department of Defense added state-owned COSCO to its blacklist of companies with links to the Chinese military in January. While the designation does not involve immediate bans on US companies doing business with those listed, it can act as a signal that further action is being considered.“The United States intends to attack China’s international influence by exaggerating the ‘China threat theory’ and use this as an excuse to force allies to take sides in supply chain arrangements,” the Development Research Center of the State Council, an official think-tank of China’s governing cabinet, said in a paper published last month.The US administration has unveiled measures to increase America’s thin commercial maritime presence around the world, including by encouraging domestic shipbuilding, is looking to expand access to US-controlled shipping registries, and is also reviewing global maritime chokepoints for shipping risks.China owns or leases an extensive network of ports through companies including COSCO and other state-controlled enterprises such as China Merchants and SIPG in Shanghai.According to a report published last year by the Council of Foreign Relations, a US think-tank, China had investments in 129 port projects worldwide through various companies, as of August 2024.China’s shipbuilding industry is also estimated to be 230 times larger than US shipyard capacity, meaning it could take decades to catch up, according to US Navy estimates.The US maritime push has contributed to tensions with Beijing, which sees port and shipping assets as integral to its Belt and Road initiative, at a time when the two superpowers are already at loggerheads over trade and tariffs.Mediterranean Gateway under reviewIn March, the US Federal Maritime Commission launched a review of seven maritime chokepoints. It said it wanted to identify regulations, policies or practices “that create unfavourable shipping conditions”.The Strait of Gibraltar, which separates Spain from Africa at the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea, was one such waterway the review is examining.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has sought to deepen trade ties with China and this has raised concerns in Washington over Beijing’s access to its ports, two of the sources said.“We are not aware of any alleged concerns or approaches by third parties on this matter and therefore it is not appropriate for us to comment,” a Spanish foreign ministry spokesperson said when asked for comment about Chinese port investments.COSCO has concessions to operate container terminals in Valencia and Bilbao, a Spanish Port Authority spokesperson said.Trump has taken numerous steps since returning to the White House to boost US influence over the seas.He signed an executive order in April to revive shipbuilding capacity to expand the fleet of US-controlled vessels.His administration is examining a proposal to establish a shipping registry in the US Virgin Islands that could attract vessels to a US-controlled flag without having to meet the stricter standards of the domestic US registry.The US is poised to start hitting Chinese-built or Chinese-flagged vessels with fees for calling at US ports.And Trump has also flagged seizing the semi-autonomous Danish territory of Greenland as an objective, due to its proximity to the Arctic and key shipping lanes.Together, this all adds up to the most ambitious effort by the US to improve its position in global shipping since President Richard Nixon, who tried to bolster domestic shipbuilding, the commercial ship registry, and US sea power, the sources familiar with the plans said.“The US in the short to medium term is likely to continue its efforts to counter Chinese influence in the key port areas by building alliances and partnerships to counter Chinese power and economic growth,” said Poole-Robb at KCS.Caribbean shipping concernsThe United States has expressed concern too about Chinese investment in Jamaica’s Kingston terminal, a key maritime transhipment hub in the Caribbean due to its location and deep-water port facilities, according to the three sources.China Merchants has a stake in the company operating Kingston’s container terminal together with France’s CMA CGM.

A new report from the nonprofit Rewiring America suggests home energy upgrades like solar power, batteries and heat pumps can offset the electricity demand from data centers.

The report cites data from the firm Aterio that the grid will need 93 gigawatts of additional power by 2029 for data centers that are announced or currently under construction. That’s about as much power as the state of California. Researchers at Rewiring America, which advocates for renewable energy and electrifying transportation and home appliances, estimate that installing rooftop solar, at-home batteries and upgrading electric heating and air conditioning could yield enough electricity gains to meet 100% of the data center demand.

The nonprofit has spent $500,000 on lobbying firms so far in 2025, according to OpenSecrets.

Cora Wyent, head of research and data science at Rewiring America, told Straight Arrow News the present moment is a “crossroads in the energy transition,” adding that “we have a choice to make about how we meet that increase in electricity demand.”

Across America, utility companies are asking state regulators to approve rate increases. Many are also making plans to build new gas power plants to meet demand from data centers. Instead of relying on new power plants, Wyent said she hopes to spark a conversation about investing in households as essential energy infrastructure, which could save consumers money. Some analysts, however, expressed doubts that home energy upgrades can make a difference against data center demand.

How did Rewiring America conduct its analysis?

Rewiring America built its findings on a state-by-state analysis of residential electricity demand and grid capacity. The organization examined the peak electricity demand on the grid and calculated how household upgrades could reduce that load.

The researchers then modeled three types of high-efficiency heat pump installations: upgrading electric resistance heating, replacing central air conditioning and converting electric resistance water heaters to heat pump water heaters. For each state, they determined which upgrade would deliver the most grid capacity and used that as their heat pump solution.

For solar and storage, the analysis modeled adding a five-kilowatt solar system to every American home with a suitable roof — about 81% of single-family homes nationally — and paired it with a home battery roughly the size of a Tesla Powerwall. The report calculated how much these installations could reduce stress on the grid during peak demand by generating and storing electricity during off-peak hours, then discharging it when demand surges.

“There’s a solution to the capacity needs that data centers have on the grid that can be widely beneficial to households across the country,” Wyent said.

‘No way you can do it fast enough’

Although experts agree that there are benefits to energy efficiency upgrades and distributed resources like batteries and rooftop solar, the report’s conclusion that these upgrades can meet data center demand has been met with skepticism.

“It seems like you’re swimming against a really big current,” Doug Sheridan, a veteran of the pipeline industry and managing director of EnergyPoint Research. “There’s no way you can do it fast enough,” Sheridan told SAN, expressing doubts over how fast home batteries and solar can be installed.

Sheridan also pointed out that many of the policies Rewiring America supports, such as drivers switching to electric vehicles and converting gas furnaces to heat pumps, will also drive up demand for electricity.

Justin Kirkpatrick, an environmental economist and professor at Michigan State University, said solar combined with sufficient battery storage is among the most cost-effective ways to power new data centers. But for that purpose, he said it’s more efficient to build solar and storage in a centralized fashion.

“Is it more efficient to put eight solar panels on 100 houses or put 800 solar panels in the field next to the data center, right by the battery?” Kirkpatrick told SAN.

However, Kirkpatrick does think households can play a role in reducing peak load on the grid through demand response programs. These are utility-run programs where customers can get money back on their electrical bill by voluntarily reducing their electricity consumption during peak demand.

“Every household has a price for reducing their demand,” Kirkpatrick said. “That is an area where households have a role.”

How would energy upgrades be financed?

Big Tech is already making major investments in power generation. Wyent said the tech industry could pay for energy infrastructure that also directly benefits homeowners. Under this model, data center developers would cover about 50% of heat pump costs or 30% of solar and battery installations, with homeowners paying the remainder.

Some utility companies are charging higher rates to large customers such as data centers. As an alternate model, Wyent said the utilities could offer a portion of new revenues toward incentives for household upgrades rather than utility-scale projects.

The report comes as federal tax credits for home energy efficiency and rooftop solar are set to expire at the end of this year, while grid-scale renewable projects retain longer-term incentives.

“We think that one potential source of funding is from hyperscalers and utilities looking for capacity on the grid,” Wyent said.",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2150184875_Getty_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 17:00:53.887820

Key Takeaways

The U.S. exported 3.9 billion barrels of oil to 146 countries in 2024, representing 55% of its domestic production

The top destinations were: Mexico (11.0%), the Netherlands (9.9%), Canada (8.1%) and China (8.1%)

The U.S. is one of the world’s largest oil producers and exporters. In 2024, the country shipped nearly 4 billion barrels of oil abroad, accounting for more than half of U.S. production that year. This flow of crude, refined products, and other liquids highlights the global importance of American energy.

This visualization breaks down the top countries buying U.S. oil last year. The data for this visualization comes from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). It tracks all petroleum and liquid fuel exports, measured in barrels.

North America Leads U.S. Oil Imports

Mexico topped the list of importers, receiving 429 million barrels, or 11% of all U.S. oil exports. Canada followed closely, importing over 316 million barrels (8.1%).

Europe and Asia Are Key Markets

The Netherlands was the second-largest buyer, taking in 387 million barrels (9.9%), while other major European buyers included the UK, Spain, and France. These exports often serve as inputs for refining hubs or redistribution across the continent.

Meanwhile, Asian countries such as China, South Korea, Japan, and India also ranked highly—each importing over 150 million barrels.

Broad Global Reach

While the top 10 countries accounted for a majority of exports, U.S. oil reached almost 150 countries. Even smaller nations like Togo, Belize, and Latvia made the list.

Why Does the U.S. Export Oil While Still Importing It?

At first glance, it may seem contradictory for the U.S. to export over half of its oil production while continuing to import oil, especially from Canada. But this is a result of differences in crude oil types, refinery configurations, and global market dynamics.

Most U.S. oil production is light, sweet crude, while many American refineries were built to handle heavier, sour grades. Additionally, some U.S. refineries are located closer to foreign markets than to domestic demand centers. As a result, oil flows both in and out of the country to optimize refining efficiency, logistics, and economic returns.

In total, 55% of U.S. oil production was exported.

With tariffs on steel and aluminum doubled to 50% and extended to 407 additional goods—including wind turbines and railcars—the administration is prioritizing domestic production to insulate the economy from global supply chain shocks U.S. Manufacturing in 2025: Key Shifts, Tariffs, and Reshoring[ 1 ]. This policy framework, reminiscent of historical mobilization efforts like those during World War II, is creating fertile ground for advanced manufacturing sectors. For investors, the intersection of industrial policy, technological innovation, and capital inflows presents compelling opportunities in semiconductors, automation, and clean energy.

Historical Precedents: Lessons from WWII Mobilization

The U.S. industrial mobilization during World War II offers a blueprint for understanding the long-term economic benefits of strategic industrial policy. Government-led construction of war production plants in the 1940s spurred a 30% increase in manufacturing employment and a 10% rise in wages in treated regions, with lasting effects on population growth and median family earnings US economic policy in WW2 shaped regional development | VoxDev[ 2 ]. These plants, often staffed by unskilled workers, not only fueled wartime success but also catalyzed regional development. For example, counties with war production facilities saw a 20% higher population growth and a 7–8% increase in median earnings by the postwar decades US economic policy in WW2 shaped regional development | VoxDev[ 2 ]. This historical precedent underscores how targeted industrial investment can create durable economic value—a lesson echoed in today's CHIPS and Science Act and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Modern Policy Tailwinds: CHIPS, IRA, and Reshoring Incentives

The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 and the IRA are reshaping U.S. manufacturing through a combination of tax credits, grants, and regulatory incentives. The CHIPS Act alone has spurred over $30 billion in private-sector investments across 23 projects, projected to create 115,000 jobs and position the U.S. to produce 30% of the world's leading-edge chips by 2032 Two Years Later: Funding from CHIPS and Science Act Creating Quality Jobs, Growing Local Economies[ 3 ]. Meanwhile, the IRA has catalyzed a 305% surge in manufacturing investment since 2022, with $89 billion in new projects announced, including $133 billion in clean energy and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing How the Inflation Reduction Act sparked a clean energy boom[ 4 ]. These policies are not merely stimulative but transformative, embedding conditions such as workforce development and domestic sourcing to align industrial growth with national security and sustainability goals.

Strategic Sectors: Where to Invest in 2025

Semiconductors and Advanced Materials

The CHIPS Act's $52 billion authorization has drawn commitments from industry giants like

($100 billion) and ($200 billion), creating a domestic semiconductor ecosystem once dominated by foreign producers TRUMP EFFECT: A Running List of New U.S. Investment in President Trump’s Second Term[ 5 ]. However, challenges persist, including the monopolization of leading-edge chip fabrication by firms like TSMC and labor shortages in states like Arizona and New York After the CHIPS Act: The Limits of Reshoring and Next Steps for U.S. Semiconductor Policy[ 6 ]. Investors should focus on firms leveraging AI-driven predictive maintenance and automation to optimize production efficiency, as well as those securing IRA tax credits for green energy integration.

Automation and Industrial AI

Rising labor costs and persistent workforce gaps are accelerating adoption of automation and AI in manufacturing. Rockwell Automation's $2 billion investment in U.S. facilities highlights the sector's potential, with predictive maintenance systems reducing downtime and improving productivity 2025 U.S. Manufacturing: Policy, Automation, Investment[ 7 ]. Small and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs) are also adopting 3D printing and flexible automation to compete globally, reducing inventory costs and enabling on-demand customization What’s Coming for US Manufacturing in 2025 | NIST[ 8 ].

Clean Energy and Decarbonization

The IRA's $5.8 billion Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program is accelerating the commercialization of low-carbon technologies, particularly in steel and cement production Inflation Reduction Act Two Years Later: Historic Industry Investment[ 9 ]. With the Federal Buy Clean Initiative creating demand for domestic green materials, investors can capitalize on firms integrating renewable energy into manufacturing processes. For example, the IRA has spurred $133 billion in clean energy investments since 2022, with rural communities becoming hubs for EV battery and solar panel production The IRA and CHIPS Act are supercharging U.S. manufacturing[ 10 ].

Challenges and Considerations

While the policy tailwinds are strong, investors must navigate headwinds. Tariff-driven reshoring has led to cross-border tensions and rising production costs, particularly for import-reliant firms U.S. Manufacturing in 2025: Key Shifts, Tariffs, and Reshoring[ 1 ]. Additionally, labor shortages—exemplified by 600,000 open manufacturing jobs in December 2023—require strategic workforce development partnerships The CHIPS Act: How U.S. Microchip Factories Could Reshape the Economy[ 11 ]. Cybersecurity risks for digitized manufacturing systems also demand attention, as SMMs adopt AI and IoT technologies What’s Coming for US Manufacturing in 2025 | NIST[ 12 ].

Conclusion: A New Industrial Era

The confluence of historical precedents and modern policy innovation is redefining U.S. manufacturing. Just as WWII mobilization laid the groundwork for postwar prosperity, today's industrial policies are fostering a resilient, technology-driven industrial base. For investors, the key lies in aligning with sectors that combine policy support, technological adoption, and long-term demand—such as semiconductors, automation, and clean energy. While challenges remain, the strategic opportunities are clear: a reshored, digitized, and decarbonized manufacturing sector poised for decades of growth.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-qwen_generated_1758366353420.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-20 18:00:44.294338

Krishnamoorthi stating that are ""driving up energy bills for Illinoisans"" and asked for more support with clean energy, not less.

""It doesn't make any sense to remove electricity or the supply of electricity from the grid. That is just a dumb policy. We need as much supply as possible to drive down prices,"" said Krishnamoorthi.

He said that energy demand is rising due to overall usage going up, and also because of data centers being built.

But, he said with Trump's insistence on stopping wind and solar energy projects, supply for that energy is not able to keep up.

And, Illinois families will bear the consequences, possibly seeing their energy bills go up by an average of $180 per year.

He also said this will impact the local economy by causing 20,000 to 30,000 people who work for wind/solar projects to lose their jobs.

""Think about your neighbors who are working on these projects...I can't tell you how many good paying union jobs, for instance, are related to the construction of these projects,"" said Krishnamoorthi. ""The loss of those jobs also hurt our local economy. So, in so many ways, he's [Trump] making the affordability crisis worse right now.""

Krishnamoorthi said that by staying in the wind/solar market, it could help the U.S. stay ahead in the global market.

""If we don't do these projects, we seed leadership to the Chinese Communist Party, which is trying to eat our lunch. They are trying to own the entire market for renewables around the world,"" said Krishnamoorthi. ""Now, we actually have a fighting chance of defeating them in this competition for renewables around the world because we're starting to develop our own technology. New indigenous supply chains are growing and emerging in the U.S., but they're unfortunately getting knee capped by the Trump administration's approach, which doesn't make any sense in the world.""

Trump has changed and lessened with the which Krishnamoorthi argues doesn't make sense, since fossil fuels also rely on help from the government.

""What I can say is that there are subsidies for fossil fuels that also exist that deprive the federal government of important revenues, because those interests are very powerful. So, let's just be honest about what is the true cost of fossil fuel exploration...if fossil fuel interests or anybody else, is allowed to successfully remove these tax credits, they may profit, but it's going to be at our expense,"" said Krishnamoorthi.

But he wants to be clear his stance is overall more energy on the grid.

""You don't have to be against having a home that's powered by natural gas or driving a car that uses gasoline to also be in favor of wind and solar and other types of energy coming online. If you have more of everything, then we have lower prices,"" said Krishnamoorthi.

Beyer, a respected industry figure and independent director since September 2023, stepped down on September 18, 2025, to assume the role of Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management at the U.S. Department of the Interior. Her departure, while framed as a loss of regulatory expertise, raises questions about PTEN's future direction and market perception.

Strategic Realignment: Filling a Regulatory Vacuum?

Beyer's tenure on PTEN's board was marked by her influence on energy policy and workforce development, as highlighted by CEO Andy Hendricks in a company statementPatterson-UTI Energy Congratulates Leslie Beyer following her confirmation as Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management[ 1 ]. Her new federal role, which oversees mineral leasing and environmental compliance, positions her to shape policies directly impacting PTEN's operations in oil and gas drilling. This creates a potential regulatory “feedback loop,” where Beyer's federal decisions could indirectly affect PTEN's access to permits or operational frameworks.

However,

has not publicly outlined strategic initiatives to mitigate this vacuum. The absence of immediate announcements suggests the board may prioritize internal continuity over rapid realignment. Yet, the energy sector's regulatory uncertainty—exacerbated by shifting federal priorities—could pressure PTEN to appoint a successor with comparable policy acumen.

Collyn: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So obviously, the conversation today was Texas Tech vs Utah.","Transcript

John: Hello and welcome to The Daily Utah Chronicle podcast “The Home Stretch: Sports Edition.” My name is John Leone, sports editor of The Daily Utah Chronicle. I’m here with my assistant editor, Collyn Cowles, and we’re going to be previewing the Utah-Texas Tech matchup. This is probably the biggest home game, if not game in general, Utah’s had in 2+ seasons, and we’re excited to cover it. Collyn, what are your thoughts?

Collyn: Yeah, so Texas Tech is coming to town. They’re ranked 17th in the nation, and Utah is currently ranked 16th in the nation. We got the the honor of getting Big Noon Kickoff. So we’ll get the likes of Urban Meyer and Dave Portnoy and all those other guys being being on campus tomorrow. It’ll be big for the school. The last event that happened like that was College Game Day a few years ago. It should be just the fact this is there for their first conference game of the season. For both teams, it just should just kind of set the standpoint of what either of these two teams are going to do for the rest of the year. If you don’t know anything about those odds, that just pretty much tells you these two teams are the Big 12 powerhouses. Like last season, we didn’t see Arizona State get into that powerhouse spot until like the last few weeks of the season. So the fact that we have the top two teams facing off against each other in week four. It’s pretty cool — on a side note, what’s your approach to this game? It’s like you said, it’s one of the biggest games that the U has had in a few seasons. So what’s your approach on it?

John: This has potential to be the Big 12 Game of the Year, and it’s fortunate that we’re getting it this early, because it comes at a time where there aren’t a ton of marquee games going on this week. I mean, there’s Florida-Miami, which is a good one. There’s Illinois-Indiana, another good one. But none are quite getting the attention of this Utah-Texas Tech game. And I think one reason for that is obviously both teams are 3-0, Utah’s ranked 16th, Texas Tech 17th, and we don’t entirely know how good these teams are. They then went on to play Kent State and beat them 62-14 in a game which they were ahead 48-0 at halftime. And then last week, they played Oregon State in another home game and beat them 45-14 and they were up 28-0 at halftime. So in first times alone, Texas Tech is outscoring their opponents 123-0 in three games, which seems rather unbelievable. And while you consider the strength of schedule and see okay, well, they’ve played Pine Bluff, Kent State and Oregon State … it’s still impressive what they’ve been doing offensively. Pine Bluff and Kent State are 1-2 each, Oregon State’s 0-3. And so this will be the first time we really get to see Texas Tech’s offense operate against some sort of a defense with a pulse, if you will.

Collyn: Yeah, 100% and I think this game is going to test both quarterbacks. All the quarterbacks and seeing who can do more. Obviously, on paper, Texas Tech is known for their defensive line. They have the No. 3 D-line in the country. And for Utah, on paper, our best asset is our O-line. So we, we have the No. 2 best O-line in the country. So this for being week three, and getting the top O-line and the top D-line in the country, being able to go off and showcase affect, like, the college game itself? Like, yes, our fans are going to show up. We are going to be rowdy. We have Sorority Row right outside the stadium. It’s going to be packed. But if this was a 5:00 game instead of a noon game, I think it would be totally different. What do you think on that?

John: Absolutely, I think, I mean, like you said, Utah’s fans will always show up. They have always shown up. And I think there’s something about playing that early in the morning, your fans are never going to be quite as rowdy, quite as loud at 10 a.m. as they would be, say, at 8 p.m., or maybe not even 8 p.m. — 6 p.m. But I still think it’ll be a tough road environment for Tech. Behren Morton obviously struggles on the road. If you take a look at his splits, he does not perform under pressure. I guess his home passing grade is an 80.4, which is great. They’ve played all three games at home this year, and clearly he’s lived up to that with those stats that you mentioned. But his away passing grade takes a huge dip, drops from 80.4 down to 59.0. In an interview with NaQuari Rogers, he was asked kind of about the playbooks, and if they’ve really shown much of what they have buried deep in the books for when they need it most. And obviously he’s on the offensive side of the ball, so he probably can’t speak for the defense as much as the offense, but he said they’ve shown pretty much nothing. So they’ve been saving up all these plays and they’re going to pull out all the stops they can to beat Texas Tech.

Collyn: Yeah, 100% and what I’ve what I’ve been noticing this last week with all of these sports shows that have come out and been talking about this game, that’s all I’ve been seeing. Good college football, game day, Big Noon Kickoff, all the Barstool guys. Everyone is talking about this game. And my concern is, yes, you look on paper and it’s O-line versus D-line. But I don’t like how the media is dissing our defense. I don’t like how the media is dissing our defense. We have a guy, one of our cornerbacks, who’s [got] two interceptions, one of them being a pick six, almost having three interceptions. We have another one of our D-line. John Daly has five sacks on the year for 13 solo sacks. So yes, it’s O-line versus D-line, but I think Morton is going to get pressured a lot, because of just who they’ve played and the amount of physicality we’re going to show him right off this start. It’s not like it’s we’re just going to rely on our old line to get to lead us through, or we’re going to rely on Devon [Dampier]. I think our defense is going to come up huge in this game.

John: Yeah, I totally agree. I think when you take a look at quarterbacks, opposing quarterbacks who make their first start at Rice-Eccles Stadium — not that this is Morton’s first start, but it’ll be his first game playing at Rice-Eccles — when you take a look at those stats, you’ve got guys like Jayden Daniels and Jared Goff and some serious NFL quarterbacks that are making their name in the NFL, who came to Rice-Eccles Stadium as college quarterbacks and totally got rocked. I remember Jared Goff threw five interceptions. Jayden Daniels had … it was below 20 yards of total offensive production, passing and rushing when he played here [for] Arizona State. And Morgan Scalley knows how to dial it up against quarterbacks and make them feel uneasy. To your point, the defense have looked great so far, but it’s kind of the same deal with Texas Tech. We can’t really tell how good Utah is until they play this game. Obviously they had that road win at UCLA which looked amazing at the time, but you’ve seen how UCLA has [taken a] nosedive … they fired their coach, and they’re just spiraling. And then [the Utes] won against Cal Poly — who, FCS opponent, hard to say. And then that Wyoming game, which we’ll get into a little bit, but [there were] some highs and some lows from that game. Wyoming’s no slouch. They’re a solid team, and I think they’re going to do some good things this year, but same deal as Texas Tech: Utah has more road experience, but that’s irrelevant in this game as Texas Tech will be coming to Utah. But the defense has been great. Utah opponents are averaging just over eight points per game, keeping them in the single digits. Like you mentioned, John Henry Daley: five sacks, 13 solo tackles. He’s just wreaking havoc back there. I think Logan Fano is going to be back on his other side at the end, which will be a big addition to this defense … he was out against Cal Poly, and then played limited against Wyoming, but he should be back in full force. I think the main question for Utah is the secondary. You mentioned Jackson Bennee, he’s been great. Couple interceptions. I think the corners on the outside have struggled the most of any unit on defense thus far. Elijah Davis has primarily played as the corner one, and he hasn’t exactly shown a lot to give us confidence ahead of this air raid — not “air raid,” but pass heavy-style offense from Texas Tech.

Collyn: Yeah. They’re 100% going to be throwing the ball to Coy Eakin as much as they can. This kid’s got 11 receptions for 230 yards. So yeah, they’re going to be throwing it to him a lot. What I do like is the way our offense has been running this year, with a lot of RPO, run-heavy. In Wyoming, we saw a lot of pressure on Devon — and that would be my biggest takeaway from this, is just kind of protecting that pocket, protecting him, making sure he’s got enough time. With New Mexico, his O-line was atrocious and he’d only been sacked a handful of times. So I think he’s in good hands in this game, I think the fans are going to back this team and we’re going to come out hot. The only takeaway I saw from Wyoming was the amount of pressure on him. But Wyoming has really good defense. They’re very defensive-heavy, there’s only been one year that people remember them having a good offense, we all know that year … That’d be my biggest thing, just protecting him and making sure he’s got that pocket presence. Because if he’s getting pressured a lot and he has to scramble and he has to dish it out to Wayshawn [Parker], then we can’t afford to lose those 4 or 5 yards every time he gets pressured.

John: Yeah, I agree. I think, like you mentioned, his O-line at New Mexico was abysmal. They had a bottom five pass blocking grade as a unit, and Dampier somehow managed to only get sacked four times on the season, which, in 13 games is insane. He’s been sacked twice this year, which it doesn’t feel like he has at all. I think one of those sacks against Wyoming was … it wasn’t really a sack, it was more just Dampier running around and ended up getting tackled just behind the line of scrimmage. But Dampier is as good as anyone in the country at improvising. And his pocket presence is truly one of a kind. I think Texas Tech is coming into this game thinking “Oh yeah, we’ll be able to get to him, bring him down …” Getting to Dampier is one thing; bringing him down is another. And that dude is shifty. He’s been compared to Kyler Murray and some of those other guys that have really high end, short, short field quickness, where they can just make cuts and adjustments on the fly. Look for that. Dampier is … like you mentioned, his passing game has taken a big step forward. And we’ll keep harping on it: no competition — not no competition, but sparse competition thus far. His 73% completion percentage, seven touchdowns, zero picks, is already such an improvement. Last year at New Mexico, he was barely above 50% completion percentage, and he threw 12 picks and 12 interceptions. So that ratio wasn’t good … I mean, Morton already has 11 touchdowns in one pick, in three games. Dampier had 12 and 12 all last year. But this year, he’s got seven and zero. So you can see that he’s made it a priority to take care of the ball. And one guy that’s helped him with this is Ryan Davis, his former teammate. Davis is a receiver, obviously transferred in with [offensive coordinator Jason] Beck and Dampier from New Mexico. He had 10 receptions versus Wyoming last week, and really has kind of solidified himself as the go-to guy for Dampier in the past game. Jason Beck has spread the wealth across the offense very heavily throughout the first three games. I mean, he’s throwing tight ends out there at Wildcat. Former quarterbacks at Wildcat … you know, you got Nate Johnson, Hunter Andrews, NaQuari Rogers, Wayshawn Parker, all these guys catching snaps, and that doesn’t even include the main guy, Dampier. So, I mean, Jason Beck is getting creative at OC.

Collyn: Yeah. This game is — it’s, to your comment earlier, we’re going to pull all the tricks out of the book this week. Those three games, I’d say you saw a lot of our offense against UCLA, a lot of big plays. But, the Cal Poly, Wyoming games, those were more focusing on getting first downs and getting to our designated spots, kind of perfecting those 5-10 yard plays. But if you look at Texas Tech’s side, I would recommend you take our first three games and their first three games. I mean, we have UCLA, Cal Poly and Wyoming … and compared to Pine Bluff, Oregon State and Kent — I mean, they shouldn’t even have gotten scored on in any three of those games.

John: And they haven’t even played on the road yet.

Collyn: Yeah, yeah, yeah. We’re almost a month into the season. In 10 days, it’ll be their month mark. So yeah, this is going to be a tough matchup for them. I wanted to bring up the amount of money that Texas Tech has spent. They have spent over $25 million on this roster. And a culprit to that was giving a lot of their money to their star transfer from USC, Quinten Joyner, and before the season even started, he had jacked up his knee and he’s out for the year. So, what’s your take on the college football aspect and being able to see a team like Texas Tech spend the most amount of money this year on their roster, but not even be able to get their full resource out of that, with Quinten Joyner being out all year?

John: Yeah. I mean, obviously never, never want to wish an injury on anyone, that sucks for Joyner. He came in, obviously out of USC, [and] was a terrific running back. People were surprised he went to Tech, but, you know, he undoubtedly got a bag to do it. So yeah, he’s out for the year, but another place that Texas Tech spent a ton of their money on is their defensive line, and it looks like that’s paying off for them so far. But to your question about the contracts and teams being able to spend: I’ve seen numbers in the [NIL] ballpark of $25 million to even $55 million, which is just a crazy number to be thrown out there for college football. But you know, Texas Tech’s taking advantage of it, and credit to them for going after it. I know they have a former player … I don’t know his name off the top of my head, but he’s sold two oil companies, and his main goal is to make Texas Tech good again. So obviously, with the new rules into place, they won’t be able to spend this much in the future. But for now, it’s entertaining. We can say that.

Collyn: Yeah, the gentleman you’re talking of is Cody Campbell, yes. So yeah, he’s like some oil guru, and he donated over $55 million to Texas Tech’s NIL fund [sic — see editor’s note] So, yeah, and that’s not just to football. I think fans see that and they think, “Oh, that’s just for football.” No, that’s for the entirety of their athletics program. That’s scholarships across all sports: women’s, soccer, volleyball, hockey, whatever it may be, basketball. And then, you know, majority of it goes to football, majority of it goes to those training facilities and and travel expenses and all the fun stuff that fans really don’t see, right? But I mean, even to Utah’s side, we’ve spent roughly around $15 million, if anyone were wondering. And I don’t know, I like the way our team is looking, without having that headline of where we have a guy giving us $50 million … you know? I would rather the grit, instead of having money talk.

John: Totally. Built, not bought, as they like to say. Yeah, big game here. Collyn, what’s your prediction?

Collyn: Um, honestly, I think we’ll know the way this game is going to go by halftime. I don’t think I’ve seen a lot of pundits talk about this game going to the wire, this game going to the last few seconds. I don’t think it’s going to happen. I think it’s going to be an easy win for Utah. Few touchdowns. It’s going to be a little low-scoring. I have them winning 24-10. I think we’re gonna hold Texas Tech, force the run, show up on the D-line, protect Devon, and we have to convert on field goals. We did not talk about that today, but we have to convert our field goals. If we get an attempt from 30 yards out, we have to convert on these. Every point counts, and I think we’ll know who’s going to win by halftime.

John: I like that. I more or less agree. I think Utah has historically been a second half team. But the way I see it, there are three keys to victory for Utah. I think number one is, believe it or not, establishing a run game. This Texas Tech defensive line has been stout against the run so far, and I think Utah is averaging over 200 rushing yards per game. It’s something crazy. I have the number here: they are averaging 260 rush yards per game, which is crazy, more than Texas Tech, and I’m sure it’s up there in the country, in terms of the highest. Establish the run game; that’ll help you be able to control key number two, which is managing the clock. I think Utah loves to go on those long, extended drives, give their defense a break. They’ve had two drives of 20 plays and 19 plays, just in three games alone. So if they can get some drives like that, go in and just kind of demoralize Texas Tech’s defense, I think that’ll be huge. And manage the clock, keep their offense off the field. And then key number three I had was defense. Defend the pass with pressure and coverage. You’re going to have to have an element of both of those in this game. I think pressure is something that, like I said, Scalley is going to be dialing up, and he’s going to do everything in his power to make Morton uncomfortable. And with Morton kind of putting the ball up for grabs more or less when he’s under pressure, if Utah can come down with a couple interceptions or force a fumble, that’ll be huge, because I think the offenses will look good in this game, if I had to guess. Overall, I think Utah’s able to do these things. It may not look pretty at times, but my prediction is Utah-35, Texas Tech-20. As always, go Utes, and it’s gonna be a fun one. So get there early, get loud. It’s gonna be intense.

Collyn: Yeah, 100%. And to close out this episode, we’ll just kind of give a basic rundown for fans of what to expect for this week, for events happening on campus that students can attend. So obviously, the conversation today was Texas Tech vs Utah. Kickoff is at 10 a.m. on Saturday, tomorrow. Fans can show up for the Big Noon Kickoff at 4 a.m., so the students can start showing up to the public queue area at 4 a.m., fans can enter the set area at 5:30 a.m. There’s going to be food, music prizes and all kinds of different contests that fans can enter themselves into, which also starts at 5:30 a.m. The Barstool show starts at 7 a.m. The annual Ute walk is 7:45 a.m. and then the Big Noon Kickoff show starts at 8 a.m. So if you’re looking to show up, it is recommended to be there early. They’re giving out — first 500 people to get there get shirts, free food, gift cards … all kinds of different stuff they’re giving out to fans. So show up to that early. Be there. Be loud. On another note, for athletics this week, women’s soccer will be traveling down to Texas to face TCU, Texas Christian University, tonight at 6 p.m. TCU is ranked 14th in the nation with a 6-1-0 record. They look very hot. They are very strong. And I think this game is going to determine our women’s soccer program and just kind of put our season in line. It’s the first Big 12 game for the season for the ladies, and the team is led by Kelly Bullock. She has three goals on the year, and she’s just been lights out. So show up! Watch your Utes. Let’s go to these games. The ladies will be back home for the second game of the Big 12 conference against Cincinnati on Sept. 24. And then another sport in fall athletics is women’s volleyball. This week, we are in California and San Luis Obispo. We have a set against Cal Poly today and then one against Vincent St. Mary’s tomorrow. So for athletics this week, just make sure we’re staying aware of our fellow students and showing up for our athletes, and 100% be there for Texas Tech. Show up. Show why the MUSS is the MUSS, and go Utes!

John: Yes, sir, go Utes. This has been our second episode of The Home Stretch this year. Collyn, thank you for coming on. We’re excited to bring you guys more previews, more recaps of football, soccer, volleyball, whatever sports are going on. So, again this is The Home Stretch, presented by The Daily Utah Chronicle. I’m John Leone with my assistant sports editor Collyn Cowles, and we’ll see you next time.

It can now draw down $100 million from Generate Capital, a leading infrastructure investment firm.
“We’re not just growing our current projects, we’re building new ones wherever wasted renewable energy can be converted into valuable high performance computing.
About Soluna Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: SLNH) Soluna is on a mission to make renewable energy a global superpower, using computing as a catalyst.

It can now draw down $100 million from Generate Capital, a leading infrastructure investment firm.

John Belizaire, CEO of Soluna, said an initial $12.6 million draw will fund refinancing and construction of active data center projects, with additional capital support for Soluna’s one gigawatt and expanding pipeline.

“We believe this deal with Generate primes Soluna for scale,” Belizaire said. “We’re not just growing our current projects, we’re building new ones wherever wasted renewable energy can be converted into valuable high performance computing.

Belizaire said the deal with Generate reflects a different kind of infrastructure financing, one focused on capital efficiency, modular growth, and disciplined execution.

“We’ve known the Generate team for quite some time before partnering; they understand our business, our team, and our industry well, making them so much more than just investors. We see them as strategic partners going forward,” Belizaire said.

Generate was represented by Vinson & Elkins LLP. Norton Rose Fulbright LLP, O’Melveny & Myers LLP, and Lowenstein Sandler LLP represented Soluna.

Project Kati is Soluna’s largest renewable computing site yet. “One hundred and sixty six MW of clean, high-performance computing is on its way to Willacy County,” the company said. “It will deliver 83 MW of clean Bitcoin hosting capacity by early 2026, with Galaxy as the first customer. It will expand to 166 MW in two phases, supporting both Bitcoin hosting and AI/HPC workloads. And it will bring jobs, investment, and long-term economic benefits to Willacy County.”

Soluna is a digital infrastructure company that builds modular data centers that transform curtailed or underutilized renewable energy into compute power for energy-intensive, batchable applications such as Bitcoin mining and AI. By colocating with clean energy producers, Soluna supports a cleaner grid while delivering cost-effective, sustainable infrastructure to enterprises.

Generate has invested over $2.4 billion across sustainable infrastructure credit since inception, making the partnership with Soluna a natural fit. Generate’s institutional experience and capabilities as an asset owner and operator enable it to deliver differentiated value, enabling the partnership to go beyond dollars invested to strategic collaboration.

""Soluna's vision for turning underutilized renewable energy into scalable computing power aligns with our belief in infrastructure that solves real-world challenges,"" said Ryan Miller, principal at Generate Capital. ""We're excited to support their growth through a flexible credit solution and continue our leadership at the nexus of digital and energy infrastructure.”

Belizaire said the new financing package from Generate follows over $30 million in funding raised earlier in 2025 from Galaxy Digital, Spring Lane Capital, and a recent public offering. He said the new agreement adds further momentum to Soluna’s execution roadmap, as the recent addition of 150 MW Projects Gladys and 100 MW Fei pushes the company past one gigawatt of renewable computing capacity.

Belizaire said this milestone builds on the recent 48 MW expansion underway at Project Dorothy 2 and the start of construction of Project Kati 1. He said Soluna intends to expand its computing offerings beyond Bitcoin mining to include AI workloads, reflecting the growing demand for green computing across various industries.

""Soluna's vision for turning underutilized renewable energy into scalable computing power aligns with our belief in infrastructure that solves real-world challenges,"" said Ryan Miller, principal at Generate Capital. ""We're excited to support their growth through a flexible credit solution and continue our leadership at the nexus of digital and energy infrastructure.”

Belizaire said recent expansions of partnerships with Blockware, Compass Mining, Galaxy Digital, and other Hyperscale miners further underscore the company’s growing traction and operational maturity.

Among the highlights of the scalable financing, he said, are:

A credit facility of up to $100 million to be used for refinancing and construction of Soluna’s data center projects.

An initial $12.6 million draw will be used to refinance Dorothy 1A and Dorothy 2. This unlocks equity capital for Soluna and Spring Lane.

A delayed draw facility of $22.9 million will include continued funding for the Dorothy 2 project and support for the Project Kati 1 data center.

An additional uncommitted $64.5 million accordion facility would support Soluna’s growing renewable-powered pipeline and fund AI-related long-lead equipment procurement.

Credit facilities and security are limited to a portfolio of projects financed by Soluna and Spring Lane Capital, are limited recourse, and do not have parent company guarantees.

Generate received warrants for the right to purchase 4 million shares of Soluna common stock anda board observer right.

“The climate crisis, economic fights and immigrant fights are all really one big fight,” she said.
Since then, she has gotten more involved in movements for migrant rights, Palestinian liberation and fighting climate change.","NEW YORK (AP) — Thousands of activists marched down Park Avenue and turned down Billionaires’ Row toward Trump Tower in New York Saturday to “Make Billionaires Pay,” calling for climate justice, democracy, free speech, gender equality, a stop to the Trump’s immigration crackdown and a ceasefire in Gaza.

Their signs and reasons for taking to the streets were diverse, but many said the march highlighted a common theme behind the issues they stood for: that a small, elite class of the wealthy and powerful consistently prioritized profits over people’s lives.

“I don’t see them as movements. I don’t see them as organizations. I just see humanity. We are all on this Earth. This is our mother,” said Mahaishuwea, whose name means Eagle Woman in the language of the Hidatsa tribe, which is based in North Dakota.

As marchers gathered, she spoke about her personal experiences growing up on the Fort Berthold Indian reservation, where she survived cancer. Standing in front of investment management company Blackstone’s headquarters, she connected the violent history of colonization and resource extraction on Indigenous lands to the present-day greed of the powerful. “They have a sickness,” she said.

Demonstrations have been planned around the world this week ahead of the United Nations General Assembly and New York Climate Week. Despite years of international conferences, negotiations and treaties, countries have continued to increase their emissions of carbon dioxide and other planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, fueling more frequent and intense extreme weather events. 2024 was the hottest year on record, and the Trump administration has been working to roll back foundational environmental rules. This has freed the way for oil and coal industries to pollute more while presenting more roadblocks to wind and solar energy development.

Tamika Middleton, managing director of the Women’s March, said that although it sometimes can be challenging to bring together people who are passionate about different causes, this year the intersections between them felt clearer. “The climate crisis, economic fights and immigrant fights are all really one big fight,” she said.

The crowd stretched for over four city blocks and passed by luxury stores like Louis Vuitton, Bergdorf Goodman and Tiffany & Co. Some carried enormous papier-mache puppets of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. Several grabbed the edges of a 160-foot “climate polluters bill” calling out the economic damages wrought by extreme weather events made worse by the carbon emissions of major polluting companies.

Others dressed as the Statue of Liberty, rang cowbells and waved flags with the Star Wars character Princess Leia or homemade signs inked in sharpie and paint. One simply read: “Free Kimmel.”

Tatiana Cruz was one of the people holding up the puppet of Elon Musk. “Eat the rich, that’s the main message,” she said, smiling. But she also explained that this was her first year actively protesting more after two of her friends were deported after being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Since then, she has gotten more involved in movements for migrant rights, Palestinian liberation and fighting climate change.

“The monster up top is similar in a lot of different scenarios,” she said.

Julia Donahue-Wait had come out from the South Bronx with a group of families who had started organizing together and also described the many causes present at the march as interconnected. Her young daughter Eurydice has grown up on picket lines and helped with the poster painting. Behind her, another protester held a sign: “Our work is love,” it read.

“It’s all people without power taking it back,” Donahue-Wait said. “What we say to the kids is, we have safety and we need to stand up for people who don’t have safety.”

Mahaishuwea said although many people are scared, she thought it was important to show up.

Her 12-year-old daughter is back at home. But she wants to teach future generations how to speak up, and “to show people we’re not afraid,” she said.

At the end of the march, protesters held a five-minute moment of silence during which they sat in front of the Trump International Hotel and Tower.

From the Gulf Coast to the Pacific Northwest, ports are being reimagined as hubs for offshore wind, hydrogen production, and electrified logistics. This transformation is not merely environmental—it is economic.

The Port of Long Beach's microgrid deployment project exemplifies the potential of port electrification. By integrating resilient energy infrastructure, the port has reduced fossil fuel dependence while enhancing air quality for surrounding communitiesMicrogrids Help Electrify Ports, Increase Reliability[ 1 ]. Similarly, the Georgia Ports Authority's adoption of electrified ERTG cranes has set a benchmark for efficiency, demonstrating how ports can adapt to new operational demands without sacrificing throughputMicrogrids Help Electrify Ports, Increase Reliability[ 1 ]. These projects align with Arup's assertion that ports are becoming “key enablers of the energy transition,” supporting offshore wind deployment and sustainable fuel tradeWhy ports have a future as green energy hubs - Arup[ 2 ].

On the Gulf Coast, ExxonMobil's $21 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal and carbon capture network underscore the region's dual focus on traditional and emerging energy systemsClean energy uncertainty rattles Texas project pipeline[ 3 ]. Meanwhile, the Port of Houston's $105 million investment in electric cargo-handling equipment and shore power infrastructure—funded by the EPA's Clean Ports Program—highlights the federal government's role in accelerating decarbonizationClean energy uncertainty rattles Texas project pipeline[ 3 ]. Such initiatives are not isolated; they reflect a broader trend of ports leveraging public-private partnerships to reposition underused assets.

Financial Returns and Yield Projections

The economic case for port redevelopment is compelling. A 2025 study by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) notes that the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) has boosted annual port funding to $450 million, enabling upgrades that accommodate larger vessels and enhance multimodal connectivityUS Port Infrastructure[ 5 ]. These investments directly correlate with improved operational efficiency: the NBER found that expanding port capacity by one ship increases trade by 42% and reduces congestion by 4% at the host portMicrogrids Help Electrify Ports, Increase Reliability[ 1 ].

Renewable energy integration further amplifies returns. Research from the National Renewable Energy

(NREL) reveals that hybrid renewable systems—combining solar, marine energy, and storage—can cover 60% of a port's energy demand with payback periods under six yearsReturns to Port Infrastructure Investments | NBER[ 4 ]. For instance, the Port of Anacortes' $65 million EPA grant for microgrid development, supported by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), illustrates how electrification can unlock new revenue streams through grid services and energy salesMicrogrids Help Electrify Ports, Increase Reliability[ 1 ].

Challenges and Opportunities

Despite this optimism, challenges persist. Texas' renewable energy pipeline faced setbacks in 2025, with 9 gigawatts of projects canceled due to tariffs on solar panels and policy uncertaintyClean energy uncertainty rattles Texas project pipeline[ 3 ]. However, grid reliability has paradoxically improved, with ERCOT reporting reduced summer emergency risks thanks to solar and battery storage deploymentsClean energy uncertainty rattles Texas project pipeline[ 3 ]. This duality—volatility in project pipelines versus tangible grid benefits—highlights the need for diversified strategies.

Louisiana and other Gulf Coast states offer a counterpoint. By redeveloping underutilized ports for non-freight activities—such as commercial fishing, recreation, and mixed-use development—ports like Seattle have generated $1.4 billion in economic outputReturns to Port Infrastructure Investments | NBER[ 4 ]. The Gulf Coast's $25 billion energy transition investments in 2025, including clean hydrogen and carbon capture, position the region to replicate this successWhy ports have a future as green energy hubs - Arup[ 2 ].

Long-Term Outlook and Investment Strategy

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects renewables will surpass natural gas as the primary electricity source by the mid-2030s, growing from 3.41 quadrillion BTUs (Quads) in 2024 to 14.8 Quads by 2050Returns to Port Infrastructure Investments | NBER[ 4 ]. For ports, this means infrastructure tailored to renewable energy—such as offshore wind staging areas and hydrogen export terminals—will become critical. The LSU Center for Energy Studies' 2025 Gulf Coast Energy Outlook reinforces this, noting the region's leadership in lower-emission energy productionWhy ports have a future as green energy hubs - Arup[ 2 ].

Investors should prioritize ports with:

1. Strategic Location: Proximity to offshore wind farms or hydrogen production clusters.

2. Policy Support: Access to federal grants (e.g., EPA's Clean Ports Program) and state incentives.

3. Diversified Revenue Streams: Non-freight activities that buffer against trade volatility.

Conclusion

The redevelopment of underutilized port assets is no longer a niche opportunity—it is a cornerstone of the U.S. energy transition. With Gulf Coast ports leading the charge, investors who act now can secure long-term yields through electrification, renewable integration, and infrastructure modernization.

But instead of expanding or reopening our reliable energy capacity or updating failing long-term plans, the 2019 New Jersey Energy Master Plan, or EMP, is stagnant.
And it will not just be the billion-dollar companies that are affected by New Jersey’s energy policy uncertainty.
Clean energy goals matter, but so do the people and employers trying to stay in New Jersey.
Right now, New Jersey’s Energy Master Plan is an obstacle to both.","New Jersey's Energy Master Plan aims for 100% clean electricity by 2035; however, the commendable goals within this plan may have the unintended consequence of making New Jersey even more unaffordable for the next generation. The impact doesn’t stop at higher utility bills. Facing rising energy costs, unreliable capacity and policy inconsistencies, New Jersey businesses are pulling back — reducing head count and slowing growth resulting in fewer local jobs for the next generation.

At the start of June 2025, New Jersey households experienced an increase in electricity rates of 17–20%, resulting in average monthly bills of approximately $183, which is about 30% above the national average. For an average resident, that’s another $20 to $28 every month, without any corresponding increase in income.

Ask yourself: Do you know anyone whose salary rose 20% this year?

We’re being told to electrify everything — our cars, our homes — but at the same time, we’re facing record-high costs and a grid clearly under strain. And with salaries not keeping pace, those expectations are especially unrealistic for those of us who are just starting out.

For young people trying to live and work in New Jersey, these energy mandates are structural barriers to building a life here in our home state. With student loans, rising rents and wages that don’t keep up, unpredictable energy bills are one more reason my generation often looks to other states for employment.

New Jersey imports around 35% of its electricity, thanks to delayed clean energy projects, such as offshore wind, and the closure of reliable energy plants. Meanwhile, PJM, New Jersey’s regional grid operator, forecasts an additional 39% increase in electricity demand by 2039, driven by the adoption of electric vehicles, home electrification, and the expansion of data infrastructure. My generation is expected to lead this electrification effort, without the infrastructure to support the shift.

The new energy demand levels will require a stable foundation of supply. But instead of expanding or reopening our reliable energy capacity or updating failing long-term plans, the 2019 New Jersey Energy Master Plan, or EMP, is stagnant. The EMP was due for a significant update in 2024, but it has been delayed without a final release date. Meanwhile, rules on emissions, EV sales, building electrification, and energy sources are advancing without formal modeling of their cost. This leaves many of us unsure whether the choices we’re pushed to make today will be even supported or relevant tomorrow.

In June, Amazon announced a $20 billion investment in two data center campuses in Pennsylvania, not New Jersey, despite both being in the same grid region. One site is co-located with a nuclear power plant, offering direct access to steady, affordable baseload power. Pennsylvania paired that with corporate tax reductions and a more transparent energy policy. The result? Thousands of jobs and billions in investment, just across the river. For young professionals, many are seeking to build careers in fast-growing industries such as AI or cloud services, making these lost opportunities increasingly difficult to ignore. As a result, Gen-Z workers will need to look outside of New Jersey to find them.

And it will not just be the billion-dollar companies that are affected by New Jersey’s energy policy uncertainty. Higher utility costs leave less room for hiring, investment, or wage growth for small businesses as well. A local salon, grocery store or restaurant can’t absorb a 20% jump in power costs without raising prices or cutting staff.

Clean energy goals matter, but so do the people and employers trying to stay in New Jersey. The state should pause the implementation of new mandates until the EMP is released and backed by transparent cost models. We need more certainty, not more pressure, especially for those just starting out.

For many of my generation, the decision to stay or leave will hinge on New Jersey’s job market and affordability. Right now, New Jersey’s Energy Master Plan is an obstacle to both.

“I very much want to engage in negotiations on an all-of-the-above permitting reform.
“If we work together on bipartisan permitting reform with the understanding that it includes clean energy, we pass it through Congress, and then the administration does it all except for the clean energy part, then we will look like a bunch of suckers,” Magaziner added.
As discussions continue, the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group of centrist Republicans and Democrats, also unveiled a possible framework for permitting reform.
HOUSE GOP INVOKES RENEWABLE ENERGY TO WIN DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT FOR PERMITTING REFORM Their recommendations align closely with permitting reform legislation already introduced in the House by streamlining NEPA reviews, restricting judicial review, and prioritizing digitization.","Several Democrats have expressed interest in supporting these proposed reforms, as both sides of the aisle agree that environmental rules have made it too difficult to build in the United States. While Democrats generally do not share Republicans’ ambition of unlocking new fossil fuel production, they do wish to accelerate the permitting process for clean energy and traditional infrastructure projects in their districts. Some have even co-sponsored legislation introduced by their Republican colleagues.

Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) signed on to the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act introduced by House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-AR) at the end of July.

This bill would overhaul and simplify the NEPA, which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental effects of major actions and decisions relevant to their departments. It would also limit legal challenges to projects under the existing law.

In an apparent effort to bring more Democrats on board, the bill includes language that is agnostic toward energy sources and infrastructure projects — meaning accelerated reviews would apply to wind, solar, and fossil fuels.

Not all lawmakers, however, are convinced that language is enough to ensure renewables will see the benefits.

Rep. Seth Magaziner (D-RI), who has said he wants to reach a “yes” on bipartisan legislation, told the Washington Examiner that he is doubtful the White House would enforce accelerated permitting for renewables, given Trump’s recent crackdown on offshore wind.

“I very much want to engage in negotiations on an all-of-the-above permitting reform. But if the administration is just going to block clean energy projects that have their approvals from going forward, then how could we on our side assume that they are going to be negotiating in good faith?” Magaziner said, referring to the stop-work order issued for the Revolution Wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island that is roughly 80% complete.

“If we work together on bipartisan permitting reform with the understanding that it includes clean energy, we pass it through Congress, and then the administration does it all except for the clean energy part, then we will look like a bunch of suckers,” Magaziner added. “And we’re not, we’re not going to go for that. So we’re going to need to see some action from the administration that shows that we’re actually committed to an all-of-the-above energy strategy.”

Rep. Scott Peters (D-CA), who has also co-sponsored legislation focused on modernizing the permitting process, agreed, telling the Washington Examiner that he did not believe they could achieve Democratic consensus without assurance from the White House.

Peters pointed to changes made by the Trump administration that have made it more difficult to permit and approve a renewable energy project, such as requiring Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to personally sign off on proposals located on federal lands.

He described these obstacles as “anti-business” and said that ideologically driven policy will hurt the U.S.’s ability to secure enough power needed to beat China in the race for artificial intelligence.

While Republicans may have to cede to Democrats’ demands for accelerated permits for renewables, Peters said Democrats will have to do the same for natural gas to secure enough demand and lower energy prices for consumers.

Members on the right side of the aisle appear more optimistic about coming to a bipartisan agreement in the coming weeks and months.

“A lot of Democrats can come to the table, particularly when they understand that at the end of the day, we all actually want the same things,” Rep. Nick Begich (R-AK) told the Washington Examiner. “The regulations that have stymied traditional energy production in the United States are the same regulations that are stymying renewable energy production in the United States.”

Rep. Bob Latta (R-OH), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s subcommittee on energy, said a final permitting bill will not necessarily be Republican or Democratic, given the widespread desire to build things faster.

He pointed to the Energy and Commerce Committee’s track record for advancing bipartisan bills, noting that the panel has put out more than any other in the House.

Latta told the Washington Examiner he is working on different pieces of legislation with Democrats right now, looking for bipartisan amendments to ensure they have the votes to advance a bill to the floor.

As discussions continue, the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group of centrist Republicans and Democrats, also unveiled a possible framework for permitting reform.

HOUSE GOP INVOKES RENEWABLE ENERGY TO WIN DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT FOR PERMITTING REFORM

Their recommendations align closely with permitting reform legislation already introduced in the House by streamlining NEPA reviews, restricting judicial review, and prioritizing digitization. It also aims to bolster the buildout of grid infrastructure to support new generation.

“Right now it takes years, even decades, for new green energy and other projects to get connected to the grid and start generating energy to meet demand,” Caucus co-Chairman Tom Suozzi (D-NY) said. “We need commonsense, bipartisan solutions to cut red tape, bring projects online faster, and make energy more affordable for American families.

Gavin Newsom signed a sweeping package of bills on Friday charting the state's continuing transition to green energy, which includes an extension of the state's landmark cap-and-trade program.

The slate of six bills seeks to address energy affordability, the stabilization of petroleum markets, and reducing air pollution as part of California's acceleration toward a green job-generating economy. A statement from the Governor's Office said California's action comes as the Trump administration continues ""to gut decades-old, bipartisan American clean air protections and derail critical climate progress.""

The bills, which Newsom signed at the Morrison Planetarium at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco on Friday, were approved with bipartisan support in an extended session of the California legislature last weekend. They represent a balancing act in managing the transition from fossil fuels to green energy amid the challenge of climate change, while keeping energy costs manageable for consumers.

""After months of hard work with the Legislature, we have agreed to historic reforms that will save money on your electric bills, stabilize gas supply, and slash toxic air pollution — all while fast-tracking California's transition to a clean, green job-creating economy,"" Newsom said in a prepared statement.

Newsom said legislation will bring down electricity costs for Californians by providing up to $60 billion in electricity bill refunds through an expanded California Climate Credit. The legislation also aims to make energy more affordable by accelerating critical clean energy projects and expanding regional energy markets to improve grid reliability.

California has positioned itself as leading the nation on the transition to green energy, but has also faced headwinds from the petroleum industry, the federal government, and the costs associated with the transition. After the state enacted a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, the Trump administration blocked it, prompting a lawsuit by the state. High gas prices and the move by petroleum companies to close refineries in the state have threatened to send prices even higher.

One bill eases regulations on oil production in Kern County in a change the Governor's Office calls ""targeted, locally-led, environmentally responsible"" to boost the state's fuel supply while protecting the ongoing transition away from fossil fuels. The signing of SB 237 brought rare praise from the Western States Petroleum Association, which historically has strongly opposed the state's aggressive climate policies.

""Governor Newsom's leadership on SB 237 was foundational for the renewed partnership with the oil and gas industry,"" the WSPA said in a prepared statement. ""We look forward to continuing our relationship focused on realistic policies that balance environmental and economic goals to ensure California and the Western States have access to the affordable fuels they need.""

Another bill extends the state's cap-and-trade program to 2045. The program puts a cap on emissions from large polluters that gets lowered over time. Companies can then sell credits for polluting less to other companies, allowing them to reduce emissions while providing flexibility in how the limits are met.

The program is now known as ""cap-and-invest"" to highlight that the money raised is reinvested back into the state to fund projects on climate, housing, and transportation, including the state's high-speed rail project. The state's high-speed rail authority will receive $1 billion annually from the cap-and-invest program in a deal finalized just before the legislature's scheduled adjournment last week.

""Public transportation delivers for the environment and economy by providing Californians with travel options that reduce emissions, relieve congestion, cut household expenses, and sustain middle class jobs,"" said California Transit Association executive director Michael Pimentel in a prepared statement. ""By reauthorizing the Cap-and-Invest program and preserving the state's climate investments in building and operating our public transit systems, these bills will ensure that communities across the state experience the benefits of California's nation leading environmental policies.""

The package also updates California's Wildfire Fund, the $21 billion insurance pool that helps utilities cover wildfire liabilities and avoid bankruptcy. It adds another $18 billion — financed jointly by utility shareholders and ratepayers — while requiring utilities to put in billions more of shareholder money to harden and modernize their equipment.

Some analysts and environmental groups say that Newsom and the state legislature have not yet found the right balance between the state's climate goals and the continued reliance on fossil fuels.

Asha Sharma, state policy manager with the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability, told KQED that the legislation doesn't address pollution for Californians who live near refineries.

""We have a real responsibility to ensure that the fourth largest economy in the world, a progressive leader on climate, is really committed to not only climate policies, but ensuring that they're deployed equitably,"" Sharma told KQED.

Advocacy group Consumer Watchdog went further, calling the claims made by the Governor's Office ""a sham.""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/19/a18ebee9-9deb-451c-b71b-513949fb8588/thumbnail/1200x630/d9d876b50d0db18f8e7da8398ff791e1/screenshot-2025-09-19-142210.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 15:01:14.404285

In this evolving landscape, strategic partnerships and robust risk mitigation frameworks are becoming critical for scaling renewable energy projects. A recent collaboration between Jera Americas, Tenaska, and Tyr Energy exemplifies how such alliances can optimize portfolios, enhance grid reliability, and navigate the complexities of transitioning from fossil fuels to cleaner energy.

Strategic Realignment: From Fossil Assets to Renewable Opportunities

On September 15, 2025, Jera Americas completed the transfer of its equity interests in three gas-fired power plants—Tenaska Virginia Generating Station (940 MW), Tenaska Kiamichi Generating Station (1,220 MW), and Tenaska Gateway Generating Station (845 MW)—to Tenaska and Tyr Energy. This $3,005 MW capacity transfer aligns with Jera Americas' broader strategy to divest from carbon-intensive assets and reinvest in renewable energy opportunitiesJERA Americas, Tenaska, and Tyr Jointly Announce Share Transfer in U.S. Power Generation Projects[ 1 ]. For Tenaska and Tyr, the acquisition expands their operational footprint in key U.S. power markets (PJM, SPP, ERCOT), where grid reliability remains a pressing concernJERA Americas completes exit from three U.S. power plants as Tenaska and Tyr expand their ownership stakes[ 2 ].

This transaction reflects a broader trend: foreign energy firms are increasingly reallocating capital from aging thermal assets to zero-emission technologies. Jera Americas, for instance, has already begun scaling its renewable portfolio through JERA Nex, its dedicated clean energy subsidiary. In 2024, JERA Nex acquired the 300 MW Oxbow Solar Farm in Louisiana and the 95 MW Happy Solar Farm in Arkansas, both of which supply renewable energy to corporate clients and municipal utilitiesProjects - JERA Nex[ 3 ]. These projects underscore Jera's commitment to diversifying its energy mix while leveraging partnerships to mitigate risks associated with regulatory shifts and market volatility.

Risk Mitigation Through Collaborative Structures

Renewable energy projects inherently face political, economic, and technical risks. However, the Jera-Tenaska-Tyr partnership demonstrates how joint ventures and shared ownership models can mitigate these challenges. By transferring high-quality gas-fired assets to Tenaska and Tyr, Jera Americas reduces its exposure to regulatory penalties tied to carbon emissions while securing stable returns from its renewable investmentsRisk management in renewable energy projects[ 4 ]. Meanwhile, Tenaska and Tyr gain access to dispatchable thermal capacity, which complements their growing renewable portfolios and ensures grid stability during periods of low solar/wind outputJERA Americas, Tenaska, and Tyr Complete Joint Share Transfer[ 5 ].

General risk management principles further reinforce this model. For example, political risks—such as policy reversals or permitting delays—are mitigated through diversified ownership structures and long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). Economic risks, including fluctuating energy prices, are addressed via joint ventures that spread capital costs and revenue streams across partners. Technical risks, such as equipment failures, are managed through performance guarantees and warranties, as seen in JERA Nex's solar projectsJERA Americas, Tenaska, and Tyr Jointly Announce Share Transfer[ 6 ].

The Path Forward: Hydrogen, Offshore Wind, and Grid Resilience

Looking ahead, Jera Americas has signaled its intent to pivot toward hydrogen and offshore wind, sectors poised for exponential growth. The company's experience in LNG infrastructure and international energy markets positions it to lead in green hydrogen production and export, particularly in North America's Gulf Coast regionJERA Americas, Tenaska, and Tyr Jointly Announce Share Transfer in U.S. Power Generation Projects[ 7 ]. Similarly, Tenaska and Tyr's expanded thermal assets could serve as backup power for intermittent renewables, ensuring a balanced grid as the U.S. transitions to a low-carbon future.

However, success will depend on continued collaboration. For instance, joint ventures between Jera Nex and Tenaska could accelerate offshore wind development in the Gulf of Mexico, while Tyr's expertise in asset management could streamline solar-battery storage integration. Such partnerships not only reduce individual firm risks but also create economies of scale, driving down costs for investors and consumers alike.

Conclusion: A Blueprint for Sustainable Investment

Trump administration’s energy policies are jeopardizing the creation of new jobs in the wind, solar, and other alternative energy sectors, a report by a transition outlet has warned.

According to E2, jobs in energy transition industries grew much faster than jobs in the conventional energy sectors in the past few years, but now the trend is reversing, with the outlet saying that “recent policy actions by Congress and the Trump administration have already resulted in major job losses in the industry, with more expected to come.”

The report said that last year, new jobs in the transition space came close to 100,000, bringing the total to 3.56 million. However, this was already a slowdown from 2023 despite pro-transition policies pursued by the Biden administration.

E2 blamed the slowdown on “policy uncertainty and an overall slowing of job and economic growth.” Even so, the group said that more than 80% of all new energy jobs last year in the United States were in alternative energy sectors.

“What these numbers show is that this was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024,” Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director, said.

“Now, clean energy job growth is at serious risk – and with it, our overall economy.”

Since President Trump took office, almost $19 billion worth of wind and solar power generation projects have been canceled, according to U.S. consultancy Atlas Public Policy.

As the new administration slashed subsidies and regulatory support for wind and solar, companies involved in these industries have canceled projects worth a total $18.6 billion.

The radical change in federal government attitudes towards the wind and solar industries has already shaken them, causing bankruptcies and stock price slumps.

Do you feel differently about what international collaboration on climate change can accomplish now than you did at the beginning of your career?
It is not.’ Does international collaboration on climate change work if the United States is rowing in the opposite direction?
The withdrawal from Paris was a setback for global climate efforts, particularly in climate finance.
When I worked as a minister of finance seven years ago, I was co-founder of the Coalition of Finance Ministers Against Climate Change.","In Australia, climate has historically been a divisive issue. You seem to have gotten past the partisanship somewhat. How have you done that? I wouldn’t say there is a consensus here now. There are attempts by some in our opposition who are currently trying to remove, for example, the support for net zero by 2050. We have a green political party that would say net zero by 2035. Now, if you do that, you’re not going to achieve it; you’re going to threaten energy security, and therefore you’ll lose community support. If you just say, “Yeah, 100 percent renewable by tomorrow,” then you will lose support. You’ve got to take people with you on the journey. Our predecessors had 22 different energy policies and didn’t land one.

I try to speak about climate change as a challenge, but also an opportunity. To speak about the cost of inaction through the disasters that we’re seeing, but also the benefit in embracing the transition to clean energy. We are in a position where we’re trying to shift the agenda from one of “Why are you spending money on this?” to the return that comes from acting. One of the things that is said by climate skeptics in Australia is, “Oh, well, we’re only a couple of percent of the world’s emissions, so anything we do doesn’t matter.” That’s where the argument about economic benefit from action as opposed to inaction needs to be made.

Do you believe that the framework for international collaboration is actually effective? The challenge that the globe faces on this and so many other areas is the tension between international action and national sovereignty. I don’t think there’s a shortcut around the U.N. framework. As much as it is not ideal, I don’t see that there’s another option. What we’ve seen is a rise of nationalism and individualism from many countries. But it is also in the interest of nations and states for there to be good global outcomes. No country will be immune from action if we see an ongoing rise in levels of climate change, which means more climate refugees, which means other international changes as well. And these things are linked with national security, too.

‘I don’t think there’s a shortcut around the U.N. framework.’

You’re a big importer of Chinese-made solar panels. How do you see China right now? Is it a threat to a country like Australia, or is it a benefit because they are making so many of these technologies cheap and affordable? Well, it is a source of some regret. I think that there’s not a solar panel in the world that doesn’t have intellectual property that was created in Australia. Now, part of my argument is that we missed out on the commercial benefit. Just literally today, my minister and I were in South Australia announcing a nearly sixfold increase in manufacturing of solar panels at one of our plants there. China was smart to ramp up its investment in manufacturing, as it has been dominating critical minerals. What that could be is a lesson for countries so that, if there is potential trade disruption, there is less risk if other parts of the globe are also manufacturing.

This is something we’re going through here, where the Trump administration is penalizing the development of renewable energy and promoting fossil fuels. What is your response to what the U.S. is doing? We’re really focused on working in the Pacific in particular. We have a climate-change structure fund that is supporting the lowering of emissions in our own region. I think we don’t get into what other countries are doing, including the United States. That’s a matter for them as a sovereign nation. What it potentially does is open up opportunities in other parts. The countries that will succeed economically, in my view, are countries that continue to move forward.

How is climate change affecting the Marshall Islands? We will be submerged by 2050 if the world doesn’t do its part. We have a population of around 37,000. Ten years ago, we had closer to 50,000.

And what is driving that migration? One reason is that when we have regular inundations, some people, rather than rebuilding their homes, decide to go away and settle in the U.S. Sea-level rise is becoming scary for many of us.

Do you think your citizens make a direct connection between things like rising seas, airborne diseases and climate change? Yes, this conversation has been ongoing for many years. We have climate change in our curriculum. So our kids are growing up understanding the issues. People know that big emitters — the rich countries — are causing this, that we have no contribution to the greenhouse-gas emissions that are destroying the world and our livelihood. Our people are not complacent, but they have accepted the fact that big inequities exist and powerful countries get away with unacceptable behaviors. We are used to that mentality and attitude, since we have lived with the impact of the U.S. nuclear-testing program on our islands for 70 years.

What do you think developed nations owe countries like the Marshall Islands? The plan for elevating only two of our communities is projected to cost us billions. It’s a lot of money. I wish that the big emitters could step up and put money into that, because that could really help.

Do you feel differently about what international collaboration on climate change can accomplish now than you did at the beginning of your career? I have a positive outlook, despite everything that is happening. I think the fact that we are sitting at the table now — before, you know, it wasn’t as easy to be part of the discussions. The small-island developing states have been able to organize themselves and to be heard.

What has participating in those discussions been like for you? This is the 10th year of the Paris Agreement, and we’ve been hearing the same excuses from big emitters. You know, they’re very comfortable, and they don’t want to move from their comfort level.

What impact does the U.S. withdrawal from Paris have on the world’s ability to take action on this issue? It’s unfortunate that the U.S. has decided to step out of Paris. But there are those who rally together, because there are no other options for them. And so I think people are coming together stronger than before because you cannot rely on the U.S. in this respect. Something positive is happening, even though it’s not at the level that the Marshall Islands and other small developing countries have been advocating.

‘Big emitters are very comfortable, and they don’t want to move from their comfort level.’

What specific steps are you taking in the Marshall Islands to combat the effects of climate change? The warming of the ocean is killing our corals, which are building blocks of atoll nations. We are currently doing research to determine species of corals that can survive the warming ocean. Big emitters could provide research. Even though we are not contributing to emission levels, we are doing what we can to decrease greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. We are building a fleet of ships that use wind and solar power to replace our fossil-fuel-run shipping fleet.

Do you think your country will survive? As the leader of the Marshall Islands, I cannot take the view that we cannot survive. One important thing we’ve done is register our boundaries with the United Nations, making sure that the world recognizes our boundaries, regardless of whether we’re underwater or above water. So in that respect, the country will survive.

What are some of the changes your people have had to make to their daily lives as you navigate all this? Seven years ago, Majuro had no sea walls. Now we build sea walls to protect homes and schools. I mean, we used to be able to just walk into the lagoon. Now you have to go over sea walls to get to the lagoon side or to the ocean side. The landscape is different. I’ll share a poem that was put together by my daughter, Kathy Jetn̄il-Kijiner. It’s a reflection on how people are feeling about what’s happening.

My cousin

had a nightmare

that we kept

building seawalls

higher and

higher

all around

our island

up to

the sky

until suddenly

we were

at the bottom

of a wishing well

looking

up

at the world.

When you see the U.S. retreat from engagement in climate issues, what does that mean for Guyana? The withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement is a major blow. We can’t debate that. The U.S. is not only a major emitter of greenhouse gases, but it wields tremendous influence in global affairs. The climate crisis is an existential crisis for many of us. We simply cannot afford to fold our hands and do nothing. We’re working closely with our neighbors, especially Brazil and Suriname, on forest biodiversity and resilience. With the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, then predictability on financing becomes an issue. It opens up a floodgate for others to also be unpredictable in the policy-making environment. Everything that surrounds climate change, commitment and policy requires global consensus, basically.

Is the global community actually making the financing available so that nations like Guyana can undergo the energy transition? Absolutely not. It’s ridiculous sometimes to listen to the pledges, because none of the pledges is actualized. When you ask the developing world to adopt measures to limit the impact of whatever we are doing on climate, you’re asking us to transition when we have major issues on energy equality, energy poverty, energy access. And then to complicate issues, these very countries are asked to function in a digital world, so they are already suffering from immense poverty because they were never able to adapt to the Industrial Revolution. Now they are moving into the digital revolution with A.I. that they will never be able to catch up with. And at the same time, basic things like clean water, access to electricity — major segments of the population don’t have this. This is something that has severely impacted the quality and equity of global policy-making. And there is no clear path and no clear plan as to how we are going to address these issues.

I heard implicitly in what you just said that climate change is the ultimate long-term problem in a world that is so often consumed with these short-term crises. I would put it even better: It’s a sacrificial lamb. Climate change is a sacrificial lamb that is always postponed. If you look at the last five years, we have not accelerated momentum. We have really stagnated. We are not implementing what we commit ourselves to do globally.

One thing that has not stagnated is temperature rise. What will this mean for the people of Guyana? If we did not have the type of revenue stream that we have now, it would have meant debt. It would have meant destruction. It would have meant our economy just falling apart. Guyana is a new oil producer, but we are using the resource to finance our energy transition, to build resilient infrastructure, to support the region that we are in, to invest in livelihood options that will keep our forest standing, which stores many gigatons of carbon. We’re investing in solar farms, hydro, natural gas, wind and biomass, all aimed at transitioning to a low-emission energy grid. We are building off-grid systems, solar farms, wind farms for the hinterland community, where the Indigenous people live.

‘Climate change is a sacrificial lamb.’

You talk about how, for Guyana, the answer to coping with a hotter world is in fact being funded by the production of more fuels that are causing that warming. That of course is sort of the conundrum in a nutshell, right? I don’t see it as a problem. Your question in the context of Guyana is quite different from your question in the Middle East, or your question in one of the industrial countries. For us, it’s quite different.

How do you see a way out? We have this standing forest that has been there for all our lives, which the world does not see a value in. It’s easy. If the world says, “We’re going to pay a fair-market rate for the forests that have ecological and biodiversity sources that also have a price,” then it will allow countries like ours that are forested to then use the revenue from that to protect our land, to invest in health, to invest in education, human development and infrastructure, to remain competitive and to build a strong and resilient economy. So the moral question is: Who can produce what the world needs in the least environmentally damaging way? Because let’s be clear on this too. We can’t be naïve. The world will need fossil fuel a long time into the future.

How is climate change affecting Kenya? Just in the last 10 years, we have experienced three very serious droughts. In one, we lost close to two and a half million heads of livestock. We incurred costs upward of $1.5 billion on the loss of livestock alone. We lost many lives because of floods that followed. Between 5 and 10 percent of our economy is washed away every time we have a drought or flood. Climate change is not a myth. It is not a story. It is not far-fetched. It is a lived reality every day.

There has been real pushback within Kenya on the degree to which you are focused on international issues around climate rather than domestic issues. There have been protests. You’ve been criticized for police crackdowns. I see protests happen in many other countries. I see demonstrations in America. I see demonstrations in France and Europe. The reason that maybe you don’t see as much protesting in the rest of our continent is largely because not many countries are as democratic as Kenya. There is always a balance between the right to protest and the degeneration of protest into riots, destruction of property and life. And the police have a very delicate job. I don’t envy their position. But this is part of the growing of a nation.

But talking to your countrymen, how do you explain your focus on something that can seem very abstract to people who are still just struggling to get by day to day? Climate change is not just a global issue. It is a very domestic matter as well. Droughts made millions of Kenyans go hungry. Floods just in the city of Nairobi killed over 30 people. Nobody can persuasively tell any Kenyan that climate change is abstract. It is not.

Do you feel like the effort to coordinate global climate action has been effective? In the last three years, ever since we came together as a continent and pushed one continental position, what looked impossible is now beginning to be a reality. We just came back from a meeting of the U.N. where we were discussing development and financing. And it is generally acceptable now that countries like Kenya should be considered for financing. There was a time when we said this and it looked like a joke.

How exactly have things changed in those conversations? I think there is now a realization that we need debt relief, debt restructuring, because many countries, including Kenya, spend a lot of resources on managing the effects of climate change. And we’ve had, many times, to reorganize our resources because, when it comes to emissions, we are paying for a crime that others committed.

‘Nobody can persuasively tell any Kenyan that climate change is abstract. It is not.’

Does international collaboration on climate change work if the United States is rowing in the opposite direction? My brother, no situation is permanent. We may have a difficult situation now, but I believe that no one country can solve the problem of climate change alone. No one region, however powerful, however mighty. Solving this requires the participation, the collaboration, of everybody. And so I am very confident that the position of the United States, of China, of Europe, of Africa must come together at some point. We may disagree for a moment, we may disagree for a while, but reality is going to beat us into an agreement, because we have no option. The effects of climate change are in every continent. The only difference is that developed countries can cushion themselves. If the people in our continent cannot find life bearable in this continent, no amount of building borders and erecting roadblocks will block people from moving around the globe.

What’s your response when you see President Trump withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, essentially saying that he doesn’t believe climate change is an urgent threat? I have come across many leaders, and I don’t think President Trump is alone. But that does not remove the reality of what climate change is. The science is stubborn. The reality and facts are clear. Governments will come and go, leaders will move on, but the situation will be here. The reality will be staring at us.

Finland has among the most ambitious climate targets in the world. At the same time, you’re still consuming large quantities of oil, gas and even coal. What has the energy transition looked like for you? Today we produce more than 95 percent of our electricity carbon-neutral. We are going to change our whole society to use clean energy and get rid of fossils and to be carbon neutral. And we can do it. Our companies are committed. And our people, the whole of society, is committed to these targets.

What do you think when you see the U.S. pulling out of the Paris Agreement, penalizing renewable-energy production and doubling down on fossil fuels? We are looking very carefully at what is happening in the U.S. The withdrawal from Paris was a setback for global climate efforts, particularly in climate finance. For example, the American data economy is investing billions in data centers in Finland because of clean energy. I’m a bit worried about how U.S. policy affects the companies from the U.S. and their investment plans. But it is important to note that many private-sector companies have continued to advance climate action. And we have seen that China’s role in climate policy has become even more crucial. And the E.U. must work even harder. Climate and economy go hand in hand. We in Finland know this.

Is China becoming a more powerful partner to Finland with the retreat of the U.S. on clean energy? With China, we have to be careful. We have to get rid of dangerous dependencies, because we have to be autonomous in clean-energy production. China is investing a lot, and China is very good on that. That’s why we have to invest also in the West.

Do you feel like the effort to coordinate international climate action has ultimately been effective? I’m concerned at this moment, because we have so many troubles around the world. We have wars in Ukraine, the Middle East, in Africa. But at the same time, climate change is moving forward. And we have to act. I have seen that international cooperation is possible. When I worked as a minister of finance seven years ago, I was co-founder of the Coalition of Finance Ministers Against Climate Change. Today there are 100 countries on board. And the solution was carbon pricing. I think that is a good example — that if you have practical and good ideas, you can find the power between countries and coalitions.

‘With China, we have to be careful. We have to get rid of dangerous dependencies.’

When you talk to leaders from the developing world, they really believe that developed countries, including Finland, should pay for climate-related damage in their countries. What’s your response to this? It is understandable, of course, and it’s clear that we have to support developing countries that are facing the effects of climate change first. It’s daily life in their countries.

You’ve been working on this issue for many years now. What was the moment when you felt the most personal disillusionment about the politics around climate change? About five to 10 years ago, there was a debate in my own country over whether climate change is true or not. And because I believe it is, and I’m deeply worried about our world and our planet, that debate was frustrating. But we won. Today we have new technologies. We can change our behavior without cutting our welfare. We just have to believe that it’s possible, and we have to continue our work.

How is Bangladesh experiencing climate change right now? We have to make use of every little space we’ve got in order to feed ourselves. But not only is our land sinking into the ocean; the water system brings saline water into the land because of the tide. And salinity eats up our cultivable land. So sum total is our land is getting squeezed. It’s not a very happy situation. It’s not going to change unless global warming changes. And then besides the sea level rising, our atmosphere is getting crazy. Our weather pattern is changing. Half of the population is under the age of 26. It’s a very young population. So they need a space to grow up and learn how to survive on this planet.

How much do you think international efforts to collaborate on climate action have succeeded or failed? We try to solve everything by pouring money into it. That’s not the solution. I’m saying I have to change myself. That’s how the world will change. I’m not undermining the importance of the COP [U.N. climate conference], because this is where everybody gets together and worries together. But the solution has to be something which is not just the government giving instruction. Government is not the solution. It’s the people who live on this planet who are the solution.

Bangladesh is a country that has almost no renewable-energy production at scale right now. You’ve talked about a zero-carbon-emissions world. How does a country like Bangladesh get there from where it is now? It’s not our fault. We try every way. Bangladesh doesn’t have its own source of hydropower. It’s a flat land, so we don’t have much except for solar. We have tremendous sources of hydropower up in the north, in Nepal, in Bhutan, and they are willing to supply this to Bangladesh. But for a time, we could not have the transmission line over India. So we got stuck. This is something that needs a decision which is beyond the control of Bangladesh.

‘We have to make use of every little space we’ve got in order to feed ourselves.’

Beyond India, what does the rest of the strategic landscape look like when it comes to energy issues? Is China potentially a partner for you as the U.S. pulls back? Well, you can imagine what the answer is, but being in the government, I cannot go on talking about other countries, what they should do and so on. It creates a problem for the government.

When you see the moves that the Trump administration has taken to reduce support for renewables, to prioritize fossil fuels, to cut federal funding for disaster response, what do you say? I just do the same thing I do for everybody. I’ll go to him and explain how I feel so bad that we are not taking the right kind of steps. And it can be done without hurting anybody. You have a choice, whether you take the path of self-destruction or you take the path of continuation and a decent life for all of us together. And not let the island people sink into the ocean. Not let Bangladesh be affected by sea level rising.

What do you think the developed countries that have historically been responsible for most global emissions owe a country like Bangladesh? All I can do is explain to them: “Look, this is our home.

In the US, the AI boom is spurring the biggest surge in power demand in decades, leading to soaring utility bills.
Without parallel investment in renewables, higher demand could push baseload power prices up 9% by 2040.

“High UK electricity costs are likely to remain a structural drag, as data-center developers increasingly gravitate toward regions with lower power prices and abundant renewable resources.” ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.","Microsoft Corp. and OpenAI are among the US firms that have in recent days pledged to invest £31 billion ($41.8 billion) into artificial intelligence projects in Britain, but industry experts say the commitment could be undermined by the UK’s aging power grid and some of the world’s highest electricity prices.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer has promised to fast-track planning approval for data centers and ease access to the power grid. But AI is notoriously energy-hungry and companies could look elsewhere if the government can’t meet its commitments.

“The UK is simply unfit for datacenter development, with some of the world’s highest electricity prices, an ill-suited planning system and a systemic failure of governance,” said Joshua Leahy, chief technology officer at XTX Markets.

Earlier this year, XTX Markets, the quant trading firm backed by billionaire Alex Gerko, announced it would spend more than €1 billion building five data centers in Finland, where power is cheaper, to underpin its growing use of machine learning.

The US-UK initiative is a spin off from President Donald Trump’s visit to the UK this week.

Getting these plans off the page and onto the ground is going to be tough. New infrastructure in the UK from hospitals to manufacturing is already facing challenges from an aging, strained grid. As things stand, it can take at least five years to get a new connection, according to Savills Plc, a real estate firm working with developers to identify which sites are suitable for data centers.

In the US, the AI boom is spurring the biggest surge in power demand in decades, leading to soaring utility bills. The largest grid, stretching from Virginia to Illinois and home to the biggest concentration of AI data centers in the world, mostly uses natural gas, nuclear reactors and coal rather than clean energy.

In the UK, the same power mix isn’t going to work. The government’s central energy policy envisages having a clean grid by 2030 while lowering bills by £300. On top of that, if the planned “AI growth zones” come to fruition, they would create a huge surge in electricity demand.

Looking at the US experience, it’s increasingly difficult to see how Britain can manage to achieve all of these things.

The UK is making progress toward its 2030 goal, getting a record 50% of its electricity supply from renewables last year, according to government data. Even with renewable power being added at a record pace, demand from data centers could grow 40% by 2030 which would quickly soak up the extra supplies, according to analysis firm ICIS.

The UK has high electricity costs because of the role gas-fired power plants play in setting prices. The most expensive megawatt needed to meet demand sets the price for everyone in the market. That means that even if the wind is blowing and the sun shining, a small amount of expensive gas on the grid can drive up the cost. In other parts of Europe, like France, cheaper sources like nuclear energy keeps prices lower.

To be sure, the tech industry is often willing to pay up for power. People in the power sector talk about the AI premium - referring to the higher cost the industry is willing to absorb to get the supply they need. Last year, Microsoft to agreed to steep prices to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in New York.

But the extra demand could push up prices for everyone, a politically fraught prospect in a country where utility bills are front of mind for inflation-scarred voters.

A large-scale 100-megawatt facility can use as much electricity as 260,000 homes, according to Aurora Energy Research Ltd. Without parallel investment in renewables, higher demand could push baseload power prices up 9% by 2040.

“Our overriding priority is being where our customers are, with the strongest connectivity and lowest latency,” said Seamus Dunne, managing director for UK and Ireland at Digital Realty. The firm operates one of the biggest fleets in London with 13 data centers. “That’s why we continue to invest in London and other major metro areas even when power prices are high.”

Countries like France where power prices are cheaper are more attractive than Britain and that will start to take effect by 2030, according to ICIS.

“The price differential is currently the main distinction between the French and UK markets in terms of data-center attractiveness,” said Luca Urbanucci, analyst at ICIS. “High UK electricity costs are likely to remain a structural drag, as data-center developers increasingly gravitate toward regions with lower power prices and abundant renewable resources.”

The Georgia factory is not just a manufacturing site—it is a statement of intent in a sector where scale and resilience are paramount.","The electric vehicle (EV) industry is at a pivotal inflection point, with companies racing to balance innovation, scalability, and supply chain resilience.

(RIVN) has taken a bold step forward with the groundbreaking of its $5 billion Georgia factory, a project that could redefine its trajectory in the mass-market EV landscape. This analysis evaluates Rivian's strategic momentum through the lens of supply chain resilience and production scalability, drawing on recent developments and partnerships to assess its long-term viability.

Supply Chain Resilience: Localization and Strategic Partnerships

Rivian's Georgia factory is not merely a production hub but a cornerstone of its strategy to insulate itself from global supply chain vulnerabilities. The company has secured a $6.6 billion federal loan from the U.S. Department of Energy and a $1.5 billion state incentive package from Georgia, contingent on creating 7,500 direct jobs and 8,000 indirect jobs by 2030 Rivian breaks ground on $5B Georgia factory ahead of construction in 2026[ 1 ]. These incentives are tied to Rivian's commitment to localize its supply chain, a critical move in an era of rising tariffs and geopolitical uncertainty.

A key component of this strategy is Rivian's partnership with LG Energy Solution (LGES) to produce 4695 cylindrical battery cells at a new Arizona facility. These cells, set to power the R2 and R3 models, offer six times the capacity of the 2170 cells currently in use, enhancing energy density and safety 2026 Rivian R2 Will Get New LG Cells With 'Six …[ 2 ]. This collaboration aligns with the Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) requirements for domestic battery production, reducing Rivian's reliance on overseas suppliers while qualifying for federal tax credits Rivian R2 will get Arizona-made batteries from LG[ 3 ].

Moreover,

has proactively stockpiled lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells from Gotion High-Tech in China and Samsung SDI in South Korea, ensuring short-term stability amid tariff risks Rivian’s Strategic Battery Stockpile: A Smart Move Against Tariff Challenges[ 4 ]. This dual approach—short-term stockpiling and long-term localization—demonstrates a nuanced understanding of supply chain dynamics. By co-locating suppliers near its Georgia plant, Rivian aims to reduce logistics costs and lead times, a strategy echoed by traditional automakers like and in their Southeastern U.S. operations Rivian Georgia Plant: EV Supply Chain Investment Opportunity[ 5 ].

Production Scalability: From Ambition to Execution

The Georgia factory's two-phase design, targeting 400,000 annual vehicles by 2028, represents a quantum leap for Rivian. Currently, the company produces 15,000 units annually at its Illinois plant, a scale insufficient to compete with Tesla's 4 million vehicles or Ford's 2.5 million It's 'Do or Die' for Electric Vehicle Maker Rivian as It Breaks Ground on a $5 Billion Plant[ 6 ]. The Georgia facility's phased approach—200,000 units per phase—allows for incremental capacity expansion while mitigating financial risk.

This scalability is further bolstered by Rivian's investment in workforce development. The company has partnered with Georgia's technical colleges and universities to create apprenticeship programs, ensuring a pipeline of skilled labor for advanced manufacturing Rivian | Georgia Department of Economic Development[ 7 ]. Such initiatives not only address immediate labor needs but also strengthen the regional ecosystem, a factor that could attract additional suppliers and investors.

However, scalability hinges on Rivian's ability to execute its timeline. Delays in construction or production could exacerbate cash flow pressures, particularly as the company burns through $1 billion annually in operating costs Rivian Breaks Ground on $5B EV Plant in Georgia[ 8 ]. The Georgia plant's proximity to I-20 and major ports, however, provides a logistical edge, enabling efficient distribution to the Eastern U.S. and export markets Rivian Holds Kickoff Ceremony for Georgia Plant, Accelerating American Manufacturing Growth[ 9 ].

Challenges and Mitigants: Navigating a Competitive Landscape

Rivian's path is not without obstacles. The U.S. EV market is maturing, with slowing sales growth and the expiration of federal tax credits At a truly awful time to build an electric vehicle[ 10 ]. Competitors like

and Ford are also scaling production, with Tesla's Texas and Berlin Gigafactories targeting 500,000 units annually by 2025. Rivian's differentiation lies in its focus on premium utility vehicles (R1T/R1S) and its upcoming R2 and R3 models, which aim to capture the mass market with lower price points Rivian breaks ground on $5 billion Georgia electric vehicle plant[ 11 ].

Environmental concerns from local residents—particularly regarding the Georgia plant's impact on farmland—could also delay permits or spark regulatory scrutiny Rivian Breaks Ground on $5B EV Factory in Georgia, Boosting Jobs and Production[ 12 ]. Rivian's emphasis on sustainability, including renewable energy integration and modern construction techniques, will be critical in addressing these concerns and maintaining its ESG credentials Tracking Success] Rivian’s Supply Chain – How a Startup Competes in the EV Market[ 13 ].

Investment Outlook: Balancing Risks and Rewards

For investors, Rivian's Georgia factory represents both a high-stakes gamble and a potential catalyst for long-term value creation. The project's success depends on three pillars:

1. Supply Chain Localization: Continued progress with LGES and domestic battery producers will reduce exposure to global disruptions.

2. Production Timelines: Meeting 2028 production targets is essential to achieving economies of scale and profitability.

3. Market Differentiation: The R2 and R3 models must resonate with price-sensitive consumers in a crowded EV segment.

While risks remain, Rivian's strategic alignment with the IRA, its vertically integrated approach, and its geographic advantages position it to capture a meaningful share of the EV market.

When I worked as a minister of finance seven years ago, I was co-founder of the Coalition of Finance Ministers Against Climate Change.
What was the moment when you felt the most personal disillusionment about the politics around climate change?
About five to 10 years ago, there was a debate in my own country over whether climate change is true or not.
Do you think your citizens make a direct connection between things like rising seas, airborne diseases and climate change?","Finland has among the most ambitious climate targets in the world. At the same time, you’re still consuming large quantities of oil, gas and even coal. What has the energy transition looked like for you? Today we produce more than 95 percent of our electricity carbon-neutral. We are going to change our whole society to use clean energy and get rid of fossils and to be carbon neutral. And we can do it. Our companies are committed. And our people, the whole of society, is committed to these targets.

What do you think when you see the U.S. pulling out of the Paris Agreement, penalizing renewable-energy production and doubling down on fossil fuels? We are looking very carefully at what is happening in the U.S. The withdrawal from Paris was a setback for global climate efforts, particularly in climate finance. For example, the American data economy is investing billions in data centers in Finland because of clean energy. I’m a bit worried about how U.S. policy affects the companies from the U.S. and their investment plans. But it is important to note that many private-sector companies have continued to advance climate action. And we have seen that China’s role in climate policy has become even more crucial. And the E.U. must work even harder. Climate and economy go hand in hand. We in Finland know this.

‘We are going to change our whole society.’

Is China becoming a more powerful partner to Finland with the retreat of the U.S. on clean energy? With China, we have to be careful. We have to get rid of dangerous dependencies, because we have to be autonomous in clean-energy production. China is investing a lot, and China is very good on that. That’s why we have to invest also in the West.

Do you feel like the effort to coordinate international climate action has ultimately been effective? I’m concerned at this moment, because we have so many troubles around the world. We have wars in Ukraine, the Middle East, in Africa. But at the same time, climate change is moving forward. And we have to act. I have seen that international cooperation is possible. When I worked as a minister of finance seven years ago, I was co-founder of the Coalition of Finance Ministers Against Climate Change. Today there are 100 countries on board. And the solution was carbon pricing. I think that is a good example — that if you have practical and good ideas, you can find the power between countries and coalitions.

‘With China, we have to be careful. We have to get rid of dangerous dependencies.’

When you talk to leaders from the developing world, they really believe that developed countries, including Finland, should pay for climate-related damage in their countries. What’s your response to this? It is understandable, of course, and it’s clear that we have to support developing countries that are facing the effects of climate change first. It’s daily life in their countries.

You’ve been working on this issue for many years now. What was the moment when you felt the most personal disillusionment about the politics around climate change? About five to 10 years ago, there was a debate in my own country over whether climate change is true or not. And because I believe it is, and I’m deeply worried about our world and our planet, that debate was frustrating. But we won. Today we have new technologies. We can change our behavior without cutting our welfare. We just have to believe that it’s possible, and we have to continue our work.

How is climate change affecting the Marshall Islands? We will be submerged by 2050 if the world doesn’t do its part. We have a population of around 37,000. Ten years ago, we had closer to 50,000.

And what is driving that migration? One reason is that when we have regular inundations, some people, rather than rebuilding their homes, decide to go away and settle in the U.S. Sea-level rise is becoming scary for many of us.

Do you think your citizens make a direct connection between things like rising seas, airborne diseases and climate change? Yes, this conversation has been ongoing for many years. We have climate change in our curriculum. So our kids are growing up understanding the issues. People know that big emitters — the rich countries — are causing this, that we have no contribution to the greenhouse-gas emissions that are destroying the world and our livelihood. Our people are not complacent, but they have accepted the fact that big inequities exist and powerful countries get away with unacceptable behaviors. We are used to that mentality and attitude, since we have lived with the impact of the U.S. nuclear-testing program on our islands for 70 years.

What do you think developed nations owe countries like the Marshall Islands? The plan for elevating only two of our communities is projected to cost us billions. It’s a lot of money. I wish that the big emitters could step up and put money into that, because that could really help.

Do you feel differently about what international collaboration on climate change can accomplish now than you did at the beginning of your career? I have a positive outlook, despite everything that is happening. I think the fact that we are sitting at the table now — before, you know, it wasn’t as easy to be part of the discussions. The small-island developing states have been able to organize themselves and to be heard.

What has participating in those discussions been like for you? This is the 10th year of the Paris Agreement, and we’ve been hearing the same excuses from big emitters. You know, they’re very comfortable, and they don’t want to move from their comfort level.

What impact does the U.S. withdrawal from Paris have on the world’s ability to take action on this issue? It’s unfortunate that the U.S. has decided to step out of Paris. But there are those who rally together, because there are no other options for them. And so I think people are coming together stronger than before because you cannot rely on the U.S. in this respect. Something positive is happening, even though it’s not at the level that the Marshall Islands and other small developing countries have been advocating.

‘Big emitters are very comfortable, and they don’t want to move from their comfort level.’

What specific steps are you taking in the Marshall Islands to combat the effects of climate change? The warming of the ocean is killing our corals, which are building blocks of atoll nations. We are currently doing research to determine species of corals that can survive the warming ocean. Big emitters could provide research. Even though we are not contributing to emission levels, we are doing what we can to decrease greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. We are building a fleet of ships that use wind and solar power to replace our fossil-fuel-run shipping fleet.

Do you think your country will survive? As the leader of the Marshall Islands, I cannot take the view that we cannot survive. One important thing we’ve done is register our boundaries with the United Nations, making sure that the world recognizes our boundaries, regardless of whether we’re underwater or above water. So in that respect, the country will survive.

What are some of the changes your people have had to make to their daily lives as you navigate all this? Seven years ago, Majuro had no sea walls. Now we build sea walls to protect homes and schools. I mean, we used to be able to just walk into the lagoon. Now you have to go over sea walls to get to the lagoon side or to the ocean side. The landscape is different. I’ll share a poem that was put together by my daughter, Kathy Jetn̄il-Kijiner. It’s a reflection on how people are feeling about what’s happening.

My cousin

had a nightmare

that we kept

building seawalls

higher and

higher

all around

our island

up to

the sky

until suddenly

we were

at the bottom

of a wishing well

looking

up

at the world.

In Australia, climate has historically been a divisive issue. You seem to have gotten past the partisanship somewhat. How have you done that? I wouldn’t say there is a consensus here now. There are attempts by some in our opposition who are currently trying to remove, for example, the support for net zero by 2050. We have a green political party that would say net zero by 2035. Now, if you do that, you’re not going to achieve it; you’re going to threaten energy security, and therefore you’ll lose community support. If you just say, “Yeah, 100 percent renewable by tomorrow,” then you will lose support. You’ve got to take people with you on the journey. Our predecessors had 22 different energy policies and didn’t land one.

I try to speak about climate change as a challenge, but also an opportunity. To speak about the cost of inaction through the disasters that we’re seeing, but also the benefit in embracing the transition to clean energy. We are in a position where we’re trying to shift the agenda from one of “Why are you spending money on this?” to the return that comes from acting. One of the things that is said by climate skeptics in Australia is, “Oh, well, we’re only a couple of percent of the world’s emissions, so anything we do doesn’t matter.” That’s where the argument about economic benefit from action as opposed to inaction needs to be made.

Do you believe that the framework for international collaboration is actually effective? The challenge that the globe faces on this and so many other areas is the tension between international action and national sovereignty. I don’t think there’s a shortcut around the U.N. framework. As much as it is not ideal, I don’t see that there’s another option. What we’ve seen is a rise of nationalism and individualism from many countries. But it is also in the interest of nations and states for there to be good global outcomes. No country will be immune from action if we see an ongoing rise in levels of climate change, which means more climate refugees, which means other international changes as well. And these things are linked with national security, too.

You’re a big importer of Chinese-made solar panels. How do you see China right now? Is it a threat to a country like Australia, or is it a benefit because they are making so many of these technologies cheap and affordable? Well, it is a source of some regret. I think that there’s not a solar panel in the world that doesn’t have intellectual property that was created in Australia. Now, part of my argument is that we missed out on the commercial benefit. Just literally today, my minister and I were in South Australia announcing a nearly sixfold increase in manufacturing of solar panels at one of our plants there. China was smart to ramp up its investment in manufacturing, as it has been dominating critical minerals. What that could be is a lesson for countries so that, if there is potential trade disruption, there is less risk if other parts of the globe are also manufacturing.

This is something we’re going through here, where the Trump administration is penalizing the development of renewable energy and promoting fossil fuels. What is your response to what the U.S. is doing? We’re really focused on working in the Pacific in particular. We have a climate-change structure fund that is supporting the lowering of emissions in our own region. I think we don’t get into what other countries are doing, including the United States. That’s a matter for them as a sovereign nation. What it potentially does is open up opportunities in other parts. The countries that will succeed economically, in my view, are countries that continue to move forward.

When you see the U.S. retreat from engagement in climate issues, what does that mean for Guyana? The withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement is a major blow. We can’t debate that. The U.S. is not only a major emitter of greenhouse gases, but it wields tremendous influence in global affairs. The climate crisis is an existential crisis for many of us. We simply cannot afford to fold our hands and do nothing. We’re working closely with our neighbors, especially Brazil and Suriname, on forest biodiversity and resilience. With the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, then predictability on financing becomes an issue. It opens up a floodgate for others to also be unpredictable in the policy-making environment. Everything that surrounds climate change, commitment and policy requires global consensus, basically.

Is the global community actually making the financing available so that nations like Guyana can undergo the energy transition? Absolutely not. It’s ridiculous sometimes to listen to the pledges, because none of the pledges is actualized. When you ask the developing world to adopt measures to limit the impact of whatever we are doing on climate, you’re asking us to transition when we have major issues on energy equality, energy poverty, energy access. And then to complicate issues, these very countries are asked to function in a digital world, so they are already suffering from immense poverty because they were never able to adapt to the Industrial Revolution. Now they are moving into the digital revolution with A.I. that they will never be able to catch up with. And at the same time, basic things like clean water, access to electricity — major segments of the population don’t have this. This is something that has severely impacted the quality and equity of global policy-making. And there is no clear path and no clear plan as to how we are going to address these issues.

I heard implicitly in what you just said that climate change is the ultimate long-term problem in a world that is so often consumed with these short-term crises. I would put it even better: It’s a sacrificial lamb. Climate change is a sacrificial lamb that is always postponed. If you look at the last five years, we have not accelerated momentum. We have really stagnated. We are not implementing what we commit ourselves to do globally.

One thing that has not stagnated is temperature rise. What will this mean for the people of Guyana? If we did not have the type of revenue stream that we have now, it would have meant debt. It would have meant destruction. It would have meant our economy just falling apart. Guyana is a new oil producer, but we are using the resource to finance our energy transition, to build resilient infrastructure, to support the region that we are in, to invest in livelihood options that will keep our forest standing, which stores many gigatons of carbon. We’re investing in solar farms, hydro, natural gas, wind and biomass, all aimed at transitioning to a low-emission energy grid. We are building off-grid systems, solar farms, wind farms for the hinterland community, where the Indigenous people live.

‘Climate change is a sacrificial lamb.’

You talk about how, for Guyana, the answer to coping with a hotter world is in fact being funded by the production of more fuels that are causing that warming. That of course is sort of the conundrum in a nutshell, right? I don’t see it as a problem. Your question in the context of Guyana is quite different from your question in the Middle East, or your question in one of the industrial countries. For us, it’s quite different.

How do you see a way out? We have this standing forest that has been there for all our lives, which the world does not see a value in. It’s easy. If the world says, “We’re going to pay a fair-market rate for the forests that have ecological and biodiversity sources that also have a price,” then it will allow countries like ours that are forested to then use the revenue from that to protect our land, to invest in health, to invest in education, human development and infrastructure, to remain competitive and to build a strong and resilient economy. So the moral question is: Who can produce what the world needs in the least environmentally damaging way? Because let’s be clear on this too. We can’t be naïve. The world will need fossil fuel a long time into the future.

How is climate change affecting Kenya? Just in the last 10 years, we have experienced three very serious droughts. In one, we lost close to two and a half million heads of livestock. We incurred costs upward of $1.5 billion on the loss of livestock alone. We lost many lives because of floods that followed. Between 5 and 10 percent of our economy is washed away every time we have a drought or flood. Climate change is not a myth. It is not a story. It is not far-fetched. It is a lived reality every day.

There has been real pushback within Kenya on the degree to which you are focused on international issues around climate rather than domestic issues. There have been protests. You’ve been criticized for police crackdowns. I see protests happen in many other countries. I see demonstrations in America. I see demonstrations in France and Europe. The reason that maybe you don’t see as much protesting in the rest of our continent is largely because not many countries are as democratic as Kenya. There is always a balance between the right to protest and the degeneration of protest into riots, destruction of property and life. And the police have a very delicate job. I don’t envy their position. But this is part of the growing of a nation.

But talking to your countrymen, how do you explain your focus on something that can seem very abstract to people who are still just struggling to get by day to day? Climate change is not just a global issue. It is a very domestic matter as well. Droughts made millions of Kenyans go hungry. Floods just in the city of Nairobi killed over 30 people. Nobody can persuasively tell any Kenyan that climate change is abstract. It is not.

Do you feel like the effort to coordinate global climate action has been effective? In the last three years, ever since we came together as a continent and pushed one continental position, what looked impossible is now beginning to be a reality. We just came back from a meeting of the U.N. where we were discussing development and financing. And it is generally acceptable now that countries like Kenya should be considered for financing. There was a time when we said this and it looked like a joke.

How exactly have things changed in those conversations? I think there is now a realization that we need debt relief, debt restructuring, because many countries, including Kenya, spend a lot of resources on managing the effects of climate change. And we’ve had, many times, to reorganize our resources because, when it comes to emissions, we are paying for a crime that others committed.

‘Nobody can persuasively tell any Kenyan that climate change is abstract. It is not.’

Does international collaboration on climate change work if the United States is rowing in the opposite direction? My brother, no situation is permanent. We may have a difficult situation now, but I believe that no one country can solve the problem of climate change alone. No one region, however powerful, however mighty. Solving this requires the participation, the collaboration, of everybody. And so I am very confident that the position of the United States, of China, of Europe, of Africa must come together at some point. We may disagree for a moment, we may disagree for a while, but reality is going to beat us into an agreement, because we have no option. The effects of climate change are in every continent. The only difference is that developed countries can cushion themselves. If the people in our continent cannot find life bearable in this continent, no amount of building borders and erecting roadblocks will block people from moving around the globe.

What’s your response when you see President Trump withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, essentially saying that he doesn’t believe climate change is an urgent threat? I have come across many leaders, and I don’t think President Trump is alone. But that does not remove the reality of what climate change is. The science is stubborn. The reality and facts are clear. Governments will come and go, leaders will move on, but the situation will be here. The reality will be staring at us.

How is Bangladesh experiencing climate change right now? We have to make use of every little space we’ve got in order to feed ourselves. But not only is our land sinking into the ocean; the water system brings saline water into the land because of the tide. And salinity eats up our cultivable land. So sum total is our land is getting squeezed. It’s not a very happy situation. It’s not going to change unless global warming changes. And then besides the sea level rising, our atmosphere is getting crazy. Our weather pattern is changing. Half of the population is under the age of 26. It’s a very young population. So they need a space to grow up and learn how to survive on this planet.

How much do you think international efforts to collaborate on climate action have succeeded or failed? We try to solve everything by pouring money into it. That’s not the solution. I’m saying I have to change myself. That’s how the world will change. I’m not undermining the importance of the COP [U.N. climate conference], because this is where everybody gets together and worries together. But the solution has to be something which is not just the government giving instruction. Government is not the solution. It’s the people who live on this planet who are the solution.

Bangladesh is a country that has almost no renewable-energy production at scale right now. You’ve talked about a zero-carbon-emissions world. How does a country like Bangladesh get there from where it is now? It’s not our fault. We try every way. Bangladesh doesn’t have its own source of hydropower. It’s a flat land, so we don’t have much except for solar. We have tremendous sources of hydropower up in the north, in Nepal, in Bhutan, and they are willing to supply this to Bangladesh. But for a time, we could not have the transmission line over India. So we got stuck. This is something that needs a decision which is beyond the control of Bangladesh.

‘We have to make use of every little space we’ve got in order to feed ourselves.’

Beyond India, what does the rest of the strategic landscape look like when it comes to energy issues? Is China potentially a partner for you as the U.S. pulls back? Well, you can imagine what the answer is, but being in the government, I cannot go on talking about other countries, what they should do and so on. It creates a problem for the government.

When you see the moves that the Trump administration has taken to reduce support for renewables, to prioritize fossil fuels, to cut federal funding for disaster response, what do you say? I just do the same thing I do for everybody. I’ll go to him and explain how I feel so bad that we are not taking the right kind of steps. And it can be done without hurting anybody. You have a choice, whether you take the path of self-destruction or you take the path of continuation and a decent life for all of us together. And not let the island people sink into the ocean. Not let Bangladesh be affected by sea level rising.

What do you think the developed countries that have historically been responsible for most global emissions owe a country like Bangladesh? All I can do is explain to them: “Look, this is our home. You start a fire in your part of the home, you suffer. But you do something to start a fire in my part of the house — this is not a fair thing to do. You are destroying the whole home. Our life depends on what you do.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/21/magazine/21mag-climate-Leaders-07/21mag-climate-Leaders-07-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 13:02:44.007066

The $110 million new investment will help create a new production line in Mississippi for ABB’s Emax3 circuit breakers.
Earlier this year, ABB announced $120 million investment for new manufacturing sites in Selmer, Tennessee and Senatobia, Mississippi.

The latest manufacturing investment follows ABB’s $170 million commitment to its U.S. facilities two years ago. Those include projects around motor drives in Wisconsin and manufacturing, robotics and other services in New Mexico, Georgia, Tennessee, Michigan, Pennsylvania and South Carolina.

This month’s investment expansion could create nearly 200 new jobs in products serving growth industries such as data centers and the power grid. The International Energy Agency and other forecasters such as Goldman Sachs are forecasting a tremendous demand growth due to artificial intelligence and cloud-based computing, as well as industrial and transportation electrification.

The $110 million new investment will help create a new production line in Mississippi for ABB’s Emax3 circuit breakers. The capital will also be spent to double the footprint of ABB’s power quality and protection equipment manufacturing in Richmond, Virginia, which is opening later this year.

“This $110 million investment in the US is part of our long-term strategy to support future growth in our biggest global market,” said Morten Wierod, ABB CEO, in a statement. “Demand is being driven by key trends, from the surging power needs of AI in data centers, to grid modernization and customers improving energy efficiency and uptime to reduce their costs. Our investments will ensure we can meet growing demand from customers across North America in line with our local-for-local strategy.”

ABB will invest $30 million of its capital to expand three new production lines in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, where the company manufactures smart circuit breakers and switching devices. That expansion will bring 90 new skilled labor jobs by the end of 2026, according to the company.

ABB also is increasing capacity for advanced low- and medium-voltage grid components at its plant in Pinetops, North Carolina, which is going to open next year also.

Earlier this year, ABB announced $120 million investment for new manufacturing sites in Selmer, Tennessee and Senatobia, Mississippi. These are both plants to produce electrical distribution and circuit breakers to market beginning in 2026.

“Demand is increasing steadily for advanced electrification technologies, driven by growth in key sectors including data centers and utilities,” Wierod at the time of the March 2025 announcement. “Our new facilities in Selmer and Senatobia will keep our U.S. customers at the cutting edge of the energy transition and help them meet their performance, productivity and energy efficiency goals.”

Including the past three years, ABB has committed more than $500 million of new investment in its U.S. manufacturing operations. U.S. revenues for the company total nearly $9 billion annually, while the workforce is close to 17,000 people across those facilities.

At last week's RE+ energy conference--where more than 40,000 industry insiders gathered in Las Vegas to talk about the energy transition, enthusiasm and optimism were high for electrification and decarbonization despite recent political headwinds against renewables.

“Technology wins,” said Brian Nelson, renewable segment leader at Swiss-based energy technology giant ABB. “Technology will continue to push the evolution of renewable energy further and further.”

On a purely company level, Nelson highlighted the rise of new 2,000-volt capacity for solar energy collection, pushing module capabilities higher and energy denser than ever.","https://img.energytech.com/files/base/ebm/energytech/image/2025/09/68ced142de78c994b6d34145-abb_manufacturing_photo.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-09-20 13:02:52.497396

After cutting the US wind and solar industries off at the knees all year long, the Trump administration has finally woken up to the fact that wind and solar are the only abundant, accessible domestic energy resources that can meet the nation’s surging demand for electricity ASAP, STAT, on the double, economically, safely, and at scale, too. At least, that’s what one may think upon a cursory reading of the Energy Department’s new “Speed to Power” plan. It is tailor made to vault renewable energy back to priority status in federal energy policy — or not, as the case may be.

More Renewable Energy, Pleeeeese!

Actually, “Speed to Power” is more of a plea than a plan. In a September 18 announcement, the Energy Department let everybody know that it has issued a formal Request for Information, desperately seeking any and all ideas from the private sector on how to “accelerate the speed of large-scale grid infrastructure project development for both transmission and generation.”

The Energy Department sure sounds anxious enough to try anything. In the announcement, the agency admitted that “the current rate of project development is inadequate to support the country’s rapidly expanding manufacturing needs and the reindustrialization of the U.S. economy.”

“The Speed to Power initiative will help ensure the United States has the power needed to win the global artificial intelligence (AI) race while continuing to meet growing demand for affordable, reliable and secure energy,” the Energy Department added, which is a sideways way of indicating that US President Donald Trump’s new fossil-friendly “American Energy Dominance” plan has already fallen on its face.

In fact, the pitch for Speed to Power slots neatly into the renewable energy picture. The US wind and solar industries (especially solar) have spent the better part of the early 2000’s demonstrating that they can deliver kilowatts on the megascale faster, and more economically, than any other energy resource on the market today.

Restarting the Renewable Energy Engine, Or Not

The US renewable energy track record is even more impressive considering that the nation’s rich offshore wind resources have barely been tapped as yet, having hit the doldrums all through the Obama administration and the first Trump administration, too.

Former President Joe Biden finally wrangled the offshore industry into speed mode with a near-term goal of 30 gigawatts. By the time US President Donald Trump took office, a long list of Biden-era offshore wind projects was already through the review stage and on the way to construction. In fact, some were deep into construction when Trump pulled the plug.

If the Energy Department is really that desperate to make Speed to Power happen, perhaps Energy Secretary Wright could find a tactful way to suggest that US President Donald Trump’s fossil-friendly “American Energy Dominance” needs a bit of a tweak, particularly in regards to the US offshore wind industry.

For example, one need look no farther than the Revolution Wind project, a 704-megawatt offshore wind farm located off the coast of Rhode Island. The work was 80% complete as of last August, when Interior Secretary Doug Burgum ordered the work to stop.

That’s peanuts compared to the 2.4-gigawatt SouthCoast Wind project in Massachusetts, which was greenlighted for construction until Burgum pulled the plug last Friday.

And, that’s the problem. Instead of collaborating with other federal agencies on significant domestic energy initiatives, the Energy Department is only seeking projects within its funding wheelhouse. The Speed to Power RFI covers “near-term investment opportunities, project readiness, load growth expectations, and infrastructure constraints that DOE can address,” the Energy Department explains (emphasis added).

The Energy Department’s authority over US energy policy is rooted in the nuclear industry of World War II, so it’s no surprise to see a focus on nuclear power in the RFI. Besides, even if Energy Secretary Wright wanted to address constraints on the offshore wind industry, first he would have to ask Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to restart the federal offshore lease program upon which the entire offshore industry depends, and stop issuing stop-work orders on projects already in the pipeline. Wright will also have to tell Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin to stop re-reviewing offshore wind permits that were already reviewed and approved.

In addition, Wright will have to get Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to reverse his reversal of a federal grant program aimed at upgrading 12 seaports around the nation to serve as offshore wind industry hubs, and he will have to convince US Attorney General Pam Bondi to reverse her reversal of prior offshore wind approvals, too.

Renewable Energy And The Reliability Canard

If you’re thinking that Speed to Power will fall just as flat as American Energy Dominance, drop a note in the comment thread. Meanwhile, in an exquisite coincidence of timing, the Energy Department issued its plea for more power generation just three days before renewable energy advocates from all over the world descend upon the US for New York Climate Week 2025.

CleanTechnica will be in and around New York all week, and we’re particularly interested to know what representatives from the global wind and solar industries make of Speed to Power, particularly in regards to another stipulation coughed up by the Energy Department in the new initiative.

In addition to seeking input on projects only within the Energy Department’s funding authority, Speed to Power relies on the same outdated “reliability” canard that shuts the door on wind and solar. In the September 18 announcement, Secretary Wright emphasized that the hunt is on for any and all “affordable, reliable and secure sources.”

“With the Speed to Power initiative, we’re leveraging the expertise of the private sector to harness all forms of energy that are affordable, reliable and secure to ensure the United States is able to win the AI race,” he repeated.

In case anyone didn’t get the message, the Energy Department cited its lopsided new grid report, in which it warned that that “blackouts could increase by 100 times by 2030 if the U.S. continues to shutter reliable power sources and fails to add additional firm capacity.”

Sure, Let’s Save All Those Coal Jobs

So, where does that leave the Energy Department? With not much, that’s for sure. The agency has fallen back on expensive, wasteful emergency measures such as pulling the mothballed Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan out of mothballs.

The Energy Department has also pulled the emergency cord to force a lumbering, antiquated coal power plant in Michigan to remain open past its scheduled retirement date. That’s not a plan, that’s a sop to the US coal industry, which is still clinging to the hope that Trump will finally make good on his promise to save coal jobs.

“Coal prices are far less volatile than those of natural gas,” the coal industry organization America’s Power notes weakly, but that won’t help. Natural gas has been pushing coal out of the US power generation picture since the early 2000’s, and it will continue pushing with or without an assist from renewable energy resources.

Last week, for example, the Ohio-based power engineering firm Babcock & Wilcox joined with the investment fund Denham Capital to announce a new partnership aimed at leveraging existing transmission infrastructure in the US and Europe to convert coal power plants to gas. “Through the partnership, substantial investments will be made to convert coal-fired power plants to cleaner natural gas solutions, which represent a crucial bridge for the clean energy transition,” the partners explained.

In terms of the renewable energy transition, that “bridge” pitch is worth debunking, but the point is that coal’s place in the power generation profile is shrinking no matter what lifeline the Trump administration tosses into the seas.

Renewable Energy Gets The Last Laugh, Eventually

Oh the irony, it burns. Trump’s own insistence on a Federal Reserve rate cut could give renewable energy investing the edge over coal and gas, too, according to some analyses. For that matter, Trump’s carefully articulated American Energy Dominance plan contains the seeds of coal’s destruction. In addition to throwing a protective blanket over the US nuclear industry, the plan includes multiple renewable energy resources, including hydropower, geothermal, and biomass along with marine energy.

All of these renewable resources face cost and timeline obstacles under the current state of technology, but none of them are going away. Neither is the wind or the sunshine, for that matter. They will all be sticking around long after Trump leaves office on January 20, 2029, as scheduled — peacefully, one hopes, this time.

That was the message from executives, investors and industry leaders at BloombergNEF’s Barrel of Tomorrow in the Age of AI Summit in Houston on Thursday.

The meeting took place against the backdrop of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, which preserved incentives for some sectors while clawing them back for others. Meanwhile, the nation’s shakeup of clean energy policy has prompted some companies to look for opportunity elsewhere, and the AI boom is forcing grids to expand.

Here are five takeaways from the summit about the state of the energy transition in the age of Trump and AI.

Companies look outside of US for opportunities

With Trump rolling back clean-tech incentives, some companies are refocusing their efforts abroad. That’s particularly the case for the battered green hydrogen industry, which has seen high costs, falling investment and stalled projects. In the US, gas is “relatively inexpensive,” and selling green hydrogen into Europe makes more sense, according to Gavin Rennick, president of new energy for SLB.

It’s also the case for carbon capture and storage. In a separate panel, Occidental Petroleum Corp.’s Anthony Cottone said the company is positioning its carbon removal product toward mandated carbon markets. Cottone is the president and general manager of the oil and gas major’s carbon removal unit, 1PointFive, which is currently commissioning a direct air capture plant in Texas.

While the US doesn’t have a federally-regulated carbon market, the European Union and other geographies have emissions trading schemes in place that make carbon credits for direct air capture more enticing.

Regulation is needed to scale green tech

For many green technologies, scaling the Valley of Death and commercializing successfully requires a bit of policy support. And not just carrots, but also sticks.

“We need to transition this not from a voluntary market but to a global regulatory market where there’s actually mandates,” Cottone said of the carbon market. In his view, that’s necessary to lower the technology cost curve and guarantee long-term customer demand for products like carbon dioxide removal credits.

That sentiment was echoed by infrastructure investor Chris Rozell, who co-founded Cresta Fund Management. “I don’t see any case today where you can make alternative fuels at a price that’s lower than crude,” but subsidies could make them “digestible for economies.”

Grid must double in size in 15 years

The US grid took more than 100 years to build out and now has to double in size to meet demand. And it has to do it in the next 15 years, according to industry executives.

Connecting the three power main grids is one of the “most cost effective things to do,” said Michael Skelly, co-founder and CEO of transmission developer Grid United. A national policy to develop high voltage power lines would facilitate that, he said.

Frank Kreikebaum, engineering chief for Smart Wires, said his company was able to help data centers connect in half the time of alternate solutions with the aid of hardware to better manage flow across power lines, substations and other equipment.

The data center build-out is costly

The bitter battle brewing over how to accelerate the AI data-center build-out without unduly burdening consumers was a key point of discussion, with NRG Energy Inc. CEO Larry Coben asking “Who pays for this expansion?”

Coben also noted that this new wave of infrastructure-building isn’t creating the jobs generated by past build-outs. “Data centers are extremely important, both business wise and to national security, but the long term job creation generally isn’t there,” he said.

Terawatt Infrastructure CEO Neha Palmer, meanwhile, emphasized the need for new power generation as electric vehicles proliferate. Like data centers, EVs need power “as fast as possible but the cost is also incredibly important” especially for heavy duty truck fleets that are comparing the cost per mile versus diesel, she said.

Redwood Materials Inc. Chief Executive Officer JB Straubel said batteries have a role to play in stabilizing the load for data centers, which see oscillating rather than steady power demand.

Biofuels may help US farmers

As US farmers struggle with low commodity prices and a trade war that’s hitting demand, biofuels are becoming a key market for the industry.

“I wouldn’t say it’s the answer, but it’s certainly a big part of the answer,” Donnell Rehagen, chief executive of Clean Fuels Alliance America, said.

Rehagen pointed to recent US proposals on biofuel blending mandates, saying he thinks the Trump administration has come to the same conclusion and “is looking at renewable fuel policy as a way to try to help agriculture get through a time like this.”

Fellow panelist Fernando Candia, Bunge’s vice president of global carbon solutions, said biofuel mandates “have enormous importance” for the industry and farmers, who are looking for the visibility and incentives they provide.",https://energynow.com/wp-content/uploads/Houston-Downtown-Skyline-1200x810-1.png,N,,2025-09-20 15:01:44.779195

The award, which recognizes significant contributions to reducing the environmental impact of film productions, was presented to del Toro by Sam Read, executive director of the Sustainable Entertainment Alliance.

Among its green achievements while filming in Toronto, Frankenstein used electric vehicles (EVs) on the production which were quickly recharged through temporary DC fast-charging stations provided by Netflix. The use of diesel generators was cut by more than a third, with Ontario’s clean electricity grid used instead through careful redistribution of available power. These measures, combined with hybrid vehicles, allowed the production to avoid over 50,000 liters of fuel. Additionally, while filming in the U.K., Frankenstein became the first Netflix production to use a mobile hydrogen power unit.

Read highlighted the impact of these efforts in his remarks: “We know from our industry research that the majority of a film’s carbon emissions come from fuel usage, so we’re honored to recognize Frankenstein and Guillermo del Toro’s legacy of sustainability, whether that is how you make the films, but also the films that you make which explore the balance between humanity and the natural world we live in.”

The production also made substantial strides in reducing waste, including minimizing single-use plastics and recycling 180 metric tons of steel from its sets. These initiatives reflected a holistic commitment to sustainability, from energy use to material recycling.

“Shout out to Miles Dale who is always insisting on this,” said del Toro, crediting his long-time collaborator, producer J. Miles Dale, for driving the sustainability efforts on Frankenstein. He added, “Miles Dale and I have been partners for more than a decade, and his dedication to these practices has always been inspiring.”

Dale noted, “We have 53 EV and hybrid vehicles on the show. With our fast chargers here, we can charge a car in about 20 minutes.” He continued, “I think increasingly we will have electric vehicles. That movement is coming. I think that we as producers are committed to doing that going forward.”

Running a sustainable production does not require giving up full creative control, notes del Toro, “We have to decide which one is the thing that we can do more reasonably when we want full control and also not damaging a natural resource. It is a people-driven industry. So you have an impact on the community immediately.”

The company, which owns Facebook, filed an application with US regulators this week seeking authorization to do so. A Meta representative said it was a natural next step to participate in energy markets as it looks to power operations with clean energy.

Buying electricity has become an increasingly urgent challenge for technology companies including Meta, Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. They’re all racing to develop more advanced artificial intelligence systems and tools that are notoriously resource-intensive. Amazon.com Inc., Google and Microsoft are already active power traders, according to filings with US regulators.

While big tech companies consume huge amounts of electricity, they also have contracts for power that they can flip around and sell when prices are high.

“There will be opportunities to sell electricity into the wholesale markets and make a little extra money doing that,” said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James.

Plus, tech companies that have batteries or on-site generators at data centers can sell power from those back to the grid when prices spike, said Andy DeVries, a utilities and power analyst at CreditSights Inc.

Power demand from data centers used to build and run AI models is set to quadruple in 10 years, based on projections from BloombergNEF. At the same time, power prices are rising amid this surge in electric demand. In fact, capacity payments — which generators get in some US markets — hit a record in an auction held this year by the country’s biggest grid, which stretches from Washington to Chicago.

The demand is so robust that some tech firms that touted their climate goals are now considering natural gas a key source to help power their data centers. Last month, for instance, Louisiana regulators approved utility Entergy Corp.’s plan to build three natural gas plants to power Meta’s data center there.

Meta’s application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission seeks authorization “to sell energy, capacity, and certain ancillary services.” It didn’t identify, however, where in the US it would seek to trade power. The company would be required to file for membership in order to trade in one of seven competitive power markets, such as the Texas grid or the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which encompasses the Louisiana data center.

It filed the request through a subsidiary, Atem Energy LLC, formed to act as a power marketer. Meta asked for its application to be approved by Nov. 16.

In recent years, Nevada has built some of the largest clean energy projects in the country, with seven solar projects boasting more than 200 megawatts of capacity. Between now and 2030, another six are expected to come online.

Nevada's solar-plus-storage portfolio now includes several massive projects, including the Gemini Solar Hybrid facility. Completed in March 2024 with 690 megawatts of solar capacity and 380 megawatts of battery storage, it stands as one of the world's biggest solar-plus-storage plants. Not too far away, the Reid Gardner storage project adds another 220 megawatts of capacity.

According to Cleanview's project tracker, Nevada now hosts 66 utility-scale solar farms with a combined capacity of 5,285 megawatts. These megaprojects have helped Nevada become one of the largest solar markets in the U.S. — roughly 30% of the state's power capacity comes from utility-scale solar, more than any other state.

Chart Source: Cleanview's market intelligence platform

Why is solar and storage growing so quickly in Nevada?

The state has ideal conditions for solar deployment: abundant sunshine, and — critically — vast available federal land near major load centers like Las Vegas and Reno.

This geographic advantage has enabled large solar farms with co-located batteries that achieve significant economies of scale. (It also creates significant risk going forward given the Trump administration's recent policy changes favoring older energy industries.)

Nevada's transformation from coal state to solar and storage leader has also been driven by some of the smartest, most supportive clean energy policies in the country.

In 2019, Nevada's legislature increased the state's renewable portfolio standard (RPS), jumping from 25% to 50% by 2030, with a goal to be 100% carbon-neutral by 2050. The utility NV Energy responded immediately with an ambitious plan to add 1,200 MW of solar and 590 MW of battery storage by 2023.

The law also included provisions discouraging fossil fuels, prohibiting new coal, and limiting gas expansion. This effectively nudged the utility to use batteries for reliability instead of the gas peakers that utilities have traditionally relied on.

Another key driver is Nevada's opportunity to export power to California. Developers can store surplus solar generation and export it across state lines during evening hours when California prices are high.

As part of the Western Energy Imbalance Market, Nevada has seen multiple days where evening power prices in California spiked above $1,000 megawatts an hour — creating lucrative opportunities for battery discharge.

Lessons learned from the Silver State's Solar Boom

Nevada generated just under 30% of its electricity from utility-scale solar in 2024—three times the U.S. average. No state has a higher solar penetration rate, not even California.

Chart Source: Cleanview's market intelligence platform

And its success scaling solar and storage provides reasons for optimism. Nevada's emergence as a battery storage leader follows a familiar pattern in America's energy transition. In the early 2010s, Iowa and Texas pioneered utility-scale wind development thanks to exceptional resources and supportive policies. A few years later, California and North Carolina led the country's initial solar boom.

Today, Nevada is playing that same pioneering role for battery storage. Its combination of high solar penetration, perfect geography, and smart policy frameworks has made it an early adopter of a technology that will soon become ubiquitous.

Nevada won't be the last storage success story. Just as wind spread from Iowa and Texas to Oklahoma and Kansas, and solar expanded beyond California to states like Arizona and Florida, battery storage will likely proliferate across the country. Nevada is simply an early adopter of a technology that is quickly becoming essential to America's clean energy future.

The giants of green hydrogen The global map of green hydrogen is best understood by looking at concrete projects with confirmed investments and defined capacity.","Europe, China, the United States, and the Gulf are competing with subsidies and megaprojects. Behind climate discourse lies a struggle for energy hegemony and the promise of a new industry that can become a lever of sovereignty or an extractive mirage.

Green hydrogen has ceased to be a laboratory concept and has become the centerpiece of the global energy transition. The International Renewable Energy Agency projects more than USD 240 billion in investments by 2030 and estimates that demand could reach 100 million tons per year by the same horizon. The figures are staggering and the competition is already underway.

The United States subsidizes each kilo with up to USD 3 through the Inflation Reduction Act. Germany pays up to USD 5.5 through the H2Global program. China controls 40% of the worlds electrolysis capacity and is launching massive projects in Inner Mongolia. Saudi Arabia is developing NEOM, an USD 8.4 billion complex set to produce 600 tons per day of green hydrogen in 2026. Latin America is trying to ride this wave with Chile, Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina deploying their own strategies.

The energy map is being reconfigured in real time. What is at stake is not only how to replace fossil fuels, but who will control the value chains, who will emerge as an exporter of clean energy, and who will be reduced to a supplier of raw materials. The green hydrogen race is climatic, technological, and geopolitical. The next five years will decide whether the planet moves toward a just transition or toward a global mirage painted green.

Europe and its climate obsession

Europe has decided that green hydrogen will be the heart of its climate and energy security strategy. The European Commission has set a goal of producing 10 million tons per year of renewable hydrogen by 2030 and importing another 10 million from Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. Brussels understands that it is not enough to electrify easy sectors such as urban mobility. The challenge is to decarbonize steel, cement, fertilizers, and maritime and air transport. For that, green hydrogen appears as the indispensable tool.

The European plan rests on massive subsidies. Germany leads with the H2Global program that offers up to USD 5.5 per kilo of hydrogen or derivatives and secures long-term purchase contracts that reduce financial risk. Spain announced more than EUR 10 billion in incentives for renewable hydrogen projects, and France committed another EUR 9 billion through 2030. The European Union also launched the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance, channeling community funds to companies such as Air Liquide, Siemens, and Thyssenkrupp.

Projects are no longer just models. In the Netherlands, the NortH2 consortium led by Shell, RWE, and Equinor plans to install 10 GW of electrolysis by 2040 with an initial 1 GW phase operational in 2027. In Spain, the Puertollano plant is under construction and will produce 3,000 tons per year of green hydrogen with an investment of EUR 150 million. In Portugal, the Sines project aims to turn the country into an export hub for northern Europe.

The bet is clear. Europe seeks to reduce its dependence on Russian gas, meet its climate commitments, and at the same time consolidate a new clean heavy industry. The risk is that demand will grow faster than supply and that dependency will shift from Moscow to Rabat, Riyadh, or Santiago. Europe wants energy autonomy but may end up importing yet another dependency painted green.

The United States and the IRA

The United States has burst into the green hydrogen race with one of the most ambitious climate policies in its history. The Inflation Reduction Act, approved in 2022, allocated USD 369 billion to clean energy and placed hydrogen at the center of the strategy. Every kilo of green hydrogen produced on U.S. soil receives up to USD 3 in direct subsidies. The effect was immediate. In less than two years, dozens of projects have been announced with investment commitments exceeding USD 40 billion.

The Department of Energy selected seven development poles in 2023, known as Hydrogen Hubs. Texas, California, the East Coast, and the Midwest lead this network. These hubs aim to decarbonize heavy sectors such as steel, fertilizers, and long-distance transport. The first plants will come online between 2026 and 2027 and already have supply contracts under negotiation.

The strategy seeks more than emissions reduction. Washington wants to displace China in the manufacture of electrolyzers and in the technological value chain. Green hydrogen is for the United States a climate tool, but above all an industrial and geopolitical one. The race to dominate it is being played out both in the market and in the factory.

China and Asia

China is today the worlds largest producer of hydrogen with more than 60% of global output, though most still comes from coal. Beijing has decided to change that matrix and lead the transition to green hydrogen. The country controls 40% of global electrolyzer capacity and its manufacturers offer equipment up to 30% cheaper than in the West.

The five-year plan includes more than 200 projects at different stages. Among them is the Ordos cluster in Inner Mongolia, which will add more than 1 GW of electrolysis before 2028. The state oil company Sinopec announced a USD 2.9 billion complex in Ulanqab that will produce 100,000 tons per year of green hydrogen. Altogether China has committed more than USD 33 billion to renewable hydrogen by 2030.

The strategy goes beyond production. China wants to dominate the entire value chain. Controlling the manufacturing of electrolyzers, fuel cells, and turbines ensures a privileged position vis--vis Europe and the United States. Japan and South Korea are advancing in parallel with projects for maritime transport, power generation, and ammonia exports. Asia as a whole understands that green hydrogen is not only clean energy but also an industrial and technological battleground.

The Middle East and Africa

The Persian Gulf seeks to convert its oil rents into renewable hegemony. Saudi Arabia leads the offensive with the NEOM megaproject, an USD 8.4 billion investment that will begin producing 600 tons per day of green hydrogen in 2026. The complex is designed to export green ammonia to Europe and Asia and to become the largest in the world. The United Arab Emirates is developing projects in Dubai and Abu Dhabi worth over USD 2 billion, linked to airlines and shipping companies seeking to decarbonize their supply chains.

Africa is also emerging as a key stage. Morocco plans to install 6 GW of electrolysis capacity before 2035 with European financing. Namibia signed agreements worth more than USD 10 billion for the Hyphen project, which should produce 300,000 tons per year of green hydrogen starting in 2027. Egypt is advancing in the Suez Canal area with USD 12 billion in investments to build export hubs to the Mediterranean.

The appeal lies in abundant sun and wind, but the risk is repeating colonial schemes. Europe is already negotiating long-term import contracts to secure part of the 10 million tons per year it wants to source from outside its territory by 2030. The problem is that local industrialization is advancing slowly. Without electrolyzer factories or their own value chains, Africa may become a cheap supplier while profits concentrate in the North.

Latin America

Latin America is seeking a place in the global green hydrogen race. Chile is the most advanced, with more than 70 projects at different stages and a projected investment portfolio close to USD 100 billion by 2030. The official goal is to produce 1 million tons per year of green hydrogen, mainly in Magallanes and Antofagasta. Companies such as HIF Global, Engie, and Enaex are leading initiatives to export e-fuels to Europe and Asia.

Brazil is betting on greater scale. In the ports of Pecm and Suape, potential investments exceed USD 200 billion by 2040. The country seeks to become an export hub thanks to abundant solar and wind resources. Several projects exceed 10 GW of electrolysis in planning and memorandums of understanding have already been signed with German and Japanese companies.

Colombia is moving forward with a goal of 3 GW of electrolysis by 2030 and export projections from the Caribbean coast. The government expects to attract more than USD 5 billion in private investment. Argentina, though lagging, is pushing pilots in Patagonia with an eye on exports to Europe and Asia.

The regional dilemma is clear. Countries have unique natural conditions, but the risk is repeating the history of copper, oil, or lithium. Exporting green hydrogen as a raw material without developing domestic industry could leave Latin America in a peripheral role. The alternative is to create local value chains that generate jobs, manufacturing, and technological sovereignty before export contracts define a path of no return.

Global risks

The green hydrogen race does not only bring opportunities. It also exposes deep risks that could transform the promise into a mirage. The first is the asymmetry between North and South. The United States and Germany subsidize, while countries like Chile or Colombia barely offer limited tax credits. That financing gap could leave much of the planet out of the competition.

Arisk is greenwashing. Not all hydrogen promoted as green really is. The lack of strict certification allows fossil electricity to be mixed into production. The International Energy Agency estimates that nearly 60% of the worlds hydrogen is still gray. Without clear rules, the credibility of the transition is at stake.

Infrastructure is another critical point. To reach the 2030 targets, the world will need more than 300,000 km of adapted pipelines and dozens of specialized ports to move hydrogen and derivatives such as ammonia and methanol. These investments exceed USD 500 billion and still lack secured financing.

Finally there is the geopolitical risk. Control of the value chain will determine new dependencies. If production is concentrated in a few countries and manufacturing in Asia, green hydrogen could cement an unequal map similar to oil. The energy transition could be born marked by the same tensions it sought to overcome.

Projects setting the global pace

Green hydrogen is no longer just a PowerPoint announcement. Across regions, there are projects producing at pilot scale and others entering mass operation within the next five years. The most emblematic is NEOM in Saudi Arabia, with an USD 8.4 billion investment and the capacity to generate 600 tons per day of green hydrogen from 2026. It will be the worlds largest complex and will export green ammonia to Europe and Asia.

Europe: NortH2 in the Netherlands and the North Sea, backed by Shell, RWE, and Equinor. The goal is 10 GW of electrolysis by 2040, with a first 1 GW phase in 2027. Germany is advancing with H2Global, which secures long-term contracts and subsidies of up to USD 5.5 per kilo.

United States: Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs, seven poles from Texas to California, already have over USD 40 billion in committed investments. The first plants will operate between 2026 and 2027.

China: Ordos cluster with more than 1 GW before 2028 and USD 33 billion committed in projects through 2030. Sinopecs Ulanqab complex alone requires USD 2.9 billion and will produce 100,000 tons per year.

Brazil: Pecm and Suape ports project more than USD 200 billion in investments by 2040, with planning goals exceeding 10 GW.

Namibia: Hyphen project, USD 10 billion, projected 300,000 tons per year starting in 2027.

The projects set the pulse of green hydrogen. They are not trials but industrial bets at continental scale. Their success or failure will determine whether green hydrogen ceases to be a promise and becomes a global energy reality.

The giants of green hydrogen

The global map of green hydrogen is best understood by looking at concrete projects with confirmed investments and defined capacity. These are not vague announcements but figures showing where the energy race is truly being played.

NEOM, Saudi Arabia: USD 8.4 billion investment, 600 tons per day of green hydrogen from 2026

NortH2, Netherlands: Target of 10 GW of electrolysis by 2040, 1 GW operational in 2027

Hydrogen Hubs, United States: 7 hubs with over USD 40 billion in investments, first plants in 2026 with initial capacity in the hundreds of thousands of tons per year

Sinopec Ulanqab, China: USD 2.9 billion investment, 100,000 tons per year of green hydrogen by 2028

China global commitment: More than USD 33 billion by 2030, over 200 projects at various stages

Brazil, Pecm and Suape: Projections of more than USD 200 billion by 2040, with planning targets exceeding 10 GW

Namibia, Hyphen: USD 10 billion, 300,000 tons per year projected from 2027

These projects mark the rhythm of green hydrogen. They are not experiments but industrial-scale bets. On their success or failure depends whether green hydrogen becomes a real global energy alternative.

Final reflections

Green hydrogen has become the planets new energy frontier. Europe, the United States, China, the Gulf, and Latin America are running with billions of dollars and promises of millions of tons per year. The official narrative presents it as the key to meeting climate targets and decarbonizing sectors impossible to electrify with traditional renewables.

But behind the figures lie open questions. Will green hydrogen be a driver of energy sovereignty or a new global dependency? Will it be a lever to create industry and jobs, or will the pattern repeat of exporting raw materials while buying expensive technology? The decade 20252035 will mark whether the world builds a just transition or whether the green mirage becomes another bubble inflated by subsidies.

Green hydrogen could be the lever that frees the planet from fossil fuels. It could also be just another mirage in the desert of unfulfilled promises. Everything will depend on how projects are executed, on the capacity to include regions and communities, and on whether the great powers understand that the future is measured not only in gigawatts or tons, but in justice, sovereignty, and shared dignity.

Europe, China, the United States, and the Gulf are competing with subsidies and megaprojects. Behind climate discourse lies a struggle for energy hegemony and the promise of a new industry that can become a lever of sovereignty or an extractive mirage.

Green hydrogen has ceased to be a laboratory concept and has become the centerpiece of the global energy transition. The International Renewable Energy Agency projects more than USD 240 billion in investments by 2030 and estimates that demand could reach 100 million tons per year by the same horizon. The figures are staggering and the competition is already underway.

The United States subsidizes each kilo with up to USD 3 through the Inflation Reduction Act. Germany pays up to USD 5.5 through the H2Global program. China controls 40% of the worlds electrolysis capacity and is launching massive projects in Inner Mongolia. Saudi Arabia is developing NEOM, an USD 8.4 billion complex set to produce 600 tons per day of green hydrogen in 2026. Latin America is trying to ride this wave with Chile, Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina deploying their own strategies.

The energy map is being reconfigured in real time. What is at stake is not only how to replace fossil fuels, but who will control the value chains, who will emerge as an exporter of clean energy, and who will be reduced to a supplier of raw materials. The green hydrogen race is climatic, technological, and geopolitical. The next five years will decide whether the planet moves toward a just transition or toward a global mirage painted green.

Europe and its climate obsession

Europe has decided that green hydrogen will be the heart of its climate and energy security strategy. The European Commission has set a goal of producing 10 million tons per year of renewable hydrogen by 2030 and importing another 10 million from Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. Brussels understands that it is not enough to electrify easy sectors such as urban mobility. The challenge is to decarbonize steel, cement, fertilizers, and maritime and air transport. For that, green hydrogen appears as the indispensable tool.

The European plan rests on massive subsidies. Germany leads with the H2Global program that offers up to USD 5.5 per kilo of hydrogen or derivatives and secures long-term purchase contracts that reduce financial risk. Spain announced more than EUR 10 billion in incentives for renewable hydrogen projects, and France committed another EUR 9 billion through 2030. The European Union also launched the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance, channeling community funds to companies such as Air Liquide, Siemens, and Thyssenkrupp.

Projects are no longer just models. In the Netherlands, the NortH2 consortium led by Shell, RWE, and Equinor plans to install 10 GW of electrolysis by 2040 with an initial 1 GW phase operational in 2027. In Spain, the Puertollano plant is under construction and will produce 3,000 tons per year of green hydrogen with an investment of EUR 150 million. In Portugal, the Sines project aims to turn the country into an export hub for northern Europe.

The bet is clear. Europe seeks to reduce its dependence on Russian gas, meet its climate commitments, and at the same time consolidate a new clean heavy industry. The risk is that demand will grow faster than supply and that dependency will shift from Moscow to Rabat, Riyadh, or Santiago. Europe wants energy autonomy but may end up importing yet another dependency painted green.

The United States and the IRA

The United States has burst into the green hydrogen race with one of the most ambitious climate policies in its history. The Inflation Reduction Act, approved in 2022, allocated USD 369 billion to clean energy and placed hydrogen at the center of the strategy. Every kilo of green hydrogen produced on U.S. soil receives up to USD 3 in direct subsidies. The effect was immediate. In less than two years, dozens of projects have been announced with investment commitments exceeding USD 40 billion.

The Department of Energy selected seven development poles in 2023, known as Hydrogen Hubs. Texas, California, the East Coast, and the Midwest lead this network. These hubs aim to decarbonize heavy sectors such as steel, fertilizers, and long-distance transport. The first plants will come online between 2026 and 2027 and already have supply contracts under negotiation.

The strategy seeks more than emissions reduction. Washington wants to displace China in the manufacture of electrolyzers and in the technological value chain. Green hydrogen is for the United States a climate tool, but above all an industrial and geopolitical one. The race to dominate it is being played out both in the market and in the factory.

China and Asia

China is today the worlds largest producer of hydrogen with more than 60% of global output, though most still comes from coal. Beijing has decided to change that matrix and lead the transition to green hydrogen. The country controls 40% of global electrolyzer capacity and its manufacturers offer equipment up to 30% cheaper than in the West.

The five-year plan includes more than 200 projects at different stages. Among them is the Ordos cluster in Inner Mongolia, which will add more than 1 GW of electrolysis before 2028. The state oil company Sinopec announced a USD 2.9 billion complex in Ulanqab that will produce 100,000 tons per year of green hydrogen. Altogether China has committed more than USD 33 billion to renewable hydrogen by 2030.

The strategy goes beyond production. China wants to dominate the entire value chain. Controlling the manufacturing of electrolyzers, fuel cells, and turbines ensures a privileged position vis--vis Europe and the United States. Japan and South Korea are advancing in parallel with projects for maritime transport, power generation, and ammonia exports. Asia as a whole understands that green hydrogen is not only clean energy but also an industrial and technological battleground.

The Middle East and Africa

The Persian Gulf seeks to convert its oil rents into renewable hegemony. Saudi Arabia leads the offensive with the NEOM megaproject, an USD 8.4 billion investment that will begin producing 600 tons per day of green hydrogen in 2026. The complex is designed to export green ammonia to Europe and Asia and to become the largest in the world. The United Arab Emirates is developing projects in Dubai and Abu Dhabi worth over USD 2 billion, linked to airlines and shipping companies seeking to decarbonize their supply chains.

Africa is also emerging as a key stage. Morocco plans to install 6 GW of electrolysis capacity before 2035 with European financing. Namibia signed agreements worth more than USD 10 billion for the Hyphen project, which should produce 300,000 tons per year of green hydrogen starting in 2027. Egypt is advancing in the Suez Canal area with USD 12 billion in investments to build export hubs to the Mediterranean.

The appeal lies in abundant sun and wind, but the risk is repeating colonial schemes. Europe is already negotiating long-term import contracts to secure part of the 10 million tons per year it wants to source from outside its territory by 2030. The problem is that local industrialization is advancing slowly. Without electrolyzer factories or their own value chains, Africa may become a cheap supplier while profits concentrate in the North.

Latin America

Latin America is seeking a place in the global green hydrogen race. Chile is the most advanced, with more than 70 projects at different stages and a projected investment portfolio close to USD 100 billion by 2030. The official goal is to produce 1 million tons per year of green hydrogen, mainly in Magallanes and Antofagasta. Companies such as HIF Global, Engie, and Enaex are leading initiatives to export e-fuels to Europe and Asia.

Brazil is betting on greater scale. In the ports of Pecm and Suape, potential investments exceed USD 200 billion by 2040. The country seeks to become an export hub thanks to abundant solar and wind resources. Several projects exceed 10 GW of electrolysis in planning and memorandums of understanding have already been signed with German and Japanese companies.

Colombia is moving forward with a goal of 3 GW of electrolysis by 2030 and export projections from the Caribbean coast. The government expects to attract more than USD 5 billion in private investment. Argentina, though lagging, is pushing pilots in Patagonia with an eye on exports to Europe and Asia.

The regional dilemma is clear. Countries have unique natural conditions, but the risk is repeating the history of copper, oil, or lithium. Exporting green hydrogen as a raw material without developing domestic industry could leave Latin America in a peripheral role. The alternative is to create local value chains that generate jobs, manufacturing, and technological sovereignty before export contracts define a path of no return.

Global risks

The green hydrogen race does not only bring opportunities. It also exposes deep risks that could transform the promise into a mirage. The first is the asymmetry between North and South. The United States and Germany subsidize, while countries like Chile or Colombia barely offer limited tax credits. That financing gap could leave much of the planet out of the competition.

Arisk is greenwashing. Not all hydrogen promoted as green really is. The lack of strict certification allows fossil electricity to be mixed into production. The International Energy Agency estimates that nearly 60% of the worlds hydrogen is still gray. Without clear rules, the credibility of the transition is at stake.

Infrastructure is another critical point. To reach the 2030 targets, the world will need more than 300,000 km of adapted pipelines and dozens of specialized ports to move hydrogen and derivatives such as ammonia and methanol. These investments exceed USD 500 billion and still lack secured financing.

Finally there is the geopolitical risk. Control of the value chain will determine new dependencies. If production is concentrated in a few countries and manufacturing in Asia, green hydrogen could cement an unequal map similar to oil. The energy transition could be born marked by the same tensions it sought to overcome.

Projects setting the global pace

Green hydrogen is no longer just a PowerPoint announcement. Across regions, there are projects producing at pilot scale and others entering mass operation within the next five years. The most emblematic is NEOM in Saudi Arabia, with an USD 8.4 billion investment and the capacity to generate 600 tons per day of green hydrogen from 2026.

A coastal site that provides about one third of the UK's gas supply is ""ideally placed to be a carbon capture hub"", according to the region's energy group.

Kevin Keable, chair of East of England Energy Group, said Bacton Gas Terminal in Norfolk also had the potential to manufacture hydrogen as an alternative fuel to gas.

The same reservoirs that supply natural gas from below the North Sea could be used to store excess carbon dioxide (CO2) in a bid to reduce emissions.

""For net zero to happen, we need to capture that carbon and store it,"" said Mr Keable.

In October, the government pledged nearly £22bn for projects to capture and store CO2 - a process known as CCS.

But environmental groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth are concerned CCS could just prolong the burning of fossil fuels, which contribute to global warming.

Jonathan White is general manager of Perenco, which operates one of Bacton's terminals. He also co-leads the Poseidon Project which plans to pipe unwanted CO2 into the Leman gas field off the Suffolk coast.

""Some of the UK's carbon emissions come from burning gas and fossil fuels, as well as industrial processes – such as cement factories, sugar factories, waste incineration.

""If that can be captured and sent offshore to the same fields, then that's really good for the environment,"" said Mr White.

He said Bacton was well-placed to set up a CCS system.

""The expertise we have of gas is somewhat transferable. We have a very skilled workforce that knows how to work in a difficult offshore environment.""

He said Perenco had not developed facilities to capture carbon, but had run tests pumping 4,000 tonnes of liquid CO2 into the Poseidon site.

""Perenco proved the tech and pumped carbon away in some vast quantities – it is definitely achievable,"" said Mr Keable.

Critics of CCS, such as Greenpeace, say it only ""extends the life of planet-heating oil and gas production"".

There are concerns it will not scale up in time to make a dent in carbon emissions, which scientists say must dramatically reduce to avoid the worst effects of climate change.

Globally, more than 35 billion tonnes of carbon are emitted each year, but only 50 million tonnes are currently captured by about 45 CCS sites, according to the International Energy Agency.

Meanwhile, Mr Keable said, Bacton could be producing hydrogen by 2030.

Hydrogen does not give off greenhouse gases when it is used, but producing the fuel can involve burning gas - known as ""blue hydrogen"".

However ""green hydrogen"" can also be created using surplus wind or solar energy

""Green hydrogen is the future,"" said Mr Keable.

""For today we're talking about blue hydrogen from gas and green hydrogen from wind farms, using electricity.

""Bacton could become the UK's new energy gateway, storing carbon, producing hydrogen and securing local business and jobs for decades, whilst tackling climate change.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3ac0/live/b1ee1200-957f-11f0-bf42-45e64f25c5d0.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 13:03:02.777636

Enbridge officials have countered that the Line 5 pipeline in the Straits has always remained safe and cite recurring inspections by the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA, affirming its contention.
The tunnel pipeline would replace the twin pipes currently on the Straits bottom.","The U.S. Justice Dept. has filed a ""statement of interest"" in Enbridge's lawsuit against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer over attempts to revoke Enbridge's easement to operate Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac.

The Justice Dept. is siding with Enbridge's contentions that Michigan's attempts to revoke its Line 5 easement interfere with federal regulation of pipelines, and U.S.-Canadian treaties.

President Donald Trump's Justice Department has intervened — and taken the side of Canadian oil and gas transport giant Enbridge — in Enbridge's federal lawsuit attempting to stop Gov. Gretchen Whitmer from revoking the company's 72-year-old easement to operate the Line 5 underwater oil and gas pipelines on the Straits of Mackinac lake bottom.

The U.S. Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division and Civil Division announced its filing of a ""statement of interest"" in a lawsuit filed by Enbridge against Whitmer and Michigan Department of Natural Resources Director Scott Bowen in U.S. District Court in Lansing.

The Justice Department is agreeing with Enbridge's assertion in the suit that the Michigan action improperly attempts to override federal authority on interstate pipeline regulation, and federal foreign affairs authority as the pipeline from Alberta, Canada, is subject to U.S.-Canadian treaties.

""The federal government already comprehensively regulates pipeline safety, but Michigan is trying to usurp the Department of Transportation's statutory authority,"" Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson said in a statement.

""President Trump has made clear that the United States will not tolerate state overreach that interferes with American energy dominance.""

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel's Office did not immediately respond to a Free Press request for comment.

Enbridge spokesman Michael Barnes, in an emailed statement to the Free Press, noted the 1977 Transit Pipelines Treaty between the United States and Canada ""expressly prevents public authorities such as the State of Michigan and courts from unilaterally shutting down the pipeline.""

""We will continue to protect and defend Line 5's continued operations consistent with federal law, interstate commerce, and international treaty agreements, all of which recognize the critical role Line 5 plays in providing for the region's energy needs and its economic strength,"" he said.

Built in 1953, Enbridge's Line 5 moves 23 million gallons of oil and natural gas liquids per day east through the Upper Peninsula, splitting into twin underwater pipelines on the Straits of Mackinac bottom, before returning to a single transmission pipeline through the Lower Peninsula that runs south to Sarnia, Ontario. Many have expressed concern about the aging pipes over several years, as anchor strikes, missing pipeline supports and loss of protective pipeline coating have been discovered.

A 30-inch oil transmission line also owned by Enbridge ruptured in July 2010 in Marshall, spilling more than 1.1 million gallons of oil, fouling 38 miles of the Kalamazoo River and prompting a cleanup that took four years and more than $1 billion. Many fear a similar pipeline mishap on the Straits bottom, where Great Lakes Michigan and Huron meet, would be greatly more devastating.

Whitmer in November 2020 announced her intention to revoke Enbridge's 1953 easement with the state to use state-controlled Great Lakes bottomlands for the Straits pipeline. Whitmer's office at the time cited Enbridge's ""persistent and incurable violations of the easement’s terms and conditions"" related to safety and maintenance.

""Enbridge has routinely refused to take action to protect our Great Lakes and the millions of Americans who depend on them for clean drinking water and good jobs,"" Whitmer said at the time. ""They have repeatedly violated the terms of the 1953 easement by ignoring structural problems that put our Great Lakes and our families at risk.""

Enbridge officials have countered that the Line 5 pipeline in the Straits has always remained safe and cite recurring inspections by the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA, affirming its contention.

In its filing, the Justice Department notes that the federal government took ""decisive action"" in three environmental events described in Whitmer's notice to revoke the Enbridge easement, including an April 2018 anchor strike that dented the outer Straits pipelines and the discovery of significant damage to a pipeline support in June 2020. Following the 2018 anchor strike, Congress amended federal pipeline safety laws, and PHMSA issued an interim final rule to protect the Great Lakes and connecting waters, the Justice Department's filing states.

""By revisiting these same incidents to impose different standards and different results, Michigan is not only thwarting Congressional intent to promote a nationally uniform safety program but also is creating an unworkable patchwork of state standards for interim pipelines,"" the Justice Department states in its court filing.

The Justice Department filing also declares the Michigan action infringes upon ""significant interests of the United States in its conduct of foreign affairs,"" adding the United States has a significant interest in an ""affordable and reliable domestic supply of energy"" that the state easement revocation attempt threatens.

Enbridge proposes to build a 21-foot diameter, 3.6-mile tunnel underneath the bed of the Straits of Mackinac to house a new, 30-inch diameter pipeline to move the oil and natural gas liquids. The tunnel pipeline would replace the twin pipes currently on the Straits bottom.

Michigan Supreme Court allows tribes to appeal MPSC approval of Line 5 tunnel

In other litigation related to Line 5, on Friday, Sept. 19, the Michigan Supreme Court granted an appeal by multiple Michigan Native American tribes and nonprofit environmental groups to challenge the Michigan Public Service Commission's approval of the Line 5 tunnel.

The Supreme Court is allowing a review of whether the state Court of Appeals erred in providing weight to earlier lower court rulings rather than considering on its own whether the proposed tunnel ""will pollute, impair, or destroy the air, water or state's other natural resources or the public trust in these resources."" The high court will also consider whether the MPSC should have excluded ""evidence of the history and risk of oil spills along the entire length of Line 5"" as it approved the tunnel.

“The tunnel project and the dual pipelines are just two versions of one terrible idea that threatens to destroy our clean water, our fishing, and our way of life for the sake of Canadian profits,” said Bay Mills Indian Community President Whitney Gravelle. “Our choice is not between the dual pipelines and the tunnel. Our choice is between an oil spill in the Great Lakes and a clean water future for our children and grandchildren to enjoy. We simply want government officials to consider the safest, cheapest, and most commonsense alternative: Decommission Line 5.”

Barnes said a tunnel allowing for a new oil and gas pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac ""makes what has always been a safe pipeline even safer.""

In fact, the majority of America’s nuclear power plants were built between 1970 and 1990.

As our state, America, and the world grapple with how to produce enough power to keep up with AI data center demand and keep the lights on (and affordable!), more people are talking about a “nuclear renaissance.” But what does that mean?

Nuclear power provides about 19 percent of our nation’s electricity – a little less than the 21 percent we now get from renewable sources, including solar. Until Georgia Power’s Units 3 and 4 at Plant Vogtle were completed, no new nuclear had been constructed in the US in decades. In fact, the majority of America’s nuclear power plants were built between 1970 and 1990. I’ve been inside a few of them, and as you might imagine of 50-year-old infrastructure, the interiors look a lot like your grandmother’s kitchen.

The merger of the energy and technology sectors, however, is driving a nuclear renaissance. Rising demand from AI data centers not only means that America needs more power than we have today, we need denser sources of power that can generate more megawatts on less land. Pairing energy-dense resources like nuclear with large loads like AI data centers may be one way to power our future without gobbling up forests and farmland – so long as we maintain our commitment to public health, safety, and environmental quality.

The nuclear power plants of the future won’t all look like Plant Vogle’s enormous cooling towers. Emerging technologies like Small Modular Reactors (or SMRs) are the size of a football field, and advanced technologies like those used by nuclear start-ups Kairos and Oklo have an even smaller footprint.

While nuclear’s energy-dense, reliable clean power is a good match to America’s surging energy demand, it doesn’t come cheap. The first-of-its-kind of any new technology is more expensive, even though costs come down with each new implementation. So who will pay for it?

Increasingly, the same tech titans that need enormous energy resources for their AI data centers are stepping up to bear the costs. Google, for example, has partnered with Kairos to build a new nuclear facility in the Tennessee Valley. Microsoft is signing purchase agreements to help bring additional nuclear power online. And the Clean Energy Buyers Association, whose membership includes the biggest energy users in the world, has become an influential advocate for nuclear energy. Tech titans and other big energy users paying their fair share is one way to keep energy affordable for American families.

There’s one more aspect of a nuclear renaissance that’s important to note: The jobs. If America leads, it will create abundant opportunities for engineers, nuclear operators, electricians, the craft trades, manufacturing, and more. And that’s the other thing that stood out when I toured some of our region’s nuclear facilities – the excitement of the young men and women who worked there about being on the frontier of Made in America energy innovation.",https://www.lagrangenews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/37/2025/07/lagrange-logo-lg.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 11:00:14.496949

It was a dramatized, Gilded Age-type demonstration of Trump’s AI Action Plan, which grants Big Tech the unfettered ability to expand AI infrastructure.

Announced in July 2025, Trump’s AI plan aims to accelerate the construction of data centers by bypassing public protections, environmental laws, and critical oversight. This push for federal deregulation is a direct response to more and more local communities fighting back to unveil who actually benefits from these massive investments — and who is being sold out in the process. Data centers powering AI require an enormous amount of water and energy. A single data center can consume up to 5 million gallons of drinking water per day. A data center campus using one gigawatt of electric power annually would use more power in a year than consumers use in Alaska, Rhode Island, or Vermont. As tech companies scramble to build data centers in the relentless “AI race,” they are creating infrastructure that will lock us into burning fossil fuels for decades. They are seeking a future where we have to compete with corporations for drinking water and subsidize Big Tech’s energy costs with our own wallets due to increased utility bills.

In their search for cheap land, cheap energy, and cities and towns that have been structurally disempowered, Big Tech has descended upon the South. Google, Meta, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon have committed over $200 billion to build medium and large data centers in North Carolina, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia, Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama, and Tennessee. As the South becomes the new epicenter of data center growth, it is becoming increasingly clear that Big Tech is following Big Oil’s footsteps, compounding the harms of decades of environmental racism in the South.

Elon Musk’s $12 billion artificial intelligence company, xAI, is poisoning Black communities in Memphis, Tennessee. Musk’s supercomputer, Colossus, sits a few miles from Boxtown, where nearly half of the residents have an annual household income below $25,000 and the cancer rates are four times the national average. According to the Southern Environmental Law Center, the data center has been fueled by 35 unpermitted gas turbines that produce smog-forming pollution and harmful chemicals like formaldehyde. Peak nitrogen dioxide concentration levels have increased by 79 percent from pre-xAI levels in the areas immediately surrounding the data center. Nitrogen dioxide is linked to respiratory diseases. Memphis already leads Tennessee in emergency department visits for asthma and received an “F” from the American Lung Association for ozone pollution in 2025. Memphis resident KeShaun Pearson states, “We are breathing dirtier air, experiencing higher rates of asthma, and our children are spending more time in emergency rooms due to the misguided ambitions of billionaires who don’t see us as human.”

Similarly, Meta’s largest data center to date is being built in Richland Parish, Louisiana, where over a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line. Meta’s $10 billion complex will consume an unprecedented amount of energy from the state — approximately three times as much electricity as the entire city of New Orleans annually. According to the permit for the data center, it will directly emit 5,862 tons of CO2 annually, equal to the annual emissions of 1,108 homes in the U.S. Three new methane gas plants are being built just to power this one data center. Two of the power plants will be built in Richland Parish, while the third power plant will be built at an existing nuclear power plant site in the region known as “Cancer Alley.” Cancer Alley is an 85-mile stretch of land along the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, where Black and low-income communities have been getting sick and dying for decades due to emissions from over 200 petrochemical and fossil fuel plants in the area.

In South Carolina, power plants are being built in predominantly Black communities to keep up with data centers’ energy needs. In Mississippi, the state’s Public Service Commission unanimously approved a special contract to extend the life of a Mississippi Power coal unit, Plant Victor J. Daniel, to meet energy needs for a new data center project. This comes after the state government had ordered the utility company to phase out coal in 2020 due to its detrimental impacts on health and the environment. In 2022, Plant Victor J. Daniel reported more than 6 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, higher than any other facility in Mississippi, according to Grist. The plant has also been reported to be one of the nation’s top groundwater polluters, with excessive amounts of lithium, which is associated with neurological damage.

Big Tech has pushed rapid data center development forward through opaque and corrupt processes to avoid public scrutiny. Wanda Mosley, a resident of South Fulton, Georgia, told Truthout that the public processes related to data center development have been biased, saying, “They’re holding these town halls but they’re only having people who benefit from the data centers speaking at the town halls.”

In Georgia, county commissioners have been easing requirements for Project Sail, a data center which would use up to 6 million gallons of water per day — over a fifth of the entire county’s daily water allotment. Officials adopted new planning laws which were watered down by industry lobbyists and removed provisions that aimed to limit harmful environmental impacts and that would require special public hearings for proposed data centers. This was only revealed through a public records request that matched anonymous comments with emails.

Major project developers in the South have concealed key information from the public, including water and energy consumption, deals with local officials regarding tax breaks and other incentives, and even company names. Local politicians make backdoor deals with tech companies before the public has a chance to be fully informed of the harms and have a say in data centers entering their communities. Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, and South Carolina all provide major tax exemptions for data center companies. Louisiana’s GOP-controlled legislature fast-tracked Act 730 in 2024, granting data center companies 20-year tax exemptions, extendable to 30 years, for projects creating just 50 jobs and investing at least $200 million. The bill was championed by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry and corporate lobbyists, under the guise of economic development.

Big Tech promises thousands of jobs when data center projects are announced. However, in reality, data centers create very few permanent jobs. Even Microsoft admits that a data center can run with less than 50 technicians. According to a Business Insider analysis, “tax breaks given to developers can amount over time to more than $2 million for every permanent, full-time job at an operational data center.” Despite the widespread talking point that data centers bring jobs to local areas, half the states that provide tax subsidies for data centers do not actually require job creation. States that do only require a small number of jobs to be created. In Tennessee, only 15 jobs are required for data centers to qualify for tax breaks.

CNBC reports that states are forfeiting hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue to tech companies. Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, called this “a giant transfer of wealth from taxpayers to shareholders.” These tax breaks divert funds away from direct government expenditures in support of schools, tackling income inequality, investing in public transit, environmental remediation and other community needs. This affects marginalized communities the most, especially communities of color in the South. Georgia is projected to waive roughly $296 million in sales tax revenue this year for large data centers. This economic extraction through subsidies parallels the fossil fuel industry.

These subsidies extend beyond state tax breaks. In South Carolina, Dominion Energy will provide electricity to Google for multiple data centers at a discounted rate that amounts to less than half of what residential customers have to pay. Dominion has not disclosed how much electricity it is going to provide to Google data centers, saying the information is a protected trade secret. However, data centers in South Carolina will drive a whopping 65 to 70 percent of the state’s increased energy use, forcing consumers to pay more in utility bills. Jennifer Whitfield, senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, has stated, “The highest low-income energy burden is seen in the South, specifically in Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas.” Energy burden refers to the percentage of personal income needed to pay energy bills. Data centers will exacerbate this systemic inequity.

The South has long been a site of both corporate extraction and fierce political resistance. Continuing this legacy of resistance, data center opposition is increasingly strong across the South. A proposed $14.5 billion hyperscale data center in Bessemer, Alabama, has been paused after facing a united front of residents concerned with the data center’s local impact. The center would require 2 million gallons of water per day, or roughly the same amount of water as two thirds of the city’s population. In Warrenton, Virginia, residents voted out all town council members in the November 2024 election who supported Amazon’s proposed data center. In July 2025, the newly elected council voted to ban data centers from Warrenton. In Georgia, the Monroe County Board of Commissioners voted unanimously to deny a data center proposal that would rezone 900 acres of land after residents pushed back and said it posed environmental threats.

Mosley, the South Fulton resident, told Truthout:

They don’t understand what they have started. They don’t understand the coalition that we’re about to build, because all of us have high electricity bills. All of us have high water bills. And so, people who don’t normally rock together, oh, we about to rock together, and we are about to make some changes in Georgia.

It is critical that we pay attention to fights like these and stand in solidarity with the Black, brown and working-class communities being harmed by Big Tech and federal and state governments.

,Louisiana Environment,2025-09-20 12:23:27+00:00,American Press,Jim Beam column:Carbon capture gets major OK | American Press,Jim Beam,,,,,https://americanpress.com/2025/09/20/jim-beam-columncarbon-capture-gets-major-ok/,"Carbon capture is the technology that injects high-pressure carbon dioxide in a near liquid state into formations deep underground in order to protect the environment.
The newspaper said grassroots opposition has grown in some areas of conservative-leaning rural Louisiana where major storage operations are proposed.
The storage operation by the Sempra arm, Hackberry Carbon Sequestration, would allow the company to cut the carbon intensity of its nearby liquefied natural gas facility, Cameron LNG, in a remote corner of Cameron Parish.
Many carbon capture opponents find it hard to forget the Bayou Corne sinkhole first discovered on Aug. 3, 2012, that caused the collapse of a salt dome cavern in Assumption Parish.
However, like it or not, carbon capture appears to have become an accepted process.","Since Southwest Louisiana is considered to be this nation’s unofficial LNG capital, it should come as no surprise that Cameron LNG at Hackberry has received approval for the state’s first authorized carbon capture and storage well.

The Advocate reported that the order from the state Department of Energy and Natural Resources (DENR) comes more than a year and a half after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) granted DENR its authority to permit wells for the new technology.

Carbon capture is the technology that injects high-pressure carbon dioxide in a near liquid state into formations deep underground in order to protect the environment. The newspaper said grassroots opposition has grown in some areas of conservative-leaning rural Louisiana where major storage operations are proposed.

The authority issued by DENR was based on well drilling, seismic testing, computer modeling and other data. The new Class VI permit near Hackberry would allow an arm of Sempra Infrastructure to build a well that could pump up to 2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually for 20 years under Black Lake southwest of Lake Charles.

The project would create more than 200 construction jobs and up to 10 operating jobs. It will include a proposed well site, compression facility and a 9-mile pipeline routed along existing rights of way to minimize impact.

This project is among 33 being proposed statewide. While it is the first approval in Louisiana, a handful of approvals have been permitted nationwide.

The storage operation by the Sempra arm, Hackberry Carbon Sequestration, would allow the company to cut the carbon intensity of its nearby liquefied natural gas facility, Cameron LNG, in a remote corner of Cameron Parish.

Hackberry Carbon officials said the permit is an important milestone, but cautioned that the project still needs additional engineering, commercial agreements and other approvals before the company can seek state authority to inject CO2 underground.

State officials said the authorization to inject is more of an in-house permit that comes after drilling verifies well conditions are as expected. The CO2 would be stored approximately 5,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth’s surface in layers separated by impermeable shale rock.

The storage layers between the shale contain highly concentrated brine that isn’t suitable for drinking. The nearest freshwater aquifer stops at 1,090 feet underground. The company’s consultant said the concentrated area would be a mile or more from the nearest underground faults or oil and gas or other wells.

State officials said they are making sure measures are in place to protect taxpayers long-term and avoid the kind of liability Louisiana currently has with orphaned oil and gas wells.

DENR officials detailed ways that they and Hackberry will be able to track movement of the CO2 plume through the years, primarily through the seismic and microgravity testing. The agency noted this and other continued testing should catch something that doesn’t match the modeling.

Many carbon capture opponents find it hard to forget the Bayou Corne sinkhole first discovered on Aug. 3, 2012, that caused the collapse of a salt dome cavern in Assumption Parish. And they continue to express concerns about the new process.

The community science director for Healthy Gulf said DENR “is undertaking a new era of destruction of our waters and our coastal wetlands before fixing the hundreds of idle and broken oil wells in Black Lake or ensuring the drinking water for Sulphur.”

Scott Eustis added that at least 149 inactive or older oil and gas wells are within 2.5 miles of Black Lake and 259 active drinking wells north of the injection zone. He said the Hackberry company should have to plug those inactive wells, but the company’s application says they are far from the projected plume.

Industry groups counter that the new technology has a large economic impact.

David Cresson, president and chief executive officer of the Louisiana Chemical Association and the Louisiana Chemical Industry Alliance, said, “This landmark decision (approval of the permit) not only cements Louisiana’s role as a front-runner in carbon capture in the U.S., but also directly addresses the surging global demand for low to zero-carbon products.”

Legislators have offered landowners some protections but not as many as they wanted. However, like it or not, carbon capture appears to have become an accepted process. Let’s hope all the safety features have been checked and double-checked.",https://americanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/65/2025/09/CC-voisplanet.png,N,,2025-09-20 11:01:04.090727

Krishnamoorthi said that by staying in the wind/solar market, it could help the U.S. stay ahead in the global market.","President Donald Trump has made several industry and claimed it's .

Now, a congressman from Illinois is pushing back.

""The reason why electricity prices are going up is because that clean energy is not being allowed to come online, not that it exists,"" said Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi.

Krishnamoorthi stating that are ""driving up energy bills for Illinoisans"" and asked for more support with clean energy, not less.

""It doesn't make any sense to remove electricity or the supply of electricity from the grid. That is just a dumb policy. We need as much supply as possible to drive down prices,"" said Krishnamoorthi.

He said that energy demand is rising due to overall usage going up, and also because of data centers being built.

But, he said with Trump's insistence on stopping wind and solar energy projects, supply for that energy is not able to keep up.

And, Illinois families will bear the consequences, possibly seeing their energy bills go up by an average of $180 per year.

He also said this will impact the local economy by causing 20,000 to 30,000 people who work for wind/solar projects to lose their jobs.

""Think about your neighbors who are working on these projects...I can't tell you how many good paying union jobs, for instance, are related to the construction of these projects,"" said Krishnamoorthi. ""The loss of those jobs also hurt our local economy. So, in so many ways, he's [Trump] making the affordability crisis worse right now.""

Krishnamoorthi said that by staying in the wind/solar market, it could help the U.S. stay ahead in the global market.

""If we don't do these projects, we seed leadership to the Chinese Communist Party, which is trying to eat our lunch. They are trying to own the entire market for renewables around the world,"" said Krishnamoorthi. ""Now, we actually have a fighting chance of defeating them in this competition for renewables around the world because we're starting to develop our own technology. New indigenous supply chains are growing and emerging in the U.S., but they're unfortunately getting knee capped by the Trump administration's approach, which doesn't make any sense in the world.""

Trump has changed and lessened with the which Krishnamoorthi argues doesn't make sense, since fossil fuels also rely on help from the government.

""What I can say is that there are subsidies for fossil fuels that also exist that deprive the federal government of important revenues, because those interests are very powerful. So, let's just be honest about what is the true cost of fossil fuel exploration...if fossil fuel interests or anybody else, is allowed to successfully remove these tax credits, they may profit, but it's going to be at our expense,"" said Krishnamoorthi.

But he wants to be clear his stance is overall more energy on the grid.

""You don't have to be against having a home that's powered by natural gas or driving a car that uses gasoline to also be in favor of wind and solar and other types of energy coming online. If you have more of everything, then we have lower prices,"" said Krishnamoorthi.

“The U.S. energy storage market is experiencing robust growth, with installations up 57% year-to-date to 23.7 GWh,” Bernstein said.

ESS growth is “outpacing the growth in solar and wind capacity,” with demand driven by grid resilience needs amid rising electrification and AI. Key states fueling this surge include Texas, California, Arizona, and Northern Virginia.

By 2025, total U.S. ESS and EV battery demand is expected to reach 192 GWh, up 20% year-on-year. Bernstein forecasts ESS growth of 50% to 51 GWh, while EV battery demand will grow only 13%. “ESS is expected to account for 27% of the total which would be the highest ever,” the analysts wrote.

Trade tensions are reportedly reshaping the competitive landscape. “Current tariffs on Chinese ESS batteries are around 40% today and rising to 58% starting in 2026,” Bernstein noted, which could support U.S.-made batteries.

Korean manufacturers are said to be moving quickly: Bernstein notes that has already begun U.S. LFP production, with and SK On set to follow in 2026. also plans LFP cell output in Nevada.

Samsung SDI is seen as the most aggressive in shifting capacity, with “over half of SDI’s battery manufacturing capacity will be dedicated to ESS applications (20 GWh) by YE26.”

The firm added that LGES will have the largest U.S. ESS capacity at 30 GWh, though this is just 15% of its 215 GWh total.

Still, Bernstein warned that despite booming ESS demand, oversupply looms. “US battery manufacturing capacity is projected to rise significantly from 338GWh YE25 to 601 GWh by YE26, representing a robust 78% y-o-y increase.

The bill, in its current form, would create a surcharge on electric bills to incentivize battery storage developments, loosen state-level nuclear regulations, institute new energy efficiency requirements and more.

Many advocacy groups are hoping to get a major bill passed this year, but one influential lawmaker is beginning to hedge as lawmakers’ veto session approaches.

“This is still a work in progress,” Sen. Steve Stadelman, D-Caledonia, said at a Thursday subject matter hearing on the bill. “Should the bills come back before the Senate, we will have another subject matter on the legislation or we could craft a different proposal in another bill.”

Stadelman, who chairs the Senate Energy and Public Utilities, noted at the end of that hearing a final package could come “this fall or next spring.” He also said the committee will hold another hearing in early October.

House Bill 4116 contains the latest proposals, which are largely similar to legislation considered at the end of May, only with an updated timeline.

Nuclear power politics

In the latest round of negotiations, stakeholders have been largely focusing on the electricity demand created by data centers. These always-on, power-hungry facilities are a key aspect of Illinois’ economic development strategy, and the state has offered several data center companies tax incentives to locate here.

The data center industry has advocated for the use of increased nuclear energy to meet that demand.

Dan Diorio, head of state policy for the Data Center Coalition, pointed to a recent deal between Constellation Energy Corporation, the owner of Illinois’ nuclear power plants, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook. Starting next year, Meta will purchase “renewable energy attributes” from the nuclear facility in Clinton, providing the financial incentive to keep the plant open for two decades after state subsidies run out.

The industry is backing a proposal that would lift a state-level moratorium on new nuclear power stations.

“Data center companies are adding nuclear power to their energy portfolios because it’s carbon-free, scalable, safe and provides reliable base load power,” Diorio said.

But environmental advocates are wary of lifting the moratorium. Sierra Club Executive Director Jack Darin said he wanted the nuclear moratorium to be part of broader talks about data center regulations in the spring session.

“The other reason to maybe take a breath here is because of really significant changes that are happening to the federal regulatory oversight of the nuclear industry,” Darin said.

Earlier this year, President Donald Trump ordered sweeping changes at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission with the aim of quadrupling nuclear power capacity in the U.S. over the next 25 years.

The concept of lifting the moratorium has received bipartisan support, including from Gov. JB Pritzker, although the exact details would have to be ironed out in legislation.

Battery storage funding

The centerpiece of the proposed legislation is a new state funding mechanism to incentivize energy storage projects.

“Batteries can serve as an arbitrage mechanism, storing surplus energy during periods when electricity is ample and inexpensive and discharging it during high-priced peak periods,” Sarah Moskowitz, head of the consumer advocacy group Citizens Utility Board, said.

Moskowitz also said storage can help the grid maintain reliability by replacing or delaying the need for more expensive or slow-to-deploy energy generation.

“The sooner we invest in a solution, the sooner we can pull out of this cycle of record-breaking electricity price increases,” Stephanie Burgos-Veras, an organizer with the industry-backed Solar Powers Illinois campaign, said in a statement. “The most expensive path forward is to not pass anything in veto session.”

A May analysis from the Illinois Power Agency, which manages electricity purchasing in the state, found that adding 6 gigawatts of battery storage to the grid — the equivalent of several power plants worth of batteries — would reduce costs to consumers by about $2.70 per month in northern Illinois and about $7.50 in downstate Illinois.

Read more: Illinois bet on solar to meet its climate goals. Trump has the industry in his crosshairs.

The current proposal would incentivize battery storage in a similar way to renewable energy projects — by adding a surcharge to utility customer bills. This gives developers a financial guarantee that they can leverage to obtain private financing for the bulk of project costs.

Consumer advocates like Moskowitz are strongly in favor of this proposal. But some question cost savings claims.

“I think the IPA analysis assumptions were disingenuous to set up a narrative that this will save ratepayers money,” Sen. Sue Rezin, R-Morris, told Capitol News Illinois. “And that’s simply not true.”

Rezin advocated for cost caps to limit the amount of money charged to ratepayers if IPA procurements cost more than expected.

Others, notably industrial businesses and manufacturers, don’t want any surcharge on the bill. Instead, they propose requiring battery developers to get state-backed loans from the Illinois Finance Authority.

“This results in savings to them (battery storage developers) and savings to Illinois ratepayers and, more importantly, does not put another line item on the bill for Illinois consumers to pay for something,” Phillip Golden, chairman of Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers, said.

This proposal has sparked some dissent among Senate Democrats. Sen. Willie Preston, D-Chicago, earlier this month announced he was backing a proposal to use loans from the IFA as the finance vehicle for storage projects.

“Instead of soaking ratepayers for even more money, as some propose, the businesses that are going to reap the rewards should also take the risk,” Preston said in an early September statement.

Proponents of using a ratepayer surcharge say the model’s use in renewables is evidence that it can be successful. They also point to studies prepared for industry groups which found that more battery storage will save consumers money in the long run.

Is it really possible from a legal/constitutional perspective for the Trump administration to sell off public lands across the American West to the highest bidding developers and resource extractors as threatened?

MG Daly, Burlingame, CA

National parks, wildlife refuges, forests, and other public land is at risk of being sold and exploited by the Trump administration. This land is owned by the American people, yet the administration hopes to pass legislation to increase development, logging, mining, and sell our lands to private owners. President Trump’s secretary of the interior Doug Burgum stated that these resources are “national assets” and could be used to reduce national debt. And these projects aren’t new. When Trump was in office in 2017, he set into motion an executive order that aimed to reduce the size of monuments greater than 100,000 acres in size, claiming that it was “another egregious use of government power.” This was abolished in Biden's presidency, and many people challenged Trump’s reduction.

Recent news has reported that the Trump administration has already removed vital protection for two lands in order to increase mining for mineral production. Trump has also issued an executive order that plans to identify public lands that may have mineral deposits to increase mining there, no matter whether the land is protected or a national monument.

But is this legally possible? The Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) of 1976 outlines management and protection guidelines for the federal government for the purpose of enhancing public lands in federal ownership. It does permit the sale of land, but only under certain criteria such as public interest. Many Native American tribes and environmental activists argue that Trump’s actions go beyond the President's power and require congressional approval.

If we take a look at the Constitution, this rings true. In Article 4, it is stated that Congress, not the President “shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.” This essentially means that land sales largely require Congress to be involved.

Additionally, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to make an assessment of environmental impact prior to legal action. Despite these clear regulations being in place, the Trump administration can find loopholes. By reducing the power of conservation laws, proposing land sales to FLMPA, and changing the classification of certain lands to allow for private leasing, selling public land isn’t impossible.

If President Trump succeeds in implementing these orders, the damage would be massive. Animals face habitat destruction and pollution. This is also a bipartisan issue. Most Americans are in opposition to the reduction of national parks and public land. To take a stand against this issue, raise awareness by participating in protests against the Trump Administration. For instance, just last week, there was a protest through Yosemite National Park.

Sign up for WhatMatters to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.

The California Air Resources Board is getting a new leader at a pivotal moment, as it battles the Trump administration in court and contends with growing scrutiny from Democrats and voters questioning the price of the state’s climate principles.

Liane Randolph has chaired the board of the state’s top air and climate regulator since 2020. She oversaw a range of policies including landmark clean-car and truck rules, a fuel standard with implications for gas prices and the state’s signature carbon trading program, cap-and-trade. This week, Gov. Gavin Newsom nominated his senior climate advisor, Lauren Sanchez, to replace her.

Randolph, in an interview, told CalMatters her departure was part of her “personal journey,” something she began considering earlier this year.

“I’ve worked really hard over the last almost five years, and I’m ready for a break,” she said. “I am confident that the transition will go incredibly smoothly.”

Observers say the handover highlights the air board’s key role at a time of political pushback and consumer resistance.

“Pretty much all of the major areas in climate that [the air board] touches are going to be in really significant periods of challenge,” said Danny Cullenward, a climate expert and vice chair of an independent committee that analyzes the cap-and-trade program. “This is not an easy time to take over an agency. It’s a time when sound strategy — and not just autopilot — is going to be required.”

California’s climate ambition meets Trump opposition

Newsom’s 2020 order to phase out gas-car sales by 2035 was a watershed moment for California climate policy. His executive order was a headline-grabbing strike at the oil industry, meant to accelerate not only the state’s adoption of electric cars, but the nation’s.

Newsom said Randolph would be the champion of that effort as his pick to lead the air board just a few months later, calling her “the kind of bold, innovative leader that will lead in our fight against climate change with equity and all California’s communities at heart.”

But Randolph faced a larger challenge than her predecessors: a Trump administration bent on thwarting California’s authority. The White House immediately criticized Newsom’s order as an example of how “extreme the left has become,” evidence that liberal policymakers wanted to “dictate every aspect of every American’s life.”

While Randolph’s air board made significant policy during the years of the Biden administration, Trump attacked those efforts once he returned to office.

“Liane didn’t have the time or the circumstances to pivot toward a new, adjusted strategy,” said Daniel Sperling, a former member of the board, now the director of the Institute for Transportation Studies at UC Davis. “She inherited the trajectory that California was on, and that the governor was articulating, and then she got undermined by the Trump administration.”

For the gasoline car ban, the air board held months of marathon hearings filled with car owners, environmentalists and industry lobbyists. In 2022, the board approved the measure that Newsom wanted. More rules soon followed, targeting diesel trucks, locomotives and other major polluters.

Ethan Elkind, a climate law expert at UC Berkeley, said Randolph steered the board through a difficult time.

In disputes involving environmental justice groups, he said, “she really listened to people,” building consensus and lowering tensions.

“She’s always very diplomatic,” Elkind said. “She was mild-mannered, she wasn’t polemical, she didn’t use it as a perch to pontificate. She seemed very measured and steady and took her role as the public face, and the need for outreach, very seriously.”

Policies moving the state toward zero emissions vehicles have struggled, as federal and state regulators have pulled industry in opposing directions.

The Biden administration signed off on California’s clean-car rules last year. But the state air board withdrew one of its most aggressive measures on diesel trucks, as well as rules on locomotives, harbor craft and other polluters, in anticipation of Trump’s return.

“There’s not a full understanding of how aggressive the administration’s attacks on all of California’s efforts to achieve climate action have been,” Randolph said at a CalMatters event in San Francisco. She pointed to the Trump administration’s withdrawl of a rule aimed at cleaning up nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.

“That has nothing to do with electric vehicles,” Randolph said. “It was all about just attacking California’s authority, and letting the big companies who supported the administration continue to pollute communities.”

Catherine Reheis-Boyd, a senior advisor to the Western States Petroleum Association, said that under Randolph’s tenure, California’s ambition got ahead of consumers and technology. Her pushback echoed the broader clash with the Trump administration, which has targeted electric cars as costly for consumers and impractical.

“We have no problem with electric vehicles,” Reheis-Boyd said, at the San Francisco CalMatters event. But “we think there should be a free market.”

Searing climate battles at home

Last November, the air board revamped its Low Carbon Fuel Standard, a program that uses financial incentives to encourage cleaner fuels as the state phases out gasoline and diesel.

The fight exposed twin challenges arising from within the state: rising costs and lingering environmental harms not addressed by the climate policy. Consumer advocates raised alarms about gas prices, while environmentalists warned that boosting alternatives like biofuels made from cow manure or soybeans offered limited climate benefits.

Phoebe Seaton, co-director of the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability, said her group “strongly disagrees” with the expansion of the fuel standard program but credited Randolph’s leadership for showing up and listening to all parties.

“We are especially grateful for the time Chair Randolph dedicated to meeting in Pixley and Fresno with people impacted by dairies,” Seaton said.

Central valley politicians criticized the program for making fuels less affordable. Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains, a Bakersfield Democrat looking to unseat a moderate Republican in Congress, called for Randolph’s resignation earlier this year. She argued that the air board failed to study the economic impacts of its new standard. Her office did not respond to a request from CalMatters for comment.

Cullenward said the air board hasn’t always clearly said what its programs cost consumers. While Newsom and the legislature will extend cap-and-trade, the board still must decide how to reshape the program after pausing work on it during the reauthorization fight.

“One of the toughest things about this process is that being really honest about what’s working — and what’s not working — and what the costs of the different options are, is going to be essential,” Cullenward said. “Historically, that’s not something staff have ever embraced.”

Newsom praised Randolph for stepping in during a time of uncertainty and leading with “vision and resolve.” She will leave at the end of the month, before the end of her term, which lasts through 2026.

Questions about costs, affordability and environmental concerns will continue to hang over the air board as it decides how to steer cap-and-trade and other programs in the years ahead.

Randolph, in her remarks Wednesday, said California regulators must get creative in the face of federal attacks, while also addressing public concerns and communicating why the state’s policies matter.

“All of the impacts of climate change make things fundamentally unaffordable,” she said.

Newsom’s point person steps in

Randolph’s replacement, Lauren Sanchez, has been the governor’s point person on climate from within the executive office. Translating Newsom’s vision into state policy at a key turning point while also leading a 16-member board and managing the agency’s vast, highly technical staff will present a new challenge.

Sanchez built her climate credentials on the international stage and inside the governor’s office, where she helped steer billions in budget funding for climate programs and advised Newsom on this summer’s high-stakes energy and climate package.

“He turned to the aide he trusts most on climate,” said Dean Florez, the state Senate appointee to the air board. “Lauren’s been at his side drafting the playbook and steering the billions. This isn’t a change in course, it’s keeping faith with his own circle.”

Before joining Newsom’s office in 2021, Sanchez served as a climate negotiator at the U.S. State Department and later advised John Kerry in the Biden administration. She also held senior roles at the California Environmental Protection Agency and the air board, coordinating climate policy across state agencies and shaping California’s international climate work.

“Lauren has been my most trusted climate advisor and the chief architect of California’s bold climate agenda,” Newsom said. “She is a force in her own right: her expertise, tenacity, and vision will serve California well as the Board works to protect our communities and defends our climate progress against relentless attacks from Washington.”

Sanchez played a central role in weaving climate priorities into the state budget in recent years, said Jamie Pew, climate policy advisor with NetxGen Policy. Cap-and-trade pays for a climate credit that consumers see on their utility bills; Pew said Sanchez advocated for expanding the credit during the recent legislative negotiations.

“Lauren has been a champion for getting cap and invest done this year, which will ensure that funding for critical climate programs will continue to grow at a time when federal rollbacks threaten the transition,” Pew said.

Next week, the state’s top air and climate regulators will vote on amendments narrowing a previously rescinded truck rule to public fleets. The board is also advancing an emergency regulation to keep its clean-car and truck standards enforceable as the board battles the federal government in court.

Many of the air board’s recent accomplishments have run into roadblocks this year. As expected, Trump quickly moved to block California’s mandates aided by Congress, signing three measures in June against clean cars and two others targeting diesel trucks.

Adrian Martinez, a lawyer with Earthjustice, said California’s air board faces “perilous times.”",https://cdn.kpbs.org/dims4/default/c9f8383/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1536x806+0+109/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkpbs-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F27%2F4f2222fa484ca29bdb534784d64e%2Fcalmatters-photo-politics.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 11:00:35.358731

Forest envelopes Eli Lilly’s new campus, a 58-acre site halfway around a long looped road in Research Triangle Park where the company manufactures popular weight-loss and diabetes medications.

“I think it brings a beautiful aesthetic,” Daniel VonDielingen, an Eli Lilly senior vice president of manufacturing, said in late July during a facility tour.

This aesthetic, seclusion as a selling point, has defined Research Triangle Park since state leaders opened the economic zone in the 1950s. Nearly half the size of Manhattan, RTP was made for employees to commute into and drive out of.

Fidelity Investments today maintains the park’s largest workforce at its office complex in the woods. Cisco, another major RTP employer, has occupied more than 10 buildings around a lake and a pond since the 1990s. And years before Eli Lilly bought its local campus in 2020, the shielded site was owned by GlaxoSmithKline.

These layouts are no accident. RTP straddles Durham and Wake counties, and each local government sets special zoning designations that require park campuses to have large buffers and low density. The maximum building height is 120 feet. Around 20% of RTP, 1,400 acres, is parking lots.

This suited past tenants, but park leaders now have a 50-year plan to evolve alongside the booming region and modern work trends. “The old RTP model of this very suburban, auto-oriented campus really doesn’t align with what we’re seeing in demand for both an office market perspective and a town perspective,” said Travis Crayton, head of planning and public policy at the Research Triangle Foundation, which manages the park.

The first change (called RTP 2.0) opened five years ago, when the Foundation launched Hub RTP, a quasi-downtown area that today offers office, retail, dining and — in a park first — apartments. The next change has a longer timeline. Under “RTP 3.0,” park leaders wish to give developers flexibility to convert low-density, tree-lined campuses into mixed-use areas with shops, restaurants, grocery stores, towers and additional residential neighborhoods.

The Triangle’s population has never been higher, and post-pandemic, many residents maintain hybrid office schedules. “Being able to provide those amenities in close proximity to a workplace, that’s what you’re seeing the most successful office leasing have in this market today,” Crayton said.

In June, Wake County revised its zoning ordinances to fit the RTP 3.0 vision. Durham County is rewriting its entire unified development ordinance, and Crayton has advocated for its leaders to pass park rezoning faster through a standalone action. Nida Allam, chair of the Durham County Board of Commissioners, told me she supports rezoning the park with housing and a transit station to make it more accessible.

“Much of our growth is within city limits,” she said. “But so many of our jobs are within RTP.”

Crayton anticipates Durham will green light the RTP rezoning plan in November. Then, after a few internal votes, the park can get started on its big reinvention.

Coffee man vs. coffee machine at Lenovo

Proximity made the juxtaposition hard to ignore. Standing to the right, behind a mobile coffee cart, human barista Cameron Keith of Raleigh’s Arbour Coffee served drinks for guests touring Lenovo’s upgraded Executive Briefing Center in Research Triangle Park.

And a few yards away was the Coffee Robot, a fully automated system Lenovo displayed Monday alongside its data center liquid cooling apparatuses and a six-legged robotic dog.

Coffee Robot is manufactured by a company called Hestia Robotics USA with Lenovo software and screens. It has milk dispensers, syrup pumps and latte art capabilities. A mechanical arm waves to customers from behind a clear barrier as it delivers one of 200 drink variations. It’s pitched as performing the work of two employees, said Milo Speranzo, Lenovo’s North America chief marketing officer.

Keith and his wife started their coffee catering business last year. Are robots new competition? “I think people want that personal touch,” Keith told me during Monday’s event. “And we’re bringing a happy experience to you. I think that’s a little differentiator there.”

Coffee Robot is in a handful of hospitals and airports, including Austin, Dallas and San Francisco. Speranzo said there’s demand from high-traffic spaces that struggle to find employees, particularly skilled baristas.

And after watching it work all morning, Keith admitted it was a pretty cool concept.

Duke investigation silence

When does no news become news? In late July, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Education Secretary Linda McMahon threatened to sever all Duke Health federal funding if the Durham medical system did not address allegations of racial discrimination. Their letter didn’t cite examples, but prominent DEI opponents have criticized Duke’s efforts to promote diversity in its residency programs.

Kennedy and McMahon gave Duke 10 business days to decide whether it would form a “Merit and Civil Rights Committee” to review internal practices and 20 business days to respond to the government’s information request under an investigation conducted by the Health Department’s Office for Civil Rights.

With both deadlines past, Duke University continues to not say how it has responded. Nor did the federal health or education departments answer requests for updates this week. In early August, the White House confirmed to The N&O that it had frozen $108 million for Duke. It did not publicly state which specific funds were cut, or give a reason.

Other Trump administration battles with elite universities have reached some resolutions: Columbia settled, a federal judge found the funding freeze at Harvard unconstitutional, and Northwestern’s president recently announced he will resign.

Will the Duke situation quietly fade, or are more headlines coming?

Clearing my cache

It’s 919 Day in the Triangle, as today’s date matches our main area code. NC State’s Centennial Campus will host a free concert to celebrate.

Data center update: Statesville City Council unanimously approved a five-building data center campus, despite some local opposition.

The production company behind YouTuber/candy bar magnate MrBeast’s Amazon game show received a maximum $15 million state incentive to shoot portions of the next season near Wilmington and Greenville. MrBeast grew up in Greenville and maintains a studio in the Eastern North Carolina city.

Duke Health CEO Dr. Craig Albanese will step down at the end of the month, meaning Duke Health and UNC Health each face top leadership changes amid a turbulent funding landscape.

Acadia Healthcare is shutting Carolina House, three treatment center facilities near South Durham that address eating disorders and general behavioral health. The closure comes as Acadia faces both federal investigations into its general admissions practices and Medicaid cuts under the One Big Beautiful Bill.

A new annual report from NCInnovation shows the imperiled statewide economic development organization awarded UNC System researchers $18.8 million between June 2024 and June 2025. Melanoma treatment, lithium purification and power-grid efficiency were among the recipient projects’ aims.

North Carolina has issued a permit to Duke Energy to install 13 new emergency generators to support Novo Nordisk’s large, expanding pharmaceutical plant in Johnston County.

RTI International laid off around 120 staff members on Thursday as the Durham-based global research nonprofit continues to readjust to the federal funding climate. “RTI’s next chapter will demand bold thinking and strategic agility,” RTI CEO Tim Gabel said in a statement.

National Tech Happenings

Trump officials and Chinese leaders have outlined a deal to transfer TikTok to U.S. control. At least one Raleigh grandmother should be thrilled.

The Federal Reserve cut rates his week in an 11-to-1 vote and suggested two more cuts could come before year’s end.

Amazon says it will invest $1 billion to raise pay and lower health care costs for its U.S. transportation and fulfillment workers to more than $23 an hour.

Waymo’s driverless robotaxis are coming to Nashville. How long until Raleigh gets them?

ABC has pulled Jimmy Kimmel off his night-time talk show following complaints from Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr over Kimmel’s comments regarding the Charlie Kirk shooting suspect.

The final session will virtually welcome author Robin Wall Kimmerer for a keynote address on Sept. 30.

The first three sessions will take place online and will feature Rev. Randy Woodley, Dr. Carolyn Finney and Lyanda Lynn Haupt. Registration for these sessions can be found at aes-summit.org.

The final session will take place on from 6 to 9 p.m. Sept. 30, where Kimmerer will appear via livestream for her keynote address. A watch party for this address will be hosted by Columbus Interfaith, and will be held at the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Columbus, IN, 7850 W. Goeller Blvd.

An author, scientist and Citizen Potawatomi Nation member, Kimmerer is well known for writing the book “Braiding Sweetgrass” and its follow up “The Serviceberry – The Abundance and Reciprocity in the Natural World.” This second book teaches one on how to orient their life around graditude, reciprocity and community based on the lessons of the natural world.

“She’s a wonderful scholar, activist, writer, very inspiring. Her text is very accessible to a wide community of folks who are wanting to live in greater harmony with the Earth, to be better stewards of the planet and we hope that it can bring a lot of people into greater commitment to this idea of caring for the Earth,” Columbus Interfaith Executive Director and UUCCI minister Nic Cable said.

The theme of this year’s summit is “Strong and Supported,” which Faith in Place development officer and Columbus Interfaith member Eric Riddle said really plays into Kimmerer’s second book. Each session will focus on ways that people can give and receive healing to the Earth as well as ways to create a healthier and more just world.

“We really want to emphasize the importance of circular economies, of seeing ourselves as connected to the natural world and as a humanity that helps all of creation thrive through our support of ecological systems…,” Riddle said.

About 30 in-person watch parties will take place on Sept. 30 across Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin, or Faith in Place’s main service territory, Riddle said. Prior to the watch party, a vegetarian pitch in dinner will be held at 6 p.m., with the live stream starting at 7:30 p.m.

A discussion in Unitarian Universalist’s sanctuary will then take place after the live stream. Riddle said they will also be inviting their guests to more Interfaith events that will be occurring throughout the rest of the year.

“… this is open to anyone. (We) certainly, you know, have a strong Christian attendance, but there’s also members of the Hindu Temple that come from the Islamic Center, people who have a Buddhist spiritual belief system,” Riddle said. “So we’re really just trying to continue that work that’s been going on for a long time.”

From the summit, Cable hopes people walk away with new friendships, connections and commitment to living more consciously and being better stewards for the Earth. He said environmental justice concerns everyone, and in bringing people of different religious backgrounds together, attendees can learn from each other’s religious teachings and perspectives.

“So I think naturally, the gift that having an intentional interfaith group gather for this summit is to be reminded that we are all in this together and that not one religion has all the answers or has all the solutions,” Cable said. “And so we can and need to learn and listen with and from each other so that we can move forward together.”",https://www.therepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/AIM_IN_THE_REPUBLIC_32x32-v2.png,N,,2025-09-20 12:02:59.904209

Hancock County Commissioner Bill Spalding posted in a private Facebook group that representatives from Chesco Energy had approached county commissioners about the prospects of building a gas turbine power generation plant in Blue River Township — more specifically, around County Roads 750 East and 200 South, near Pleasant View Cemetery.

The post, originally made in the Facebook group “Eastern Hancock School Happenings,” was copied and posted by other residents and shared across various groups, including the community Facebook group “Westland – Blue River Township Indiana.” Spalding confirmed the veracity of the post to the Daily Reporter. The plan is still in its preliminary stages, and no official proposals have been brought forward.

Chesco Energy started up earlier this year, looking to develop natural gas power projects in states with increasing electrical demand. The company’s website says it is “enabling the energy tradition” and meeting the challenge in the surge of electricity demand driven by generative AI and data centers. Chesco hopes to create a balanced and reliable power grid backed by thermal and renewable energy.

“While renewables are an important component of a sustainable future, the evolving market dynamics underscore the essential role of hybrid power facilities — combining both battery technology and thermal generation to ensure grid reliability and support the smooth integration of renewables and meeting increasing electricity demand,” the company’s website says.

Company leaders have previously worked in various major energy companies, including Duke Energy, NRG, Washington Group International and Exelon.

According to federal data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, natural gas made up 40.5% of the utility-scale electricity generation in Indiana for 2024, which is second of all power generation in the state, only behind coal. The nearest natural gas power stations are one operated by Duke Energy in Henry County and one operated by Indiana Municipal Power Agency in Anderson.

Representatives from Chesco recently presented plans, Spalding said in his post, which include evaluating several sites across Indiana with proximity to gas and power utility crossings and the ability to secure a location by only talking to a minimal amount of homeowners.

One of the landowners in the general area Chesco is targeting is Tyner Pond Farm. Opened in 2010 to implement regenerative farming practices and raising chicken in pasture environments, the farm has grown since its opening. Owner and founder Chris Baggott said if a plant was built in the area, it would disrupt the biosphere and the environment Tyner Pond Farm has created over the past 15 years.

He said the food system is moving toward localization, and that maintaining the agricultural land on the eastern side of the county needs to be an important priority for county officials.

“People think this isn’t going to be disruptive, but it will be very disruptive for operations. It’s all about soil health, microbiology and the healthy biosystem that allows our cattle to be healthy, without having to have drugs, without having to have vaccines, antibiotics, etc.,” Baggott said.

In his Facebook post, Spalding said one major concern of the proposed development is the proposed height of the vent stacks, which could go up to 200 feet tall. For comparison, the Hancock County Courthouse is 181 feet tall.

“Additionally, this plant is intended as a pass-through facility, meaning it would not provide power to the local community, nor would it bring substantial employment (an estimated 50 jobs at most),” Spalding said in his post.

Blue River Township Trustee Brandon Jones said he first heard about the potential plans for the area about a month ago from local farmers. He said he then told Spalding about the potential development in the township.

Jones, elected trustee for the largely rural township in 2022, said he did not see the benefit of a potential power generation plant in the county if it wasn’t going to directly benefit the county.

“I understand that progress is going to happen. I don’t like the idea of it being in the backyard,” he said. “I don’t see how it’s going to benefit Hancock County, period, let alone people from Blue River Township.”

In his online post, Spalding said once Chesco reached out to local landowners to gather their input, it planned to report its findings, and later schedule a public meeting with commissioners to discuss the proposal.

In late 2023, Hancock County approved a new version of the county’s comprehensive plan, which is supposed to be a guide for future growth and development in the county. In the plan, the future land use map shows the area around County Roads 750 East and 200 South recommended for remaining agricultural land.

County commissioners have used the land use map in making crucial decisions about economic development in the county. In July, after several months of public interest, commissioners put an end to considering a proposal to turn 775 acres of agricultural farmland into a data center in Buck Creek Township. One major reason why the commissioners dismissed the proposal is because the area proposed for the development was not an appropriate site for such a project according to the comprehensive plan.

Baggott believes the county will not give Chesco the go-ahead to build in Hancock County, referencing the county’s comprehensive plan. However, he is worried that if county officials reject it, the company could partner with a utility company and petition the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission to override the county’s decision.

“That’s a little bit worrisome. I think so far, the government at the state level has been very supportive of county rights of putting appropriate development in appropriate places. Our county has designated spots for this kind of thing,” he said.

Jones noted that Blue River Township does not have the infrastructure necessary to support a power generation plant. He said if the plant was built, the company would need to significantly upgrade the infrastructure in the area. Jones said he would prefer for the area to stay as farmland.

“We also have to consider water and sewer and well. If they need water, they’d have to use a well. If you dig into somebody else’s aquifers, it could mess up other people’s wells in surrounding areas. There’s a lot to consider with that,” he said.

For Baggott, at the end of the day, he just wants to make sure the comprehensive plan is being followed and the eastern third of the county is being kept as rich, fertile agricultural farmland.

“We don’t want to see what we have created destroyed,” he said.",https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/AIM_IN_DAILY_REPORTER_32x32-v2.png,N,,2025-09-20 06:58:27.057269

Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) emerged in the European Union around 2010 as a framework to align science and technology with societal values, ethical standards, and sustainability goals [1]. While the United States does not formally use the term “RRI,” its principles are embedded in many federal regulations and oversight mechanisms.

Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) offices are at the center of this work. By ensuring compliance with standards from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and other agencies involved with the work environment, EHS teams translate RRI’s high-level principles into day-to-day practices [2] [3] [6] [7]. Their work protects research personnel, the public, animals, and the environment while fostering trust in scientific progress.

The Purpose of Responsible Research

At its core, responsible research emphasizes ethics, sustainability, and accountability. RRI was formalized in European policy through Horizon 2020 and focuses on aligning research outcomes with societal needs through engagement, governance, and foresight [1]. Recent scholarship highlights a “decoupling dilemma,” where the concept of inclusion risks being used as a broad impact measure rather than staying anchored in equity and justice for marginalized groups [2].

In the U.S., responsibility is embedded not through a single RRI framework, but through a patchwork of regulatory standards, compliance obligations, and ethical codes. EHS offices play a central role in uniting these requirements. Their work includes:

Identifying hazards and assessing risk levels [4].

Implementing controls to minimize risks to people and the environment.

Supporting oversight committees like Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBCs) and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs).

Ensuring alignment with best-practice laboratory standards such as Prudent Practices in the Laboratory [5].

In this way, EHS teams embody the purpose of responsible research while ensuring that discovery and innovation occur without compromising health, safety, or public trust.

EHS Across the Research Lifecycle

Research Design: Building Safety into Proposals

EHS involvement begins before the first experiment. During research planning, EHS staff conduct hazard assessments, evaluate containment needs, waste stream, and review risk management strategies. Their findings support oversight committees such as IBCs, which review recombinant and synthetic nucleic acid research [8], and IACUCs, which evaluate the humane use of animals [9].

By embedding safety and ethics into protocols early, EHS helps ensure that projects not only meet regulatory requirements but also reflect RRI principles of anticipation and governance. This proactive approach saves time, resources, and reputational risk later in the research process.

Research Execution: Training, Monitoring, and Compliance

Once a study begins, EHS responsibilities expand to include:

Training research staff on hazard awareness and protective practices [4].

Monitoring laboratories for compliance with OSHA standards, such as those addressing chemical hazards, biological risks, and ionizing radiation [4] [7].

Managing hazardous materials and waste to reduce risks of environmental contamination [5].

Coordinating with EPA programs, such as Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), which tie safe laboratory operations directly to the credibility and reliability of submitted data [6].

Through these measures, EHS ensures that compliance is not just a bureaucratic requirement but a foundation for valid, trustworthy, and ethically defensible research.

Ongoing Monitoring: Continuous Improvement and Accountability

EHS engagement does not stop once research is underway. Offices conduct audits, inspections, and corrective action tracking to identify gaps and ensure that hazards are managed over time [2].

In radiation-related research, for example, OSHA’s ionizing radiation standards set dose limits for workers, require personal monitoring (such as dosimeters), and mandate hazard postings [7]. Similarly, NRC requirements for radioactive materials and OSHA rules for non-NRC sources establish a multilayered system of protections.

This continuous monitoring embodies the RRI principle of reflexivity by assessing whether current practices align with both regulatory expectations and societal values.

Oversight Committees: IBC, IACUC, and Beyond

Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBCs)

NIH guidelines require IBCs at institutions conducting recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid research. These committees ensure containment, monitor compliance, and evaluate risks to researchers and the community [8]. EHS offices provide critical expertise, aligning laboratory practices with biosafety protocols and serving as liaisons between researchers and regulators.

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs)

IACUCs oversee programs of animal care and use, including protocol review, semiannual evaluations, and facility inspections [9]. EHS staff collaborate with IACUCs to implement occupational health and safety programs, ensure staff are appropriately trained, and support disaster preparedness plans that safeguard both animals and personnel.

AAALAC International Accreditation

Beyond federally mandated committees, voluntary accreditation through AAALAC International provides institutions with a benchmark of excellence. AAALAC uses three primary standards—the NRC’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the Ag Guide, and the European Convention on Vertebrate Animals—as well as position statements and guidance documents to evaluate programs [10]. Institutions that pursue AAALAC accreditation demonstrate their commitment to global best practices and the values of RRI.

Societal Relevance: Beyond Compliance to Stewardship

Responsible research is not only about protecting laboratory staff, it is about upholding public trust and protecting ecosystems. EHS offices help institutions demonstrate their commitment to transparency, accountability, and sustainability.

Examples include:

Real-time monitoring systems for air and water quality in laboratories and surrounding communities [5].

Occupational health programs that protect not only employees but also the families and communities connected to them [9].

Integration of sustainability practices, such as energy-efficient laboratories and responsible waste management, that minimize research’s environmental footprint.

In doing so, EHS bridges the gap between compliance and stewardship. This aligns with RRI’s call to anticipate long-term societal impacts and to ensure that science is conducted with both responsibility and foresight [1,2].

EHS as a Foundation of Responsible Research

Environmental Health and Safety offices are more than compliance checkpoints, they are enablers of responsible innovation. By embedding safety and ethics into project design, execution, and monitoring, EHS teams ensure that research progresses without compromising human health, animal welfare, or environmental integrity.

Through collaboration with oversight committees, alignment with OSHA, EPA, and NRC standards, and integration of best practices like Prudent Practices and AAALAC accreditation, EHS translates RRI principles into daily operations. Their work protects not only laboratories but also the communities and ecosystems touched by science.

Ultimately, EHS fosters the trust, transparency, and accountability that make research both innovative and responsible.

Spectrum News talked with Dave DeMatthews, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, to get his perspective on this and other issues facing Texas educators today.
There have been lots of tragedies in Texas,” DeMatthews said.
Rather than the TEA focusing on its job, and it’s not always been effective at its job, right?

We know that the state is seeing a severe shortage of teachers, and now, we’re seeing educators being fired or resigning, like the president of Texas A&M.

Spectrum News talked with Dave DeMatthews, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, to get his perspective on this and other issues facing Texas educators today.

DeMatthews talked of the recent focus from the Texas Education Administration (TEA) on comments made in the classroom at every level about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, an issue that has caused controversy across the country.

“TEA just a few days ago put out a directive to superintendents across the state who may have made inappropriate comments about the killing of Charlie Kirk. And, you know, this is kind of arbitrary. There have been lots of controversial issues. There have been lots of tragedies in Texas,” DeMatthews said.

“But the kind of bigger concern is the long term. Rather than the TEA focusing on its job, and it’s not always been effective at its job, right? Rather than doing that job, or ensuring there’s a quality teacher workforce, now they’re distracted on another issue. And that’s a big concern,” he said.

He emphasizes that, in such an environment, it’s going to be hard to get people to want to teach, which is already a problem in the state.

“Who’s going to want to be a teacher in this sort of hostile political environment?” he said.

On the subject of free speech, which has been at the center of the debate in recent days, DeMatthews issues an ominous warning.

“It harkens back to the Red Scare of the 1940s and 1950s,” he said, referring to the McCarthy political hearings on communism. “We should be at a point in our society where we’ve learned from our history’s past mistakes.”

Those on the other side of the issue point to the right of an employer to have their own rules and policies governing what they consider to be appropriate behavior. DeMatthews doesn’t see an inconsistency in that viewpoint.

“Just to be clear, teachers do have an educator code of conduct, and having a code of conduct and engaging professionally and ethically is really important, especially since we’re trusting teachers to work with children in our public schools,” he said.

“But that does not necessarily provide the government the right to go scouring and searching for private conversations and private posts that are made by teachers. And the same goes in the workforce,” he added.

And what of legislators such as Briscoe Cain, who took to X this week to say, “We must drive the woke out of our institutions?”

“All I would say is I wish our legislators, our elected officials, our commissioner had the same code of conduct that teachers had, and that the same standards were applied to them,” he said. “But that is not the case.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/UT_Austin_generic,N,,2025-09-20 12:02:42.668926

The valuable perks are ending early due to government policy changes. As a result, Michigan public radio station WKAR reported that installations are up greatly ahead of the Dec. 31 deadline.

""A lot of people have been telling me, 'I wish I would have done this five years ago' when they first started thinking about it or looking at it, and turning into 'how quick can you do it?' It's a lot happening very fast,"" Absolute Solar's Adam Phelps said in the story.

Phelps added that the Lansing business has seen a 200% or more increase in business since July, when the budget bill that ends the incentives was passed.

Adding a household array is a great way to reduce or even eliminate your utility bill, as well as cut harmful, plant-warming air pollution. The fumes are linked by experts to greater chances for severe heat waves and droughts that are impacting even our food supply through feared farm labor productivity loss and crop damage.

EnergySage is a great resource to help you get started. The free tool compares quotes and can aid your search for the right professional installer in your area.

The Solar Energy Industries Association reported that there are more than five million installations in the United States, most of them on rooftops. A government report said that 1.2 million Americans claimed tax incentives for solar and other clean energy upgrades on their 2023 tax returns.

Unfortunately, most of the incentives are sunsetting early, along with other household rebates. But WKAR's story said that solar credits for business and nonprofit projects last into 2026 and 2027, per Phelps.

""There is a little bit of a larger window,"" he said in the story.

EnergySage's guidance can make sure you collect all applicable rebates, saving you up to $10,000. There's also a helpful mapping tool that compares costs by state, as well as localized incentives. What's more, EnergySage can help you upgrade elsewhere around the house. Its experts have great advice for efficient heat pumps, for example. It's an HVAC switch that the government said can reduce home electricity use for heating by up to 75%. The units also provide energy-efficient air conditioning and can operate in almost any climate.

Fast action is important to secure residential project incentives — including up to $2,000 in tax breaks for heat pumps — before they expire at the end of the year.

The New South Wales Government is fast-tracking the State’s first REZ, aiming to upgrade existing grid infrastructure such as distribution poles and wires. This approach will help reduce the impact on communities and the environment.

“Planning approval for the Hunter-Central Coast Renewable Energy Zone project is further evidence of progress on a key upgrade that will help the lights on as coal-fired power plants retire.

“Upgrading existing distribution poles and wires allows us to minimise the impact on communities and the environment, and speeds up the delivery of this critical infrastructure,” Minister for Climate Change and Energy Penny Sharpe said.

“This important milestone in the development of the Hunter-Central Coast Renewable Energy Zone project is good news for communities in the Central Coast and Hunter.

“The REZ will help ensure a reliable and sustainable energy future for our regions,” Minister for Central Coast David Harris said.

The Hunter-Central Coast REZ development is proposed to include:

Upgrades to 85 kilometres of existing sub-transmission power lines

Building two new energy hubs (substations)

Upgrading two existing energy hubs (substations)

Installing 18 kilometres of new underground fibre optic communications cable

The network infrastructure upgrades will run from Kurri Kurri to Muswellbrook, and it will enable about 1GW of network transfer capacity.

“The Hunter-Central Coast region has always been a powerhouse for industry and innovation and now it’s taking a bold step forward into the clean energy future.

“Fast-tracking the Hunter-Central Coast Renewable Energy Zone is about more than just new poles and substations, it’s about delivering affordable, long-lasting energy while creating good jobs, supporting local businesses and protecting our communities and environment.

“By upgrading existing infrastructure, we’re minimising disruption, maximising benefits and ensuring our local communities are at the heart of the state’s renewable transformation,” Minister for the Hunter Yasmin Catley said.

Hunter-Central Coast REZ map (source: Ausgrid)

Projects such as the Hunter-Central Coast REZ are key to the State Government’s energy plan. Currently, about 36 per cent of New South Wales’ electricity comes from renewable sources.

Full planning approval was granted following the exhibition of the Review of Environmental Factors as well as a review of submissions by councils, state authorities, businesses and individuals.

With most of the works proposed to take place on existing easements, the Hunter-Central Coast REZ network infrastructure was assessed to have a relatively low environmental impact.

Ausgrid is partnering with EnergyCo to deliver the network infrastructure upgrades. Ausgrid is committed to addressing the feedback on the Review of Environmental Factors, which included priorities like jobs, support for local businesses and procurement, protection of visual amenity and environment, community benefits, effective traffic management and ongoing community engagement.

This REZ development is anticipated to create an average of about 590 direct jobs annually in the local area during its construction phase. Opportunities include roles for engineers, electricians and labourers. Ausgrid is committed to prioritising jobs and skills training, local procurement and Aboriginal business participation.

The Hunter-Central Coast RES development is now subject to final approvals from the Australian Energy Regulator.

This project, however, is separate from the Hunter Transmission Project Environmental Impact Statement currently on public exhibition.

“Fast tracking the Hunter-Central Coast Renewable Energy Zone project is part of EnergyCo’s plan to keep the lights on for everyone in New South Wales, while providing tangible benefits to Hunter communities and their economies,” EnergyCo Chief Executive Hannah McCoughey said.

“Finalising the Review of Environmental Factors marks a significant milestone toward delivering upgraded network infrastructure that supports clean, reliable energy for the Hunter-Central Coast region.

“Ausgrid is committed to working closely with landowners and local stakeholders as we enable a lower cost transition that reduces the impact on our communities,” Ausgrid CEO Marc England said.",https://www.felix.net/hubfs/Felix%20Project%20News/Header%20images/hunter-central-coast-renewable-energy-zone-nsw.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 10:00:28.514463

We may have a difficult situation now, but I believe that no one country can solve the problem of climate change alone.
What’s your response when you see President Trump withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, essentially saying that he doesn’t believe climate change is an urgent threat?
Do you think your citizens make a direct connection between things like rising seas, airborne diseases and climate change?
The withdrawal from Paris was a setback for global climate efforts, particularly in climate finance.","How is climate change affecting Kenya? Just in the last 10 years, we have experienced three very serious droughts. In one, we lost close to two and a half million heads of livestock. We incurred costs upward of $1.5 billion on the loss of livestock alone. We lost many lives because of floods that followed. Between 5 and 10 percent of our economy is washed away every time we have a drought or flood. Climate change is not a myth. It is not a story. It is not far-fetched. It is a lived reality every day.

There has been real pushback within Kenya on the degree to which you are focused on international issues around climate rather than domestic issues. There have been protests. You’ve been criticized for police crackdowns. I see protests happen in many other countries. I see demonstrations in America. I see demonstrations in France and Europe. The reason that maybe you don’t see as much protesting in the rest of our continent is largely because not many countries are as democratic as Kenya. There is always a balance between the right to protest and the degeneration of protest into riots, destruction of property and life. And the police have a very delicate job. I don’t envy their position. But this is part of the growing of a nation.

‘When it comes to emissions, we are paying for a crime that others committed.’

But talking to your countrymen, how do you explain your focus on something that can seem very abstract to people who are still just struggling to get by day to day? Climate change is not just a global issue. It is a very domestic matter as well. Droughts made millions of Kenyans go hungry. Floods just in the city of Nairobi killed over 30 people. Nobody can persuasively tell any Kenyan that climate change is abstract. It is not.

Do you feel like the effort to coordinate global climate action has been effective? In the last three years, ever since we came together as a continent and pushed one continental position, what looked impossible is now beginning to be a reality. We just came back from a meeting of the U.N. where we were discussing development and financing. And it is generally acceptable now that countries like Kenya should be considered for financing. There was a time when we said this and it looked like a joke.

How exactly have things changed in those conversations? I think there is now a realization that we need debt relief, debt restructuring, because many countries, including Kenya, spend a lot of resources on managing the effects of climate change. And we’ve had, many times, to reorganize our resources because, when it comes to emissions, we are paying for a crime that others committed.

‘Nobody can persuasively tell any Kenyan that climate change is abstract. It is not.’

Does international collaboration on climate change work if the United States is rowing in the opposite direction? My brother, no situation is permanent. We may have a difficult situation now, but I believe that no one country can solve the problem of climate change alone. No one region, however powerful, however mighty. Solving this requires the participation, the collaboration, of everybody. And so I am very confident that the position of the United States, of China, of Europe, of Africa must come together at some point. We may disagree for a moment, we may disagree for a while, but reality is going to beat us into an agreement, because we have no option. The effects of climate change are in every continent. The only difference is that developed countries can cushion themselves. If the people in our continent cannot find life bearable in this continent, no amount of building borders and erecting roadblocks will block people from moving around the globe.

What’s your response when you see President Trump withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, essentially saying that he doesn’t believe climate change is an urgent threat? I have come across many leaders, and I don’t think President Trump is alone. But that does not remove the reality of what climate change is. The science is stubborn. The reality and facts are clear. Governments will come and go, leaders will move on, but the situation will be here. The reality will be staring at us.

How is climate change affecting the Marshall Islands? We will be submerged by 2050 if the world doesn’t do its part. We have a population of around 37,000. Ten years ago, we had closer to 50,000.

And what is driving that migration? One reason is that when we have regular inundations, some people, rather than rebuilding their homes, decide to go away and settle in the U.S. Sea-level rise is becoming scary for many of us.

Do you think your citizens make a direct connection between things like rising seas, airborne diseases and climate change? Yes, this conversation has been ongoing for many years. We have climate change in our curriculum. So our kids are growing up understanding the issues. People know that big emitters — the rich countries — are causing this, that we have no contribution to the greenhouse-gas emissions that are destroying the world and our livelihood. Our people are not complacent, but they have accepted the fact that big inequities exist and powerful countries get away with unacceptable behaviors. We are used to that mentality and attitude, since we have lived with the impact of the U.S. nuclear-testing program on our islands for 70 years.

What do you think developed nations owe countries like the Marshall Islands? The plan for elevating only two of our communities is projected to cost us billions. It’s a lot of money. I wish that the big emitters could step up and put money into that, because that could really help.

Do you feel differently about what international collaboration on climate change can accomplish now than you did at the beginning of your career? I have a positive outlook, despite everything that is happening. I think the fact that we are sitting at the table now — before, you know, it wasn’t as easy to be part of the discussions. The small-island developing states have been able to organize themselves and to be heard.

What has participating in those discussions been like for you? This is the 10th year of the Paris Agreement, and we’ve been hearing the same excuses from big emitters. You know, they’re very comfortable, and they don’t want to move from their comfort level.

What impact does the U.S. withdrawal from Paris have on the world’s ability to take action on this issue? It’s unfortunate that the U.S. has decided to step out of Paris. But there are those who rally together, because there are no other options for them. And so I think people are coming together stronger than before because you cannot rely on the U.S. in this respect. Something positive is happening, even though it’s not at the level that the Marshall Islands and other small developing countries have been advocating.

‘Big emitters are very comfortable, and they don’t want to move from their comfort level.’

What specific steps are you taking in the Marshall Islands to combat the effects of climate change? The warming of the ocean is killing our corals, which are building blocks of atoll nations. We are currently doing research to determine species of corals that can survive the warming ocean. Big emitters could provide research. Even though we are not contributing to emission levels, we are doing what we can to decrease greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. We are building a fleet of ships that use wind and solar power to replace our fossil-fuel-run shipping fleet.

Do you think your country will survive? As the leader of the Marshall Islands, I cannot take the view that we cannot survive. One important thing we’ve done is register our boundaries with the United Nations, making sure that the world recognizes our boundaries, regardless of whether we’re underwater or above water. So in that respect, the country will survive.

What are some of the changes your people have had to make to their daily lives as you navigate all this? Seven years ago, Majuro had no sea walls. Now we build sea walls to protect homes and schools. I mean, we used to be able to just walk into the lagoon. Now you have to go over sea walls to get to the lagoon side or to the ocean side. The landscape is different. I’ll share a poem that was put together by my daughter, Kathy Jetn̄il-Kijiner. It’s a reflection on how people are feeling about what’s happening.

My cousin

had a nightmare

that we kept

building seawalls

higher and

higher

all around

the sky

until suddenly

we were

at the bottom

of a wishing well

looking

up

at the world.

In Australia, climate has historically been a divisive issue. You seem to have gotten past the partisanship somewhat. How have you done that? I wouldn’t say there is a consensus here now. There are attempts by some in our opposition who are currently trying to remove, for example, the support for net zero by 2050. We have a green political party that would say net zero by 2035. Now, if you do that, you’re not going to achieve it; you’re going to threaten energy security, and therefore you’ll lose community support. If you just say, “Yeah, 100 percent renewable by tomorrow,” then you will lose support. You’ve got to take people with you on the journey. Our predecessors had 22 different energy policies and didn’t land one.

I try to speak about climate change as a challenge, but also an opportunity. To speak about the cost of inaction through the disasters that we’re seeing, but also the benefit in embracing the transition to clean energy. We are in a position where we’re trying to shift the agenda from one of “Why are you spending money on this?” to the return that comes from acting. One of the things that is said by climate skeptics in Australia is, “Oh, well, we’re only a couple of percent of the world’s emissions, so anything we do doesn’t matter.” That’s where the argument about economic benefit from action as opposed to inaction needs to be made.

Do you believe that the framework for international collaboration is actually effective? The challenge that the globe faces on this and so many other areas is the tension between international action and national sovereignty. I don’t think there’s a shortcut around the U.N. framework. As much as it is not ideal, I don’t see that there’s another option. What we’ve seen is a rise of nationalism and individualism from many countries. But it is also in the interest of nations and states for there to be good global outcomes. No country will be immune from action if we see an ongoing rise in levels of climate change, which means more climate refugees, which means other international changes as well. And these things are linked with national security, too.

You’re a big importer of Chinese-made solar panels. How do you see China right now? Is it a threat to a country like Australia, or is it a benefit because they are making so many of these technologies cheap and affordable? Well, it is a source of some regret. I think that there’s not a solar panel in the world that doesn’t have intellectual property that was created in Australia. Now, part of my argument is that we missed out on the commercial benefit. Just literally today, my minister and I were in South Australia announcing a nearly sixfold increase in manufacturing of solar panels at one of our plants there. China was smart to ramp up its investment in manufacturing, as it has been dominating critical minerals. What that could be is a lesson for countries so that, if there is potential trade disruption, there is less risk if other parts of the globe are also manufacturing.

This is something we’re going through here, where the Trump administration is penalizing the development of renewable energy and promoting fossil fuels. What is your response to what the U.S. is doing? We’re really focused on working in the Pacific in particular. We have a climate-change structure fund that is supporting the lowering of emissions in our own region. I think we don’t get into what other countries are doing, including the United States. That’s a matter for them as a sovereign nation. What it potentially does is open up opportunities in other parts. The countries that will succeed economically, in my view, are countries that continue to move forward.

When you see the U.S. retreat from engagement in climate issues, what does that mean for Guyana? The withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement is a major blow. We can’t debate that. The U.S. is not only a major emitter of greenhouse gases, but it wields tremendous influence in global affairs. The climate crisis is an existential crisis for many of us. We simply cannot afford to fold our hands and do nothing. We’re working closely with our neighbors, especially Brazil and Suriname, on forest biodiversity and resilience. With the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, then predictability on financing becomes an issue. It opens up a floodgate for others to also be unpredictable in the policy-making environment. Everything that surrounds climate change, commitment and policy requires global consensus, basically.

Is the global community actually making the financing available so that nations like Guyana can undergo the energy transition? Absolutely not. It’s ridiculous sometimes to listen to the pledges, because none of the pledges is actualized. When you ask the developing world to adopt measures to limit the impact of whatever we are doing on climate, you’re asking us to transition when we have major issues on energy equality, energy poverty, energy access. And then to complicate issues, these very countries are asked to function in a digital world, so they are already suffering from immense poverty because they were never able to adapt to the Industrial Revolution. Now they are moving into the digital revolution with A.I. that they will never be able to catch up with. And at the same time, basic things like clean water, access to electricity — major segments of the population don’t have this. This is something that has severely impacted the quality and equity of global policy-making. And there is no clear path and no clear plan as to how we are going to address these issues.

I heard implicitly in what you just said that climate change is the ultimate long-term problem in a world that is so often consumed with these short-term crises. I would put it even better: It’s a sacrificial lamb. Climate change is a sacrificial lamb that is always postponed. If you look at the last five years, we have not accelerated momentum. We have really stagnated. We are not implementing what we commit ourselves to do globally.

One thing that has not stagnated is temperature rise. What will this mean for the people of Guyana? If we did not have the type of revenue stream that we have now, it would have meant debt. It would have meant destruction. It would have meant our economy just falling apart. Guyana is a new oil producer, but we are using the resource to finance our energy transition, to build resilient infrastructure, to support the region that we are in, to invest in livelihood options that will keep our forest standing, which stores many gigatons of carbon. We’re investing in solar farms, hydro, natural gas, wind and biomass, all aimed at transitioning to a low-emission energy grid. We are building off-grid systems, solar farms, wind farms for the hinterland community, where the Indigenous people live.

‘Climate change is a sacrificial lamb.’

You talk about how, for Guyana, the answer to coping with a hotter world is in fact being funded by the production of more fuels that are causing that warming. That of course is sort of the conundrum in a nutshell, right? I don’t see it as a problem. Your question in the context of Guyana is quite different from your question in the Middle East, or your question in one of the industrial countries. For us, it’s quite different.

How do you see a way out? We have this standing forest that has been there for all our lives, which the world does not see a value in. It’s easy. If the world says, “We’re going to pay a fair-market rate for the forests that have ecological and biodiversity sources that also have a price,” then it will allow countries like ours that are forested to then use the revenue from that to protect our land, to invest in health, to invest in education, human development and infrastructure, to remain competitive and to build a strong and resilient economy. So the moral question is: Who can produce what the world needs in the least environmentally damaging way? Because let’s be clear on this too. We can’t be naïve. The world will need fossil fuel a long time into the future.

Finland has among the most ambitious climate targets in the world. At the same time, you’re still consuming large quantities of oil, gas and even coal. What has the energy transition looked like for you? Today we produce more than 95 percent of our electricity carbon-neutral. We are going to change our whole society to use clean energy and get rid of fossils and to be carbon neutral. And we can do it. Our companies are committed. And our people, the whole of society, is committed to these targets.

What do you think when you see the U.S. pulling out of the Paris Agreement, penalizing renewable-energy production and doubling down on fossil fuels? We are looking very carefully at what is happening in the U.S. The withdrawal from Paris was a setback for global climate efforts, particularly in climate finance. For example, the American data economy is investing billions in data centers in Finland because of clean energy. I’m a bit worried about how U.S. policy affects the companies from the U.S. and their investment plans. But it is important to note that many private-sector companies have continued to advance climate action. And we have seen that China’s role in climate policy has become even more crucial. And the E.U. must work even harder. Climate and economy go hand in hand. We in Finland know this.

Is China becoming a more powerful partner to Finland with the retreat of the U.S. on clean energy? With China, we have to be careful. We have to get rid of dangerous dependencies, because we have to be autonomous in clean-energy production. China is investing a lot, and China is very good on that. That’s why we have to invest also in the West.

Do you feel like the effort to coordinate international climate action has ultimately been effective? I’m concerned at this moment, because we have so many troubles around the world. We have wars in Ukraine, the Middle East, in Africa. But at the same time, climate change is moving forward. And we have to act. I have seen that international cooperation is possible. When I worked as a minister of finance seven years ago, I was co-founder of the Coalition of Finance Ministers Against Climate Change. Today there are 100 countries on board. And the solution was carbon pricing. I think that is a good example — that if you have practical and good ideas, you can find the power between countries and coalitions.

‘With China, we have to be careful. We have to get rid of dangerous dependencies.’

When you talk to leaders from the developing world, they really believe that developed countries, including Finland, should pay for climate-related damage in their countries. What’s your response to this? It is understandable, of course, and it’s clear that we have to support developing countries that are facing the effects of climate change first. It’s daily life in their countries.

You’ve been working on this issue for many years now. What was the moment when you felt the most personal disillusionment about the politics around climate change? About five to 10 years ago, there was a debate in my own country over whether climate change is true or not. And because I believe it is, and I’m deeply worried about our world and our planet, that debate was frustrating. But we won. Today we have new technologies. We can change our behavior without cutting our welfare. We just have to believe that it’s possible, and we have to continue our work.

How is Bangladesh experiencing climate change right now? We have to make use of every little space we’ve got in order to feed ourselves. But not only is our land sinking into the ocean; the water system brings saline water into the land because of the tide. And salinity eats up our cultivable land. So sum total is our land is getting squeezed. It’s not a very happy situation. It’s not going to change unless global warming changes. And then besides the sea level rising, our atmosphere is getting crazy. Our weather pattern is changing. Half of the population is under the age of 26. It’s a very young population. So they need a space to grow up and learn how to survive on this planet.

How much do you think international efforts to collaborate on climate action have succeeded or failed? We try to solve everything by pouring money into it. That’s not the solution. I’m saying I have to change myself. That’s how the world will change. I’m not undermining the importance of the COP [U.N. climate conference], because this is where everybody gets together and worries together. But the solution has to be something which is not just the government giving instruction. Government is not the solution. It’s the people who live on this planet who are the solution.

Bangladesh is a country that has almost no renewable-energy production at scale right now. You’ve talked about a zero-carbon-emissions world. How does a country like Bangladesh get there from where it is now? It’s not our fault. We try every way. Bangladesh doesn’t have its own source of hydropower. It’s a flat land, so we don’t have much except for solar. We have tremendous sources of hydropower up in the north, in Nepal, in Bhutan, and they are willing to supply this to Bangladesh. But for a time, we could not have the transmission line over India. So we got stuck. This is something that needs a decision which is beyond the control of Bangladesh.

‘We have to make use of every little space we’ve got in order to feed ourselves.’

Beyond India, what does the rest of the strategic landscape look like when it comes to energy issues? Is China potentially a partner for you as the U.S. pulls back? Well, you can imagine what the answer is, but being in the government, I cannot go on talking about other countries, what they should do and so on. It creates a problem for the government.

When you see the moves that the Trump administration has taken to reduce support for renewables, to prioritize fossil fuels, to cut federal funding for disaster response, what do you say? I just do the same thing I do for everybody. I’ll go to him and explain how I feel so bad that we are not taking the right kind of steps. And it can be done without hurting anybody. You have a choice, whether you take the path of self-destruction or you take the path of continuation and a decent life for all of us together. And not let the island people sink into the ocean. Not let Bangladesh be affected by sea level rising.

What do you think the developed countries that have historically been responsible for most global emissions owe a country like Bangladesh? All I can do is explain to them: “Look, this is our home. You start a fire in your part of the home, you suffer. But you do something to start a fire in my part of the house — this is not a fair thing to do. You are destroying the whole home. Our life depends on what you do.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/21/magazine/21mag-climate-Leaders-10/21mag-climate-Leaders-10-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 07:58:43.493727

However, there are still challenges. India also needs to develop its infrastructure alongside actually producing the green hydrogen. Storing energy will be essential, but it can be pricey, as the South China Morning Post reported.

""Policy and regulatory frameworks are still evolving, creating uncertainty for investors,"" Prakash told the publication. ""Overcoming these obstacles is crucial for green hydrogen to become a viable and competitive energy carrier.""

India is still committed to reducing its reliance on dirty fuels, though. These fuels produce gases that are warming the planet at an accelerated rate, per the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Policy Uncertainty and Its Impact on EV Adoption

California's 27% share of U.S. EV sales makes it a bellwether for the industryCalifornia Won’t Replace Expiring $7,500 Federal EV Tax Credit[ 1 ]. The absence of a $7,500 tax credit—a key affordability driver for lower-income buyers—risks stalling progress toward the state's 2035 gasoline vehicle sales ban.

Valuation Pressures on EV Manufacturers

and , both of which have historically relied on California's regulatory tailwinds, have seen similar declines. Data from Forbes indicates that the removal of tax credits, combined with proposed 25% tariffs on imported EV components, has exacerbated production cost pressures, forcing automakers to reassess capital allocation2 Top Undervalued EV Stocks to Watch Now[ 3 ].

Yet, not all automakers are equally vulnerable. Rivian, for example, remains the most resilient among North American EV startups, with production ramping up and a clearer path to profitability compared to peers like Lucid or Mullen AutomotiveCalifornia EV Tax Credit Replacement Faces Funding Uncertainty[ 4 ]. This divergence highlights the importance of operational efficiency and diversified revenue streams in navigating policy-driven headwinds.

Supply Chain Dynamics and Resilient Segments

The EV supply chain is facing its own perfect storm. Tariffs on Chinese battery components and geopolitical tensions have driven up costs, but domestic and FTA-aligned battery material producers are emerging as bright spots. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has spurred over $49 billion in U.S. battery manufacturing investments, creating a buffer against global supply shortagesCalifornia Won’t Replace Expiring $7,500 Federal EV Tax Credit[ 1 ].

It's this push to end large-scale energy projects on private property as well that some in the energy industry consider especially troubling.","There are four new solar projects in New York, adding about 27 megawatts to the state’s grid, as the renewable energy source continues to be the cheapest way to bring more capacity online.

The expanded capacity comes online as U.S. energy demand climbs for the first time in decades and the state pursues its goal of 10 gigawatts of distributed solar generation by 2030.

The four projects are part of an eight-project collaboration between Catalyze, a Texas-based renewables company, and CS Energy, a New Jersey-based solar and energy storage company.

What are Western, Central New York's new solar projects?

Here are the four projects in western and central New York:

Pavilion, Genesee County: This solar farm on Shepard Road has a capacity of 6.5 megawatts from 12,116 solar panels on 40 acres.

Phelps, Ontario County: This 7.2-megwatt facility on state Route 96 includes 13,390 solar panels on 26 acres.

Fabius, Onondaga County: The solar farm includes 11,076 solar panels across 18 acres with a capacity of 6 megawatts.

Fonda, Montgomery County: This facility opened about two months ago with a 7.2-megawatt capacity from 13,365 panels on 21 acres.

The projects were supported by New York State programs such as the Community Adder and Inclusive Community Solar Adder, which supports community solar projects serving low-to-moderate income users.

Four additional projects from the Catalyze and CS Energy partnership, expected to add 25 megawatts to the New York grid, are scheduled for completion in the next year.

Trump administration trying to curtail wind, solar projects

Wind and solar power are two of the fastest-growing energy sectors in the United States and produced as much as 17% of the country’s electricity last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the statistical agency of the Department of Energy.

Since taking office, the Trump administration has paused permits on all new wind and solar projects on public land, onshore and offshore, writes Elizabeth Weise for USA TODAY.

The vast majority of renewable energy projects – 95% – are on private land, according to a report by the Brookings Institution. But many of those require some type of federal approval and are also being stalled by the new rules. It's this push to end large-scale energy projects on private property as well that some in the energy industry consider especially troubling.

“It’s expected that every time you have a major change in administrations, policies on public land might change,"" said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association. “But the willingness of this administration to create political and bureaucratic barriers to private economic activity on private land is something nobody anticipated.”

(P&GJ) — The U.S. Justice Department has entered the legal battle over Enbridge Energy’s Line 5 pipeline, filing a statement of interest in federal court that challenges Michigan’s attempt to shut down the cross-border oil and gas line.

The filing, submitted in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan, argues that Michigan overstepped its authority when it sought to terminate Enbridge’s easement for the 645-mile pipeline, which runs beneath the Straits of Mackinac between Lakes Michigan and Huron.

“The federal government already comprehensively regulates pipeline safety, but Michigan is trying to usurp the Department of Transportation’s statutory authority,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD). “President Trump has made clear that the United States will not tolerate state overreach that interferes with American energy dominance.”

The Justice Department pointed to the Pipeline Safety Act, which gives the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) sole responsibility for interstate pipeline safety standards. By attempting to enforce its own safety rules, the state infringed on PHMSA’s exclusive federal jurisdiction, the filing said.

The statement also emphasized the international dimension of Line 5, citing the U.S.–Canada treaty governing cross-border pipelines. Federal attorneys argued that Michigan’s actions interfere with U.S. foreign policy and treaty obligations.

The legal dispute dates back to 2020, when Michigan issued a notice to revoke Enbridge’s easement across the Straits, citing safety concerns. Enbridge has since fought to keep the line in service, stressing its importance to U.S. and Canadian energy markets.

Matt FoxBBC News NI

Kilroot power station may need to be given an exemption from environmental rules to help guarantee electricity supplies in Northern Ireland this winter.

It has two gas-fired turbines which are currently restricted to running for 1,500 hours per year.

Outages at Ballylumford and Coolkeeragh power stations mean these turbines have already been heavily used this year and are now approaching their annual running time limit, as set by the Northern Ireland Environment Agency.

The company which operates the grid said it is working with the regulator and the Department for the Economy (DfE) to ""unlock restrictions to ensure there is sufficient generation"".

Meanwhile, the department told the BBC it is ""prepared to use all levers available to government"" to address the situation.

""The department has been working with several key stakeholders, including the Environment Agency, to ensure mitigations are put in place to maintain security of supply,"" a DfE spokesperson said.

""Security of supply is a key priority,"" the department added, insisting it will continually work closely with the energy industry to ""ensure the resilience of the system"".

'A challenging year'

On Monday, the System Operator NI (SONI) issued a four day-long system alert, warning of a ""heightened risk"" for supply.

The alert was suspended on Friday afternoon, although the operator has said projections highlight the possibility of further alerts this winter.

In a statement, SONI explained that when it issues an alert ""there is no immediate impact for users of electricity"".

Instead, the alert ""warns of a heightened risk for potential temporary electricity supply issues in the near future"", allowing those working in the electricity sector to take ""pre-planned actions to protect the integrity of the grid"".

The operator said it has been a ""challenging year operationally"" with the prolonged outage at Ballylumford due to damage caused by Storm Darragh, alongside a ""significantly extended maintenance outage"" at Coolkeeragh.

These outages have meant that SONI has had to ""rely more heavily"" on Kilroot, however these plants ""are now approaching the current limit of hours these generators can run"", it said.

The operator added it is ""continuing to work closely with power station operators, the Utility Regulator and the Department for Economy to unlock restrictions to ensure there is sufficient generation to meet system needs and consumer demands as we head into the winter peak"".

'Delicately balanced'

Analysis by Louise Cullen, BBC News NI's BBC News NI agriculture and environment correspondent

While gas may be greener than oil, it is still a fossil fuel and the limits on how many hours Kilroot can use gas for generating power are there for a good reason.

They've been calculated in line with our greenhouse gas emissions targets, as set within the Climate Change Act and the carbon budgets, so reducing emissions means reducing power output.

The limits may be lifted when the plant converts to a combined cycle gas turbine to capture and utilise the residual heat from burning gas. The plan is for that to happen next year.

But this notification shows how delicately balanced our energy system can be when put under pressure.

It adds to the argument for more locally-sourced, sustainable energy – and storage to have it available for the system.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10c4/live/4101a4c0-95a3-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 04:58:30.869261

The recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act (2025) has shifted some timelines on tax policies, and our expert highlights some provisions that New Hampshire business owners should notice.

Panelist: Dana R. Bull, CPA, MST, Vice President of Tax Services at Mason + Rich, masonrich.com

Q: What regulations should business owners be aware of as it relates to tax planning for 2025 and 2026?

A: The current administration recently passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on July 4, 2025. In addition to making permanent many provisions originally set to expire from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2018, the Act also introduces changes that affect deductible expenses and business credits. Here are three changes to take note of.

1) Increased Deductions for Property Purchases

Businesses will benefit from expanded deductions for qualifying property acquired in 2025 and future years, such as:

Bonus Depreciation: A 100% bonus depreciation deduction is available for qualified property acquired and placed in service after January 19, 2025. For assets placed in service between January 1 and January 19, 2025, the rate is reduced to 40%.

Section 179 Expensing: The Section 179 deduction limit increases from $1,250,000 in 2024 to $2,500,000 for 2025 and beyond, with future amounts indexed for inflation. Unlike bonus depreciation, these deductions are typically limited to a business’s net income.

State Consideration: New Hampshire does not allow bonus depreciation and caps Section 179 expensing at $500,000.

2) Research and Experimentation (R&E) Costs

The Act also brings favorable changes for research-based businesses. Beginning in 2025, R&E costs can once again be fully deducted in the year incurred. This reverses the prior requirement (effective 2022–2024) that R&E costs be capitalized and amortized over five years. Eligible small business taxpayers may amend prior-year returns to claim the full deduction for R&E costs for tax returns filed for 2022, 2023 and 2024.

3) Changes to Clean Energy Incentives

Not all provisions were taxpayer-friendly. The Act accelerates the phase-out of certain clean energy credits. The Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit is now set to expire on September 30, 2025 (previously December 31, 2032). Businesses planning to claim this credit must ensure qualifying vehicles are purchased and placed in service by that date.

Q: What are the key takeaways businesses should consider with these tax law changes?

A: Businesses should review their capital investment and research and experimentation (R&E) strategies in light of the new provisions, while also noting the shortened timelines for clean energy incentives. State-specific differences, such as New Hampshire’s unique rules, must be factored into planning. There are additional provisions not addressed here due to space constraints. Because the legislation was enacted quickly, the Treasury Department and IRS are still in the process of issuing detailed guidance on many provisions.

Biofuels have emerged as a point of alignment between the Trump administration and the clean energy industry.
“So there’s a very strong connection to some of the real big priorities that are really important to this administration,” Skor explained.

As Skor recounted, Growth Energy is the largest biofuel trade association in the country, with a network of 130 companies, including John Deere and BASF, and nearly 100 biorefineries, such as ADM, Cargill, and POET. These operations span 33 states, with a particular presence in the Midwest. “We are really the engine of the rural economy,” Skor said. “It goes back to the fact that we help keep small communities going and thriving.”

The conversation emphasized the enduring popularity and legislative success of biofuels in the U.S., with the industry offering value to both political parties. On the one hand, they provide low-carbon energy and decarbonized modes of transportation. On the other, they produce affordable and accessible fuel, contributing to both energy independence and dominance. This bipartisan support was most evident in the budget reconciliation bill that was signed into law earlier this year. Although it cut $545 billion in tax credits that originated in the prior administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, Congress extended and even enhanced the technology-neutral clean fuel production credit, Section 45Z.

Biofuels have emerged as a point of alignment between the Trump administration and the clean energy industry. For example, during President Trump’s first term, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) increased access to higher blends of ethanol. In this term, the president issued an executive order on day one directing the EPA to consider higher-ethanol blend E15. “So there’s a very strong connection to some of the real big priorities that are really important to this administration,” Skor explained.

Skor stated that this support stems from both the President’s loyalty to the U.S. farmer and his emphasis on ‘America First.’ “The administration is making these announcements through the framework of US agriculture and maintaining strong biofuel demand,” she summarized.

Meanwhile, the industry is seeing significant opportunities arise in both the short and long term. On the near horizon, argued Skor, the continued use of ethanol in cars and trucks in the U.S. and abroad is a particular highlight. Domestically, this has recently been spurred by the highest-volume requirements ever proposed by the EPA under the Renewable Fuel Standard. Even California, until now the last state to cap the amount of ethanol that can be blended with gasoline at 10 percent, saw its Senate vote unanimously to allow the sale of E15. Internationally, Canada, Brazil, India, Japan, and Vietnam are also increasing their goals and standards regarding ethanol, providing a market opportunity.

In the longer term, meanwhile, Skor pointed out that a significant amount of innovation is emerging in this space. For example, sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to transform the aviation industry. At the same time, ethanol can replace bunker fuel in the maritime sector and replace diesel in long-haul trucking. In these nascent markets, Skor commented, “We still have to be able to do, for some of them, proof of concept. We’ve got to get regulations in place. We’ve got to be able to produce a commercial scale and get the economics in line. But that’s the blue sky potential.” As these technologies further decarbonize through carbon capture, the application of climate-smart agricultural techniques, and the installation of more clean energy sources, the carbon intensity of these fuels will also continue to decrease.",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/549877374_1227743092726280_3947920055023475192_n-1-e1758291202320.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 03:58:12.493984

It's reasonable, it's well thought out. It is researched and I'm always proud we can find a pass together. And you were a very loud proponent and champion for the state to do something rather unprecedented, which is to dive into our reserves.

When I first became Governor, our reserves were about four percent. I had worked on 14 local government budgets and I knew that my Budget Director in the town of Hamburg always said we need to be about 15 percent. So, I kept building and building the reserves to get us to about an excess of 15 percent. And in so doing it gave me a chance to use that to do a one-time infusion of money to pay off the unemployment insurance debt that was born on the backs of our employers. And when I looked at some of the bills that they were paying based on the number of employees and how much it was adding up, whether you're a small business or large, I said, “If there's one pro-business thing I can do, that'll have a massive impact across the state, it is eliminating this.” But Heather, I want to thank you and congratulate you on working so hard to get that over the finish line.

I know we have some representatives from the REDC. Marsha Gordon is here, the Co-Chair of the Mid-Hudson Regional Economic Development Council, and, of course, head of the Business Council of Westchester. And I know we have a number of elected officials in the room — John McDonald, Gary Warner, and Assemblymember Rivera — is still, or did you leave? You leave on me? Okay. Go Bills, there you go.

But I also know that you've been a little busy with the report. My team made sure I dissected it and read your analysis because I'm always looking for input from all perspectives and certainly the business perspective on what businesses like in New York is the most important to me to hear and to learn from. And I will say it talks about our strengths and it certainly points out the weaknesses, which I am very cognizant of.

You know my own family story, talk about how my dad worked at the steel plant, and struggled. I lived in Lackawanna, but eventually I talked about how he got a college degree. And over years having that credential allowed him to do something quite extraordinary when a few young guys talked to him about joining a company that was only a year old back in 1968. It was something known as a computer services company. How rare was that in Buffalo in 1968. So, my dad took the plunge at age 30 with five of his six little kids. And people at Bethlehem Steel thought he was crazy — that certainly they would go out of business and they did struggle. We had a lot of lean years, but eventually grew into a powerhouse of computer task group. And I know there's many clients in this room. Because as a little kid, I used to go on the client calls. I went and visited Corning and Eastman Kodak and went around the state trying to just get business for him. So, you need to know in my heart there's a very pro-business understanding and appreciation for the risks that's involved and how the winds of change affect you, whether it's out of Washington or tariffs and statewide policies.

And so, I'm very cognizant of that when I look at bills that people are encouraging me to pass. I also say, what is the impact on whomever, but always business as well when I think it's going to have a — what is the impact? Are they involved? Do they have an alternative? Is there something else we can do to get to a position that is going to help our business and not hurt them. So, my philosophy has always been not just from my experience with my own failings, but also my siblings became serial entrepreneurs. They started businesses after businesses, and I was involved in serving as legal counsel to some of them. And so, I know what the regulations are, like I know what the stress is — like I know how to complain about the government, like every business does. But also now that I'm in government in a meaningful way, My job is to also make your jobs easier. You deserve to have a government that's on your side, not on your back. And that's what I'm going to continue fostering for the next many years in government.

So, you've heard some of the economic impact from Blake, I presume. He's my Budget Director because he tells me how the winds are going and sometimes even though he looks like he's perpetually happy and optimistic, I could see the clouds a little bit. And we certainly felt a lot of clouds and saw clouds across his face and indeed our state after July 4th when the dubbed Big Beautiful Bill that I can only call, the Big Ugly Bill was passed because Blake knew that was going to be a huge financial hit on us — what Washington did, and healthcare being in the line of fire number one.

It is a $13.5 billion hit to healthcare systems with the loss of Medicaid subsidies. The State of New York lost $7.5 billion in subsidies like that. We have to make up $3 billion next year, even just this year, midyear — figure out how to come up with the loss of $750 million. So, we have been working intensely on how to do this with minimal pain to people who've come to rely on these services.

We've had more than our share coming our way unanticipated out of Washington and that takes up a lot of my staff’s time and effort. But, we'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. But also, I've charged my staff with finding ways to streamline government. You need to know that's important to me. We don't need excessive government. We don't need excessive programs.

You saw how I took on the CDPAP program. That was a program that was built to provide people to be able to select their own home care provider if they had health problems or debilitating situations — makes all the sense in the world until it's abused. And we had ended up with 700 providers, these financial intermediaries in between the patient and the provider; whereas a state like California with double our population somehow managed to do it all with one financial intermediary. And as a result of this excess and explosive growth in this middleman position, we went from a $1.5 billion program to an $11.5 billion program with the same size population basically except there ended up being so much abuse and we've had many cases brought where the fraud and the waste and abuse. People charging the State of New York for reimbursement when they actually live in Florida or saying that they're helping their grandmother and working 24 hours a day living in her house and charging the state. It was an abuse and I was warned there's going to be a lot of pushback if you try to change that, but I cannot knowingly be the Governor of the State and know that there's programs like that are so wildly expensive. When you look at what the drivers of our Budget, by far it is the Medicaid costs and the healthcare costs and education, and those are set.

Last year, we started our budgeting Medicaid — went up 12 percent before we even opened up the books, we want to get it right, we want to make sure we take care of people, but make sure that anytime we're aware of abuse, we are going to fight it and fight hard because you are ultimately the ones paying for that.

So, I'm trying to look at programs like that and others where we can have substantial savings. This first year, you're saving $500 million from what we did by streamlining that and getting it down to one provider despite massive opposition to those changes. And so I'm looking for more ideas like that, and I'm sure many of you out there see them. I'm on the verge of hiring a top-notch professional to oversee an office that's going to look at regulatory opportunities. I think, is Bob Duffy here? Bob Duffy, something. If you're standing here, I can't — oh, Bob, great to see you again. And I always harken back to the work that you did as Lieutenant Governor and making a real difference in trying to uncover this. But I want to make sure that I get it over the finish line. That's not just identifying areas where we can streamline regulations, but also get it done.

And I just use one example: the seeker process. You heard me talk about this the first year. I said, we need to build more housing in this state. I have to have more housing, whether I'm in the North Country and we have a lot of hospitality businesses, the hotels, the restaurants, people are driving an hour and a half to go to their jobs because they can't afford housing anywhere near these communities. Long Island — same thing out at the East End or other parts. I was just out there meeting supervisors out there. They're starting to finally see that. I've been talking about this for years and I'm right. We need to build more housing for our workforce. And that'll be a great lift for employers in Central New York. I just looked at some modular homes there that we're looking to expand. They look like gorgeous homes by the way, you cannot tell the difference because I have 50,000 jobs coming to Central New York with Micron. So, all across the state, the demand is only growing. But there's barriers and I've tried to take this on and we want to, right now in the process of streamlining our seeker rules, the environmental review process, which I know from my local government days was always the way you could say no to somebody, right? I know how to say yes, I know how to say no. I had 14 years of going over local applications for business development and housing projects. So, I know exactly what it's all about. And so, I just want to make it easier. Let's build more housing, get rid of some of those rules, or at least streamline them and make them common sense.

So, I put out the offer here today. Help us identify areas, and I'll never compromise the health and safety of New Yorkers. So if you've got something that removes the restriction that does that, don't waste my time. But if you have something, it's time has passed, it's obsolete, it's duplicative, it's redundant — bring it to us so we can actually have a thoughtful conversation about this. And I'm trying to expand not just housing, but I also have to expand our energy capabilities intensely. You wouldn't believe the interest in our state now that we successfully landed Micron, and what an accomplishment that was — “People are still talking about how you landed Micron.”

I said, “it’s a secret, I don't want other states to know.”

But a lot of it was personal engagement and showcasing how extraordinary New York is and what a great place it is. You'll find an incredibly dedicated, hardworking workforce for you. But also the university system we have, the feeder system, our community colleges — all this plays into creating an environment that is hospitable for business. But then, if they don't have the energy to power what they're doing, then they have to go somewhere else. So I've taken that on as a personal challenge to me, because I want to get this right and give us all the advantages when it comes to recruiting businesses and helping our businesses here expand.

So, I look at nuclear. Now, you don't hear that out of the mouths of a lot of Democratic Governors, but you should. It's a renewable source. It's clean energy. And I look at what happened when a project was shut down Downstate, Indian Point was shut down a few years ago, I'm the one who inherited that and the decommissioning. We lost 25 percent of the power that was going to New York City without a Plan B. So now, we have more trucks, diesel trucks, transporting liquefied natural gas and home heating oil over the roads. And guess what? Guess how emissions have gone up Downstate because of that one move. So I'm looking at the possibilities, opportunities for nuclear.

Back in June, I had a major press conference putting NYPA in charge of finding a place to do this and getting it going. And we already have four nuclear reactors, three sites in Upstate New York. And after I announced it, you would not believe the number of communities that came knocking on my door, “Can we have it in our community?” I won't send it Downstate because that's fine with me, I don't need a battle, but Upstate wants this because they want to power the industries that are coming, whether it's Edwards Vacuum, another supply chain element that we were able to recruit with 600 jobs after the Micron announcement. There's so many great things happening.

I was just up here. Last week, Micro Bird, we were about to lose Nova Bus, big employer up near Plattsburgh. And we were able to find a company from Quebec that is now — despite them being real unhappy with our country. And I had to do a little smoothing over there that New York really loves Canada, “We're not going to try and take you over. So you're safe and we'll forgive what you did in the war of 1812.” But I digress. Buffalo was burned to the ground. But I forget all that. But when we were able to land this opportunity to bring in a company from Quebec to take over that facility, not one employee missed a beat. They went from the fear of losing their jobs, 350 people, good-paying manufacturing jobs, about to lose them. And we structured a deal to say one day you're working for Nova, the next day you're working for Micro Bird and you miss nothing in between. And I was so proud to see we were able to accomplish it.

That's just one example of where I get very involved, but also know that I can do more to promote businesses Upstate and Downstate as well.

But if I can get the power, if I can get nuclear going, if I can reduce some of the regulations associated with that — and I've had conversations with Washington about this. I told the President I need to have more of an all of the above approach to our energy solutions. I need you to leave offshore wind alone, because Empire Wind would power — it's 1,500 jobs — half a million homes in Brooklyn powered by clean offshore wind energy. Next year we're expecting it, then it was shut down like that. So we've had to have some conversations. The President knows I'm all in for nuclear. We're working closely on that to reduce some of their regulatory timeframe as well.

So, once we get this underway, focus on hydro and all of our other opportunities, my friends. There's no holding us back, because we have a world-class, educated workforce. We're going to continue this. You saw what we did with community colleges in response to employers saying that they need more employees that would have skills, we identified some industry sectors where there were shortages of workers. You know this one, it's health care. We have a huge shortage of health care workers. But also advanced manufacturing, the trades, clean energy as well as semiconductor manufacturing. So we are providing free community college education to any adult age 25 to 55 who will go back to school and maybe never entertained those fields and never could do it because of the cost. We're covering the cost of their community college education where they can now step into a four year institution. Just by announcing this months ago, we have 16,000 students who are now going to community college. And they’re learning skills that are going to be beneficial to all of you as employers. That's how we create the synergy we need between our workforce and our institutions as well as your workplace.

I'm working on housing, working on energy, working on workforce development, more recruiting, infrastructure projects — I love building things. We're just going gangbusters; creating tens of thousands of jobs for anybody from Downstate, New York City.

I look at something like the bus station, the Midtown Bus Terminal. Have you ever been in there? Stay away. It's scary. But it's going to be gorgeous. It's a $10 billion project, 6,000 jobs. But these are the kind of projects that — and Penn Station, people go by them year after year and just assume it always has to be that way, it always has to look like that. I believe in the preeminence of New York State and how we must showcase ourselves in a proud way where our infrastructure, our airports and our transportation hubs really gleam and look welcoming and magnificent and should be talked about.

And so, I'm on the cusp of more announcements along those lines, but every one of the projects — the Gateway Tunnel, that was locked up for years because governors couldn't get along and the President wouldn't get along and there’s all this, forget that, we have 10,000 jobs right there alone. So I'm all about creating jobs and opportunities and affordability as well.

You've told me to talk about affordability, number one issue, in addition to public safety. And I just hosted a law enforcement reception at the Governor's residence this morning — that's where I came from — honoring police officers and people in law enforcement, public safety all around the state, letting them know we believe in them. I have their backs because they have ours. We'll always overfund them or fund them dramatically, $3 billion we've put into law enforcement.

And my friends, share this statistic. The numbers of crimes are declining extraordinarily. Going down dramatically. I'll just put it that way, going down dramatically. And we are at lows. Whether it was the lowest crimes on the subway, July and August, in recorded history, some of the lowest murder rates in history, now we're starting to record them. I've been all over Upstate helping with law enforcement grants to help our local governments. And it's making a real difference.

We never rest on our laurels. We're not done. More to do. But I'm telling you, compared to when I was first elected Governor, the numbers are staggering, heading in the right direction. I'm really proud of that. That's foundational. No matter where your workplace is, your employees need to feel safe getting there. So we’re taking care of that. We focus on that.

As I mentioned, we have to get them housing. We have to get them reliable infrastructure to get to their housing. We have to make sure that we're making these investments. But in the long term, I just, at a high level, want to make sure that all of you are proud to be in New York. And I'm here to say thank you. I know some of you're even being recruited to other states. Say no, okay? Just say no. Remember that slogan from First Lady Reagan? Say no. Stay here. We’ve got a Governor who's going to look out for us and make sure that we thrive. And that is my commitment to you because when you're doing well, when you're hiring, when you're expanding that is a very good trajectory for New York.

And again, even our growth numbers in jobs, we have added 800,000 new jobs — private sector jobs. Everyone says, “Oh, you're hiring in government jobs,” — private sector jobs since I became Governor. And our rate of growth is achieving the numbers where I'm satisfied, but not quite there yet.

I could go over a whole list of other projects. They're exciting, and I'm proud of them, but know that I'm going to keep standing with you year after year and telling you that we are not done yet. We're going to make sure that not only are you proud to be here, because I'm proud to have you here, that the rest of the country sees this and they're really starting to.

I'll close with one more thought because I find this one of the most exciting. What we have done in putting New York on the map as a tech hub, the word is out. I was at the Economic Club speaking yesterday. And it's not just Micron. Not just Micron. But it is what we're doing with artificial intelligence. Now, there's a lot of fear associated with this, and it is a disruptive technology, but it is here and we can either embrace it or condemn it. And I say we embrace it because whoever harnesses the power of AI today will own the next generations of power. And I want that to happen here. And it is happening here.

I launched Empire AI. People were like, “What are you talking about?” And I want to thank the legislators for having the faith, when this first came to you for support, that we could invest State dollars leveraged with private sector dollars, leveraged with powering our universities all together and create the nation's largest supercomputer dedicated to public good and research. Largest in the nation outside a private company. Guess what? It's no longer a dream. It's a $500 million investment and is already at the University at Buffalo. And I didn't just do that as a hometown call. The power up there is plentiful with the hydroelectric power and I had plenty of space. But it is not just for Buffalo, it is for the entire state. And that's the beauty of this.

And we have more people, more Ph.D. candidates, more faculty — I was out there last weekend — faculty members who came from California because they heard about this because they will have, at their fingertips, power that is not available anywhere else in the nation. And what are they doing with this? They're solving society's problems and health challenges and doing research and devising new therapies. Work that would've taken months and months to do, they can do in hours. And you know what? As great as that sounds we're just about to launch, that was Alpha-Beta, 11 times faster than that.

So, that leads me to say that this is putting us on the map. In California, my friends in Silicon Valley are saying they wish their Governor had done this because we are the first in the nation to pay attention. And literally yesterday, I had a company that talked to me about a $50 billion AI investment in Upstate New York. So stay tuned.

But this is the scale that I'm talking about. And that may not be your industry, but it may power some facet of your industry someday. And you're going to want that. And this is going to give you the competitive edge against everybody else. And that's my job as Governor, to make sure that we have all the advantages. We know what we have. We know how great we are. But when we're competing with the rest of the world in other states, we have to have tangible attractions to bring them here. And that's exactly what I'm focused on.

So, thank you very much for listening. Thank you for believing in New York State. And again, very proud of your Governor. Thank you, everybody.",https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/2025-09/BusinessCouncilHero.jpg?h=851b5d7e&itok=1bnyBKld,N,,2025-09-20 14:00:44.965904

Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) and Independent System Operators (ISOs) would be tasked with developing proposals that prioritize these projects and submitting them to FERC.

Grid operators would further need to demonstrate why specific projects should move forward more quickly and explain how those projects improve grid reliability or resilience. They would also have to invite public comment before filing proposals and regularly report to FERC on the impacts to grid stability.

The legislation comes amid concerns that the U.S. electric grid is unprepared for surging demand from data centers, new manufacturing and widespread electrification. Generation projects, many of them renewable energy, remain stalled in record-long interconnection backlogs.

Nuclear microreactors, by contrast, could sit on land the size of a football field and power a whole town.

However, after decades of fraught relationships between the nuclear industry and communities in many parts of the U.S., building these tiny reactors requires reckoning with the complex history of nuclear technology and rebuilding public trust.

Microreactor technology for use in towns or cities hasn’t been developed yet, but many researchers have been building the case for its use.

For example, this technology could benefit college campuses, remote communities in Alaska primarily powered by oil and diesel, tech companies looking for reliable electricity for AI data centers, companies in need of high-temperature heat for manufacturing and industrial processes, mining operations that need a clean energy source and even military bases in search of a secure source of energy.

I’m a nuclear engineer who has been exploring nuclear microreactors’ potential. My research and teaching focuses on some of the questions that would come with placing miniature nuclear reactors close to where people live.

Microreactors: A history

Nuclear microreactors as a technology are both new and old. In the 1940s and ’50s, the American military and government began developing small reactors and nuclear batteries to power submarines and spacecraft.

After developing these small-scale reactors and batteries for various missions, the nuclear industry’s focus shifted to power reactors. They began to rapidly scale up their designs from producing tens of megawatts to the gigawatt-scale systems common around the world today.

These historical reactors were small because scientists were still learning about the physics and engineering underlying these systems. Today, engineers are deliberately designing microreactors to be small.

Microreactors aren’t to be confused with small modular reactors – these are often scaled-down, modularized versions of large reactors. Small, modular reactors can be built as single units or in clusters to achieve the same capacity as a full-size reactor. Microreactors would be smaller than these, with a power capacity under 20 megawatts.

Manufacturing and cost

Because they’re small, microreactors wouldn’t require a massive, multiyear construction project like large nuclear power reactors. Several units could be assembled in a factory each year and shipped off to their final destinations in a truck or on a barge.

Large reactors are not inherently flawed – in many ways, they remain the more economic nuclear energy option. However, electric utility companies have recently hesitated to invest in large reactors because of the multibillion-dollar nature of these projects.

Microreactors require a different but equally significant kind of investment. Though individual units will have a significantly lower price tag, building a factory to produce these microreactors is a massive undertaking. Reactor companies are waiting for their order books to fill up before investing in factories.

It’s a catch-22. Without orders, technology developers are unlikely to build microreactor factories. And future users of these new reactors are unlikely to place orders until this new style of production has been tested and the initial units built.

Future users are also waiting to see what the microreactors will actually cost. Reactor developers have put forward many cost estimates, but in the past, estimates for nuclear reactors haven’t always been reliable. Developers likely won’t know the true numbers until the reactors are actually built.

Initial “first of a kind” units will undoubtedly cost significantly more than later units. As manufacturers learn the best production processes, they’ll be able to make more reactors for less.

In this paradoxical situation in which developers are waiting for orders and users are waiting to see the economics of initial reactors, government funding for building demonstration projects could help usher microreactor technology from early designs to the market.

First movers such as national laboratories, universities, data centers and military bases that are willing to buy these initial reactors also have a role to play in validating the economic feasibility of these new reactors.

Today’s microreactors

In a nuclear reactor, the combination of nuclear fuel and coolant – which is the substance used to both cool the fuel and transport the heat generated by it – used in its design determines what situations it will work best in. Many nonwater coolants can allow reactors to operate at lower pressures, which is a little more safe.

The microreactors being developed today are based on a wide range of reactor technologies and make use of many different combinations of nuclear fuels and coolants.

Some reactors, such as the submarine propulsion reactors, are small, pressurized water reactors – the same basic technology used in most large-scale nuclear power plants. Others use configurations that resemble the small reactors in spacecraft. Still others make use of nuclear fuel and coolant combinations previously attempted in much larger reactors, such as high-temperature gas reactors, sodium fast reactors and even molten salt reactors.

Though encompassing a range of technologies, microreactors are all significantly simpler than the large reactors in use today. In many cases, they have few to no moving parts.

Microreactors, by virtue of being significantly simpler, are going to be more knowable. Because they’re easier to study and understand, simpler reactor systems have fewer points of failure and safety concerns.

Complex systems, such as the large nuclear power reactors, can be fundamentally unknowable, with unexpected entanglements of “unknown unknowns” creating instabilities, safety concerns and potential for failure. Large reactors operate safely today because we have learned about these unknown unknowns over decades of operation. Microreactors, because of their simplicity, will fundamentally be safer and more predictable than the large reactors were when they were first built.

Siting microreactors

Although the Department of Energy oversees microreactor demonstration projects, commercial deployment of microreactors requires approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which could take several years and may ultimately determine how soon commercial reactors can be built. Several designs are now approaching or in the early stages of review.

To keep people safe, large reactors have designated emergency planning zones – usually 10 and 50 miles around – which require different degrees of planning and protection to enter. The 10-mile zone has specific shelters and evacuation plans in place, while people in the 50-mile zone may need to take precautions about what they eat and drink in the event of a catastrophic accident but will not need to evacuate.

Because microreactors are smaller and simpler, developers and regulators may significantly reduce their emergency planning zones. The zones could extend only to the facility’s site boundary, or perhaps a few hundred meters beyond it.

A reduced emergency planning zone could mean that microreactors could be built in towns and cities, or embedded in remote communities. They might one day become as ubiquitous as the solar panels and windmills you see when driving through the countryside. And like the submarine reactors that can power a small underwater community of 100, one microreactor could power a rural town.

But even if siting a nuclear microreactor near a town is technically feasible, would the community accept it?

Public engagement

My lab’s ongoing research suggests that the answer to this question is contingent on how technology developers engage with the communities that may host a microreactor. If they attempt to unilaterally decide, announce and defend their decision to build a microreactor without input, communities will likely push back.

However, if developers work with communities to understand their hopes, concerns and priorities, they will likely find that many people are receptive to hyperlocal nuclear energy facilities.

My team’s initial findings suggest that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach for designing these facilities. Each community will have its own set of preferences that developers will need to navigate alongside the engineering questions.

In our discussions with community members in southeast Michigan, my research team has seen interest in designing these small energy facilities as a feature of the community that’s easily accessible to local residents. Community members designing hypothetical microreactor facilities with us have proposed shared spaces, recreational facilities, onsite visitor centers or science museums, and public art projects. Instead of hiding these facilities out of sight, they want these places to be inviting and beautiful.

CALIFORNIA POLICY IS ALWAYS CHANGING: Know your next move.","With help from Alex Nieves and Camille von Kaenel

GREEN UNION ENERGY: Close your eyes and think of the power players you’d expect to be pushing state leaders on California climate policy. Are you imagining the autoworkers union? No. But you should be.

The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America sponsored SB 787, a bill on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk that would require a slew of state agencies to collaborate on building out the supply chain for clean energy industries including zero emission vehicles and their batteries, offshore wind energy and heat pumps.

Conventional thinking says UAW is a surprising sponsor for a renewable energy bill, but Mike Miller, the union’s region six director, doesn’t agree. Miller, who represents over 120,000 members across California and eight other western states, sees himself as part of a long lineage of environmentalist labor leaders. He described climate change as “the signature challenge of our time” in an August UAW report.

UAW is a very different union than the coalition that emerged from the Detroit auto plants in the 1930s. Today, the organization represents workers in local governments, hospitals, nonprofits, and universities. Miller himself came to UAW through academia, cutting his teeth organizing fellow teaching assistants at UCLA in the 1990s.

We spoke with Miller to learn why the labor leader decided to throw the heft of his union behind environmental reforms, and how he thinks the effort will benefit his members in the end.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Where did the idea come from for SB 787?

Well, the majority of our membership believes climate change is a crisis, and we need to move far more aggressively to tackle that crisis. You know, manufacturing is also in the DNA of the UAW. We need to find a way to thread these two goals together.

Industrial policy also is a historic core of who the UAW is, whether it was meeting manufacturing needs during World War Two or bolstering the post war boom. We’ve always believed it’s necessary for working people to engage in industrial policy.

So we decided about two years ago that we needed to take this seriously. We worked with some outstanding academics and working people to develop a vision for growing the clean industrial economy in California through policy.

Manufacturing has been on a long term decline since the late 80s. In California, we’ve lost close to a million manufacturing jobs in a variety of industrial sectors. It’s important that we grow these jobs back.

We really believe in and support California’s decarbonization goals. Climate change is a huge crisis, and one that we need to address quickly.

We think that one of the best ways to have the collective political will to make that happen is to have a strategic industrial policy that creates good middle class manufacturing jobs in the sectors of the economy that need to decarbonize, like batteries, building decarbonization, heat pumps, industries like that, offshore wind.

Can you share more about how you came to this moment of having climate change issues be such a major focus for you?

Hurricane Katrina, I mean you could go on and on.

I talked a little bit about the UAW’s DNA. UAW helped found Earth Day. And [former UAW president] Walter Reuther and after him Doug Fraser, I’ve seen quotes of them, and I’ll get these wrong, but I can paraphrase them, testifying before Congress: ‘What good does it do to to make more money, make enough money to go on vacation, if the lake you’re going to go on vacation to is polluted? What good does it do to have more time off if the air where you live is too polluted to breathe?’

So we’ve always understood the connection between the environment we live in and the environment we work in. And so it’s been an issue for us for a long time. I think that the stark climate crises that you see, and things like the wildfires in LA this year, really helped drive that home and make it a more pressing, salient issue.

Would you describe yourself as an environmentalist?

Yes.

I’m struck that if the policy works out the way you’re hoping for, it would benefit workers, but presumably it would also benefit people who are running companies, people in the management and investor class. Why is it that UAW sees it as part of its responsibility to help shepherd along policies that also help this investor class and management class?

You have to have a thriving business, a profitable business, to have a workforce. Auto companies where the auto workers work have to make profits to give pay increases to the workers.

The fight isn’t about the success of the company. The workers are often very invested in the success of the company, very proud of the cars and buses and trucks that they build. The fight is over what the workers rights in the workplace are.

That takes a number of forms: The right not to be harassed, the right not be bullied, the right to leave work in the same way that you came in, to work in a safe environment, to have control over your schedule, to have time off to spend with your family, to have paid parental leave, paid sick leave, and to share the profits of the company. The conflict in the collective bargaining process is negotiating over who controls production and in whose interest and who profits from the work that is done at the company. And we’re squarely on the side of the workers playing a very decisive role in all of those processes. — NB

ENERGY CARE PACKAGE: Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the sweeping package of bills Friday to boost oil drilling, rescue wildfire-threatened utilities and extend the state’s cap-and-trade program.

The package, which came together in a last-minute agreement after weeks of negotiations with lawmakers, represents a compromise between increasing fossil fuel extraction in an effort to stave off in-state refinery closures and continuing to ratchet down greenhouse gas emissions.

“We’ve got to manifest our ideals and our goals, and so this lays it out, but it lays it out without laying tracks over folks,” Newsom said, against a backdrop of towering redwood trees projected on the screen of a planetarium in a San Francisco science museum. “We set the tone and pace for the rest of the nation.”

The legislature’s focus on energy emerged in January as leaders promised to tackle affordability, which gained even more political urgency as wildfires and refinery closures raised the threat of higher electricity and gasoline costs. Two of the bills, which allow California utilities to join a West-wide energy market and increase oil drilling in Kern County, garnered Republican votes.

The renewal of the state’s carbon market, which Newsom committed to after President Donald Trump threatened to dismantle state climate laws in April, gives the governor a climate win at a time when the state is losing other core pieces of its climate strategy, like its mandated phase-out of new gas-powered cars by 2035. And the package includes a spending plan for roughly $4 billion in annual cap-and-trade revenues, including $1 billion in guaranteed yearly funding for the state’s controversial high-speed rail project.

Utilities will also benefit from an $18 billion boost to the state’s wildfire fund, a pot funded by utility company shareholders and ratepayers to help pay wildfire-related claims. And the final piece of the package will strengthen air quality monitoring in communities disproportionately impacted by pollution. — CvK, NB, AN

WHERE’S THE REBATE?: Newsom is retreating on his commitment to restart a state rebate program for EV buyers to backfill the expiring $7,500 federal tax credit.

Just minutes after signing the energy package, Newsom acknowledged at a press conference that the state “can’t make up” for the Biden-era incentive that the Trump administration will end on Sept. 30.

The announcement comes after Newsom said last November that he would propose creating a new version of a state rebate program if Republicans went after federal incentives. California ended its broad rebate program in 2023 and replaced it with a system focused on low-income drivers in certain disadvantaged communities.

“We can’t make up for federal vandalism of those tax credits, but we can continue to make the unprecedented investments in infrastructure, which we’re doing,” he said.

Prior to Newsom’s announcement Friday, five car manufacturers — Audi, Honda, Hyundai, Rivian and Volkswagen — had called on the governor and legislative leaders to create a $5,000 rebate program that would last until July 1, 2028. Under the terms proposed by the companies, cars priced up to $55,000 and trucks and SUVs up to $80,000 would be eligible for the rebate.

And state agencies released a joint list of recommendations for supporting the EV market last month, including “point-of-sale rebates, vouchers, or other credits” to backfill the expiring federal tax incentives. — AN

The speakers stepped to the podium in the dimly-lit room with a towering projection of redwood trees above them. Meanwhile, the TV news cameramen grumbled in the back about the terrible lighting. It seems that the governor agreed.

“This is a horrible setup, I can’t see a damn one of you,” Newsom said. The last time he spoke in the auditorium, he gave a marathon San Francisco state of the city speech stretching seven and a half hours, and earning sneers from the local press. “This brings back some memories that my staff, particularly my old mayoral staff, does not want to be brought back up.” — NB

(Lane is chair of the West Virginia Public Service Commission)","The Public Service Commission of West Virginia has been at the forefront of discussions on the importance of having a reliable energy source for this nation.

While never downplaying the importance of all fuels, we consistently advocate for having energy that doesn’t falter when there’s no wind or no sun shining.

We’ve found that coal and natural gas, both abundant in the Mountain State, are reliable sources for powering electric generation plants.

In support of this idea, the administration in Washington declared a national energy emergency soon after it came into office.

As part of that initiative, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced it would fast-track approval for projects involving coal, gas, oil, and minerals on public lands. (May 30, 2025)

As a result, environmental reviews of permits that previously took a year to complete could be done in as few as two weeks.

More complicated environmental impact statements that usually take two years to complete could be done in four weeks.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum says the federal government intends to cut through unnecessary delays so it can fast-track the development of American energy and critical minerals.

And the administration has taken steps under the emergency declaration to promote fossil fuels in particular.

Just recently, the U.S. Supreme Court narrowed the scope of environmental review on some major energy projects under the National Environmental Policy Act. (May 31, 2025)

This law requires an agency to produce an environmental impact statement that must address significant effects expected to be caused by a project, and to suggest alternative ways of making a lesser impact.

In its unanimous ruling, the nation’s highest court reversed an appeals court decision.

The appeals court said the agency should have broadened its study to include environmental effects upstream and downstream of the project. The Supreme Court reversed that finding.

The court also said citizens could not use the courts to challenge the environmental effects beyond the immediate project at hand.

This decision is in line with the administration’s concern for energy independence and our use of fossil fuels to power this nation.

It remains important to all of us, as the demand for electric power continues to grow in this country, that we continue to have a reliable source for that energy.

These two matters should help us on the way to energy independence.

The EPA administrator has welcomed the new approach to the energy sector in the United States","The EPA, or Environmental Protection Agency, has withdrawn the proposed coal-ash changes for the sector and reopened the sector to potential rulemaking changes that the EPA is hoping to wrap up as quickly as possible. In 2015, the EPA published its findings from an extensive study into CCRs(coal combustion residuals), commonly known as coal ash, from coal-fired power plants. Those findings enabled the EPA to establish new rules for the disposal of coal ash from coal-powered plants across the United States. However, the EPA is following a new directive championed by the Trump administration’s new approach to the energy sector in America.

The Environmental Protection Agency has made several changes to the rules around CCRs

When the EPA published its new direct final rules, the proposal was met with the warm embrace of the companies and individuals operating in the coal sector in the United States. It states that the rule is a direct result of the extensive study done into the effects of coal ash on the environment and public health. The direct final rule establishes technical requirements for CCR landfills and surface impoundments under subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA.

That RCRA is the primary rule set for operators in the coal sector in the United States. However, following a new ruling by the EPA, that direct rule is now going to feature some significant changes, thanks in no small part to the efforts of the Trump administration. The new policies and executive orders implemented by Donald Trump aim at increasing the standing of the energy sector in the United States by easing regulations and providing more flexibility for owners and operators in the energy sector.

The EPA proposes a significant change to the two-part Facility Evaluation Report

The two-part Facility Evaluation Report is essential to establish certain requirements for coal mine operators in the United States. Under the Biden administration, the Facility Evaluation Report, or FER, was split into two phases. Which took up valuable time and resources that cost the operators and eventually the public vast amounts of taxpayer dollars.

The proposed change comes in the two-phase FER process that companies and operators are forced to endure. Under the new EPA guidelines, championed by the Trump administration, the FER process can be completed simultaneously, instead of the traditional two-part process it currently uses. FER part 1 requires the operator to conduct a ” review of readily and reasonably available records regarding where CCR was either routinely and systematically placed on land, or where facility activities otherwise resulted in measurable accumulations of CCR on land.

FER part 2 requires on-the-ground testing. And under the old rules, those two reports were to be submitted separately. The proposed rule change would allow companies to merge FER Part 1 and FER Part 2 into a single submission, due on February 8, 2027. It is not the first action taken by the EPA to align with the new administration’s approach to the energy sector.

Republicans in Congress and the White House are killing this subsidy, and the last day to buy a used EV and benefit from it is September 30, 2025.

There are dozens of electric cars on the market in the US these days, so you can search out used options for whatever model is more appealing to you (as long as they fit the necessary requirements), but I’m going to highlight examples of some of my favorites in this article. Before I get to my favorites, though, these are currently EV models on the market in the United States:

There are also some discontinued models, like the Chevy Bolt and BMW i3, out there.

Now, the list above is not really a perfect list for used EVs you can get the $4,000 tax credit to help buy. The car you’re buying has to cost $25,000 or less, and it has to be a 2023 or earlier model year — many of the models above can’t be had for $25,000 or less, and several models didn’t come to market until after 2023.

Four models I think could be especially appealing for getting the $4,000 used EV tax credit include the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6, and Volkswagen ID.4. (There are also far more Tesla Model Y and Tesla Model 3 vehicles on the market, of course, if you want to go the Tesla route.)

Kia EV6

Carfax shows several used Kia EV6s for under $20,000, and many more for just over $20,000. Naturally, there are typically reasons for why the cheapest options are so cheap — high mileage, a branded title, an accident history, etc. Sometimes it pays off to spend just a little bit more to get the best deal. The above model was still priced at just $20,415 before the $4,000 tax credit. Not too shabby!

Ford Mustang Mach-E

There are numerous Ford Mustang Mach-Es available for under $20,000, but watch out for high mileage or other features. Above is one appealing one I found — just about $20,000, under 50,000 miles, 2023 model year.

Hyundai IONIQ 5

Similar to the models above, the IONIQ 5 is a crossover that hits the sweet spot of comfortable passenger space, good range, and price. There are a bunch of options near the $15,000 mark, or you can get a vehicle without too many miles on it for around $20,000–25,000. The option above stood out to me as a good buy.

Volkswagen ID.4

Last but not least, we have the Volkswagen ID.4. Many of the same points noted above about the other models apply to the Volkswagen ID.4 as well. However, you can go even further and get an ID.4 for just over $10,000 if you are brave enough to buy a vehicle with high mileage or a branded title. To me, this car looks like a great steal: $16,000, 61,000 miles, 2021 model year.

Leading VPP providers, utilities, OEMs, industry think-tanks and non-profits are forming working groups, partnerships and consortiums advancing interoperability in the VPP market.
If the incremental cost of developing and adopting standardized interoperability protocols exceeds its value, VPP platforms and OEMs will not advance tech agnostic platforms.
Advice for utilities Emergence of a technology agnostic VPP market will take place incrementally over many years.","The virtual power plant market today is fragmented and inefficient, dominated by technology-specific programs and operating platforms that lack interoperability. As a result, neither the market nor individual VPP providers have achieved significant economies of scale.

The majority of VPPs include single distributed energy resource technologies, such as smart thermostats or commercial battery energy storage systems, and limit participation to a handful of original equipment manufacturers.

Though some providers have developed largely tech-agnostic VPP platforms through APIs, interoperability hurdles can cause latency and connectivity issues. While open protocols are emerging, a small fraction of original equipment manufacturers today employ interoperability standards that would allow their products to communicate seamlessly with a range of VPP and distributed energy resource management systems, or DERMS.

As a result, distributed resource owners and operators face limited opportunities for VPP participation. In fact, fewer than 1 in 5 MW of installed DER capacity is enrolled in VPPs today, meaning the potential of DERs remains largely unrealized.

This evolution in the VPP market towards open protocols and interoperability is unfolding against the backdrop of an energy system under tremendous strain. Industrial on-shoring, AI-fueled data center expansion, and transportation electrification are some of the forces shaping today’s energy landscape, contributing to unprecedented load growth and capacity constraints that threaten to overwhelm the system. Now, more than ever, we need to unlock sources of additional capacity on the grid — and load flexibility through tech-agnostic VPPs holds out significant potential to help meet this challenge.

The future is tech agnostic

We believe the future of VPPs is tech agnostic, and a key driver is interoperability.

Interoperability is crucial for deploying certain consumer technologies efficiently at scale. The evolution of EV charging towards interoperability provides an analog to the VPP market.

For EV charging networks to grow and scale effectively, they need to serve a broad range of electric vehicles, and vice-versa — EV charge ports must integrate with a variety of charging stations enabling drivers to reliably get from point A to point B.

In much the same way, virtual power plants must foster cross-technology participation by a variety of DERs and brands to compete with traditional power plants in providing firm, dispatchable power at scale to utilities and wholesale energy markets.

DER manufacturers, in turn, must adopt protocols facilitating communication and integration with a wider set of VPP and DERMS technologies (non-wire alternatives) to augment traditional generation assets and offset costly transmission and distribution investments by utilities and network operators.

Our confidence in a tech agnostic future for VPPs is grounded in economics. In a market populated by single technology programs, some VPP providers will adapt to integrate multiple technology types in order to capture additional market share. On the flip side, a profitable deviation for OEMs is to begin offering DER products that enable participation across multiple VPP platforms, enhancing their appeal to consumers and increasing market share.

This back-and-forth interplay between OEMs and VPPs will move the market towards a tech agnostic state. The transition, however, will not include all VPP providers. It will look different in the short term versus the long run, and may take different forms based on regional, macroeconomic, and regulatory factors.

Sources of variability

While cross-technology VPPs may be dominant five years from now, it is unlikely the market will be uniformly tech agnostic.

Differences in business strategy, technological capabilities, OEM partnerships, customer enrollment models, market share and name recognition will push VPP companies in different directions as they adapt to an increasingly tech-agnostic marketplace. Name-brand OEMs and installers, with in-house VPP technologies and exclusive partnerships, may cordon off their corners of the market, strengthening bilateral agreements with partners and utilities and working to deepen proprietary moats. These VPP providers are less likely to advance the cause of universal interconnectivity.

By contrast, DER aggregators whose business models are built on cross-technology enrollment through non-exclusive partnerships and OEM integrations will champion open protocols and adoption of interoperability standards. Leading VPP providers, utilities, OEMs, industry think-tanks and non-profits are forming working groups, partnerships and consortiums advancing interoperability in the VPP market.

Electric Power Research Institute and Kraken’s Mercury Consortium, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers’ IEEE 2030.5 DER interconnection standard, Rocky Mountain Institute’s VP3 consortium, Duke Energy’s Open Field Message Bus (OpenFMB) and Linux Foundation’s open source microgrid initiative are examples of this movement towards technology agnostic tools and platforms built around interoperability.

In order for a tech-agnostic market to emerge, VPP platforms and DERs must both adopt open protocols facilitating cross-technology enrollment and interoperability, which will take years. Even once most new DER technologies adopt open protocols, the bulk of legacy DERs on the system will not be fully interoperable. VPP companies leveraging legacy APIs to integrate a variety of DER technologies will play an important role bridging the gap between today’s fleet of non-interoperable assets and the tech-agnostic future market.

Ultimately, regional differences in energy markets, utility governance, clean energy regulation, taxation and economic incentives will largely determine where VPPs take hold and how well they scale. As a result, there are limits to the scalability of VPPs in the US, even as they evolve to be tech-agnostic.

Read More in Grid Security & Reliability

New regulatory policy by states or regulators could accelerate the evolution of tech-agnostic VPPs in certain states or regions by requiring the adoption of open protocols for systems communication and integration, or by mandating utility-sponsored, tech-agnostic VPP programs for customers. Meanwhile, the extension or expiration of tax incentives favoring VPP development could sustain or slow the growth and scaling of VPPs by state or region.

Too big to fail?

It is worth considering what factors could cause the market to remain fragmented and proprietary, rather than evolving towards standardization and interconnection. In other words, what could keep the market from becoming tech agnostic?

If the incremental cost of developing and adopting standardized interoperability protocols exceeds its value, VPP platforms and OEMs will not advance tech agnostic platforms. Given the magnitude and urgency of demand growth by data centers and hyperscalers, the value of additional capacity is increasing rapidly. As utilities begin to face capacity shortfalls resulting from AI-driven load growth, the value of firm, dispatchable resources will rise.

Against this backdrop, and given the sheer volume of untapped DER resources sitting on the grid, the market potential of tech-agnostic VPP platforms likely outweighs the cost. In effect, consumers, aggregators and utilities are leaving money on the table by not connecting these devices to VPPs — an opportunity they cannot afford to ignore.

Advice for utilities

Emergence of a technology agnostic VPP market will take place incrementally over many years. This provides utilities with the advantage of foresight, and the opportunity to prepare in advance for an optimized, tech-agnostic, grid-to-grid-edge future state. There are several steps utilities can take:

Incremental progress is good. Utilities do not have to accomplish everything at once in the transition to unified, tech-agnostic VPPs. An incremental approach is optimal given the nascent, rapidly evolving nature of the market. As an example, utilities will benefit from working with tech-agnostic VPP aggregators and program providers leveraging product-specific APIs for integration today, rather than waiting for the emergence of market-wide interoperability. Through partnerships with today’s emerging tech agnostic VPP providers, utilities can enroll a broader set of existing customer-sited DERs in the near-term, increasing MW under management and learning how to integrate these resources into existing utility systems optimally.

Single-technology VPPs are valuable. Utilities should not shy away from proprietary, single-technology VPPs in the near-term, while waiting for interoperable DER technologies and VPP platforms to mature. Single product VPP providers are dominant in today’s market and are valuable partners in enrolling more DER resources, providing utilities valuable load flexibility experience and learning opportunities, and engaging the customers they will need to operate tech-agnostic grid to-grid-edge dynamic systems in the future.

Foundational systems are key. Utilities must begin working now to implement the systems that will enable them to derive full value from tech-agnostic VPPs. It is important to begin trials, testing and implementation of DERMS, ADMS and other supporting systems that will lay the foundation for their participation in tech agnostic, utility-scale VPPs in the future.

The future of VPPs is technology agnostic, but that transition will take years to achieve and will take different forms depending on regional, political and regulatory differences.

Consortiums and partnerships will play a large role in the emergence of open protocols and interoperability, though not all VPP providers will move towards tech-agnostic platforms. As the market evolves, utilities should undertake incremental investments and projects, building the systems and customer engagement platforms they will need to realize the full benefits of tech-agnostic VPPs in a dynamic, optimized grid-to-grid-edge future.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/_a4sXwb144qIWPgkDG7QualaCOCteRwNjTfpRTucZ5s/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Tb2xlaWxfMS5qcGVn.webp,N,,2025-09-20 12:02:21.888023

Industry leaders must design tangible strategies that align with core manufacturing processes while avoiding superficial efforts that may lead to accusations of greenwashing.

At Sustainability LIVE: Climate Week NYC 2025, the CSO Strategy Summit gathers pioneers from across the manufacturing landscape to share insights on effective sustainability integration.

Attending this event provides an opportunity to glean valuable information about successful methodologies and forward-looking initiatives.

Adapting to an evolving risk landscape

The manufacturing industry faces a rapidly transforming risk landscape, with shifting regulations and increased scrutiny on sustainability practices.

As noted by the World Economic Forum’s 2025 Global Risks Report, environmental challenges such as extreme weather events, biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse pose significant concerns for long-term manufacturing sustainability.

Additionally, while 72% of businesses involve their top governance in ESG reporting, a larger impact must extend deeply into manufacturing supply chains, where the majority of emissions are generated.

For manufacturers, addressing these challenges is crucial, not only to mitigate risks but also to capitalise on growth opportunities by integrating environmental considerations into business practices.

Boston Consulting Group highlights that some sectors face upstream carbon liabilities exceeding US$335bn.

Such liabilities underscore the importance of addressing Scope 3 emissions, which can greatly surpass the emissions from direct operations.

Targeting transformation in manufacturing

Moving from setting sustainability targets to achieving transformational change in manufacturing requires robust governance frameworks, comprehensive data management and strategic capital allocation.

The UN Global Compact indicates that about 60% of global emissions are tied to supply chains, thereby necessitating strategies that extend throughout the entire manufacturing process, from operations to partners and suppliers.

Immediate and informed action can allow manufacturing firms to not only manage risks but also seize market opportunities.

Integrating sustainable practices into procurement, product development and operational strategies can position companies to better handle market volatility and capture future growth.

According to RepRisk analysis, as the severity of greenwashing incidents evolves, manufacturing entities need to implement robust data governance and oversee claims with strict board governance to maintain credibility.

Furthermore, a joint survey by BCG and CO2 AI reveals that only around 9% of companies extensively report on all emissions Scopes 1, 2 and 3.

This statistic highlights the need for more comprehensive reporting across the manufacturing industry.

MADISON — Gov. Tony Evers today delivered his weekly radio address, celebrating National Clean Energy Week in Wisconsin. Gov. Evers proclaimed September 15-19, 2025, as “National Clean Energy Week” across the state, highlighting the importance of building a robust 21st-century clean energy economy in Wisconsin that supports green jobs, bolsters the health of our state, and ensures the clean, sustainable future Wisconsinites deserve. A copy of the governor’s proclamation is available here.

This week, Gov. Evers also announced the release of the 2025 Clean Energy Plan Progress Report, underscoring achievements made over the last year to advance goals established by the state’s first-ever Clean Energy Plan. The progress report released today details Wisconsin’s advances in reducing greenhouse gas emissions through clean energy sources while also creating thousands of new jobs and lowering energy costs for families across Wisconsin, as well as investing in job training and apprenticeship programs in innovative industries and technologies. During 2025 the Year of the Kid, the progress report also highlights stories of youth-driven initiatives, helping to create a more sustainable future for Wisconsin.

Since Day One, the Evers Administration has been committed to promoting climate resilience and building a clean energy economy in the state. In 2019, in one of his first acts as governor, Gov. Evers joined the U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of 24 governors representing nearly 60 percent of the U.S. economy and 55 percent of the U.S. population. Earlier this year, Gov. Evers was appointed a co-chair of the Alliance after being the first governor from the Midwest to join the executive committee, which oversees the strategic direction of the bipartisan coalition of governors.

In addition to joining the Alliance in 2019 Gov. Evers signed Executive Order #38 to create the Office of Sustainability and Clean Energy (OSCE), charging the office with developing the Wisconsin Clean Energy Plan to promote the development and use of clean and renewable energy across the state, advance innovative sustainability solutions that improve the state’s economy and environment, and diversify the resources used to meet the state’s energy needs. The order also established the state’s goal to reach 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2050 and charged the OSCE with ensuring the state is fulfilling the carbon reduction goals of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.

Hey there, folks. Governor Tony Evers here.

This week, we’re celebrating National Clean Energy Week across the state to highlight our efforts to build the clean energy future Wisconsin deserves.

Folks, we don’t have to choose between mitigating climate change and protecting our environment and good-paying jobs and economic development—we can and should do both.And a clean energy economy is as much about protecting the health of our communities as it is about protecting the health of our environment.

So, as governor, I’ve made protecting our environment and investing in a clean energy economy to support our 21st-century needs a top priority of my administration since Day One.

We’ve joined the U.S. Climate Alliance, created a Office of Sustainability and Clean Energy, and developed our state’s first-ever Clean Energy Plan.

We also created the Green Ribbon Commission on Clean Energy and Environmental Innovation and our Green Innovation Fund, and so much more!And I was thrilled to sign legislation to advance the state’s nuclear energy innovation to continue our work towards ensuring Wisconsin has 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2050.

Through these efforts, we’re working to lower energy bills for families, reduce reliance on out-of-state energy sources, and invest in jobs and apprenticeship training all while building a brighter, healthier, and more prosperous future.

And while leaders in Washington continue to slash and claw back millions of dollars of federal funding for clean energy initiatives across our state, sending us backwards, this work is more important than ever.

Now is the time to roll up our sleeves and get to work, and here in Wisconsin, that’s exactly what we are going to continue to do.

So, happy National Clean Energy Week, Wisconsin, and take care.",https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/WIGOV/2020/03/3252723/wisconsin-twitter_original.png,N,,2025-09-20 00:58:37.729418

While battery storage and solar manufacturing have captured headlines and capital, other critical components of the clean tech infrastructure landscape remain undervalued—presenting strategic opportunities for forward-thinking investors. This analysis examines the current state of underfunded clean energy projects, the transformative potential of battery storage, and the overlooked promise of wind manufacturing, all while navigating the complex interplay of policy, technology, and market dynamics.

The Resilience of Battery Storage: A Cornerstone of the Energy Transition

Battery storage has emerged as a linchpin of the energy transition, with global investment tripling since 2021Cleantech Market Update: Q1 2025 in Review[ 2 ]. In Q1 2025 alone, the U.S. added over 30 GW of battery storage capacity, a 65% year-over-year increase, while the development pipeline expanded by 57%Clean Investment Monitor: Q1 2025 Update[ 5 ]. Projects like Ontario's Hagersville Battery Energy Park—secured with CAD$538 million in financing and offering 300 MW of capacity—demonstrate the sector's scalability and its critical role in stabilizing grids during peak demandInfrastructure Quarterly: Q1 2025 | CBRE Investment[ 1 ].

The economic case for battery storage is strengthening. According to a report by Forbes, battery prices are projected to fall below $100/kWh in 2025, making electric vehicles (EVs) increasingly competitive with internal combustion engines2025 Energy Predictions: Battery Costs Fall, Energy Storage Booms[ 3 ]. This trend is accelerating demand for grid-scale systems, particularly in sun-belt states like Texas and California, where rapid deployment is already underway2025 Energy Predictions: Battery Costs Fall, Energy Storage Booms[ 3 ]. Meanwhile, lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries are gaining dominance due to their affordability and safety, with domestic manufacturing set to expand under Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives2025 Energy Predictions: Battery Costs Fall, Energy Storage Booms[ 3 ].

Policy Uncertainties and the Shadow of the Trump Era

Despite these gains, the sector faces headwinds. The U.S. policy landscape remains volatile, with the Trump administration's suspension of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program and its broader challenges to the IRA creating uncertainty for long-term planningCleantech Market Update: Q1 2025 in Review[ 2 ]. However, private sector confidence persists. The global infrastructure and energy investment reached $1.1 trillion in late 2024, driven by digital and transport infrastructureCleantech Market Update: Q1 2025 in Review[ 2 ], while $335 billion in dry powder remains available to sustain activityInfrastructure Quarterly: Q1 2025 | CBRE Investment[ 1 ].

The Overlooked Potential of Wind Manufacturing

While battery and solar manufacturing have surged, wind manufacturing has lagged. A 2025 report by the Clean Investment Monitor notes that the U.S. wind sector has seen declining investment, few new project announcements, and limited capacity expansion despite IRA incentives like the Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax CreditThe State of US Clean Energy Supply Chains in 2025[ 4 ]. This underperformance suggests a significant undervaluation.

The IRA's tax credits are designed to incentivize domestic production of wind turbines and components, yet the sector has not yet capitalized on these opportunities. This gap could be a strategic entry point for investors, particularly as global demand for wind energy grows. With supply chain bottlenecks easing and permitting reforms streamlining project timelines2025 Energy Predictions: Battery Costs Fall, Energy Storage Booms[ 3 ], the sector is poised for a rebound—if capital flows align with policy intent.

Navigating the Risks and Rewards of Underfunded Sectors

Not all clean tech infrastructure is created equal. While battery storage and solar remain robust, other areas like industrial decarbonization and utility-scale solar have shown volatility. In Q1 2025, U.S. industrial decarbonization investment plummeted to $79 million from $16 billion in Q1 2024Clean Investment Monitor: Q1 2025 Update[ 5 ], while utility-scale solar and storage investment declined by 15.4% year-over-yearClean Investment Monitor: Q1 2025 Update[ 5 ]. These fluctuations highlight the importance of sector-specific due diligence.

However, the development pipeline remains strong, with $328 billion in clean energy projects in the worksClean Investment Monitor: Q1 2025 Update[ 5 ]. Investors who focus on undervalued niches—such as wind manufacturing or regional battery storage projects—can capitalize on mispriced assets while contributing to a diversified energy transition.

Conclusion: Strategic Allocation in a Fragmented Market

The energy transition is not a monolith. While some sectors are overhyped, others are undervalued, offering asymmetric risk-reward profiles. Battery storage's resilience, wind manufacturing's untapped potential, and the IRA's long-term tailwinds suggest that investors who adopt a nuanced, sector-specific approach will outperform in the coming years. As the global infrastructure market continues to evolve, the key to success lies in identifying where capital is scarce—and where it is most needed.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-qwen_generated_1758325485178.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-19 21:59:51.230147

From this action, the district court reasonably inferred that the government’s reference to lack of oversight was a pretext.
But of course the district court gave no evidentiary value to that video: it is patently irrelevant to the GGRF.
Although EPA claimed it conducted an “individualized assessment” of the grants, the district court found that EPA had not provided any rationale for the terminations.
The district court, as the finder of fact, concluded that EPA’s “public statements contradict its representations here regarding the future of the program.” Id.","U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Ranking Member Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), U.S. Representative Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), and 36 of their Congressional colleagues have submitted an amicus brief to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in the case of Climate United Fund, et al. v. Citibank, N.A. et al, urging the reinstatement of Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) grants.

The lawmakers pressed the Court to grant a rehearing en banc, or hearing of the full active bench, and to overturn the erroneous ruling issued earlier this month by a three-judge panel of the Court. That poorly reasoned ruling allows the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to proceed with its efforts to illegally claw back GGRF awards that were appropriated by Congress and fully disbursed into private bank accounts. The GGRF is a $27 billion national climate financing network that facilitates investments in affordable clean energy deployment to spur economic development, lower energy costs, and reduce pollution. It was passed into law in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and is based on the National Climate Bank Act, legislation authored by Senators Van Hollen and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Congresswoman Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.).

In the brief, the lawmakers argue that the D.C. Circuit panel’s two-judge majority – both Trump appointees – misapplied precedent and ignored the district court’s well-supported factual findings in a results-oriented bid to greenlight EPA’s unlawful efforts to claw back GGRF funds. Given that Congress mandated that the GGRF funds be spent as appropriated, and the funds were already distributed to private bank accounts, EPA’s cancellation of the program is clear executive overreach. The lawmakers stress that letting this decision stand jeopardizes Constitutional protections of the separation of powers, and would amount to a transfer of Congress’ power of the purse to the executive branch.

The lawmakers outlined the thorough, transparent process by which the EPA under the Biden Administration awarded GGRF funds, writing, “Congress passed the IRA in 2022, which authorized and appropriated nearly $20 billion for the GGRF programs at issue here: the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF) and the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA). Congress directed that these funds must be granted to specialized nonprofit financial organizations for projects that ‘reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air pollution.’ Congress required that the EPA obligate GGRF funds by September 30, 2024. EPA met the deadline and entered into Financial Agent Agreements to ‘[convey] to the grantees legal title to the award funds’ while ‘affording EPA greater oversight of the grantees’ use of the funds than it would have had under the default disbursement system.’”

“After President Trump took office, the new EPA Administrator and other officials began to make outrageous attacks on grantees – including attempts to fabricate criminal fraud allegations. EPA’s subsequent blanket termination of the NCIF and the CCIA programs willfully ignores Congressional spending power and puts $20 billion of community and clean energy investments at risk. This is not a prosaic contract dispute; this is a constitutional power grab,” they argued.

The lawmakers pointed out that the panel Dalton v. Specter, which disallows judicial review in cases where a statute commits decision-making to the discretion of the President. They argued that Dalton does not apply in this case, writing, “but no statute gave the President, let alone EPA, discretion to terminate all previously obligated and disbursed funds allocated by Congress for two GGRF programs. Plaintiffs’ claims here do not depend on termination of a single contract, withholding of a disputed grant amount, or even administrative interpretation of a statutory provision. Finally, in sharp contrast with the discretion afforded to the President [by the] … statute at issue in Dalton, Congress could not have been clearer that the GGRF was enacted to ‘enable low-income and disadvantaged communities to deploy or benefit from zero-emission technologies,’ and that EPA had to obligate all grant funding by September 30, 2024. […] Dalton cannot sanction EPA nullifying clear statutory directives by terminating these programs.”

They also criticize the panel for dismissing without basis key factual findings by the district court, writing, “The district court did not, as the panel writes, ‘simply declare’ that EPA was shutting down the GGRF program. […] Rather, the district court made well-supported findings of fact that EPA’s out-of-court words and actions contradicted the Agency’s representations in the litigation that the GGRF program would continue following termination of Plaintiffs’ grants.”

“If the panel decision stands, it would set precedent that any agency can simply unwind any Congressionally-mandated program, unilaterally ending contracts without process, seizing money in private bank accounts, and clawing back already-disbursed funds. Congress’s exclusive power of the purse would be in name only. This Court should grant rehearing en banc,” the Senators concluded.

INTEREST OF AMICI CURIAE AND RULE 29(a)(4)(E) STATEMENT

Amici curiae include the original champions of Green Bank legislation and its passage as the GGRF; the Ranking Members of the Senate and House committees with jurisdiction over the GGRF (U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce); the Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Committee subcommittee with jurisdiction over GGRF funding; and other Members of Congress with a particularized interest in preserving the separation of powers and ensuring that Congress’s plenary power over appropriations and spending is protected.

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

Congress passed the IRA in 2022, which authorized and appropriated nearly $20 billion for the GGRF programs at issue here: the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF) and the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA). Congress directed that these funds must be granted to specialized nonprofit financial organizations for projects that “reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air pollution.” Congress required that the EPA obligate GGRF funds by September 30, 2024. EPA met the deadline and entered into Financial Agent Agreements to “[convey] to the grantees legal title to the award funds” while “affording EPA greater oversight of the grantees’ use of the funds than it would have had under the default disbursement system.” Climate United Fund v. Citibank, 2025 WL 2502881 at *16 (D.C. Cir. Sept 2, 2025) (Pillard, J. dissenting) (citing Bafford Decl. ¶ 33 (J.A. 372)).

After President Trump took office, the new EPA Administrator and other officials began to make outrageous attacks on grantees – including attempts to fabricate criminal fraud allegations. EPA’s subsequent blanket termination of the NCIF and the CCIA programs willfully ignores Congressional spending power and puts $20 billion of community and clean energy investments at risk. This is not a prosaic contract dispute; this is a constitutional power grab.

The panel errs in finding that Plaintiffs’ appropriations claims are prohibited by Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462 (1994). An agency’s failure to spend congressionally appropriated funds is illegal under In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d 255 (D.C. Cir. 2013). Yet the panel wrongly allows EPA to seize GGRF funds that were appropriated by Congress and fully disbursed into private bank accounts. Unlike in Dalton, which was not an appropriations case, here Congress mandated how, by when, and to whom appropriated funds should be granted. It is black letter law that Congress enjoys plenary appropriations power. As held by the Supreme Court in Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 464 (1998), the executive branch does not have the power to repeal a statute by withholding its funding. To hold otherwise would give the executive branch free rein to ignore Congressional appropriations decisions. This Court should grant rehearing, to consider the constitutional issues raised by EPA’s misdeeds.

ARGUMENT

EPA’s Actions

Violate Congress’s Appropriations Power.

The panel decision acknowledges that EPA terminated the full amount of all grants made under two GGRF grant programs, but discards the district court record and precedential case law to conclude that the grantees’ challenge “is not a constitutional claim at all” and is only a challenge to the IRA. Climate United, 2025 WL 2502881 at *10. This is exactly backwards: the existence of a potential statutory violation does not displace a constitutional claim, and the dispositive question is whether the Administration has exceeded its constitutional powers. Here, it has: Congress required EPA to spend the GGRF funds before September 30, 2024, and EPA would have been prohibited from refusing to do so. EPA’s efforts to terminate funding after disbursement are equally impermissible. Nor was there any basis to overturn the district court’s thorough analysis concluding that EPA terminated the grant programs wholesale.

A. The Panel Erred in Rejecting the Constitutional Claim.

The Court should grant en banc review and not allow an overly expansive interpretation of Dalton to nullify Congressional spending power. By stretching Dalton to reject Plaintiffs’ separation of powers claims, and shoehorning Plaintiffs’ remaining claims into contractual disputes under the ill-fitting Tucker Act, the panel swept constitutional questions under the rug.

This case concerns EPA’s unilateral termination of all grants under two GGRF programs (in addition to at least eight other programs beyond this case, see infra note 4), after all the funds had been dispersed to private bank accounts. These brazen actions usurped power assigned to Congress by the Constitution. Under our Constitution, the power of the purse belongs to Congress, not the President or his agents. U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7 (Appropriations Clause); U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1 (Spending Clause). Congress may employ that power “to further broad policy objectives” and as the dissent points out, “neither the President nor his subordinate executive agencies may decline to follow a statutory mandate or prohibit spending because of policy objections.” Climate United, 2025 WL 2502881 at *14 (Pillard, J., dissenting).

Dalton simply does not apply here. That case stands for the limited proposition that “[w]here a statute . . . commits decision-making to the discretion of the President, judicial review of the President’s decision is not available.” 511 U.S. at 477. But no statute gave the President, let alone EPA, discretion to terminate all previously obligated and disbursed funds allocated by Congress for two GGRF programs. Plaintiffs’ claims here do not depend on termination of a single contract, withholding of a disputed grant amount, or even administrative interpretation of a statutory provision. Finally, in sharp contrast with the discretion afforded to the President under the military base closure statute at issue in Dalton, Congress could not have been clearer that the GGRF was enacted to “enable low-income and disadvantaged communities to deploy or benefit from zero-emission technologies,” and that EPA had to obligate all grant funding by September 30, 2024. 42 U.S.C. § 7434. Dalton cannot sanction EPA nullifying clear statutory directives by terminating these programs.

Nor can the panel’s expansion of Dalton be reconciled with Supreme Court precedent that prohibits the executive from unilaterally refusing to spend appropriated funds – let alone claw back actually disbursed funds. In Clinton, the Supreme Court struck down the line item veto as unconstitutional, because Article I, § 7 of the Constitution makes clear that the President cannot cancel a law without Congress’s express authorization. Clinton, 524 U.S. at 446. Decided after Dalton, the Court’s opinion in Clinton specifically rejected the argument that cancellations of Congressionally appropriated programs were “merely exercises of discretionary authority granted to the President.” Id. at 442. Instead, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the bedrock principle that the Constitution does not permit “the President to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.” Id. at 438. The panel’s broad recharacterization of Dalton into the appropriations context effectively gives an unconstitutional line item veto to this Administration.

It is similarly not possible to square the panel’s reading of Dalton with the Supreme Court’s ruling in Train v. New York, 420 U.S. 35, 42-47 (1975). There, the Supreme Court held that language in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act that the EPA “shall” allot funds by a date certain meant what it said. Train, 420 U.S. at 42-47. At the direction of President Nixon, the EPA Administrator allotted less than what the Act specified. Id. at 40. The Supreme Court ruled that the Administrator could not do so. Inclusion of the phrase “not to exceed” did not provide discretion to the EPA to refuse to spend the funds; it only preserved the possibility that approved applications for funds already allotted “would not total the maximum amount authorized to be appropriated.” Id. at 44. Here, the statutory directive is even clearer: Congress appropriated specific sums to carry out the GGRF programs, to be spent by a specific date, and to be provided to specified eligible entities.

Meanwhile, on the correct factual record, Aiken County is indistinguishable. See Climate United, 2025 WL 2502881 at *29 (“[A]bsent congressional authorization, the Administration may not redistribute or withhold properly appropriated funds in order to effectuate its own policy goals.”) (Pillard, J., dissenting, quotation and citation omitted). Under Aiken County, an agency may not refuse to spend appropriated funds in violation of a statutory obligation. Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 257-69. As then-Judge Kavanaugh wrote: “where previously appropriated money is available for an agency to perform a statutorily mandated activity, we see no basis for a court to excuse the agency from that statutory mandate.” Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 260. The panel tries to avoid this precedent by discarding the district court’s well-supported findings and lending undue credibility to EPA’s inconsistent justifications for terminating the grants. Climate United, 2025 WL 2502881 at *11. As set out below, the district court’s factual conclusion that EPA had no intention of re-awarding the GGRF money was amply supported; thus, Aiken County should control. The district court correctly found that the Plaintiffs demonstrated a likelihood of success on this claim.

B. The Panel Wrongly Substituted Its Own Inferences and Factfinding for That of District Court

The panel avoids the clear dictates of Clinton and Aiken County only by rewriting the factual record in the case and overturning the district court’s factual findings. Climate United, 2025 WL 2502881 at *11. But this turns logic upside down, dispensing with the district court’s detailed factfinding while affording the government a presumption of regularity that strains credulity. Where “the district court’s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.” Anderson v. City of Bessemer, 470 U.S. 564, 573-74 (1985).

The district court did not, as the panel writes, “simply declare” that EPA was shutting down the GGRF program. Climate United, 2025 WL 2502881 at *11. Rather, the district court made well-supported findings of fact that EPA’s out-of-court words and actions contradicted the Agency’s representations in the litigation that the GGRF program would continue following termination of Plaintiffs’ grants. Specifically:

The district court found that EPA initially claimed fraud and conflicts of interest in grant awards and enlisted the FBI to pressure Citibank to freeze funds, but then admitted the terminations were “based on reasons of policy” when it could produce no evidence of fraud. Climate United, 778 F.Supp.3d at 114-115.

The district court found that EPA served Plaintiffs with identical information requests on the GGRF program’s oversight controls then terminated all the grants prior to receiving responses. Id. at 114. From this action, the district court reasonably inferred that the government’s reference to lack of oversight was a pretext.

The district court found that EPA refused to provide any rationale for why it terminated the grants, why cancellation was necessary when EPA had begun to examine the grant programs to add oversight mechanisms, or “why it needed to cancel every single grant to review some aspects of the GGRF program . . . .” Id.

The district court found that “[t]hroughout February and March 2025, Administrator Zeldin began to publicly express his desire to take control of the funds disbursed under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and to terminate the GGRF grants . . . and that EPA is ‘not going to rest’ until it recovered the grant funds.” Id. at 102. The district court was not “clearly erroneous” in concluding that these public statements by the EPA Administrator, alongside an executive order directing agencies to halt all IRA disbursements to “terminate the Green New Deal,” betrayed the actual, unlawful reason for the grant terminations and the intent to end the program.

The panel erred further by faulting the district court for “ignor[ing]” the “gold bars” video. Climate United, 2025 WL 2502881 at *11 n.12. But of course the district court gave no evidentiary value to that video: it is patently irrelevant to the GGRF. The video concerns efforts to award different grant money after the November 2024 election. All the GGRF grants were awarded by September – months before.

The panel also erred in holding that the district court should have afforded EPA’s unsupported and inconsistent representations a presumption of regularity. Climate United, 2025 WL 2502881 at *11. The “presumption of regularity” is a limited, rebuttable presumption that applies to authenticity of government documents and official acts. Latif v. Obama, 677 F.3d 1175, 1178 (D.C. Cir. 2011). The district court did not refuse to consider EPA’s evidence or account of its actions but rather determined – after significant factual analysis – that EPA’s representations were unsupported by the broader factual record. The district court found that EPA first sought to terminate grant funding through a criminal investigation, and when that failed, shifted its position to claim that the terminations were based on changed agency priorities. Climate United, 778 F.Supp.3d at 115. Although EPA claimed it conducted an “individualized assessment” of the grants, the district court found that EPA had not provided any rationale for the terminations. Id. at 115-116. The district court, as the finder of fact, concluded that EPA’s “public statements contradict its representations here regarding the future of the program.” Id. at 116. These factual conclusions were firmly grounded in the record and should not have been disturbed by the panel.

CONCLUSION

The stakes presented by this power grab are high. In the NCIF and CCIA programs under the GGRF, Congress directed EPA to grant nearly $20 billion to nonprofit financial organizations for the purpose of reducing pollution and energy costs for low-income and disadvantaged communities. There is considerable reliance on those grants, which were disbursed to private accounts nearly a year ago.

If the panel decision stands, it would set precedent that any agency can simply unwind any Congressionally-mandated program, unilaterally ending contracts without process, seizing money in private bank accounts, and clawing back already-disbursed funds. Congress’s exclusive power of the purse would be in name only. This Court should grant rehearing en banc.",https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/assets/images/sharelogo.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 20:59:15.323245

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Problem Solvers Caucus announced its endorsement of a bipartisan permitting reform framework. As momentum builds for Congress to act on permitting reform, the recommendations in this framework offer a commonsense, two-party roadmap to streamline the permitting process, boost energy production of all kinds, and give investors the clarity and confidence they need to invest in America.

This framework was developed by the Problem Solvers Caucus Permitting, Energy & Environment Working Group, led by Reps. Scott Peters (CA-50) and Gabe Evans (CO-08), along with Co-Chairs Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01) and Tom Suozzi (NY-03).

The framework reflects months of bipartisan collaboration with energy producers, industry experts, Members across committees of jurisdiction, and stakeholders across the political spectrum. It lays out a path forward to update the permitting system so the United States can compete globally and remain a responsible steward of the environment.

With the country poised to see one of the largest increases in energy demand in decades, Congress needs to act now. Communities and businesses across the country are facing rising costs and growing demand for affordable, reliable energy. Yet, too many projects remain stalled for years — some more than a decade — due to outdated regulations, duplicative reviews, and endless litigation, stifling innovation and driving up costs for families.

Key elements of the framework include:

• Cutting red tape for linear infrastructure projects

• Meeting growing energy demand across sectors

• Reforming outdated and duplicative NEPA requirements

• Establishing clear, enforceable permitting deadlines

• Strengthening domestic supply chains

“America faces a choice between cheap, abundant energy from all of the above sources or higher energy prices, falling behind China, and an increased risk of blackouts,” said Congressman Scott Peters (CA-50). “It’s obvious where we need to go. To get there, we know we need to update our environmental laws to meet the challenges of today and invest in a grid for this century. This platform represents a bipartisan commitment to set aside ideology and solve this problem for the American people. I look forward to working with my colleagues to keep the momentum going and turn this into legislation that can pass both chambers of Congress.”

“Reforming our permitting system is crucial, and this framework meets the moment for much-needed change. The demand for affordable and reliable energy of all kinds becomes increasingly urgent,” said Congressman Gabe Evans (CO-08). “By cutting through red tape, we can meet energy demand, lower costs, strengthen national security, and create high-quality jobs in America, while being responsible stewards of the environment and maintaining our position of global leadership and not cede ground to China. The urgency is real, and I am proud of this bipartisan push for change.”

“The number one issue Americans are concerned about is the cost of living,” said Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Tom Suozzi (NY-03). “Sky-high energy costs play an enormous role—electricity prices rose more than 6.5% in just the last year, and demand is skyrocketing. Right now it takes years, even decades, for new green energy and other projects to get connected to the grid and start generating energy to meet demand. We need commonsense, bipartisan solutions to cut red tape, bring projects online faster, and make energy more affordable for American families. That’s exactly what this framework does.”

“America wins the future by building faster, smarter, and cleaner than our competitors — lowering costs, creating jobs, and strengthening security here at home. But our permitting system has been holding us back. The Problem Solvers Caucus is changing that,” said Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01). “Our bipartisan framework sets clear rules, enforces real deadlines, unleashes investment in every form of American energy, and strengthens our security and supply chains while protecting our environment. This is the model for governing in the 21st century: two parties coming together to clear the path for innovation, jobs, and affordable energy — proving that when both parties lead together, America leads the world.”

“Too much government red tape drives up costs for Nevada families and industries alike. As one of the top two geothermal states in the country, red tape is currently preventing us from unleashing our full clean power potential and getting reliable and affordable energy on the grid,” said Congresswoman Susie Lee (NV-03). “I’m thrilled to have a bipartisan framework that includes my proposed geothermal permitting reforms.“

“As Co-Chair of the Climate Solutions Caucus, I believe we need to move energy and infrastructure projects forward in a way that strengthens our economy, lowers costs, and protects our environment,” said Congressman Andrew Garbarino (NY-02). “This permitting reform framework is a step toward cutting through red tape so we can build cleaner, more reliable energy, create good-paying jobs, bolster our supply chains, and secure American energy dominance for the future.”",https://scottpeters.house.gov/vendor/_accounts/scottpeters/_skins/peters/images/twitter_card.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 01:59:14.110120

The partnership combines Denham’s experience in developing, building, and operating large-scale power plants across six different continents, and B&W’s experience in coal power generation and the conversion of coal-fired power plants to use natural gas.

“Data centers have created an unprecedented and immediate demand for power generation, the likes of which we have not seen in nearly two decades,” said Justin DeAngelis, Global Head of Sustainable Infrastructure at Denham Capital. “Time-to-power is a key focal point for data center developers and hyperscalers, and this partnership is one differentiated tool we are looking to utilize to meet market needs.”

“We are delighted to partner with B&W to offer reliable, fast, low-cost and sustainable power solutions to the data center market, leveraging B&W’s nearly 160 years of expertise in power boilers, and bringing Denham’s 10 GW of experience in developing, constructing or operating power generation,” DeAngelis said. “Given the scale of this opportunity, Denham will shortly announce a dedicated portfolio company focused on delivering these solutions. It is vital we leverage existing power fleets, decarbonize, and increase the quality and security of our power generation systems.”

According to Industrial Info Resources (IIR), as of early March, there were over 1,900 data center projects in development in the U.S., with a total investment exceeding $800 billion. A lot of this announced spend is tied up in multi-building campuses with additions that are planned out to 2035.

While nuclear is a favorite of data center developers, natural gas may get most of the business – at least for the time being.

What are the relevant PFAS?

PFAS are synthetic chemicals used in many products and materials by a broad range of industries—from cosmetics to textiles—because they resist heat, water, and oil. Given their widespread use, these chemicals are relatively ubiquitous at low levels and have been detected in soil, sediments, groundwater, and surface water at many sites. The EPA rule at issue focuses on two PFAS specifically, PFOA and PFOS, given their widespread use and prevalence in the environment.

What does the rule do?

The EPA’s April 2024 rule designates PFOA and PFOS as “hazardous substances” under CERCLA. The rule establishes substantial reporting requirements for PFOA and PFOS releases, allows the EPA to initiate response actions without showing imminent and substantial endangerment, and perhaps most importantly, allows parties to pursue reimbursement or contribution claims for cleanups of these two substances. CERCLA’s strict, joint and several, and retroactive liability regime is particularly concerning in the context of chemicals like PFOA and PFOS that are ubiquitous in the environment and resistant to degradation.

More details on the rule’s specific requirements can be found in analysis from the Alston & Bird team here and here.

What’s the rule’s current status?

After the rule went into effect in July 2024, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and industry groups petitioned for review by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing in part that the agency had wrongly applied CERCLA and did not adequately assess the costs and benefits extending Superfund liability to PFAS contamination. With the Trump Administration’s arrival, the EPA moved for a stay in February 2025, and the case has been paused since then while the agency decided whether to continue defending the rule.

In its September 17 motion this week, the EPA asked the court to lift the stay. Attached to the motion was a declaration from a senior adviser to the EPA’s Office of Land and Emergency Management stating that the agency will continue to “engage with Congress and industry to establish a clear liability framework that ensures the polluter pays and passive receivers are protected.” This goal of protecting so-called “passive receivers” raises significant questions, including the criteria for determining which entities qualify, the scope of protections provided, and the potential of unintended consequences on enforcement actions and cost allocations at sites where these entities are involved. The EPA has indicated that Congress will have to adopt new statutory language to address concerns with passive receiver liability.

The decision to retain the PFAS Superfund rule contrasts with other Trump Administration actions to relax PFAS regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act and push back compliance deadlines under similar legislation.

Next Steps

As litigation against the rule proceeds, companies and stakeholders should follow developments both at the congressional and EPA levels, where prominent leaders in both branches have supported measures to keep the rule but excuse so-called “passive receivers” from liability. For now, companies should be aware of potential releases of PFAS—especially PFOA and PFOS—in their waste streams, be mindful of potential PFAS contamination during environmental due diligence for transactions, and stay informed on potential liability that may arise from real property investments.

The federal tax credit for electric vehicles is set to expire Sept. 30, which means consumer must act quickly to take advantage of the savings.

New qualifying EVs, known as ""clean vehicles,"" will see a tax credit up to $7,500. It's $4,000 for used models.

""If you're going to think about trying to get tax credit for your electric vehicle, act now. Don't wait till the last minute,"" said John Warren is an enrolled agent at Medford Tax Experts.

Here's what you need to know:

Consumers must buy the EV - before the deadline.

""The car can still be on order, or you can still be waiting for delivery, and you can still get this tax credit,"" Warren said.

Before signing the contract, make sure to read the fine print.

Eligibility for the tax credit, especially for used cars, could hinge on the type of car and how much money you make.

""In some cases, you can apply the credit if you're going to enter into a lease agreement with the car dealer and you can use the credit to lower the purchase price by $7,500,"" said Warren. ""The credit will go to the car dealer directly.""

A complete list of qualifying vehicles is available on fueleconomy.gov.

To claim the EV tax credit...

…taxpayers must fill out the IRS form 8936 with their federal income tax return.

""The purchaser of the vehicle has to receive a document from the car dealership. The car dealership will take their name, their social security number, their address, and report that with the VIN of the car they're buying to the IRS,"" said Warren. ""There is some information, documents that have to match for someone to be able to receive this credit""

Those who don't make the deadline may still find savings through financing deals from manufacturers or dealerships. However, experts caution new EV models could come with bigger price tags as tariffs kick in - even if they're assembled in the states.",https://media.nbcboston.com/2019/09/2019-electric-vehiclesJPG.JPG?resize=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all,N,,2025-09-19 20:01:08.978325

The Calcasieu-Sabine Basin will get $122 million from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement for drainage improvements geared to help marsh plants grow and halt erosion.

The basin, on trend with the entire Louisiana coastline, has experienced dramatic wetland loss, with more than 128,000 acres lost since 1932 and a projected 110,000 at risk of loss in a future without intervention, based on data from the United States Geological Survey.

The first phase of the project, planned along the southeastern edge of Calcasieu Lake, will build seven drainage structures with elements of a levee that allow water to flow back and forth from either side. The design is meant to balance water and salinity levels between the lake and the rest of the watershed, using natural events such as low tides and cold fronts to keep the marsh from being inundated with water.

“This funding allows us to move from planning to construction on one of our most critical restoration efforts,” Gov. Jeff Landry said Thursday in a Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority news release.

Future phases of construction include up to 18 miles of channels to improve water flow into the marsh and deposits of dredged material to promote the growth of marsh vegetation. Existing water control structures around Calcasieu Lake will also get maintenance upgrades as needed.

Estimates of the project’s total cost come to about $260 million, according to the CPRA. A previous $28.6 million grant was put toward planning costs with any remainder to be rolled over for construction and maintenance.

“The Calcasieu-Sabine project reflects the kind of large-scale, science-based restoration prioritized in Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan,” CPRA executive director Michael Hare said.. “We’re now moving from planning to action in one of the most vulnerable areas of our coast, where this investment will make a measurable difference.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-85/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_9101-1024x6831758312506.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=ntbz57FF,N,,2025-09-20 04:59:02.870790

No goal is close to that of bringing more hope and opportunity and jobs and a stronger private sector in this state,” Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels said on Thursday.

The governor addressed the crowd as hundreds gathered for the announcement in Portage, celebrating one of the biggest new-job creations in some time for Northwest Indiana.

“First a company may pick a state where they have a good chance of succeeding,” Governor Daniels continued. “But, ultimately, they have to pick a community, and they chose wisely and well when they chose Portage.”

Fronius, a family-owned business founded in 1955, will manufacture grid-connected inverters at its new Portage facility in the Ameriplex complex. These inverters convert solar energy into electricity and feed that electricity into the public grid in an efficient, high-powered manner. The plant is estimated to bring 512 jobs to Northwest Indiana by 2016, a huge win for the area, as unemployment remains relatively high.

Mayor Olga Velazquez was on hand as well, excited at the opportunity this new business venture brings to Portage. “Can you feel the energy?” she exclaimed to the crowd.

She continued, “I would like to take this opportunity to thank the governor and his team as well as the Indiana Economic Development Corporation and Jim Staton, for working with us at the local level to help bring this project to Portage. Thank you very much.”

This announcement marks the 1,000th new business establishment or expansion completed by the Indiana Economic Development Corporation since 2005.

“In order to compete, we must collaborate,” said Velazquez. “And this is truly a shining example of the collaboration that happened with the state government and private industry to realize positive results.“

“We’re excited to be able to introduce more of the U.S. especially to Fronius’ forward-thinking people, quality products, and superior service which have helped our position as a global leader in all three areas of our operations,” said Thomas Herndler, member of the Management Board for the manufacturing department of Fronius.

Fronius is the fourth-largest solar inverter producer in the world, and will relocate its North American headquarters from Michigan to the soon-to-be-built 400,000 square-foot facility in the Ameriplex complex in Portage.

“There were many factors that needed to be considered to choose the best location for the new site, but Indiana quickly became a contender,” explained Wolfgang Niedrist, the Managing Director for Fronius USA. “It has a strong educational system that will help us train our employees, as well as a talented workforce. There is a solid network of suppliers, some essential to the manufacturing of quality products.”

“On behalf of the citizens of Portage, please extend our extreme and sincere appreciation for choosing Portage to be your new home,” Velazquez told the crowd.

“I truly believe that this is a game changer, not only for the city of Portage, but for all of Northwest Indiana.“

Bob Latta and Heather Reams: Permitting reform is the key to American competitiveness,The Washington,,,,,https://washingtonreporter.news/p/op-ed-rep-bob-latta-and-heather-reams,"Too often, we have seen energy production or transmission projects languishing in litigation and redundant bureaucracy for years.

Too often, we have seen energy production or transmission projects languishing in litigation and redundant bureaucracy for years. As a result, Americans have been unable to fully benefit from our nation’s vast energy resources.

As a member of Congress and as the leader of an energy non-profit, we know that durable policy change as impactful as reforming our broken permitting process requires public buy-in. This is where federal policy and education from institutions like CRES go hand-in-hand — legislative action will help ensure long-term growth and informing Americans about how this will improve day-to-day life is key to garnering support. We know that passing comprehensive permitting reform will not only create jobs, but spur innovation, and the key is communicating that economic impact.

Improving federal permitting will create jobs and give business the certainty they need to invest in long term projects. Permitting reform will benefit all sources of energy production, meaning it could also help to lower consumption costs. However, supporting homegrown energy sources isn't just about supporting an American energy dominance agenda — it’s about boosting our local economies and American businesses. Take nuclear, an industry long burdened by red tape that supports roughly a quarter of a million jobs. Or wind, which boasts more than 300,000 jobs across all 50 states. Imagine if we made it easier to bring these job creating energy sources online?

Increased energy production is more important than ever with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). AI data centers need an immense amount of power — and one way to ensure we have that energy is an efficient and streamlined permitting process. To put it simply: data centers aren't just a trend; they're part of the next generation of the industrial economy, and we have to be ready to capitalize on their potential. This can be seen in Ohio, which is ranked fourth in the country for volume of data centers. We all use AI in our daily lives, and we need to take federal action to ensure the technology has the energy it needs to power its continued integration into our lives.

We need significantly more power, at lower costs, and the key is to use every tool and resource available to us. This is more important than ever, and should be a central focus of Washington, especially during this National Clean Energy Week.

There is so much to be gained from unleashing American energy: strengthening the economy, job creation, and innovation — but we have to get the policies right. Energy production, and the ability to move it, will be the defining need of our generation. As we continue to push pragmatic energy policy in the beltway and beyond, we look forward to working with the Trump administration to put American energy first.

Petrochemical companies and other industries in the coastal area need a lot of water and were already using the lion’s share of the municipal water supply.

The city of Corpus Christi is in a water crisis. It’s in stage three water restriction right now.

Desalination was being floated as the best solution. But it's expensive.

The project had ballooned from earlier estimates of $750 million to about $1.2 billion with residential users expected to pay for it with a 20 percent water rate increase.

Recently at a very long, emotionally charged city council meeting, many residents and environmental advocates spoke against the project. Major concerns included the high cost, fiscal risk, environmental damage—especially discharge of super-salty brine into the bay—and the unequal benefits.

But it was the cost concerns that eventually killed the project.

There was pressure from state officials pushing for desalination seeing this technology as a long-term partial solution to growing water needs for the state. For example, Governor Greg Abbott’s office had supported the project and provided some funding. But council members who opposed it said that despite the political pressure, the financial and broader benefit risks were too large.

Scrapping the Inner Harbor project is being seen as a major victory for the Corpus Christi community organizers who maintained pressure throughout the decade-long planning process.

They succeeded by mobilizing public testimony, framing the environmental stakes, and focusing on transparency and fiscal accountability.

Their strategy included showing how costs had escalated, how jobs or other claimed benefits were unclear, and insisting on alternatives.

The large public engagement shifted the political balance, making it politically costly for officials to support a plan seen as risky and burdensome.

Beatriz Alvarado and Jake Hernandez are lead organizers for the Texas Campaign for the Environment—Water for People Not Polluters operation.

Measles vaccine

On Thursday the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s advisory panel on vaccines voted to weaken recommendations for a measles vaccine that includes protection against the varicella virus, or the chickenpox.

They are saying the vaccine, called MMRV, shouldn’t be recommended for children under age 4 because of a small risk for seizures in that age group.

The seizures can be prompted by fevers associated with viruses. Doctors say that while they are scary for parents to witness, they are generally harmless.

It’s unknown if this recommendation will result in a policy change at the CDC but supporters of vaccines are alarmed.

Terri Burke says that would have had tragic consequences for Texans, given the fact the state just endured the worst outbreak of measles in 30 years.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6fb9fe4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/916x481+0+62/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8a%2F35%2F496e1feb4085a733d2cf8dcd6b9c%2Fdesal.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 20:01:44.394780

Hello and welcome to Eco Report. In today’s feature report, WFHB Assistant News Director Noelle Herhusky-Schneider reports on National Moth Week, a citizen science project to study and record populations of moths.

And here’s your environmental reports:

There is a Kissing bugs warning from CDC. Native insects aren’t always adorable bumblebees or beautiful butterflies. The triatomine insect, or “kissing bug,” is native to Indiana but it’s been making recent news as a danger. The CDC has issued a warning about the recent cases of Chagas disease—a parasitic infection that, while not immediately dangerous, can be deadly if untreated.

Environmental leaders from across the Great Lakes region gathered in Toledo this week for a groundbreaking summit focused on restoring the most polluted areas in the Great Lakes system. The “Areas of Concern Cross-Agency Partnership Summit” brought together federal, state, and local officials to coordinate restoration efforts. These “areas of concern” are locations that have experienced significant environmental degradation. The summit took place in the Maumee area, Ohio’s largest area of concern which has seen significant investment aimed at transformation.

The timing of this summit highlights major restoration progress happening across the region. Following a successful cleanup, the EPA removed New York’s Rochester Embayment from the list of most polluted Great Lakes areas, Since the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative began in 2010, the restoration program has already delisted 7 “areas of concern” and enhanced, protected, and restored nearly 530,000 acres of habitat, 13% of which are coastal wetlands.

Feeling the Heat? These fossil fuel giants are to blame, new study says. Climate change increased the probability and intensity of more than 200 heat waves across the globe over the last two decades, according to a newly published study.

The folks from Campbell’s soup company are in hot water after officials admit that they’ve been dumping water in the Maumee River for over 6 years, violating the Clean Water Act thousands of times. This isn’t just about soup production gone wrong—it’s about contaminated water that affects everyone downstream. The factory dumps its waste into the Maumee River, which flows directly into Lake Erie. Phosphorus from the wastewater feeds toxic algae blooms that can harm swimmers and contaminate drinking water with dangerous cyanobacteria—something residents of Monroe County and visitors to Lake Monroe are all too familiar with.

The actor and influential environmentalist, Robert Redford, has passed away. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, Redford spent over fifty years advocating for public lands and protected waters in the West, protecting wildlife, pursuing environmental justice for Indigenous communities, and climate action. Redford was one of the early voices speaking out about climate change and the choices developers, communities, and governments can make in safeguarding the planet for future generations. Redford, a longtime resident of Utah, was 89.

“I just can’t emphasize enough what an impact that ARCUS has had to the Arctic research community over the years, and actually to communities in the Arctic.”","After nearly 40 years, the Arctic Research Consortium of the United States will close Sept. 30, a casualty of President Donald Trump’s proposed budget cuts and his administration’s focus on using the Arctic as an outpost for national security and energy dominance—and its push away from science.

As part of the overarching defunding of science after Trump took office, ARCUS’ major funder, the National Science Foundation, chose not to re-open a bid for a community hub project that would have continued to fund the nonprofit.

ARCUS had been trying to diversify its funding sources, but still received 93 percent of its funding—$1.7 million— from the NSF in fiscal year 2023, according to the nonprofit’s most recently available tax records.

While NSF is an independent federal agency, it relies on government funding to award grants to other organizations. It is also the lead agency responsible for implementing Arctic research policy. It is accepting input on the next five-year plan until Nov. 15.

In May, Trump released his budget request, which would cut NSF funding by 56 percent, from $9 billion to $3.9 billion. The request “reflects a strategic alignment of resources in a constrained fiscal environment in which NSF prioritizes investments that can have the greatest national impact,” an NSF spokesperson told Inside Climate News in an email.

The NSF spokesperson did not answer questions about the rationale for the cuts, how the money would be redirected and any connection between the reduction and the Trump administration’s national security plans for the Arctic region.

The U.S. House of Representatives is proposing a 23 percent decrease in NSF spending levels, while the Senate’s reductions are comparatively minimal, just 0.7 percent.

The ARCUS board recommended that the organization shut down, a move supported by the membership. “This decision to sunset ARCUS was not rash in any way,” said Audrey Taylor, its executive director, on a farewell call to supporters, scientists and media on Friday. “It was responsive to a number of things happening throughout the funding streams and throughout the federal government and the Arctic research community landscape writ large that have been going on for a number of years, but certainly came to a head in this last six months.”

Founded in 1988, ARCUS advanced Arctic research by connecting scientists, government agencies, Indigenous communities and nonprofits all over the world. Its dozens of projects included an Indigenous scholars program, the launch of the Sea Ice Prediction Network and an initiative to develop the prediction network’s sea ice forecast reports.

That research not only shed light on the effects of global climate change on sea ice, but provided crucial information for local subsistence hunters and businesses that relied on Alaskan shipping channels.

ARCUS, based in Fairbanks, Alaska, is closing at a critical time. Over the past several decades, federal data show Arctic air, ocean and land temperatures have increased at a rate more than twice the global average.

In May, the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy revised an implementation plan for the Arctic. Under the Biden administration, it had prioritized community resilience and health, hazard mitigation and sustainable economies and livelihoods, as well as the global climate impacts of a warming Arctic.

The Trump administration amended the list to prioritize community, economic, energy and military security. The changes mirror an executive order that Trump issued on his first day in office, “Unleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Potential,” that rescinded Biden-era energy regulations and replaced them with measures to fast-track fossil fuel drilling and exploration.

The melting of Arctic sea ice also allows other countries, particularly Russia and China, to more easily access the region. That could turn Alaska into a chessboard for international military maneuvers, whose value is measured by its geopolitical usefulness—similar to Hawaii and Guam.

“In the early days, anything we did in Arctic research had to be justified from the importance of why the Arctic was important to the Lower 48,” Larry Hinzman said on the farewell call. He is the former assistant director for polar sciences and the executive director for the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee in the White House from 2020 to 2024.

“ARCUS has really helped us change that perception and made the Arctic a presence in its own right,” Hinzman said. “I just can’t emphasize enough what an impact that ARCUS has had to the Arctic research community over the years, and actually to communities in the Arctic.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2215603850-1024x768.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 19:01:28.577719

Many spots again observed a more than 30° jump from the observed low temperatures to the observed high temperatures. Most once again ended up with highs in the upper 80s with several 90° readings.

Our blocking pattern this week ends soon! Notice the counterclockwise spin of an upper low. It drifts east tonight and brings more clouds here first. There are showers in Illinois but those will have a tough time holding as they enter a very dry environment. I won’t rule out a stray shower tonight but most, if not all, stay dry.

This weekend is when the changes arrive. If you have outdoor plans, Saturday is the day when rain shouldn’t bring impacts. Expect mostly to partly cloudy skies with the warm temperatures continuing in the upper 80s. As that upper-level low gets closer, the slightly higher rain chances come with it starting Sunday.

With the changes, this low will be cut off from the jet stream and nearly stationary from Sunday into the work week. This means (1) daily chances exist, (2) dry hours are promised and (3) cooler temperatures but higher dew points will be around. In the near term, the highest rain chances look to be late Sunday into Monday morning then again toward the middle of the week.

Total rainfall will help in putting a dent in our drought situation. However, it won’t help when it comes to the longer 60-90 day lack of rainfall across central Indiana. Most of the region is now under a Moderate Drought.

The rain will need something to feed off each day. That will come with increased humidity levels/dew points each day.

The 120-acre site at 1500 S. Tibbs Ave. has a long history of contamination.

It operated as a specialty chemicals production facility since the 1950s. Until 1972, a coal-tar refining and wood treatment facility that used creosote operated at the site. Creosote is a substance considered a likely contributor to cancer. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, site operators used a trench, a landfill and several pits to dispose of waste. Those waste handling practices contaminated the groundwater and soil.

The EPA placed it on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in 1984.

The site has opened and closed over the years and changed owners. It most recently closed in 2024.

“What I remember is the smell, the stench,” said Linda, a neighbor of 50 years. “It was putrid. There was always a layering of dirt or dust all over everything. Always a layering. You could wash your car and go out a couple of hours later, and it’s like a dust storm came through. It was that bad.”

In the 80s, Linda attended every meeting with the EPA for over a year.

“I learned that tons of chemicals were underground,” she said. “I did not know that. I don’t think anybody knew that.”

She remembers a few neighbors who still used wells and weren’t hooked up to city water. They had to get rid of their wells because the water wasn’t safe to drink.

Groundwater monitors detected benzene, a cancer-causing chemical.

“It’s like, what is this going to do to our health?” Linda said. “A lot of our neighbors are gone now, but they all felt the same thing that we did.”

“It’s nothing today like it was in the 80s,” she said. “But it’s still scary, because we lived here that whole time and you don’t know what the future holds.”

The existing groundwater extraction system has been operating at the site since 1994.

This month, crews will begin installing a new air sparging system. It’s intended to capture contaminants including benzene, ammonia and pyridine. The EPA says air sparging is the process of injecting air into the ground below the water table. It flushes the contaminants up through the groundwater as air bubbles and gets captured with a vapor extraction system.

1500 South Tibbs LCC is responsible for installing 73 air sparging wells along the east side under EPA’s oversight.

Crews will also install additional wells to monitor the cleanup process.

The EPA estimates the construction will be done in February. The existing system will remain online until the new air sparging system is fully operational.

“These are the pods once they’re mostly dry. But you can see we’ve got some of different colors,” Geiger said. “This is a blue-ish gray pod.”

He’s working with the Utopian Seed Project, an Asheville-based nonprofit, to test crops that will be climate resilient.

“Having seeds and crops that are resilient to our weather extremes is the best way to adapt to a changing climate,” Geiger said.

Several years ago, Geiger owned a food truck, then started a farm in Denton in 2020.

“[I] just got real interested in sourcing local ingredients and then kind of went down a rabbit hole of growing them myself,” Geiger said.

He says now he’s fairly hooked on farming.

With this project, he’s contributing to growing ingredients that can withstand the volatile nature of weather.

“Having more resilient plant varieties is definitely very important as we see more weather extreme events,” Geiger said.

The Utopian Seed Project uses crossbreeding to take different varieties to create hybrid versions of crops. Then Geiger can select and refine the seed collection. This year he grew three to four varieties of southern peas.

“These are the black-eyed peas that we’ve already shelled and harvested,” Geiger said.

With the southern peas that performed best, he’ll take those seeds and grow them again next year for a higher yield.

“It’s great. I’m very excited to be able to share our progress with the other growers. We have little groups that we’re able to share our successes, failures, what’s doing the best. Being able to collaborate and be in these groups with other plant breeders and seed savers,” Geiger said. “It makes me feel like there’s good progress to be had.”

“Probably the biggest thing would be it’s relatively quiet.” Muller said they're seeing demand for electric tractors from Europe, where farming policies are sometimes more progressive.
Some entrepreneurs see electric tractors as a step on the path to automation — fewer workers, more efficiency and less cost.","East Lansing — In the soft dirt of an indoor horseback riding ring last month, a group of farmers got ready to test drive a new piece of equipment: an electric tractor.

As they took turns climbing in — some surprised by its quick acceleration — they gave real-time feedback to the Michigan State University researchers who have been developing it for over two years.

The farmers remarked on the motor's quiet whir. Most were intrigued, or at least open to the idea. Some were concerned that the battery on the underside of the carriage would mean a lower clearance over the field, while others worried that it would simply be too expensive.

“What we hope to do when we retire is we want to get everything electric on the farm. The tractor is the last electric implement to get,” said Don Dunklee, one of the farmers to provide feedback. He runs a small organic vegetable farm that's relied on wind and solar for decades.

The market is fairly new, but some researchers and entrepreneurs think electric tractors will be ideal for small farmers who care about sustainability and want to market their products that way. The small cherry-red, open-cab machine is well-suited for tasks like weeding fields of specialty crops like carrots or asparagus, or squeezing between the tight rows of orchard trees. Farmers with solar panels can avoid the cost of diesel.

Agriculture is among the largest sources of climate-warming emissions worldwide. Though tractors are a small culprit, experts believe an environmentally friendly machine would still attract buyers interested in sustainability.

“There’s reduced emissions, but before you get there, you have to be solving for other problems,” including noise, ease of use and cost, said Derek Muller, business manager for battery electric systems at John Deere.

There are downsides — electric tractors are aimed at filling a niche, not overturning the status quo. And while battery technology has come a long way, they can’t last all day or match the massive horsepower of a diesel engine that sets giant tractors cruising through the sprawling grain and soybean operations of the Midwest.

Few companies offer electric tractor options

In addition to battery limitations, there are other structural obstacles. Most farmers do not have fast electric chargers, nor do they have solar panels to supply those chargers with free electricity — diesel would need to be much more expensive for the economics to turn sharply in favor of electric. But companies are starting to see an opportunity.

“For John Deere, it is not the only solution,” Muller said. “It’s not going to be where we lead our efforts. It’s going to be one of many options.”

The company has built a small utility electric tractor prototype. It joins a limited set of offerings from other companies like Monarch Tractor, which started in 2019 with the aim to help farmers, who have traditionally struggled with razor-thin profits to save money, work sustainably and more efficiently.

Ajit Srivastava, an agricultural engineer and Michigan State professor who hosted the farmer feedback session, wants to help smallholder farmers across the world. Such farmers grow about a third of the world’s food, but many do it with only hand tools. He started trying to emulate a pair of oxen made of off-the-shelf parts, so anyone could build it themselves.

“If we were to mechanize all the smallholder farmers in the world, there isn’t enough diesel out there to power them. So we have to find some other source,” Srivastava said.

It's still a work in progress. Rain had postponed the feedback session, originally planned for the spring, because the tractor hadn't been waterproofed yet. It also doesn't have enough power for some jobs like tilling. But farmers generally like what Srivastava had developed. He hopes it could eventually be sold for roughly $30,000, substantially cheaper than some of the competition.

“The steering is really responsive. It just seems to run really smooth,” said Dunklee, adding, however, that it might not do everything he needs on a farm yet. “Probably the biggest thing would be it’s relatively quiet.”

Muller said they're seeing demand for electric tractors from Europe, where farming policies are sometimes more progressive. And there's also a market at universities in other countries where researchers are studying agriculture, said Brendan Dowdle, chief business officer of Bonsai Robotics, which sells modular, automated electric farm robots that can work together to mimic some tasks ordinarily done by a tractor.

One possible customer is the so-called “gentleman farmer” who has a small operation of specialty crops or vegetables and farms for fun, not necessarily to make a living.

“They want to be self-sustaining,” said Patrick Woolcock, an associate engineering professor and agriculture expert at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls.

Plus, without harmful diesel emissions, they can work in greenhouses and, with fewer parts, there's hope repairs won't be as complicated, at least once a readily available supply is established.

Could electric tractors be more compatible with automation?

Some entrepreneurs see electric tractors as a step on the path to automation — fewer workers, more efficiency and less cost. Engineers are now designing machines that will drive themselves and power precise weeders and planters.

For example, Monarch Tractor CEO Praveen Penmetsa noted that if a self-guided tractor gets stuck and has to notify the farmer, electric power has clear benefits. A diesel tractor would sit there idling, but an electric one doesn’t waste fuel while waiting.

Srivastava also said he's just trying to make people's lives easier — looking backward all day to make sure a plow is operating properly is grueling. So, a self-driving tractor would let farmers pay more attention to ensuring harvesting is happening properly, or the weeder isn't accidentally digging up crops.

""Not that we want to take the operator off the tractor, the operator would be there, but they can focus on how well the operation is going rather than making sure the tractor is in the rows,"" he said.

Still, some aren’t so sure electric has such a big advantage when it comes to automation. Tim Bucher, CEO of Agtonomy, a company focused on bringing autonomy software to farm vehicles, was all-in on electric a few years ago. But the technology has gotten so good that now his customers can pick and choose the energy source for their tractor and see similar results, he said. And with government electric vehicle subsidies disappearing, there's less incentive for most farmers to go that route.

On his own farm, though, he opts for electric, and he says he's seen economic returns.

And from an environmental perspective, “it also just makes me feel better,” he said.

A companion Request for Information (RFI), with responses due Nov. 21, 2025, aims to surface projects and bottlenecks across regions – everything from inter-regional transmission and reconductoring to bringing retired thermal assets back online or building new and balanced portfolios of generation – and how best to utilize its funding programs and authorities to meet this demand growth.

The launch follows DOE's report, ""Evaluating the Reliability and Security of the United States Electric Grid,"" developed under President Donald Trump's executive order (EO) on ""Strengthening the Reliability and Security of the United States Electric Grid"" (EO 14262). That analysis underscores an urgent reality: Planned retirements and interconnection delays – combined with AI/data center and industrial load growth – are stressing the U.S. electric grid. DOE is now asking industry, states, regulators, utilities and grid operators to help identify what can be advanced quickly and how federal tools should be applied to do so.

How Speed to Power Fits the Administration's Policy Framework

Speed to Power aligns with several administration priorities:

Unleashing American Energy (EO 14154). Emphasizes abundant, reliable and affordable energy across the nation as an economic and national security imperative.

Removing Barriers to American Leadership in AI (EO 14179). Prioritizes building U.S. AI dominance to promote economic competitiveness and national security.

Strengthening Grid Reliability and Security (EO 14262). Directs DOE to use a uniform reliability methodology to guide federal interventions to meet growing demand.

Reinvigorating America's Nuclear Industrial Base (EO 14302). Encourages rapid deployment of nuclear generation as firm, dispatchable capacity.

Together, these actions point to a federal posture that is both pro-build and time-sensitive – with Speed to Power as the mechanism to identify and accelerate critical projects that can realistically increase power availability and reliability over the near-term to accommodate and enable load growth.

What DOE Is Looking For

DOE seeks information on large-scale projects that could enable at least 3 GW (and up to 20 GW) of incremental load, including:

New interregional lines (≥1,000 megavolt-amperes (MVA)) and reconductoring of existing lines (≥500 MVA) to increase load-serving capability.

Bringing retired thermal generation facilities back into service or otherwise using the existing interconnection capacity to provide reliable power generation.

DOE is also inviting respondents to flag high-priority geographic areas – such as data center corridors, semiconductor clusters, industrial parks and port complexes – where targeted federal support could unlock major private investment but where grid constraints (i.e., capacity, congestion and interconnection) stand in the way.

Programs and Authorities on the Table

While the RFI is not a funding opportunity, DOE explicitly asks how its programs and authorities should be deployed to accelerate delivery. Relevant tools include:

Transmission Facilitation Program (TFP). DOE acts as an ""anchor customer"" and administers borrowing authority to support and de-risk large interregional projects.

Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP). Competitive funding for grid hardening, optimization and advanced technologies.

Loan Programs Office (LPO). Debt financing for eligible transmission, generation and integrated systems under Title 17 authorities.

Technical Assistance. Modeling, planning support and national lab expertise to help design bankable, buildable solutions.

For sponsors weighing capital stacks, the RFI also invites input on where gaps exist and how DOE could best de-risk early stages to crowd in private capital.

Connection to Recent INL RFA

Speed to Power complements DOE's recent Request for Applications (RFA) for long-term lease agreements to use federal land at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for AI data center and integrated energy infrastructure – a site-specific opportunity that encouraged engagement with GDO and LPO on financing pathways independent of leasing decisions. (See Holland & Knight's previous blog post, ""DOE Opportunity to Lease INL Land for AI Data Centers and Integrated Energy Infrastructure,"" Sept. 12, 2025.)

Who Should Consider Responding

Utilities and public power entities with major load additions or grid constraints in their service territories

Regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and independent system operators (ISOs) coordinating interregional solutions or facing queue backlogs

Large load customers (e.g., AI/data center operators, semiconductor fabrication plants and industrial facilities) with location-specific, near-term needs

Generation and transmission developers with advanced projects that can materially increase power availability and reliability

State energy offices (SEOs) and public utility commissions (PUCs) with development investment zones or corridor designations with projected demand growth from data centers, advanced manufacturing facilities, semiconductor plants and other large energy users

Technology and software providers with solutions that can realistically be deployed quickly to increase power availability or address grid constraints

How Holland & Knight Can Help

Holland & Knight advises investors, utilities and large-load customers on federal energy programs, including through GDO (TFP/GRIP) and LPO financing pathways. We can help scope a targeted RFI response, align projects with the appropriate federal tools, and position near-term projects for accelerated delivery.

A Massachusetts-funded EV rebate program will still be available after the federal tax credit ends.
The federal tax credit has income eligibility limits and requirements for vehicles to qualify.
Consumers can also take advantage of lower monthly payments on leased EVs through the expiring tax credit.
The other driver of EV sales, charging stations, seem to be back on track.","Car buyers have less than two weeks to take advantage of federal discounts that provide up to $7,500 toward the purchase of electric vehicles.

With the expiration of the federal tax credit at the end of this month, environmental policy experts said, there's one less incentive to buy the climate-friendly vehicles, and they're concerned about how Massachusetts will meet its goals for slashing planet-warming emissions.

“ It's going to be a lot harder to find a way to increase adoption to the levels that we need,” said Anna Vanderspek, electric vehicle program director at the nonprofit Green Energy Consumers Alliance.

Still, she said, consumers can still make the switch to EVs.

""This is not all going to grind to a halt,"" she said. ""It is a challenging time, but that does not mean that this transition is not moving forward.""

The federal discount was designed to encourage drivers to go electric. In ending the credit, Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration argued the government shouldn't place its thumb on automobile markets in favor of one type of vehicle over another.

In Massachusetts, staff at some local dealerships said they've seen an increase in interest and sales of EVs in recent weeks, as consumers try to take advantage of the credit before the looming Sept. 30 deadline. Some dealerships' websites feature online countdown clocks until the credit expires.

Nationally, EV sales are also up. Last month, more than 145,000 EVs were sold across the country and made up nearly 10% of all new vehicle sales, according to Kelley Blue Book estimates. This quarter, the U.S. could hit an all-time record for EV sales, the report stated.

Despite the “mad rush” to use the tax credit, EV sales will likely slow after it sunsets, said Christopher Knittel, professor of energy economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and director of the university's Climate Policy Center.

In 2023, research out of MIT and Harvard University projected that federal tax credits, combined with efforts to install charging stations on highways nationwide, would increase EV adoption by 18% through the end of the decade. Knittel suspects customers could turn away from the EV without the financial incentive program.

“ Those are customers that are buying it because the tax credit exists, and if you pull it away, they're gonna go back to the internal combustion engine vehicle,” Knittel said.

Taking away the tax credits could reduce the number of EV sales through the end of the decade by around 6%, according to updated models from the Harvard and MIT team.

Massachusetts needs residents to register 900,000 EVs by the end of this decade in order to meet its climate change target. Last year, officials reported 140,000 EVs were on the state's roads. That pace of EV adoption has to increase for the state to meet its goal, Vanderspek said.

A Massachusetts-funded EV rebate program will still be available after the federal tax credit ends. The state incentive provides up to $3,500 for eligible vehicles. And Uber, Lyft and taxi drivers are eligible for a $6,500 credit. Some low-income households can also qualify for an additional $1,500.

Lauren Diggin, spokesperson for the state Department of Energy Resources, said staff works to ensure the rebate program ""operates as cost-effectively as possible to support broad adoption of EVs, and to better support increased adoption among disadvantaged communities, which are disproportionately impacted by harmful transportation emissions.""

The state will continue to help residents looking to purchase an EV ""as the Trump administration dismantles federal programs that support affordable clean vehicles,"" she said.

The federal tax credit has income eligibility limits and requirements for vehicles to qualify. The IRS also clarified last month that as long as a buyers sign a sales contract and make a payment before Sept. 30, they can qualify for the credit even if their car is delivered after the deadline.

Consumers can also take advantage of lower monthly payments on leased EVs through the expiring tax credit. They count as commercial vehicles, so there's a wider range of qualifying cars and the person leasing doesn't need to meet the income requirements that buyers do. Dealerships claim a commercial tax credit and often pass savings onto consumers.

Whether buyers get the tax credit when they buy a car or when they file their taxes, Vanderspek said to make sure and get a “time of sale” report from the dealership within three days of purchase. That will allow buyers to prove their purchase happened before the deadline.

The other driver of EV sales, charging stations, seem to be back on track. The Trump administration resumed a federal charging infrastructure program in August after freezing its funding for months, but research suggests that won't make up for the loss of individual discounts.

Knittel sees potential for the state continue its work on charging infrastructure, which could encourage more EV adoption without the cost of tax incentives. The Northeast has some of the highest density of public EV charging ports in the country, with Massachusetts topping the list, according to data from the nonprofit Climate Central.

Last month, state officials announced $46 million to add more charging infrastructure.

""Access to EV charging is essential if we’re serious about reducing emissions and developing a transportation system that’s resilient, fair, and prepared for the challenges of climate change,"" said state Transportation Secretary Monica Tibbits-Nutt in the announcement.

Still, shifts in federal climate policy — like a proposal to end the legal underpinning for tailpipe emissions standards — and uncertainty about tariffs could spell further uncertainty for the EV industry, as well as for consumers, Knittel said.

"" The most concerning thing to me is the yo-yo nature of climate policy at a federal level,” Knittel said. ""We've really gone into a world where we just have uncertain policy and that's gonna have much longer term impacts than what we're talking about today.""",https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/nepm-ev-1000x750.jpeg,N,,2025-09-19 18:03:58.349179

I also said the temporary deployment of the National Guard, which doesn’t have law enforcement training, was unlikely to make our community safer but will affect tourism, restaurant, construction and other industries. See a release with my exchange with Director Patel here(link is external).

Introducing Safe Streets for All Act

On Thursday, I introduced the Safe Streets for All (SS4A) Reauthorization and Improvement Act with Congressmen Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Robert Garcia of California. The legislation aims to reduce traffic accidents by supporting projects protecting pedestrians, cyclists, scooter-riders, motorists and transit riders. This is an important and successful program from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and I am working to ensure it continues. See details about the measure here(link is external).

Meeting with Memphis Constituent Groups

These meetings are helpful in shaping my approach to voting, and I always welcome the opportunity to talk with constituents from Tennessee’s 9th Congressional District to my Washington office.

Calling for Independent Congressional Redistricting

On Wednesday, I introduced the John Tanner and Jim Cooper Fairness and Independence in Redistricting (FAIR) Act to require states to remove politics from their congressional apportionment practices and establish independent redistricting commissions. The measure is named for two former Tennessee congressmen who championed an end to partisan gerrymandering. Read about the measure here(link is external).

Kara-Murza, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 2024 while in prison, was released in a prisoner exchange last year. He is a true hero. As the Special Representative on Political Prisoners for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s Parliamentary Assembly, I discouraged Vladimir’s return to Russia in 2022 and worked diligently to keep his illegal detention in the headlines until he was released.

Denouncing Apparent Censoring of Trump Critics

ABC yanked late night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air on Wednesday citing some innocuous comments he made about the MAGA movement and its reaction to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. This follows CBS’s decision to cancel late night host Stephen Colbert in a transparent attempt to muzzle any criticism of Trump and his administration. These decisions, made while each broadcaster’s ownership companies are awaiting government approvals for multi-billion-dollar mergers, smack of government censorship in an age of fear and must be loudly and passionately condemned. As a democracy, we have a long tradition of criticizing public and elected officials, and the First Amendment guarantees that free speech. I spoke about this issue on the floor Thursday night which you can see here(link is external), and I cosponsored a resolution to condemn these attacks on free speech.

VPPs connect small energy systems and smart devices into a single network managed by an energy company or utility. That can include residential solar panels, battery storage, EVs, and smart thermostats. When the grid needs help during peak demand or emergencies, they can be tapped – and you get paid for participating.

Wood Mackenzie’s “2025 North America Virtual Power Plant Market” report shows that the market is expanding more broadly than deeply. The number of company deployments, unique buyers (offtakers), and market and utility programs each grew by more than 33% in the past year. But total capacity grew at a slower pace – just under 14%. “Utility program caps, capacity accreditation reforms, and market barriers have prevented capacity from growing as fast as market activity,” said Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid edge at Wood Mackenzie.

Residential VPP customers are gaining ground

Residential customers are making a bigger dent in wholesale market capacity, increasing their share to 10.2% from 8.8% in 2024. But small customers still face roadblocks, mainly due to limits on data access for enrollment and market settlement.

Battery storage and EVs are also playing a bigger role. Deployments that include batteries or EVs now account for 61% as many as those that include smart thermostats, which have long dominated VPP programs.

Leading states and markets

California, Texas, New York, and Massachusetts are leading the pack, making up 37% of all VPP deployments. In wholesale markets, PJM (which manages the electric grid for 13 states and DC) and ERCOT (the Texas grid), both home to massive data center commitments, also have the highest disclosed VPP offtake capacity. “While data centers are the source of new load, there’s an enormous opportunity to tap VPPs as the new source of grid flexibility,” Hertz-Shargel said.

Offtake growth and new business models

The top 25 VPP offtakers each procured more than 100 megawatts this year. Over half of all offtakers expanded their deployments by at least 30% compared to last year. That’s fueling the rise of a new “independent distributed power producer” model, where companies aim to use grid service revenue and energy arbitrage to finance third-party-owned storage for electricity retailers.

Policy pushback

Not everyone is on board with how utilities are approaching distributed energy resources (DERs). Many VPP aggregators and software providers oppose utilities putting DERs into their rate base under the Distributed Capacity Procurement model.* “This model is seen as limiting access of private capital and aggregators from the DER market, rather than leveraging customer and third-party-owned resources,” Hertz-Shargel explained. He added that most wholesale market experts believe FERC Order 2222 was a missed opportunity and won’t significantly improve market access.

*I really like this model, personally. I leased two Tesla Powerwalls under Green Mountain Power’s Lease Energy Storage program in Vermont for $55 a month, and it’s an excellent VPP program that’s grown much more rapidly than other models, such as bring-your-own batteries.

Steps to Take Now Plan with the deadline in mind: Review project timelines to confirm construction begins before June 30, 2026.
Final Word The construction start date is more than just a project milestone, it’s the gatekeeper to one of the most valuable tax deductions available today.
With the One Big Beautiful Bill sunsetting §179D on June 30, 2026, acting now ensures your project is on the right side of the deadline.","On July 4, 2025, Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill, a landmark piece of legislation that expanded the §179D Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction into one of the most powerful tax incentives available to building owners and designers. But this opportunity won’t last forever. The program sunsets on June 30, 2026. That means only buildings that start construction prior to this date will be eligible to claim the deduction.

After the deadline, the door to significant tax savings through §179D closes for projects that have not yet started.

Why Construction Start Date Matters

The construction start date is purely about eligibility. It does not determine which energy-efficiency standard applies. Instead, it’s the deciding factor for whether your project can claim the deduction at all.

Start before June 31, 2026 → Eligible to pursue up to $5.81 per square foot in deductions.

Start after June 31, 2026 → Not eligible, no matter how efficient the building becomes.

How the IRS Defines “Start of Construction”

The IRS recognizes construction through the use of 2 methodologies:

Method 1: Physical Work Test

Significant physical work on site is performed such as foundation work, plumbing, vertical construction, etc.…

This does not include site clearing, planning, design, permitting, etc..

Method 2: Safe Harbor

Incur 5% of the total cost of the facility. Additionally, work must be continuous.

In both cases, proper documentation of these activities is essential to demonstrate compliance with the eligibility cutoff.

What This Means for Owners and Designers

Building Owners: Beginning construction before June 30, 2026 locks in eligibility and ensures the opportunity to capture six- and seven-figure tax savings. Waiting too long could mean missing out entirely.

Eligible Designers: For architects, engineers, and contractors working on government or tax-exempt projects, starting construction before the deadline is the only way to receive an allocation of the deduction.

Steps to Take Now

Plan with the deadline in mind: Review project timelines to confirm construction begins before June 30, 2026.

Document thoroughly: Keep dated photos, contracts, and invoices to prove when significant work started.

Engage your advisors: Tax consultants and energy modelers can provide guidance and prepare the necessary reports and allocation letters.

Final Word

The construction start date is more than just a project milestone, it’s the gatekeeper to one of the most valuable tax deductions available today.

With the One Big Beautiful Bill sunsetting §179D on June 30, 2026, acting now ensures your project is on the right side of the deadline.

,EPA,2025-09-19 20:17:18+00:00,Inside Climate News,Children Plead With U.S. Lawmakers to Protect EPA's Endangerment Finding,"Carl David Goette-Luciak, Wyatt Myskow",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/19092025/children-lawmakers-protest-epa-endangerment-finding-move/,"Repeal of the endangerment finding stands to fundamentally reshape the lives of young people, who will bear the brunt of climate change.
“Kids want the EPA to preserve the endangerment finding to protect our health and future,” said 12-year-old Valencia, who lives in Maryland.
The EPA determined at that time that the evidence was clear, and formalized the endangerment finding in 2009.
“The EPA couldn’t disapprove and deny the connection between greenhouse gases and climate change then, and they can’t now,” Markey told the audience.
“If the endangerment finding is overturned, all the environmental groups will come together in bringing a case against the EPA,” Rogers, a former judicial clerk, told ICN.","School-age children carrying signs reading “less pollution, more solution” and “people over polluters” gathered on Wednesday inside the U.S. Capitol to oppose the Trump administration’s plan to roll back greenhouse gas regulations.

Congressional leaders and climate advocates joined the youth at the press conference, where they denounced the Environmental Protection Agency’s move to reconsider the landmark 2009 endangerment finding, the backbone of emissions regulation.

The backdrop of young faces underscored a point lawmakers and experts repeated throughout the event: that the debate is not just over statutory interpretation, science or judicial precedent. Repeal of the endangerment finding stands to fundamentally reshape the lives of young people, who will bear the brunt of climate change.

“Kids want the EPA to preserve the endangerment finding to protect our health and future,” said 12-year-old Valencia, who lives in Maryland. “Our generation is expected to live through three times as many climate disasters as our grandparents, and we’re already living through them.”

Holding aloft hand-drawn posters with messages like “climate change makes camp unsafe,” the kids described how environmental issues were already constraining the fun of their childhood. “My swim practices have gotten canceled because of wildfire smoke and recess gets moved inside when it’s too hot outside,” Margot, a 10-year-old from Virginia, told the crowd. “It’s really scary.”

Several lawmakers present reflected on their own childhoods, before pollution was reined in by the environmental policies now in the administration’s crosshairs. Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) recalled “feeling that burning sensation in your eyes or in your throat because air quality was so bad.” He recounted how, growing up in Los Angeles in the 1970s, children had to stay home from school and avoid playing outdoors because of air pollution levels. “If you truly don’t believe in the power of cleaner vehicle standards, then think about these kids,” Padilla said.

Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) grounded the fight in history. His state argued, in Massachusetts v. EPA nearly two decades ago, that greenhouse gases were air pollutants and therefore must be regulated under the Clean Air Act. The Supreme Court agreed in its 2007 ruling, which compelled the EPA to determine, based on scientific evidence, whether emissions posed a serious threat to public health. The EPA determined at that time that the evidence was clear, and formalized the endangerment finding in 2009. It vested the agency with the authority—and the legal obligation—to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

“The EPA couldn’t disapprove and deny the connection between greenhouse gases and climate change then, and they can’t now,” Markey told the audience. “We have the facts on our side—Trump’s EPA is pushing its own fictions.”

Markey’s comments were backed up the same day by a publication from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine that will be submitted to the EPA. Authors of the new report from the nation’s premier group of scientific advisers reviewed the wealth of studies amassed by the scientific community since the endangerment finding was released, concluding that the evidence that emissions endanger human health is “beyond scientific dispute” and “has only grown stronger.”

“Much of the understanding of climate change that was uncertain or tentative in 2009 is now resolved and new threats have been identified,” the report said, drawing on some 600 studies published in the past 16 years. Those newly identified threats include climate change’s impact on metabolic disease, antimicrobial resistance, immune health, nutrition, mental health, pregnancy and birth outcomes, the scientists wrote. “The United States faces a future in which climate-induced harm continues to worsen and today’s extremes become tomorrow’s norms,” their report said.

The National Academies report is one of the more important documents to emerge in the brief public comment period that the EPA provided. That’s because Congress spelled out, in the Clean Air Act, that the agency should draw on the findings, recommendations and comments of the private, nonprofit institution, which operates under a 1863 congressional charter, signed by President Abraham Lincoln. Typically, the Academies write reports in response to requests from Congress or administrations, but in this case, no such request was made. The organization decided to self-fund a rapid response review of the science, completing it in just over 40 days.

Markey likened Lee Zeldin, Trump’s EPA head, to the mayor in the 1975 film “Jaws,” who keeps the town’s lucrative beaches open for swimming despite evidence of shark attacks and warnings from experts. “He’s trying to tell the American people, it’s all clear to get back in the water. Nothing to see here, folks. No danger from climate change. No laws that require him to fight pollution. No court precedent that demands the agency he leads must keep us safe.”

“We know that people are not safe; there’s blood in the water and more fossil fuel sharks than ever,” Markey added. “This attack on the endangerment finding is a clear and present danger to the public.”

In the 16 years since the endangerment finding, it was challenged numerous times by industry groups and their allies, but courts consistently upheld the EPA’s finding as “unambiguously correct.” Now, the Trump administration is moving to overturn years of precedent in just a few months.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said the EPA’s decision was the result of infiltration by the fossil fuel industry. Whitehouse described how the parasitoid wasp injects other bugs with its larva, which then controls the victim insect from the inside. “The Trump EPA is the bug and the fossil fuel larvae are in there, driving all of its decisions,” Whitehouse said.

Whitehouse announced an investigation Tuesday into whether the EPA’s decision had been shaped by industry groups. “I am concerned about the role that fossil fuel companies, certain manufacturers, trade associations, polluter-backed groups and others with much to benefit from the repeal of the endangerment finding … played in drafting, preparing, promoting, and lobbying on the proposal,” Whitehouse wrote in a formal request for documents from 24 companies and organizations.

Zeldin announced the plan to rescind the Endangerment Finding on July 29, promising to “end $1 trillion or more in hidden taxes on American businesses and families.” If successful, the move could repeal all emissions standards for vehicles and end the reporting programs that track emissions data.

The announcement provoked immediate and significant public backlash.

During the first day of public hearings on the EPA’s proposal, Inside Climate News counted only 10 people who testified in support out of roughly 200 speakers. The overwhelming majority expressed deep concern over the decision’s potential consequences to human health, environment and industry.

The EPA extended the deadline for public input until Sept. 22, and the agency’s docket has now drawn more than 100,000 comments. Federal law requires that the EPA respond to significant comments before issuing any rule and incorporate the substance of those comments into the final regulation.

If the public fails to shift the EPA’s course, litigation will become inevitable, according to Kathleen Rogers, president of environmental advocacy group EarthDay.org. “If the endangerment finding is overturned, all the environmental groups will come together in bringing a case against the EPA,” Rogers, a former judicial clerk, told ICN. “It’ll go to the Supreme Court either way.” The National Academies report undoubtedly will be used as evidence in the legal challenges.

Rogers said the EPA would ultimately be asking the Supreme Court to overturn its own precedent. However, Rogers said it was “concerning” that three of the justices who, in 2007, wrote dissenting opinions in Massachusetts v. EPA—Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito—are still on the court today. “The Supreme Court ruling against itself isn’t that unprecedented anymore,” Rogers said. “Presidential power has become everything.”

“If the endangerment finding is overturned, all the environmental groups will come together in bringing a case against the EPA.” Rogers, a former judicial clerk,

The Trump administration based its justification for dismantling the endangerment finding on a U.S. Department of Energy report that downplayed the danger of climate change and argued that mitigating its effects could be more harmful than helpful. The report, which was widely discredited and dismissed by the scientific community—was penned by the administration’s since-disbanded Climate Working Group, composed of five prominent skeptics of the scientific consensus on climate change.

The Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists filed a lawsuit accusing the Climate Working Group of violating the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which mandates transparency and balanced consideration from such bodies. President Trump insisted the group was exempt from those rules, but on Wednesday, a federal court rejected that argument.

“This Court rules that the Climate Working Group was not assembled to ‘exchange facts or information’ in a manner that would bring it into the claimed exception,” the order read, opening the path for the legal challenge to advance.

Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) highlighted Wednesday how long environmental regulation had enjoyed bipartisan support. “I’m here to praise Richard Nixon for creating the EPA and the Clean Air Act. I’m here to praise Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, whose leadership recognized that global pollution demands global solutions,” Casten said, adding that Zeldin had a duty to administer the policies established by the courts and Congress.

“If he doesn’t do that, he’s breaking the law. He’s breaking his oath, and he is putting every one of us in jeopardy,” Casten added.

Reese Wilkerson, a 15-year-old from Maryland, was among the last to speak before the group of children and advocates left to visit the EPA, where they delivered hundreds of letters, from people across the country, opposing the agency’s regulatory rollback. “To every adult listening today, who cares about children now and who cares about our lives in the future, we are asking you to please protect the endangerment finding—and our future.”

Today, there are five, according to Cox Automotive. Not one is electric.

But stalwarts like Ford Motor Co. and startups like Slate Auto are looking to change that, and they’re focusing on Americans’ favorite vehicle: the pickup.

With President Trump’s tax bill killing EV incentives at the end of the month, the push for a sub-$30,000 vehicle that runs on electrons may help buttress the projected dip in sales.

The average price of a new car in the U.S. hovers at $49,100, nearly a third higher than it was in summer 2019. The average EV price is higher still, $8,000 above that of the industry at-large, according to Cox Automotive.

Much of the recent auto inflation can be tied to options and add-ons. During the peak of the pandemic-related supply chain crunch, auto executives had trouble getting enough parts, so they put what little they could find into more expensive, lavish vehicles. In many ways, they never looked back.

Last year, the average car sold for one-third more than the average starting price. Most buyers either didn’t want bare-bones base models or couldn’t find them.

But some EV makers see a change ahead. At Slate’s launch event, Chief Executive Officer Chris Barman delivered what has since become a bit of a stump speech for cheap EVs.

“The definition of what’s affordable is broken,” she said.

A blank Slate

Every year, AutoPacific, an industry consultancy, asks car shoppers what features they need. For those looking to spend under $35,000, the list is short. Generally, budget-conscious drivers are willing to splurge for safety features and apathetic when it comes to leather seats, head-up displays and advanced driver-assistance systems.

None of this is lost on Slate. The company’s truck, which it plans to deliver late next year, is to a Ford F-150 what an Ikea futon is to a Pottery Barn sectional. The base version — the company calls it “the blank Slate” — is best described by what it isn’t. It lacks a touchscreen, ambient lighting, cooled seats, air conditioning, all-wheel drive, a stereo and virtually any kind of driver-assistance.

“You could say we took out everything that wasn’t a car,” Barman said at the launch event.

What Slate promises in return is a sticker price in the mid-$20,000s, before any incentives. By Slate’s reckoning, the market is sizable. In America, we love our trucks, but only about one-third of U.S. truck owners tow regularly. We love our road trips, but on average only drive about 30 miles a day.

While roughly 163,000 Americans buy small pickups in a typical year, the potential market for Slate’s EV expands when considering the 4.3 million people who buy a small SUV or the 1.2 million or so who drive off in a compact or subcompact car.

Would-be buyers can also purchase add-ons including speakers, a spare tire, or a kit that converts the truck to an SUV. Buyers can also add accessories in the years after their initial purchase, creating what the company hopes will be a long-tail revenue source.

Detroit reacts

Still, AutoPacific Chief Analyst Ed Kim sees Slate challenged on two fronts. Those considering the startup’s entry-level configuration may instead spring for a used truck that will offer far more features and niceties for the same price. And those considering a higher-end Slate may instead spend their money on a new machine from an established carmaker — say, the Ford Maverick, a pickup that starts around $27,000.

Ford, which dominates the market for full-size pickups, announced plans in August to make a mid-size electric truck that will sell for about $30,000, as well as a battery-powered SUV that will start below $40,000.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said the company was making a “tremendous pivot” to more affordable EVs. “This is a Model T moment for the company,” he told analysts, invoking a car whose price point put Ford on the map and made automobiles ubiquitous in America.

Toyota Motor Corp., whose Tacoma has long outsold every mid-size pickup on the market, is eyeing the tiny-truck market as well. The current Tacoma starts just shy of $32,000; if the company rolls out a smaller rig for less money, it will add yet another option for budget-conscious buyers.

Most Americans say they’re EV inclined. While battery-powered cars account for only about 1 in 10 new cars sales, almost 60% of shoppers say they are “very” or “somewhat” likely to buy an electric vehicle, according to JD Power.

Price is one of the obstacles, a speed bump the Trump administration made bigger when the president signed a tax law that will eliminate federal incentives for battery-powered cars and trucks. Without up to $7,500 purchase tax credits, EVs are expected to be just 27% of the market in 2030, down from nearly half had the incentives stayed in place, according to BloombergNEF’s projections.

Still, BNEF expects electric cars to be as cheap or cheaper than gas versions by around 2028. Even if they won’t help bridge the expected EV sales gap, cheaper models from Slate and Ford could help spur adoption after federal incentives disappear.

Derek Dufon, a 48-year-old architect in Iowa, put down a $50 deposit on a Slate hours after its reveal. Dufon doesn’t need much in the way of luxuries, just space to haul drawings and building materials to job sites and programmable air conditioning for Henry, his boxer-hound mutt.

“It would be great for work,” Dufon says of the truck. “And I’ve got an old house, so there’s always a project going on with that.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c7d890b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb4%2F96%2Fb5ba57a064e4344954e2034f6a48%2F1x-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 17:02:04.808511

Wireless Power Transmission Systems

In recent years, wireless power transmission technologies for devices such as smartphones, wearable devices, drones, and electric vehicles, which can supply electricity without using cables, have garnered increasing attention. There are two types of wireless power transmission systems: one uses microwaves and the other uses laser beams. Microwave wireless power transmission is already in practical use and its use is expanding. On the other hand, optical wireless power transmission using laser beams has not been put into practical use, but it is expected to realize compact long-distance wireless power transmission on the order of kilometers by taking advantage of the high directivity of laser beam technology.

Future prospects envision the development of next-generation infrastructure capable of supplying power and expanding communication coverage in situations and regions where electricity or communication networks are unavailable, such as during disasters, on remote islands, mountainous areas, or at sea. This includes delivering power precisely to specific areas or moving platforms such as drones. Achieving such highly accurate and long-distance power delivery requires laser-based wireless power transmission that takes advantage of its strong directionality.

Existing Technology Challenges and Achievements of This Experiment

The efficiency of optical wireless power transmission technology is generally low, and improvement of efficiency is an issue for practical use. One of the reasons for this is that when a long-distance laser beam propagates, especially in the atmosphere, the intensity distribution becomes uneven, and the efficiency of converting the laser beam into electric power in the photoelectric conversion element becomes low.

In this experiment, researchers combined NTT’s beam-shaping technology with MHI’s light-receiving technology to improve the efficiency of laser wireless power transmission. The team conducted a long-distance optical wireless power transmission experiment in an outdoor environment using long-distance flat beam shaping technology that shaped the beam at the transmission side to achieve uniform beam intensity after one kilometer propagation, and output current leveling technology that suppresses the influence of atmospheric fluctuations with a homogenizer and leveling circuits on the receiving side.

From January to February 2025, MHI conducted an optical wireless power transmission experiment on a runway at the Nanki-Shirahama Airport in Shirahama Town, Nishimuro District, Wakayama Prefecture (Figure 2). A transmission booth equipped with an optical system for emitting the laser beam was installed at one end of the runway, and a reception booth containing a light-receiving panel was placed one kilometer away.

During transmission, the optical axis of the laser was set at a low height of approximately one meter above the ground and aligned horizontally. As a result, the beam was strongly affected by ground heating and wind, and the experiment was conducted under conditions with strong atmospheric turbulence.

Inside the transmission booth, a laser beam with an optical power of 1,035 W was generated. Using a diffractive optical element (DOE), the beam was shaped to create a uniform intensity distribution at a distance of one kilometer. In addition, a beam steering mirror was used to precisely direct the shaped beam toward the receiving panel. The beam exited through the aperture of the transmission booth and propagated across one kilometer of open space, ultimately reaching the reception booth.

During propagation, atmospheric turbulence caused fluctuations in the beam’s intensity, creating hot spots. These were diffused by a homogenizer in the reception booth, resulting in a uniform beam being irradiated onto the receiving panel. The laser beam was then efficiently converted into electrical power (Figure 3). A silicon-based photoelectric conversion element was adopted for the receiving panel, taking into account both cost and availability.

In this experiment, the average electrical power extracted from the receiving panel was 152 W (Figure 4), corresponding to a wireless power transmission efficiency of 15%, defined as the ratio of received electrical power to transmitted optical power. This result marks the world’s highest optical wireless power transmission efficiency ever demonstrated using a silicon-based photoelectric conversion element under conditions of strong atmospheric turbulence. Furthermore, continuous power delivery was successfully maintained for 30 minutes, confirming the feasibility of long-duration power transmission using this technology.

From a safety perspective, the optical transmission system and the receiving panel were each installed inside booths to prevent accidental exposure to high-power laser beams and the scattering of reflected light.

Technical Highlights

Long-Distance Flat Beam Shaping Technology. To improve photoelectric conversion efficiency, it is necessary to make the intensity distribution of the beam incident on the photoelectric conversion element uniform. In this study, MHI proposed a beam shaping method that enables intensity uniformity after long-distance propagation. In this approach, the outer part of the beam is transformed into a ring-shaped pattern using the effect of an axicon lens. The central part of the beam is phase-modulated to expand through the effect of a concave lens. As the beam propagates, the ring-shaped beam and the expanded central beam gradually overlap, resulting in a uniform intensity distribution at the target location, as shown in Figure 5.

For the experiment, MHI optimized the beam design to achieve the desired intensity profile at a distance of one kilometer. The beam shaping was implemented using a diffractive optical element, which improved the uniformity of the beam intensity at the target position located one kilometer away.

Output Current Leveling Technology. As the laser beam propagates through the atmosphere, it is affected by atmospheric turbulence, which disturbs the intensity distribution. Although the flat-beam shaping technique described above can make the intensity distribution more uniform, strong turbulence can still cause the formation of high-intensity spots, as shown in Figure 6.

To address this issue, MHI placed a beam homogenizer in front of the light-receiving panel. The homogenizer diffused high-intensity spots so that the beam was uniformly irradiated onto the panel. In addition, leveling circuits were connected to each photoelectric conversion element on the receiving panel. These circuits helped suppress fluctuations in output current caused by atmospheric turbulence and contributed to a more stabilize overall power output.

These two technologies make it possible to achieve beam uniformity in kilometer-order transmission, which was difficult with conventional beam shaping methods, and to stabilize output in outdoor environments. As a result, stable power supply to remote locations such as isolated islands and disaster-affected areas is expected to become feasible.

Company Roles and the Path Forward

NTT focused on the design and implementation of transmission optics such as beam-shaping techniques. Meanwhile, MHI managed the design and implementation of photodetector optics such as photodetector panels, homogenizers, and leveling circuits.

This technology enables the efficient and stable transmission of energy over long distances even under atmospheric turbulence. In this experiment, silicon was used as the photovoltaic conversion element. However, by employing photovoltaic devices specifically designed to match the wavelength of the laser light, even higher power transfer efficiency can be expected. In addition, the use of laser light sources with higher output power would make it possible to supply larger amounts of electricity.

As a result, flexible and rapid power delivery can be achieved in remote areas such as disaster-stricken regions and remote islands, where the installation of power cables has traditionally been difficult. Beyond terrestrial applications, a wide range of new use cases can also be envisioned based on this technology (Figure 7). Notably, the high directivity and low divergence of laser beams allow for the design of compact and lightweight receiving devices. This is a major advantage for mobile platforms that face strict limitations in weight and payload capacity.

For example, by combining this technology with beam steering techniques, it becomes possible to deliver power wirelessly to drones in flight. This avoids operational constraints such as landing for battery replacement or the use of tethered power supply cables, enabling long-duration and long-distance continuous operation. Such capabilities can enhance disaster-area monitoring as well as wide-area communication relay in mountainous or maritime regions, applications that were previously difficult to realize.

In addition, potential applications in space are anticipated, including power delivery to mobile platforms such as HAPS (High-Altitude Platform Station), which falls within the scope of NTT’s space brand, NTT C89. Looking further ahead, the technology could be applied to power space data centers and lunar rovers, as well as to space solar power systems in which electricity is transmitted from geostationary satellites to the ground via laser. These applications represent areas with strong potential for market expansion.

Through the collaboration between NTT and MHI, the companies have realized the world’s most efficient laser wireless power transfer technology under conditions strongly affected by atmospheric fluctuations. This achievement represents a significant step toward building an innovative technological foundation that can meet a wide range of societal needs, from disaster response to space development.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fig7-use-cases-laser-power-transmission.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 18:04:34.213037

Introduction

The impact of climate change has intensified worldwide, disproportionately affecting communities in the Global South, despite their limited contributions to historical greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Countries across the Global South must address rising climate challenges while balancing broader development goals such as economic growth, job creation, and trade enhancement. In fast-growing regions like India and Africa, where urban populations and energy demands are expanding rapidly, embedding sustainability into economic planning is essential for long-term prosperity. Recognizing this, policymakers are integrating energy security with low-emission technologies not only to meet climate targets, but also to foster economic progress by strengthening the local manufacturing and service sectors to create more local employment opportunities.

The transportation sector is central to the transition. It is both a critical enabler of economic activities—connecting markets, driving trade, and facilitating the movement of people and goods—and a significant source of GHG emissions. Globally, the transportation sector is the third-largest CO2 emitter, with road transportation alone accounting for over 70 percent of the sector’s emissions. To address this, many countries are turning their focus toward decarbonizing transportation through the adoption of low-emission technologies, namely EVs. This shift can unlock major opportunities for economic development through reduced reliance on expensive and imported fuels, enhanced productivity due to improved air quality, and the creation of new manufacturing and employment opportunities.

Though countries like Norway and China are currently leading the EV transition, emerging economies in Africa and Asia are following suit. Many countries are already demonstrating sustained EV adoption, building momentum toward climate resilience, harnessing economic opportunities, and expanding employment.

With distinct economic and policy structures, resource availability, and social priorities throughout the Global South, the transition to low-emissions technologies will take many forms. This diversity presents a valuable pool of knowledge in policy design, financing, technology deployment, and supply chain integration. Strengthening collaboration across the Global South can facilitate the exchange of insights, foster joint innovation, and create foundations for integrated EV supply chains to accelerate the e-mobility transition. In addition, leveraging this collaboration and regional strengths will facilitate real commercial gains built on technological and financial innovation.

Moving toward innovative and cooperative approaches across the Global South, and away from the traditionally siloed efforts, can accelerate progress and advance both economic development and climate goals. This is particularly important for India and many countries across Africa that are well-positioned to harness complementary strengths in policy design, manufacturing, and innovation.

Benefits of Global South Cooperation

Countries in the Global South can seek to harness a range of benefits from increased collaboration:

Countries can develop bilateral and multilateral relationships underpinning commercial ties to build resilient EV supply chains—spanning critical minerals, vehicle components manufacturing, and assembly line development. This has the potential to unlock new markets and investment opportunities, enhancing regional economic growth and increasing employment.

Improved regional coordination mechanisms can facilitate the exchange of ideas, identify areas of cross-collaboration, and strengthen institutional measures for rapid EV deployment.

As countries continue to evolve their EV ecosystems, the exchange of best practices can lead to the development of nuanced policy frameworks that are better suited to local contexts by drawing lessons from countries with similar economic and infrastructure challenges. Facilitating the exchange of best practices enables countries to avoid costly missteps in their own EV transitions.

A robust platform for continued dialogue among partners in the Global South would enable policymakers and private sector stakeholders to identify opportunities to create sectoral partnerships, expand the field of knowledge, and support context-specific development and manufacturing solutions as domestic ecosystems mature.

Untapped Potential of India-Africa Collaboration

India and Africa have long shared close trade relations across key sectors, including automobiles, pharmaceuticals, education, and agriculture. Over the years, trade between India and Africa has increased substantially, from $68.5 billion in 2011–2012 to $83.3 billion in 2023–2024, making India the continent’s third-largest trading partner. India’s trade volume with Africa is expected to double to $200 billion by 2031, presenting a timely opportunity to deepen economic and technology partnerships.

India has been a frontrunner on the EV transition in the Global South, supported by strong policy leadership and an expanding manufacturing ecosystem. In contrast, many countries in Africa are in the early stages of building modern, low-carbon transportation systems. By building on their long-standing cooperation in the automobile sector and channeling it into the EV value chain, India and African countries can drive innovation, reduce costs, and lay the foundation for developing strong regional coordination mechanisms.

India’s national and state-level EV policy frameworks are designed to establish a robust EV value chain. These policies create a strong enabling environment that encourages demand creation, boosts manufacturing, and supports the expansion of EV charging infrastructure (EVCI). Africa, though at an early stage of EV adoption, has a unique opportunity to leapfrog conventional vehicles and go directly to EVs while expanding its own manufacturing ecosystem by drawing from India’s policy, manufacturing, and market development experiences.

India and African countries should accelerate Global South cooperation to address challenges on both the demand and supply sides of EV deployment, including economic, material, and market barriers. To realize these opportunities, the countries should cooperatively focus on:

Strengthening supply chain resilience for EV manufacturing and critical minerals;

Integrating advanced technologies and harmonizing policy frameworks;

Developing an investment-friendly ecosystem to drive sector growth;

Enabling skill development and technology localization; and

Creating knowledge-sharing platforms to accelerate sectoral learning

There is significant common ground between India and Africa in the EV sector, with India at a pivotal stage of scaling clean transportation and several African countries entering global EV supply chains. Considering their similar ground experiences and growth trajectories, the partnerships can focus particularly on electric two-wheelers (E2W), electric three-wheelers (E3W), e-buses, and battery technologies. African countries can become reliable supply chain partners for Indian EV manufacturers, while India offers valuable expertise to support Africa’s evolving market, particularly in manufacturing and policy design.

About This Paper

This paper aims to outline a strategic framework for strengthening Global South collaboration to accelerate the e-mobility transition, with a particular focus on fostering partnership between India and Africa. It examines how collaboration between India and African countries can be deepened, drawing on a defined country selection framework (see Framework for Partner Country Selection), which has identified four African countries for focused engagement with India in this initial phase of collaboration. However, the framework is flexible and can be expanded in subsequent phases to include additional African countries.

Realizing Collaboration Opportunities in Electric Mobility

As part of development strategies, countries are increasingly recognizing the benefits of adopting low-emission technologies, including reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels, decreasing air pollution, and expanding local manufacturing ecosystems and jobs. E-mobility in particular plays a critical role in this transition due to its interlinkages with emissions reduction and economic development. Against this backdrop, India and several African countries are pursuing e-mobility, backed by clear policy intent and action plans. This section examines the present stage of the EV transition in India and Africa and identifies specific areas of collaboration to accelerate progress in the sector.

India’s E-mobility Transition

Transportation is one of India’s fastest-growing sectors, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.9 percent. India is the fourth-largest automobile manufacturer in the world, and the sector contributes 7.1 percent to India’s gross domestic product (GDP) and 49 percent to its manufacturing GDP. Alongside industrial output, job creation and global trade are cornerstones of this sector in India. However, the transportation sector is also the country’s second-largest CO2 emitter, with road transportation alone accounting for more than 90 percent of those emissions. India is at a crossroads, trying to balance pursuing its economic and development goals while also reducing its emissions intensity as outlined in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) targets. To reduce the transportation sector’s emissions, which are projected to double by 2050, India is making significant strides to electrify the sector and shift toward low-emissions technologies.

India is expected to add 80 million EVs on the road under the government’s EV target, which aims for 30 percent of new vehicle sales to be electric by 2030. To facilitate this transition, the Indian government, as well as 30 subnational governments, have introduced or are in the process of introducing demand-side and supply-side incentives aimed at promoting EV adoption, streamlining charging infrastructure, enhancing local manufacturing, and creating jobs.

In addition, fiscal incentives from the central government have evolved as described in Table 2. The most recent tranche comes from the 2024 launch of the PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM E-DRIVE) scheme, with an initial outlay of $1.3 billion to incentivize the purchase of various type of EVs, charging infrastructure, and automobile testing facilities. Through consistent policy support and financial incentives, the EV sector in India has registered exponential progress. Figure 2 shows the year-on-year increase in annual EV registrations (all categories) in India.

Changing Dynamics of India’s Automotive Sector

In tandem with the global transition, India’s automotive sector has shifted toward e-mobility, building on strong government backing and rapidly growing domestic innovation. Leading Indian original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as Tata Motors, Mahindra, Ashok Leyland, and TVS have rolled out mass-market EVs such as passenger cars, E2Ws, E3Ws, and e-buses. Additionally, startups such as Ather Energy, Ola Electric, and SUN Mobility have continuously evolved to create tailored solutions for India’s changing mobility patterns.

The central and state governments of India have long supported this focus on e-mobility through various policies and schemes. Launched in January 2013, the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020 (NEMMP-2020) laid the groundwork for key national programs such as the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid) and Electric Vehicles (FAME-I and FAME-II) schemes; Scheme to Promote Manufacturing of Electric Passenger Cars in India (SPMEPCI); Production Linked Incentives (PLI) for EVs, battery manufacturing, and critical minerals processing; and the PM E-DRIVE scheme. These central interventions have established a strong policy and financial framework, while much of the on-ground progress has been supported by proactive subnational policies. Many states have set up dedicated nodal agencies and designed region-specific incentives to address local priorities and accelerate EV adoption. States such as Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Gujarat are emerging as EV manufacturing hubs in India. At the same time, major investments are flowing into localized supply chains, including into battery gigafactories.

India’s EV Sector Challenges

While significant progress has been made in India’s EV transition, key challenges remain:

Insufficient charging infrastructure: As of April 2025, India had installed close to 26,000 public charging stations (PCSs). This translates to a ratio of only one PCS for every 235 EVs on the road. It is critically low when compared to the ratio of one charger for every 7 to 15 EVs in various European countries. Although schemes such as PM E-DRIVE and various subnational policies focus on the rapid installation of PCSs, momentum needs to be accelerated to alleviate range anxiety. Moreover, EVCI is unevenly distributed, further increasing range anxiety among potential EV consumers in both urban and rural areas. Focused, long-term planning is necessary to ensure that the charging needs of the emerging consumer base are addressed to offer easier access and convenience.

Supply chain vulnerability: The EV production ecosystem needs to address supply chain-related issues and vulnerabilities. Specifically, the sector heavily relies on imports for battery components, among other critical parts, and is constantly affected by global supply chain disruptions. While a robust local manufacturing ecosystem is required, India should explore strengthening supply chains through sourcing raw materials from reliable partners. Additionally, India has the opportunity to electrify the largest diesel-consuming segments of the economy: trucking and agriculture. To do so, India must continue to build international strategic partnerships, emphasize domestic reliance to build robust supply chains, and enable innovation to reduce costs and enhance overall trust in the sector.

Lack of technology standardization: EVCI, battery chemistries, and technology are still evolving. Charging connectors need to be standardized to enable interoperability and to ensure that the limited number of PCSs available can be utilized more efficiently.

Workforce limitations: The limited availability of a skilled workforce is another challenge that needs to be addressed. Mechanisms to train and upskill the workforce currently associated with the traditional automotive industry, as well as building a new workforce, need to match the pace of the expanding EV ecosystem.

Africa’s Evolving E-mobility Landscape

As a whole, Africa is experiencing rapid motorization, driven largely by the import of used internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. While Africa’s EV market is nascent, countries across the continent are prioritizing the manufacturing and adoption of EVs, depending on existing infrastructure and resource availability. For instance, South Africa’s Comprehensive EV Roadmap focuses on manufacturing and localization of the value chain, leveraging the country’s existing automotive manufacturing value chain. Kenya, meanwhile, has drafted a National E-Mobility Policy that centers on domestic manufacturing and job creation. Nigeria’s energy transition plan aims to achieve 100 percent EV adoption by 2060, while Mauritius has developed a 10-year roadmap aiming to create favorable market conditions for EV adoption by 2030. In 2024, Ethiopia became the first country in the world to ban the import of ICE vehicles, paving the way for the electrification of transportation. The development of the EV sector in Africa, similar to India, remains intertwined with the economic objectives of job creation and infrastructure development.

Figure 3 illustrates the various levels of EV adoption readiness in Africa based on each country’s EV polices, incentives, grid reliability, and EVCI.

Africa’s Automotive Manufacturing Evolution

Africa’s automotive manufacturing sector has a long history, with many of the largest auto manufacturers—e.g., Toyota, Stellantis, and Renault—establishing major operations in Morocco and South Africa, though the majority of vehicles produced there are destined for the European Union. Indian manufacturers have also maintained a long-standing presence in Africa, including Tata Motors, Mahindra and Mahindra, and TVS Motor Company. A number of domestic OEMs in Africa have also emerged, including Kiira Motors in Uganda and Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing (IVM) in Nigeria, both focusing on domestic innovation and projects tailored to the local contexts.

Over the last decade, Africa’s automobile sector has shifted its focus toward the EV manufacturing ecosystem, leveraging investments from leading global automobile manufacturers in cooperation with many African governments. Multiple countries have introduced policies and incentives favorable to domestic EV manufacturing and have even pooled substantial resources to build an international EV ecosystem, including $54 million from South Africa and close to $100 million in public-private financing from Uganda. So far, 21 African countries have set up or are in the process of setting up EV manufacturing plants.

However, significant gaps persist in the local infrastructure needed to support the adoption of EVs across Africa. To address these challenges, many domestic startups are building solutions tailored to the African market, such as battery swapping and subscription-to-own models. The aim is to overcome barriers related to upfront investment costs, electricity reliability, and post-sale service. Moreover, some companies are locally designing and assembling E2Ws and E3Ws or retrofitting ICE 2Ws to better suit Africa’s road conditions and to reduce costs.

Bottlenecks to the EV Transition in Africa

There are several obstacles to Africa’s EV transition:

Prevalence of used ICE vehicles and the high cost of EVs: Used ICE vehicles dominate the four-wheeler (4W) passenger car market in Africa, constituting 85 percent of all sales. Without strong incentives, EVs struggle to achieve price competitiveness, discouraging growth and investment in EV manufacturing for domestic consumption. Deliberate policy design, such as Ethiopia’s ban on the import of ICE vehicles, can potentially shift market trends and address this concern.

Financing and capital constraints: Setting up and developing EV manufacturing and supply chains requires significant upfront investments, but rising financing costs are slowing the sector’s growth. The region faces a financial deficit in the range of $20–$25 billion per year to meet its industrialization and manufacturing goals, nearly half of the $50 billion the continent’s manufacturing sector requires annually, according to the African Development Bank. With potentially $9 billion in financing required by 2030 to advance a sustainable E2W market alone across Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, Rwanda, and Ethiopia, local investors and financing institutions remain hesitant to support the sector due to early-stage risk aversion.

Insufficient electricity generation and grid reliability: Electricity demand consistently outpaces generation in Africa, with an estimated 43 percent of the population (over 600 million people) lacking access to reliable electricity as of 2022. Countries such as Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Nigeria struggle with inadequate power supplies despite massive investments in increasing electricity generation. This poses major obstacles to scaling up manufacturing and EV charging infrastructure. Additionally, African utilities consistently score poorly on grid efficiency and reliability, with high system inefficiencies and losses. As countries advance their EV goals, it is crucial that electricity infrastructure development and investment be prioritized to enhance electricity generation and grid reliability.

Lack of domestic manufacturing capacity and skilled workforce: Most countries in Africa lack both the infrastructure necessary to support local manufacturing and the skilled workforce required to run it. This poses significant barriers to scaling up EV manufacturing. While skilling remains a common challenge in India and Africa, international partnerships focusing on capacity building can help address this concern and provide a platform for more strategic dialogue among the countries.

The E-mobility Policy Landscapes in India and Africa

India’s EV policy landscape has advanced considerably over the past decade, shaped by a combination of national and subnational initiatives aimed at building a robust and self-sustaining e-mobility ecosystem. Africa’s EV policy landscape is still at an early stage, with efforts varying widely across countries depending on market readiness, infrastructure capacity, and national priorities. While a few African countries have introduced dedicated e-mobility policies or incentives, many others are integrating EV measures within broader transportation or energy strategies. Although the continent’s EV adoption remains nascent, growing commitment and urbanization trends provide a strong foundation for scaling the transition in the coming years.

This paper selected the top 10 countries in Africa based on largest GDP for the purpose of initial assessment: South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, Morocco, Ethiopia, Algeria, Tanzania, Angola, and Côte d’Ivoire. While South Africa and Nigeria have launched national plans, the others have more general frameworks focused on EV transition and emissions reduction.

Table 2 provides a broad overview of the national-level EV policies and frameworks from these countries, along with those in India, for seven broad categories. See appendix (Table 5) for more details on the different policies of the selected 10 African countries.

Realizing Opportunities to Advance the E-mobility Transition Through Collaboration

Historically, the automobile sector has been a key area of cooperation between India and Africa. Anchored in shared knowledge exchange, market development, and resource security, India and Africa have the opportunity to create a mutually beneficial framework for e-mobility. With different resources and stages of development, the two regions will need to play distinct roles through this cooperation.

India can perform several key actions to support Africa’s e-mobility goals:

Share policy and regulatory expertise. India has specific policy lessons to share through its established fuel consumption standards, such as the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) norms, which ensure that manufacturers transition toward producing a more fuel-efficient fleet. With India’s example, African countries can address the challenge posed by the prevalence of ICE vehicles on the continent. Indian policymakers and industry can work with African partners to develop regulations for used vehicle imports, design incentives for EV adoption, and share lessons on achieving price parity through local innovation and economies of scale.

Support the development of financing models. Efforts to build local capacity and infrastructure are currently being driven by private international firms through blended finance mechanisms in Africa. India’s experience with tailored financing and risk-sharing tools can be leveraged to identify key opportunities to spur investments in domestic markets.

Draw lessons from the electricity sector. While electricity reliability and access are complex and multifaceted issues, there are myriad potential solutions specific to EV manufacturing in Africa. Solutions may comprise low-cost financing and subsidies for renewable energy for EV manufacturers or financing for battery-swapping pilot programs, both to scale charging infrastructure and to improve grid reliability. India’s experiences in the integration of distributed renewable energy and mini-grid solutions, as well as in piloting battery swapping and behind-the-meter storage, are extremely relevant to address these challenges, especially in developing scaled battery innovations and grid management solutions suited to local contexts in African nations.

Build skilling models. To upskill and reskill its workforce, India has established several skilling models through initiatives such as Skill India and a range of public-private partnerships. As the India-Africa partnerships on the manufacturing ecosystem evolve, knowledge exchange and skilling programs can be designed with both economic and manufacturing needs in mind to build local capacity.

Governments in Africa can likewise undertake several actions to facilitate e-mobility collaboration with India:

Enable diversified and value-added supply chains. India needs to strengthen its supply chains to establish and securely maintain a flourishing domestic EV manufacturing ecosystem. Africa is home to vast reserves of lithium, cobalt, manganese, and nickel, all essential components of EV batteries. Beyond importing raw materials from Africa, Indian firms can play a proactive role in mineral and economic development by investing in sustainable mining, supporting local processing and refining capacities, and establishing joint ventures that can create stronger supply chains for both regions. This approach can help generate greater value domestically, build resilient regional supply chains, and produce benefits for both the African minerals sector and India’s EV industry.

Collaborate on battery recycling and circular economy models. India and many countries in Africa, including South Africa and Kenya, are considering the secondary use of batteries and establishing battery recycling ecosystems. These efforts present an incredible opportunity to collaborate on building circular economy frameworks that can meet battery demand for small-form factors (e.g., E2Ws and E3Ws) while also addressing electricity storage issues for many countries with abundant renewable energy potential.

Create innovation and opportunities to scale up. India’s automobile companies are already well-established in many African countries. The emerging EV market in Africa presents new opportunities to expand the existing consumer base or to enter local partnerships, particularly for players who already have a nuanced understanding of regional automobile markets. For India’s automobile sector, Africa’s emerging market not only provides scale but also will lead to lower costs and facilitate innovative production suitable for diverse conditions, benefiting consumers in both regions. At the same time, OEMs can invest in building local value chains, launch joint skilling initiatives, and create local employment opportunities.

Create partnerships for the ecosystem. By presenting a united Global South region at international forums, India and African countries can drive more equitable trade terms for critical minerals, promote open technology transfer, and push for increased funding and research. This collaborative approach can foster a more inclusive global EV future.

India and Africa are both at pivotal junctures in their e-mobility transitions—Africa with its strong policy intent to leapfrog ICE vehicles, and India with its goal to significantly scale up EV adoption. Considering evolving global trends, there are numerous opportunities to strengthen Global South coordination on e-mobility, including facilitating the exchange of ideas, expanding supply chains, and accelerating EV deployment across the region.

Framework for Partner Country Selection

India’s engagement with Africa on e-mobility marks a strategic opportunity for both regions to advance their economic and sustainability goals. This section outlines the framework adopted for selecting initial focus countries, providing a backdrop for collaboration between India and Africa. Subsequently, this framework can be expanded to include more countries and deepen cooperation across the Global South.

Country Selection Framework

The research team developed a comprehensive selection framework involving seven parameters to identify potential partner countries in Africa with which India can collaborate. While this framework offers an objective basis for the current assessment, it is important to note that the results may evolve as the parameters and underlying factors change. Under the initial phase, four African countries were identified, but the framework can be scaled and expanded to more countries in subsequent phases as the India-Africa partnership deepens.

The first step was to short-list countries based on GDP—a proxy for market size, consumer base, and infrastructure capacity—which can drive demand for EVs and related industries. The 10 countries short-listed for further assessment based on their GDP were South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, Morocco, Algeria, Tanzania, Angola, Ethiopia, and Côte d'Ivoire.

Each short-listed country was then evaluated for its EV readiness and its potential for partnership with India. The evaluation used seven quantifiable parameters, with data sourced from reputable international and government institutions to ensure objectivity and comparability.

Profiles for Short-Listed Countries

Based on the comprehensive selection framework, the top four countries short-listed for this phase of strengthening collaboration are South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, and Kenya. An overview of the current landscape of each country is provided below.

South Africa

South Africa is the largest automotive manufacturing hub in sub-Saharan Africa for global OEMs like Toyota, Ford, and Volkswagen. Indian OEM Mahindra and Mahindra has been operating in South Africa for over three decades and signed an MOU in 2025 to explore auto manufacturing operations in the country. While no EVs are currently manufactured domestically, South Africa’s 2023 Electric Vehicle White Paper, from the country’s Department of Trade, Industry, and Competition (DTIC), focused on developing the EV industry.

E-mobility landscape: EVs have faced economic penalties in South Africa, facing a 25 percent import tariff, compared to 18 percent on ICE vehicles, making EVs less cost-competitive. However, the 2025 budget from the South Africa’s National Treasury introduced a $54 million incentive program to build domestic EV manufacturing. South Africa also plans to introduce a 150 percent tax incentive for electric and hydrogen vehicle production in March 2026. South African EV sales are growing rapidly, experiencing 80 percent growth in first-quarter sales in 2024 compared to 2023.

Climate goals and EV targets: South Africa’s climate goals, outlined in its 2021 NDC, highlight that greening transportation is a key component of its broader climate action framework. As part of the Paris Agreement, South Africa has a relatively modest non-binding commitment to achieve 20 percent hybrid or EV penetration by 2030.

The 2021 Auto Sector Green Paper on New Electric Vehicles, from South Africa’s DTIC, ties the country’s economic goals to climate imperatives in the domestic automotive industry. The paper prioritizes EVs to maintain access to key export markets and aims to boost EV adoption through a global framework such as the Electric Vehicle Initiative. The country has conditionally signed COP26’s zero emissions by 2040 vehicle declaration.

Key stakeholders: Collaboration and alignment among the key stakeholders in the South African automotive market is essential to drive the EV transition, with the government providing the policy framework and direction and the private sector bringing investment and technology.

The DTIC develops central auto industry policy and new legislation on EVs, while the National Treasury oversees the funds for EV incentives and tax measures. South Africa’s automotive industry, represented predominantly by the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA), advocates for reduced import duties and transparent policies to encourage EV adoption (see Table 7 in the appendix for a detailed stakeholder map).

Egypt

The most populous country in North Africa, Egypt has massive potential for EV growth and adoption. The Egyptian government has begun cultivating its EV industry through a mix of import policy, supply- and demand-side subsidies, and partnerships with foreign companies. Egypt has over 7,213 registered EVs as of 2024.

E-mobility landscape: Egypt offers several fiscal incentives related to e-mobility, including special import duty rates for EVs, charging stations, and components. The country has also introduced special electricity tariffs to reduce operational costs for EVs, although this rate has increased for public charging. Furthermore, Egypt has pushed for investments in startups, domestic manufacturing, and EV infrastructure. As a result, as of late 2024, the country was home to 19 automotive manufacturing plants, as well as the Suez Canal Economic Zone, an area to provide essential support to the industry. The country aims to produce 25,000 vehicles per year through an memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the state-owned El Nasr Automotive and Dongfeng Motor Group. In addition, the country entered a joint manufacturing scheme with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Jordan, and Bahrain, to build assembly lines in Egypt for the UAE’s M Glory Holding automotive manufacturer.

Climate goals and EVs: In 2022, Egypt released its National Climate Change Strategy 2050 and revised its NDC the following year. While its transportation focus is shifting from private passenger and freight vehicles to mass transit, the country is still making efforts to encourage the domestic manufacturing of EVs. Though Egypt does not have a set EV target, electrifying transportation aligns with its broader climate and emissions reduction strategies. Its NDC pledge is to reduce emissions in the transportation sector by 7 percent by 2030.

Key stakeholders: Egypt’s EV environment is governed by its line ministries, including the Ministry of Public Business Sector and the Ministry of Trade and Industry, through import policies—most notably the used car and EV import rules—and other industrial incentives (see Table 7 in the appendix for a detailed stakeholder map).

Nigeria

Nigeria is a major oil producer and is heavily reliant on the import of used ICE vehicles. The country is committed to transitioning to cleaner vehicles, emphasized by its 2023 removal of historic fuel subsidies and its commitment to achieve net carbon neutrality by 2060.

E-mobility landscape: Since the successful repeal of historic fuel subsidies in 2023—which had been announced but not implemented in 2020, and only temporarily implemented in 2016—the Nigerian government has released several related reforms and incentives. The government eliminated all import tariffs on EVs in early 2024, compared to the 35 percent tariff on other vehicles, to increase the cost competitiveness of EVs. Nigeria’s Action Plan for Development of Electric Vehicles, issued in May 2023, delineates a strategy to facilitate domestic manufacturing of EVs, including several incentives for localized EV assembly, aiming for 30 percent of all EVs to be locally produced by 2033. The plan also outlines the country’s asset financing scheme to provide capital funding for Nigerian automotive and auto-component manufacturers.

Local and foreign entities are working together to invest in expanding Nigeria’s EV ecosystem. Nigerian Oando Clean Energy Limited, for example, is collaborating with the Chinese bus builder Yutong to deploy 12,000 electric buses by 2030, along with the associated charging infrastructure.

Climate goals and EVs: Nigeria’s long-term strategy is prioritizing clean transportation, and it has woven EV adoption into its climate commitments. Nigeria aims for 100 percent EV penetration by 2060. Critical to Nigeria’s climate strategy is transitioning to clean fuels and weaning off oil. Nigeria’s NDC targets aim for EVs to account for 60 percent of the total vehicle stock by 2050, and 100 percent by 2060.

Key stakeholders: At the national level, the National Automotive Design and Development Council (NADDC), under Nigeria’s Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Investment (FMITI), is the nodal agency for EVs. While the NADDC developed Nigeria’s automotive development plan, FMITI deploys incentives and subsidies for local EV manufacturing and adoption. At the subnational level, the Lagosian government is leading the charge for municipal electric transit, positioning itself as the testbed for EV projects in Nigeria.

Domestic auto manufacturers also play a critical role. Companies like IVM and Jet Motor Company are among the largest indigenous African EV companies. Historically, these companies have also played an important role in the EV sector. For instance, in 2020, Jet Motor Company set out to become the country’s first domestic auto manufacturer to produce a 100 percent indigenous EV, raising $9 million in research capital from a number of international investors (see Table 7 in the appendix for a detailed stakeholder map).

Kenya

Kenya leads renewable energy generation in Africa, with over 90 percent coming from geothermal, hydropower, wind, and solar power. Kenya’s transportation sector is shifting quickly from ICE vehicles to EVs. While the EV market is new, it is rising, with over 4,193 EV units registered as of December 2024, a five-fold growth in EV registrations since 2022. While this is a small percentage of Kenya’s fleet of 2 million vehicles, it represents significant growth in EV uptake.

E-mobility landscape: There is national buy-in to support the EV transition through Kenya’s Draft National Green Fiscal Incentives Policy Framework and Draft National Electric Mobility Plan, announced in 2022 and 2024, respectively. The government has also implemented several policies and subsidies to accelerate EV adoption, including zero VAT ratings for electric bicycles, motorcycles, buses, and lithium-ion batteries, as well as import duty exemptions for some electric motorcycles.

Through specific electricity tariffs and subsidies, the estimated operating cost for operating EVs is up to eight times lower than that of ICE passenger vehicles, as well as for commercial and fleet ICE vehicles. The Kenyan government and startups are actively investing in charging infrastructure, with the government planning to install 1,000 EV charging stations by 2027. However, investments in the sector still lag. In addition to public sector and development financing, the sector needs active private sector investments to support innovation and manufacturing. Without these investments, emissions are expected to be between 4 and 31 times larger by 2050, compared to the 2010 baseline.

Climate goals and EVs: Kenya’s EV transition is part of its NDC to reduce carbon emissions by one-third by 2030. While energy demand in the country is growing, carbon-based energy sources have been diminishing, with 90 percent of all energy being sourced from renewable energy as of 2022. During COP26, Kenya signed the zero-emission vehicle declaration and joined the Accelerating to Zero Coalition, supporting the group’s multinational goal of ensuring all new cars are zero emission in leading markets by 2035, and globally by 2040.

Key stakeholders: The Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Energy jointly spearhead the Draft National Electric Mobility Plan, and the Ministry of Finance looks after deploying incentives and tax benefits for EV adoption. State utilities, namely Kenya Power, KenGen, and the Kenyan Power & Lighting Company, are prioritizing EVs in their investments to build EV charging stations and introduce new business models to increase EV adoption.

The United Nations Environment Programme, headquartered in Nairobi, is also a key player, supporting E2W/E3W pilots and rollout plans (see Table 7 in the appendix for a detailed stakeholder map).

Collaboration Potential Between India and Africa

While South Africa and India already have robust, well-connected auto manufacturing sectors, both countries can deepen their EV transition and manufacturing goals through decisive government support, knowledge sharing, and private sector collaboration. Partnership between Egypt and India can be strengthened through bilateral and multilateral platforms focused on EV manufacturing. Similarly, India-Nigeria relations, particularly on EVs, show significant potential for cooperation on targeted policy and manufacturing interventions. Kenya and India also have immense potential to accelerate EV manufacturing and the e-mobility transition, leveraging their respective renewable energy capacities.

The EMBRACE Platform: Electric Mobility Bridge for Regional Africa-India Cooperation and Exchange

India’s engagement with Africa on e-mobility presents a strategic opportunity to advance shared economic and sustainability goals. As countries transition to e-mobility, there is a clear need to create dedicated platforms that facilitate knowledge sharing, policy alignment, and coordinated action across borders. Such mechanisms foster trust, translate dialogue into actionable strategies, and strengthen collaboration across the Global South.

Envisioned as the Electric Mobility Bridge for Regional Africa-India Cooperation and Exchange (EMBRACE) Platform, this strategy brings together policymakers, industry leaders, financiers, and technical experts to accelerate the e-mobility transition. By enabling structured discussions on infrastructure, policy, and trade, the EMBRACE Platform supports informed policymaking, develops resilient and inclusive supply chains, and ensures partner countries benefit from both climate and development gains.

Architecture and Areas of Collaboration

At its core, EMBRACE aims to facilitate dialogue between policymakers and stakeholders, focusing particularly on supply chain resilience, innovation, and investment in EVs, batteries, and critical minerals. The initiative also emphasizes sustainable economic growth while promoting circular, low-emission transportation solutions aligned with long-term climate goals.",https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2025-09/GettyImages-145214856_cropped.jpg?VersionId=v.K8VPibM9ni_cPpX9x5sjbs5hRkGnCu,N,,2025-09-20 07:59:02.415062

,Indiana American Energy ,2025-09-19 19:44:44+00:00,The Black Chronicle,Large Wisconsin data center tax breaks make benefits unclear - The Black Chronicle,Black Chronicle News Service,,,,,https://blackchronicle.com/energy/large-wisconsin-data-center-tax-breaks-make-benefits-unclear/,"(The Center Square) – When Microsoft announced plans for an additional $4 billion data center in Kenosha County on Thursday morning, it came with comments from Wisconsin Gov.
That means that much of the $4 billion Microsoft will spend on the facility will go untaxed along with the major costs of operating the data center once it is fully operational.
Minnesota, for instance, reinstated its sales tax on electricity at data centers in June while sales tax on equipment at the data centers was extended for up to 35 years.
The two Wisconsin data centers that have disclosed their electrical needs, Microsoft’s first data center in Mount Pleasant and the Vantage data center in Port Washington, will require a combined 3.9 gigawatts of power, enough to power 4.3 million Wisconsin homes, according to data from Clean Wisconsin.
Having a data center in a TID means that the company isn’t paying new property tax into the local community to fund things like roads, police, fire and schools.","(The Center Square) – When Microsoft announced plans for an additional $4 billion data center in Kenosha County on Thursday morning, it came with comments from Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers and Milwaukee County Executive and governor candidate David Crowley about the benefits.

But many of the usually benefits of a business entering the state – property taxes, sales tax and employment – have already been conceded by the state while questions remain about the impact of energy and water use at the facilities.

It’s why groups like Good Jobs First examine the deals surrounding data centers and provide the public with information about the deals and tax breaks, showing how these deals differ from what other businesses in Wisconsin receive.

“There are probably not a lot of benefits,” Good Jobs First Senior Research Analyst Kasia Tarczynska said. “On the tax side, if there’s any benefit it’s really difficult to know because there is so little transparency on the subsidies for these projects.”

There are six large-scale data center projects in progress in the state after Microsoft’s announcement and the state began the tax incentives for the projects in its last budget, exempting any sales tax on electricity or construction materials at any qualified data center including the water cooling systems and computing equipment. That means that much of the $4 billion Microsoft will spend on the facility will go untaxed along with the major costs of operating the data center once it is fully operational.

Tarczynska points to the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. website, where there isn’t information on the value of those tax incentives available. Many states estimated up front the value of waving taxes on electricity but have found that the actual amount of electricity used has far surpassed any expectations as more projects have appeared and the energy required by the data centers has multiplied.

Minnesota, for instance, reinstated its sales tax on electricity at data centers in June while sales tax on equipment at the data centers was extended for up to 35 years.

“A lot of tax revenue is not materializing because things are thrown back to the company,” Tarczynska said. “And, on top of that, the problem is that data centers don’t create a lot of jobs. They create very few jobs and a lot of those jobs go to residents who live outside of a community.”

Construction jobs are needed when the facility is being built but, afterward, there are a few high-level analyst and electrician jobs but also lower pay security, maintenance and technician jobs.

The two Wisconsin data centers that have disclosed their electrical needs, Microsoft’s first data center in Mount Pleasant and the Vantage data center in Port Washington, will require a combined 3.9 gigawatts of power, enough to power 4.3 million Wisconsin homes, according to data from Clean Wisconsin. Wisconsin has only 2.8 million housing units.

“Because only two of the data center projects have disclosed their power needs, we know this is really just a fraction of what the energy use would be if all those data centers are ultimately built,” Clean Wisconsin Science Program Director Paul Mathewson wrote in the analysis.

That untaxed electricity usage is a concern with energy availability and consumer electricity prices an increased concern in coming years.

Data centers are expected to lead to the average American’s energy bill increasing from 25% to 70% in the next 10 years without intervention from policymakers, according to Washington, D.C.-based think tank the Jack Kemp Foundation.

https://www.thecentersquare.com/virginia/article_368b645e-a86e-11ef-8825-772ecfdea4b2.html

The first Microsoft data center on the former Foxconn site in Mount Pleasant is in a tax increment district, meaning the additional property taxes that would have been collected by local government from the project will instead be kept in the district for Microsoft’s use.

Wisconsin state lawmakers have approved exceptions for two large data centers in Port Washington and Beaver Dam to the state’s 12% rule related to tax increment financing districts capping the amount of property in a municipality that can be in a tax increment district.

Having a data center in a TID means that the company isn’t paying new property tax into the local community to fund things like roads, police, fire and schools.

“It’s like getting a free mortgage or free house construction,” Tarczynska said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/e2/5e2dc869-f7f9-4456-8176-a4774f9b60ac/68a62ebb2aa8d.image.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 17:02:37.238007

“These are the strongest energy affordability solutions Californians have seen in years,” said Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas. “Bigger refunds on electricity bills, more reliable gas supplies, improved wildfire protections for homeowners, and a smarter power grid that will save families billions. We’re keeping health and environmental protections in place while building a cleaner, more resilient energy future.”

“No matter how much Trump lies, he can’t escape the truth: Earth’s atmosphere, upon which all living creatures depend, is heating up — and dangerously,” said former California Governor Jerry Brown. “Today, California boldly confronts this reality and extends our world-leading cap-and-invest program.

Historic reforms will save Californians billions and cut dangerous pollution

Here’s how the package will impact Californians:

💵 Saving Californians billions of dollars and making energy more affordable.

Together, these policies will save Californians billions of dollars on energy costs and bring down customer electric bills.

The legislation provides the biggest boost to the California Climate Credit ever – which already saves millions of California families more than $100 every year on their utility bills.

Accelerates critical clean energy projects by making them easier and cheaper to build while also further integrating the use of clean energy throughout the broader West – creating more energy supply, improving grid reliability and driving down costs.

By stabilizing the state’s gasoline market, Californians will continue avoiding billions of dollars in price spikes at the pump.

⛽️ Stabilizing California’s gasoline supply to prevent price spikes.

Provides a path for a targeted, locally-led, environmentally responsible and safe increase in oil production in Kern County to boost overall fuel supplies in the state.

Protects the state’s ongoing transition away from fossil fuels by maintaining a more affordable, reliable and safe supply of fuels that is often subject to increasing volatility.

Continues the state’s commitment of ensuring the safety of existing oil pipelines and related facilities both onshore and offshore.

Encourages the state’s oil refiners to continue safe operations and further stabilize the market.

🌎 Cutting pollution and creating jobs.

Extending Cap-and-Invest, formerly known as Cap-and-Trade, to 2045 continues California’s world-leading efforts to cut climate pollution and transition to the clean economy of the future.

Holds private electric utilities accountable by requiring billions in investments to modernize and harden the grid at the expense of shareholders, only.

Earlier this week, the Governor approved the first allocation of $3.3 billion from Proposition 4, which was overwhelmingly passed by voters last year. The funding is going to firefighting and wildfire prevention, clean water and agriculture projects.

California’s climate leadership

Pollution is down and the economy is up. Greenhouse gas emissions in California are down 20% since 2000 – even as the state’s GDP increased 78% in that same time period.

The state also continues to set clean energy records. California was powered by two-thirds clean energy in 2023, the latest year for which data is available – the largest economy in the world to achieve this level of clean energy. The state has run on 100% clean electricity for some part of the day almost every day this year.

Since the beginning of the Newsom Administration, battery storage is up to over 15,000 megawatts – a 1,900%+ increase, and over 25,000 megawatts of new resources have been added to the electric grid.

The Governor signed the following bills:

Recently, it also proposed to rescind a 2009 declaration that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health.
This would make it harder for citizens to keep track of how much local refineries are releasing greenhouse gases, which are the biggest drivers of climate change.
That’s absolutely critical when it comes to health,” said Lorene Allio, a member of the environmental justice group Fresh Air Vallejo.
The California Air Resources Board has a pollution mapping tool that residents can use to continue to track pollution.","VALLEJO – Last Friday, the Trump Administration announced that the Environmental Protection Agency was looking to permanently end a nationwide program that required refineries to report greenhouse gases emissions.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the program as harmful and expensive, and claimed that cutting it would save businesses billions in regulatory compliance. This is the latest in a series of environmental rollbacks from the administration. Recently, it also proposed to rescind a 2009 declaration that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health.

“It's a big step backward,” said Bill Magavern, the policy director of the Coalition for Clean Air, a nonprofit focused on air quality and climate change in California. “Reporting should be the bare minimum of what we're doing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and that was agreed on a generation ago.”

The program was first established in 2009 and has long had bipartisan support. If the plan is finalized, more than 8,000 facilities across the country will no longer have any federal requirements to report how much they’re polluting. This would make it harder for citizens to keep track of how much local refineries are releasing greenhouse gases, which are the biggest drivers of climate change.

“If you don't have the data to say it's happening, how are you going to prove that it's happening? That’s absolutely critical when it comes to health,” said Lorene Allio, a member of the environmental justice group Fresh Air Vallejo. “Communities around the country won't necessarily be able to show how they're harmed, even if they are showing up at the hospital.”

Greenhouse gases are a major contributor to higher rates of asthma. Solano County has the highest rate of asthma emergency room visits in the Bay Area and the third highest in the state, according to the California Department of Public Health.

Currently, the EPA’s emission data is still on its website. The data shows that in 2023 in California, the Los Angeles Refinery was the biggest polluter in the state, emitting over 6 million metric tons of greenhouse gases. But in second place was the Chevron refinery in Richmond, emitting 4.3 million metric tons. In fourth and fifth places were Benicia’s Valero refinery and the Martinez refinery, emitting 2.9 and 2.3 metric tons, respectively.

There are a total of 21 sites — including refineries, power plants, and landfills — in Solano County and Contra Costa that reported their greenhouse gas emissions to the EPA in 2023.

A 2023 study found that having a reporting program in place prompted facilities across the country to reduce their emissions by over 7%.

But even though this program may be ending at the federal level, Magavern said that California is better positioned to weather this change compared to other states. The California Air Resources Board has a pollution mapping tool that residents can use to continue to track pollution. And it has “a full fledged climate program,” said Magavern. “It does require the large emitters of greenhouse gases to report, and more importantly, to reduce their emissions.”

This program is called cap-and-invest (formerly known as cap-and-trade) and Gov. Gavin Newsom extended it until 2045 on Friday.

In the Vallejo area, there are also local organizations like the Benicia Air Monitoring Group, which has set up their own monitors to keep track of the emissions around the Benicia Valero refinery.

“It’s a continuous monitoring system. The monitors run 24/7, and it's on the website immediately,” said Kathy Kerridge, a board member with the Benicia Air Monitoring Group. “It's publicly available information.”

Meanwhile in Vallejo, Allio said that announcements like these have only motivated their organization to take more action and push for more environmental justice policies at a state and local level.

“Data is part of democracy,” said Allio. “When you take away people's right to have information, to talk about information, to share information, it's a big problem.”",https://www.vallejosun.com/content/images/size/w1200/2025/09/Valero-benicia-refinery-stack-fire-05-05-2025.jpeg,N,,2025-09-19 17:01:55.463669

Gavin Newsom now admits that “We are all the beneficiaries of oil and gas,” under severe pressure to avert a full-blown energy crisis.
At the tail end of the legislative session on Sept. 10, legislators and the governor reached an agreement to increase in-state crude oil production.
That’s more pollution, less transparency, less leverage for the U.S. — and yes, higher prices at the pump.","Time matters, and California is running out of it. Lawmakers in Sacramento must act to address the state’s fuel and affordability crises.

Since 2001, California gas prices have increased 162%. Today, we pay about 43% more than the national average, and that figure would likely be far higher if not for record-high domestic oil production.

That tailwind unfortunately won’t last. While crude oil prices have fallen 19% since January, California costs and taxes have increased, now accounting for approximately 26% of the retail price of gasoline. And with the highest state excise tax per gallon in the nation, California makes several times more than a typical retailer for the same gallon of gas sold.

Platitudes and rhetoric aside, the truth is California is staring at a near-term gasoline shortfall, driven largely by the pending closure of two refineries, the highest operating costs in the nation and decades of falling in-state production. What these fuel supply challenges have not resulted in is a gigantic drop in demand. This has and will continue to lead to a greater dependence on foreign fuel, greater emissions, increased exposure to global volatility, and ultimately an increase in the price Californians pay for the fuel that powers the world’s fourth-largest economy.

We face a choice: On one side, the status quo assumes California’s economy can run without petroleum any time soon. On the other is a growing recognition that affordable energy is essential to economic stability and national security.

After spending years demonizing the oil and gas industry and accusing California’s refiners of ripping off consumers, Gov. Gavin Newsom now admits that “We are all the beneficiaries of oil and gas,” under severe pressure to avert a full-blown energy crisis. At the tail end of the legislative session on Sept. 10, legislators and the governor reached an agreement to increase in-state crude oil production.

If we care about our climate goals, we must also care about where our gasoline comes from. In 1982, California imported around 6% of its oil needs from foreign sources; today, the Golden State imports around 64% from various petrostates. Shipping finished fuel thousands of miles can mean crude sourced from regimes with higher emissions and weaker oversight than California.

That’s more pollution, less transparency, less leverage for the U.S. — and yes, higher prices at the pump.

None of this is necessary, and most of this is self-created. California has one of the most underused oil reserves in the nation and some of the most advanced technologies, best-trained workforces and safest producers in the world. The Newsom administration’s recent moves to ease the bureaucratic red tape and permitting challenges that have forced us to import two-thirds of all our crude quietly admits as much.

We should use the resources we have today while we continue to build the clean energy system of tomorrow.

We also need to dial back the regulatory cost stack. On July 1, the state raised the gas excise tax and updated the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, the state’s greenhouse gas reduction program. Layer on infrastructure costs, amortization, new storage mandates, refinery retrofits for changing crude blends and the lagging effects of the LCFS credit. If we care about affordability, let’s price it honestly and show the math.

Finally, equity must be both fiscally and morally sound. California’s gas tax — roughly 61 cents per gallon — pays for the roads we all use. Meanwhile, electric vehicle drivers don’t pay the tax but still use the same infrastructure. As EV adoption grows, the revenue gap widens. In a state that prides itself on equity, a fair solution is to stop subsidizing EV owners on the shoulders of other drivers and adopt a more equitable mileage-based road fee for EVs that accounts for miles driven and vehicle weight, which better reflects road wear.

Newsom’s long-overdue acknowledgement of a pending gasoline and price crisis — together with the Legislature’s last-minute actions — are a start but also a piecemeal approach to addressing a critical problem.

As a next step, the Legislature should consider the repeal of regulations limiting production and pipeline use in more counties, assess the powers of agency bureaucrats who force higher prices on the backs of Californians, and a new regulatory strategy that will provide a more hospitable business environment for refiners and producers.

That ultimately means greater fuel and price security for California consumers.

Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), ranking member on the House energy and commerce committee.","Through mostly partisan votes, lawmakers in the House of Representatives advanced legislation Sept. 18 that proponents say will accelerate some energy-related projects, but some Democrats warn will raise energy prices.

The Promoting Cross-border Energy Infrastructure Act has a goal to make the process to authorize construction of international border-crossing facilities for import and export of oil and natural gas, and the transmission of electricity, “more uniform, transparent and modern.”

It would require anyone planning to build such a facility to obtain a certificate of crossing from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the U.S. Dept. of Energy for electric transmission facilities. The agencies would have 120 days to issue a certificate or deny an application if not in the public interest, or just 30 days for natural gas facilities on the Mexican or Canadian borders.

The bill includes an exemption for any projects with a presidential permit.

Rep. Julie Fedorchak (R-N.D.), who sponsored the bill, said in a statement that it would address regulatory uncertainty that has grown under the current process, which involves a mix of permits, different agencies’ procedures and executive discretion. She pointed to then-President Joe Biden’s decision to revoke the Keystone XL pipeline permit on the first day of his term in 2021.

“By passing my legislation, the House has taken a critical step to end years of regulatory uncertainty and partisan games that have delayed energy infrastructure projects, crushed good-paying jobs and undermined America’s energy security,” Fedorchak said.

Power sector groups have supported the legislation. Marco Giamberardino, senior vice president of public and government affairs at the National Electrical Contractors Association, said in a statement that the bill “enables more timely project delivery and ensures stable workloads for NECA contractors nationwide.”

Another bill, the Guaranteeing Reliability through the Interconnection of Dispatchable Power Act, or GRID Power Act, would assist power plant developers to fast-track project reviews. It directs the commission to initiate rulemaking “to address inefficiencies and ineffectiveness of existing procedures” in processing interconnection requests. Transmission providers could submit proposals for the commission to adjust its interconnection queue to prioritize dispatchable power plants.

Providers would need to demonstrate the need for a given project’s prioritization and describe how it would improve grid reliability and resilience. FERC would have 60 days to review and approve or deny a proposal.

Wait times for power projects on the interconnection queue have increased to as long as five years, according to Rep. Troy Balderson (R-Ohio), who sponsored the bill. He blamed projects supported by green energy tax credits for the longer wait times and highlighted the growing demand for facilities to power AI data centers.

“With American power demand far outpacing our ability to generate more electricity, our grid is heading toward a reliability crisis,” Balderson said in a statement. “The interconnection queue is overwhelmed and bogged down, leaving shovel-ready power projects waiting for years while demand continues to climb.”

A third bill advanced Sept. 18 reestablishes the National Coal Council, which shut down in the Energy Dept. when its charter expired in 2021. Per the charter, the council’s 120-150 members meet twice a year to advise the Energy secretary on coal policy matters, and are appointed by the secretary for terms of up to two years.

The bills collectively “double down on the Trump administration's commitment to raising American electricity prices by discriminating against clean, cheap energy,” said Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), ranking member on the House energy and commerce committee. “They prove that Republicans have never been for an all-of-the-above energy strategy, and they don’t care about fixing the insanely high cost of living that is crushing families across this country right now.”

The state has only to reach its remaining 20,480 eligible homes and businesses, the state said, because of successful investments under American Rescue Plan Act money contributing to a relatively rapid reduction in unserved and underserved locations.

Of the $551 million originally available under BEAD grants, South Carolina is aiming to spend just $41.3 million, or 7.49 percent.

New York also released its tentative grant winners under the $42.45 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment program this week, bringing the total to 43 states.

Meanwhile, a non-profit group called the Community Broadband Action Network confirmed the Commerce Department was moving ahead with plans to further drive down state spending before approving those draft proposals and allowing funds out the door.

South Carolina locations split between fiber and satellite

South Carolina locations would be roughly split between satellite and fiber, with 48.7 percent to be served by low-earth orbit satellite and 47.85 percent slated for fiber. The small number of remaining homes and businesses would get cable.

Amazon’s nascent Kuiper Systems would cover most of the satellite locations, about 8,900 to SpaceX’s 1,000. ZiTEL and TruVista would take the majority of the wireline locations, with AT&T, Charter, and Comcast serving several hundred each in addition to small projects from other local companies.

“Today’s release of the SC BEAD Final Proposal provides our plan for the anchor leg of the broadband investment relay race here in South Carolina,” Jim Stritzinger, director of the South Carolina Broadband Office, said in a statement.

“With an extraordinary team, in just over three years, we completed four ARPA investment rounds representing $400 million, and $41.3 million in BEAD, to 22 ISPs. From SCBBO inception (July 2021), combined federal, state, and private investments resulted in service to over 200,000 locations. Additionally, nearly 99 percent of these recently constructed locations now have access to fiber – or will soon!”

New York big on terrestrial fixed wireless

In New York, terrestrial fixed wireless would serve the largest portion of the state’s 53,918 BEAD locations, something not seen in any other state to have reported results so far, at about 44 percent. Fiber would take 30.72 percent and satellite, provided by SpaceX, would take 25.25 percent.

“Every community in New York State deserves to have access to the internet and it is time we uplift our underserved communities, providing them with more opportunities and resources,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) said in a statement.

The states will take public comments on their plans for one week before submitting them to Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration for approval.

A hidden NTIA cap on BEAD?

The awards are tentative and might be altered by NTIA before being finally approved. Last week, after apparent NTIA cost thresholds and an apparent internal memo leaked to broadband marketing executive Doug Adams, people involved in the process told Broadband Breakfast NTIA was seeking to have states negotiate down or potentially award to another provider grant awards that came above those cost caps.

CBAN’s executive director Curtis Dean said that a member company in Iowa had received notice from the broadband office there that some of its project costs had been deemed excessive and would have to be corrected within 72 hours, or within 3 days.

“Applicants can reduce costs by cutting expenses or increasing matching funds” or “provide extraordinary circumstances justifications,” Dean said. “The email explains that failure to respond by the deadline will result in locations being awarded to other applicants.”

Two people familiar with the matter said a similar process was underway in multiple other states. One said NTIA was also looking for states to further trim their lists of community anchor institutions, which are in line for fiber once a state’s eligible homes and businesses are taken care of.

ISPs bid on geographic units called project areas, the structure of which differ in each state, and many tentative BEAD projects encompassing several project areas.

The cost thresholds Dean outlined line up with the spreadsheet posted by Adams.

Question about non-deployment funds

It’s not clear what will happen to states’ BEAD money that isn’t used on broadband deployment projects. The 43 states to have reported results would have more than $16 billion in such “non-deployment” funding.

States were planning to use that left over money on things like broadband adoption and workforce development efforts, but the Trump administration isn’t eager to see much non-deployment spending. The NTIA rescinded approval for those activities in June and said more guidance was forthcoming.",https://broadbandbreakfast.com/content/images/2025/09/AP25077653033685-mcmaster.jpeg,N,,2025-09-19 16:01:46.102488

Long Live All-of-the-Above Energy… - The Breakthrough Institute,"Ted Nordhaus, Alex Trembath",,,,,https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/quiet-climate-policy-is-dead-long-live-all-of-the-above-energy-policy,"Even as pitched partisan battles over climate science, carbon regulation, and the Paris Agreement intensified, quiet climate policy largely prevailed when it came to energy innovation and investment.
The decade-long effort to center climate in US energy policy is over.
Pitched political battles over electricity generation, moreover, don’t address the source of much of the increase in retail electricity prices.
For Democrats, environmentalists, and clean energy advocates, this represents a “who moved my cheese” moment, where not just talking points and arguments will need to change but the entire basis of clean energy advocacy.
Quiet climate policy is dead.","Last January, in the Wall Street Journal, we argued that efforts to preserve the whole of the Inflation Reduction Act were both bad policy and politically doomed. Republicans had run against the IRA and needed to cut trillions of dollars to finance the extension of tax cuts established during the first Trump administration. One way or another, they were going to take a pound of flesh and it behooved climate and clean energy advocates to get clear about what in the IRA was worth saving.

We also argued that there was plenty of fat to cut. The vast majority of IRA spending was flowing towards mature technologies—wind, solar, and electric vehicles—that were well established in electricity and automotive markets. Preserving IRA money for these technologies wouldn’t appreciably change their trajectory, or the trajectory of US carbon emissions, which have been falling at a consistent rate for decades.

Rather, the main obstacles to continuing growth of those technologies are not primarily their direct costs, which continue to fall, but a range of well understood challenges associated with integrating these very different technologies into the legacy electricity and transportation sectors—permitting, transmission, and intermittency in the former case, range and charging infrastructure in the latter.

This message was not well received by many climate and clean energy advocates. They believed that the Biden administration’s clever Green Vortex strategy, which overwhelmingly directed clean tech spending toward Republican districts, might insulate wind, solar, and EV tax credits politically and accused us of “negotiating with ourselves.” Forever subsidies for wind, solar, and electric vehicles, moreover, were necessary because the future of the climate hung in the balance.

In reality, we weren’t negotiating with ourselves. We’ve long argued that public subsidies should support early stage commercialization of clean energy technologies and should phase out as those technologies achieve traction in energy and transportation markets. The point of clean tech industrial policy should be to make clean energy cheap in real, unsubsidized terms, not to prop up uncompetitive technologies in perpetuity.

Nor did the fate of the climate, or even US emissions, hang in the balance. Groups like Energy Innovation and Princeton’s Net Zero America that had promoted the legislation produced modeling purporting to show dire consequences if Trump were elected and repealed the IRA. But well before Trump and Republican majorities gutted it, the IRA was underperforming its promised emissions benefits while costing far more than initially estimated. In reality, emissions over the short and medium term were always likely to converge toward the long-term historic US decarbonization rate with or without the IRA. What will matter over the longer term are nascent technologies necessary for further progress: long duration energy storage, advanced nuclear energy, geothermal, and industrial decarbonization.

As it happened, the final package broadly comported with our political analysis. A handful of EV, battery, and solar assembly factories in Republican districts were not going to sidetrack tax, fiscal, and energy policy priorities that were far more important to the Republican coalition. The key fights that were there to be won were to preserve policy support for nuclear, carbon capture, geothermal and other nascent technologies in the face of the opposition from the Freedom Caucus’ fiscal hawks, along with beating back a last minute effort to tax wind and solar energy production.

If it had stopped there, we’d be taking a victory lap today. High-priority programs to promote nuclear, geothermal, energy storage and similar were not only preserved but extended through 2035. The sunsetting of wind and solar subsidies gave Democrats strong incentives to work with Republicans on permitting reform. And there was substantial demand in Congress to develop domestic critical mineral supply chains, and provide sufficient support for the commercialization of next generation nuclear energy technologies.

In place of the Biden administration’s whole of government climate obsession, you could almost convince yourself that federal energy policy was swinging back toward the successful all of the above energy policies that held sway across both the Obama administration and the first Trump administration—to the benefit of both America’s economic performance and its impressive decarbonization over the last two decades.

But, of course, it hasn’t ended there. The Trump administration has now borrowed a page from the Biden playbook, answering Democrats’ punitive approach towards fossil fuel and mining projects by turning the formidable administrative powers of the executive branch against wind and solar energy development. That effort has not only endangered clean energy production that America needs to meet rising demand in the short term, but has also substantially reduced the likelihood that Congress will get very far in efforts to reform permitting and other outdated environmental laws that now stand in the way of energy development of all kinds.

Polarization Trumps Green Pork

The green vortex strategy was, in one sense, an effort to build a durable bipartisan political base for the clean energy economy. By directing enormous public funding for clean energy manufacturing and production toward Republican and right-leaning congressional districts, the idea was that the representatives of these districts would have strong political incentives to support clean energy policies and subsidies whether they were Democrats or Republicans and whichever party controlled Congress and the executive branch. And perhaps, had Kamala Harris squeaked out a victory last November, four more years of public investment in these programs would have proven that strategy out.

But it is also the case that most of these policies already had bipartisan support. A broad swath of Republican politicians had supported tax credits, loan guarantees, ARPA-E, and other policies to support clean energy, electric vehicles, and other clean tech going back to the last years of the George W. Bush administration, including through the first Trump administration. Even as pitched partisan battles over climate science, carbon regulation, and the Paris Agreement intensified, quiet climate policy largely prevailed when it came to energy innovation and investment. But the era of quiet climate policy, it seems, ended with the passage of the IRA, or more precisely, with the fateful determination to enact those policies through a maximalist and entirely partisan budget reconciliation process in the name of historic climate action.

The bet by the Biden administration was that it could use budget reconciliation in the same way that the Obama administration had used the parliamentary procedure to pass the Affordable Care Act. Give the public a valuable benefit and policy-makers would be loath to take it away. Meanwhile, through its implementation, the Administration would use the IRA to make sure that Republican congressional districts benefited from the spending in much the same way that the Pentagon distributed defense production (or pork) widely around the country to assure bipartisan support for defense spending.

But in contrast to the ACA, most households saw little benefit from the IRA. Electricity prices in most places continued to rise and most people remained unconvinced that electric vehicles were a viable option despite the generous subsidies. And while defense spending was broadly supported by both parties in the Cold War era, when the Pentagon built a durable political economy around the military industrial complex, passage of a massive spending package for clean energy on a straight party-line vote in the name of averting a climate apocalypse put a huge partisan target on the IRA and the clean tech economy.

In the age of Donald Trump and an era defined by negative polarization, the results were predictable. Climate polarization swallowed the formerly bipartisan commitments to energy innovation whole, ushering in the fate that we have long warned of: that catastrophism and polarization were a positive feedback loop, imperiling not just conventionally toxic climate policies like carbon taxes and regulations but pragmatic quiet climate policies as well, such as transmission investment, conventional pollution regulations, and energy innovation.

Live By the Electricity Price Sword, Die By the Electricity Price Sword?

In the face of the Trump administration’s full frontal assault on wind and solar, much of the clean energy and climate advocacy community has pivoted, warning today not of looming climate catastrophe but an electricity price apocalypse. For the first time in decades, electricity demand is growing rapidly. Electricity rates are rising around the country. Natural gas production has flatlined. And now, alongside the phase out of subsidies, the Trump administration aims to block the siting of wind and solar projects on public lands and federal waters.

There is a belief among many advocates that Trump and the Republican Party will die by the same electricity price sword that they used so effectively against Biden and the Democratic Party in the last election. The public will blame Trump’s vendetta against wind and solar for the price hike, swinging the mid-term elections to Democrats or, at least, forcing Trump to backtrack in the same way that Biden was forced to reverse course on his administration’s moratorium on oil and gas development on public lands.

This may come to pass. But there are also reasons for skepticism. First, Trump, to a much greater degree than Biden, inherited rising electricity prices. As with the broader issue of inflation, Biden had the bad fortune of taking office just as energy prices were rebounding after the Covid pandemic, a problem that was then made worse by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Biden’s various energy policies were not the main event in the run up of energy prices. But in the context of a lot of other things that were out of his control, policies that seemingly contributed to the problem were bound to get an outsized share of the blame.

Second, it is not yet clear that Trump’s moves against renewable energy will be as politically salient as Biden’s moves against oil and gas. Gasoline prices typically set the template for public perception of energy prices more broadly and Trump has been extremely proactive about encouraging Saudi Arabia and other global producers to increase production, even though this has disadvantaged US oil and gas production.

As a result, while electricity prices are rising, gasoline prices are not. So it is not at all clear either that higher electricity prices will stoke public concern about Trump’s energy policies absent an increase in gasoline prices or that the voters or the public will so easily be convinced to accept a connection between Trump' s assault on wind and solar and electricity prices as they were to accept that Biden’s early moves against fossil fuels were responsible for high gas prices specifically and rising energy prices more generally. Indeed, recent polling suggests that voters are more likely to blame corporations and state governments than the Trump Administration for rising electricity prices.

Finally, the narrative that Democrats and clean energy advocates have begun to tell, about the cancellation of wind and solar projects causing rising electricity prices, is complicated by the widespread perception that wind and solar are responsible for high electricity prices in California and other blue states. This claim is highly contested. Clean energy advocates point to trends in wholesale electricity prices, for instance, which don’t show a strong correlation with renewable energy penetration.

But whether high retail electricity prices are the result of the costs of transmission, distribution, and other measures necessary to integrate variable renewable generation into electrical grids, wildfires, or just the “blue state model” more broadly, the fact remains that many of the highest profile Democrat-run states, including New York, California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Massachusetts feature very high electricity prices. This problem is further exacerbated by what has, to date, been Exhibit A in the effort to blame Trump for high electricity prices, which is the repeal of IRA subsidies for wind and solar, which undermines the claim that these electricity sources are cheap, not expensive.

In short, while the Trump administration’s energy agenda may not prove a recipe for either energy abundance or energy dominance, it is not clear that Trump or Republicans will pay a particularly high political price for it, particularly given how polarized the politics of energy, not just climate, has become.

Electricity Prices Are Too Damn High

Beyond the dueling claims about who is responsible for high electricity prices, what is clear is that energy price, reliability, and security are now the coin of the realm. The decade-long effort to center climate in US energy policy is over.

Yet neither fossil energy-focused Republicans nor renewable energy-focused Democrats are likely to make much headway on electricity prices in the short term. US natural gas production was already at record levels in the last years of the Biden administration. Gas production is expected to tick up a bit more this year but won’t grow remotely fast enough to keep up with demand growth.

Wind and solar, meanwhile, were not coming to the rescue of electricity ratepayers even if Kamala Harris were president and the IRA had not been repealed. Solar generation was growing rapidly even before the passage of the IRA and most current projections foresee strong continuing growth despite the phaseout of subsidies. Wind energy deployment, by contrast, was already flagging, due to rising commodity prices and exorbitant costs for off-shore projects even before the Trump administration’s recent moves against off-shore wind and the repeal of the IRA’s subsidies. Had Harris won the 2024 election instead of Trump, electricity prices would be rising just as rapidly and Republicans would be blaming the IRA for today’s electricity prices, just as they were before the election.

Pitched political battles over electricity generation, moreover, don’t address the source of much of the increase in retail electricity prices. Rather, a substantial portion is associated with the cost of transmission and distribution, which in many places has been rising faster than the cost of wholesale electricity generation.

The costs of maintaining and expanding transmission and distribution owes to many factors, including grid hardening in the face of extreme weather and rising commodity prices, as well as the costs of integrating geographically diffuse intermittent electricity generators like wind and solar. But it is also in significant part an unintended consequence of the effort to restructure and liberalize electricity markets.

Electricity market liberalization has allowed for competitive electricity generation markets and has been good for both the natural gas and wind and solar industries. But it also, by design, pushed utilities out of the electricity generation business. As a result, most utilities around the country now make their money through transmission and distribution, where they still maintain their regulated monopoly status and are still granted a guaranteed profit on top of the cost of building and maintaining transmission and distribution infrastructure.

Unsurprisingly, this has incentivized utilities to build and upgrade a lot more transmission and distribution infrastructure, and those are the costs that in most of the country are rising fastest. Worse, the institutional capacity to plan and coordinate investment for affordability, reliability, and decarbonization has been deeply compromised by a utility landscape that was already highly decentralized, by the many Rube Golbergesque variations of electricity market liberalization, and by the transformation of federal and state energy policy into culture war objects.

Wicked Electricity

Last spring, Alex declared the era of the climate hawk over, noting that none of the conditions that had allowed climate advocates to believe that climate change could be established as a durable priority for US policymakers over the decade or so before the COVID pandemic any longer obtained. Post-Covid budget deficits, supply chain challenges, and inflation had brought an end to the low interest rates and expansionary fiscal policy that had underwritten public clean energy investments over the previous decade. The post-COVID recovery and huge new demand from data centers reversed a generation of slow energy demand growth, putting upward pressure on electricity prices and making policy tradeoffs between energy costs and clean energy and climate objectives even more toxic politically than they already were. Perhaps most importantly, the election of Donald Trump had put to rest the notion that inexorable demographic trends would allow for sustained Democratic majorities which would prioritize climate policy at the federal level.

This shift appears unlikely to be temporary. Democrats might take back the House or even the Senate in the midterm elections and perhaps they will retake the presidency in 2028. But high interest rates and budget deficits are likely to be with us for a long time. So are high electricity prices. Despite America’s remarkable innovation capacities and energy resource endowments, we do not have the right mix of technologies nor the institutional arrangements nor the political leadership to solve the electricity problem anytime soon.

This will create possibilities for some clean energy technologies. Higher prices and supply constraints are good news for anyone who can get so-called “clean firm” generation technologies commercialized, sited, and built at a competitive price, whether that is advanced nuclear, enhanced geothermal, natural gas with carbon removal, or solar with long-duration battery storage. But the balkanized utility landscape, liberalized electricity markets, and diversity of rent-seeking interests competing for a share of the electricity generation and distribution pie make neither more centralized and rationalized planning of the electricity system nor truly competitive and efficient market based solutions particularly feasible.

We have long written about the wicked nature of climate change, which suffers not merely from polarization but rampant solution-based problem definition, policy-based evidence making, and arbitrary boundary setting. “The expert is also the player in a political game, seeking to promote his private vision of goodness over others,” as Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber, the UC Berkeley urban planning professors who first applied the idea of wickedness to policy debates, wrote over 50 years ago. “What comprises problem-solution for one is problem-generation for another.”

America’s electricity landscape is now wicked. The sheer number of conflicting economic and ideological interests make electricity cost and reliability a problem to be managed, not solved. Electricity costs are increasingly salient at a moment when cost of living concerns remain high and yet are not salient enough to discipline political actors and policy making in a nation in which a highly polarized public and even more polarized opinion elites are mostly rich enough to ignore cost of living concerns when they conflict with their ideological priors.

While there is no solving the problem, there are problems to solve. The electricity price crisis is the result of multiple causes, including generation and supply shortfalls; permitting, transmission and interconnection bottlenecks; wildfire mitigation, particularly in the west; and kludgy regulatory and market restructuring that simultaneously socializes the costs of goldplated infrastructure, subsidizes high-volume customers, and simulates competitive generation markets.

Solutions to these problems will look different in liberalized versus traditionally regulated utility markets. They will also look different in different parts of the country. Solutions that work in Texas, with abundant wind, solar, and natural gas resources competing in the most liberalized electricity market in the nation will not look the same as North Carolina or Florida, where vertically integrated monopoly utilities still lean heavily on nuclear and coal, or the Tennessee Valley, where TVA operates a publicly owned system powered predominantly with nuclear and natural gas.

For these reasons, as a matter of both policy and political communication, all-of-the-above energy policy remains both the most robust approach to the wicked and highly differentiated nature of America’s electricity system and, demonstrably, the best political approach. Neither Bill McKibben’s solar liberation nor Trump’s fossil-heavy energy dominance agenda are plausible alternatives.

Back to an All-of-the-Above Future

Democrats and clean energy advocates still have a lot of unlearning to do. We were both struck during our week in DC for Abundance 2025 how hard it was for even moderate, Abundance-pilled Democratic politicians, despite the determination to pivot to electricity cost, to talk about energy and electricity without talking about climate change. They would start off on their talking points, about AI and data centers, the need for more renewable energy and President Trump’s anti-abundance assault on wind and solar, and then they’d veer back to talking about climate change and decarbonization.

This was, perhaps, by design—based on the perception that they still need to signal to environmentalists that they care deeply about climate change. But if so, it is a poor design. When Democrats and clean energy advocates extoll the benefits of renewable energy to keep electricity costs under control, their supporters already know that they care about climate change. By contrast, when they muddle their energy affordability message with talk about climate change and emissions, they end up signalling to everyone else that what they really care about is climate change, not electricity costs.

Climate advocates, for their part, do their partners in the Democratic Party no favors by rebranding conventional green policies as an “energy affordability” strategy. A policy agenda that supports residential rooftop solar while opposing fossil fuel drilling and pipelines will strike voters as an agenda to keep energy prices high, because that’s what it is, notwithstanding talking points about shielding ratepayers from fuel price volatility and promises of solar energy too cheap to meter.

Trump and Republicans may face similar problems by the time the 2026 or 2028 elections come along. But removing subsidies, as they did in the Big Beautiful bill, likely won’t have the same political valence as the Biden Administration’s sweeping gestures towards fossil fuel abolition. That said, blocking wind, solar, and transmission development on public lands may undermine public support for the Trump Administration's energy dominance agenda.

Ultimately, whoever controls the affordability debate is likely to have the upper hand. For Democrats, environmentalists, and clean energy advocates, this represents a “who moved my cheese” moment, where not just talking points and arguments will need to change but the entire basis of clean energy advocacy. Policies to “keep it in the ground” are dead and aren’t coming back. The conflation of policies to make clean energy cheap with perpetual subsidies for renewable energy has polarized opinion toward what were once popular technologies and undermined claims that these technologies are cheap and hold the key to lower electricity prices. Hardest of all, clean energy advocates, not just Democrats, will need to learn to talk about the benefits that fossil fuels bring to America’s energy and electricity systems, even as they advocate for diversifying away from them.

This will seem new to many. But it is not so new for an older generation of Democrats and environmentalists. It is the language and agenda of the Clinton and Obama administrations, from before the time that the climate hawks seized control of the Democratic Party. It is still the most popular and durable approach to energy affordability and decarbonization, and holds the key to restoring credibility on the energy issue for both Democrats and clean energy advocates.

U.S. Congressman Morgan Griffith (R-VA) issued the following statement:

“LENOWISCO Planning District Commission believes that the Brownfields Program creates great potential for Southwest Virginia communities.

“This EPA Brownfield Assessment Coalition grant for $1.2 million helps LENOWISCO Planning District Commission continue its goals to redevelop hazardous or polluted sites in deep Southwest Virginia.”

BACKGROUND

In May, Congressman Griffith announced that LENOWISCO Planning District Commission received a different $1.2 million Brownfield Assessment grant from the EPA. That funding supported a community-wide assessment of local brownfields.

According to the EPA, Assessment Coalition grants are designed for one “lead” eligible entity to partner with two to four eligible entities that do not have the capacity to apply for and manage their own EPA cooperative agreement and otherwise would not have access to Brownfields grant resources.

Before his July appointment as Health Subcommittee Chairman, Congressman Griffith chaired the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment.

In March of 2025, Congressman Griffith chaired a hearing on the EPA’s Brownfields Program. Scott County Native and LENOWISCO Planning District Commission Executive Director Duane Miller testified to the panel and discussed the Program’s importance to Southwest Virginia communities.

LENOWISCO Planning District Commission serves the Counties of Lee, Wise and Scott and the City of Norton.

The Brownfields Program empowers states, communities and other stakeholders to work together to prevent, assess, safely clean up and sustainably reuse brownfields.

A brownfield site is real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant.

Brownfield Assessment grants provide funding for brownfield inventories, planning, environmental assessments and community outreach.

Ed Buchan, assistant director of Raleigh Water, said that level of demand would be significant for the region.
“It’s a meaningful chunk of water that would otherwise be reserved for residential or commercial growth,” said Ed Buchan, assistant director of Raleigh Water.
While the overall national water use of data centers remains small compared with agriculture or industry, Ren noted that local impacts can be far greater.
Ren said roughly half of data centers are not publicly disclosing their water use.","The rapid growth of artificial intelligence is fueling demand not just for electricity but also for water, raising new questions for communities in North Carolina.

Industry estimates show a 250-megawatt data center can use about a billion gallons of water each year, or 2.7 million gallons a day.

Ed Buchan, assistant director of Raleigh Water, said that level of demand would be significant for the region.

“It’s a meaningful chunk of water that would otherwise be reserved for residential or commercial growth,” said Ed Buchan, assistant director of Raleigh Water. “That’s about what the demand is for some of our merger communities like Knightdale and Wendell.”

Buchan said that most water utilities return nearly all of what they treat back to the river basin, but cooling systems at data centers often evaporate it. “If it’s evaporated, it’s basically out of the equation,” he said. That could pose risks during drought, when downstream flow is critical.

Shaolei Ren, a University of California Riverside professor who has studied AI’s water footprint, said usage can spike during the hottest months. That means competition with residents who already need more water in summer. “Understanding the peak usage is also important in addition to the annual total,” Ren said.

While the overall national water use of data centers remains small compared with agriculture or industry, Ren noted that local impacts can be far greater. “We need to look at the specific context and understand if it is creating some pressure on the water infrastructures,” he said.

Michael Pencina, Duke University’s vice dean for data science, said sustainability must be part of AI’s future. At Duke, researchers are exploring ways to recycle the heat generated by computing power. “We’ve looked at using the heat from GPU farms to warm up water that’s used across campus,” he said. “It’s about being creative in reducing the footprint while still advancing discovery.”

AI companies have pledged to become “water positive” by 2030, yet transparency remains a challenge. Ren said roughly half of data centers are not publicly disclosing their water use. “Without knowing the numbers, how can we manage these resources responsibly,” he asked.

A Washington Post analysis found a ChatGPT text query uses only about five drops of water, but those small amounts add up when multiplied by billions of requests and the massive cooling demands of data centers.

Buchan said Raleigh has enough supply to handle one or two large facilities, but multiple sites could speed the need for new reservoirs or other costly projects. “If you had a significant number of them come into your service area, and then they were the type that evaporated a lot of water, then that might move up your need for a new water resource pretty quickly,” he said.

Communities weighing data center proposals are often drawn to their high property tax value.

“Data centers clearly have benefits,” Ren said. “On the other hand, they also use resources like power and water. The real question is whether those tradeoffs add up to a net benefit for the community.”",https://images.wral.com/ba85002e-96cb-4e4d-aab9-d9863654e3ea?w=1200&h=630,N,,2025-09-19 15:02:44.634076

This week, the campaign continues with additional events and rallies in today California, Arizona and Nevada. These events will engage constituents by delivering petitions, holding more events to come in additional states across the country and holding members of Congress accountable by urging them to stop increasing costs.

These events build on the more than 115 events LCV and state partners have already hosted across the country since the Big Ugly Bill passed.

The Big Ugly Bill raises costs across the board including healthcare, groceries, and utility bills, jeopardizes clean energy jobs, and guts critical programs that protect the health and safety of people.

“Families are struggling to make ends meet and cannot afford the rising costs that Congressional Republicans are making so much worse” said LCV Senior Vice President of Campaigns Sara Schreiber. “Republicans in Congress who voted for the Big Ugly Bill have broken their promise to their constituents to lower costs. They are siding with Big Polluters and other powerful billionaires and hurting working families by cutting widely supported investments and programs that mean energy, health care and grocery bills are going up. At a time of rising energy demand and extreme climate disasters, it makes no sense to block affordable clean energy solutions and roll back protections for our health and our environment. Our elected leaders should instead be investing in affordable energy solutions that work for us all and safeguard our communities, our planet, and future generations.”

“Our Latine and communities of color were already hurting before they passed this catastrophic legislation that will continue to raise our energy bills, make our air dirtier, impact our health,” said Chispa Arizona Executive Director Vianey Olivarría. “Our leaders who voted for these policies are responsible for the harm they are placing on all our families and neighborhoods.”

The Regulatory Background The CAA generally prohibits the construction of stationary sources of air pollutants without an NSR preconstruction permit.
Bottom line: The TSMC Letter gives project developers new room to maneuver, but not without risk.","What can project developers actually build before securing an air permit? The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) prohibits constructing an “emission unit” without the requisite air permit. Yet many large capital projects involve both emitting and non-emitting components, and for decades, project developers have faced uncertainty about where the line is drawn. A 1986 “Reich memo” suggested that even “accommodating installations”—like foundations, pads, and roofs—might require permits. This expansive view often forced companies to delay construction of non-emitting components, even when those components were the rate-limiting step for development. The result: slower timelines and higher costs.

On September 2, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) provided long-awaited clarity. In a letter opinion, the agency confirmed that the prohibition applies only to construction “on an emissions unit” itself—not related non-emitting infrastructure. At the same time, EPA announced it would undertake a rulemaking to codify this narrower boundary, limiting future administrations’ ability to revert to the broader 1986 guidance without a full rulemaking.

EPA’s clarification may allow project developers in certain industries to get a head start on construction. But project sponsors, investors, and lenders alike should note that any construction remains at the permittee’s own risk: time and money spent before the permit is issued will not influence whether the permit is granted or the conditions it will impose.

The 2025 EPA Interpretation

In July 2025, semiconductor manufacturer TSMC Arizona Corporation (“TSMC”) sought clarification from the Maricopa County Air Quality Department (“MCAQD”) on whether it could begin construction of the foundation, steel superstructure, and exterior walls of a manufacturing plant prior to MCAQD’s issuance of the plant’s air permit. MCAQD agreed that TSMC was not prohibited from constructing the “core and shell” of the plant because these structures are not a source of emissions under the CAA. Nevertheless, MCAQD sought EPA’s concurrence.

EPA’s September 2 response letter (the “TSMC Letter”) explains that permit applicants can commence permanent on-site construction activities prior to receipt of a New Source Review (“NSR”) preconstruction permit, provided that no construction is performed “on an emissions unit.” EPA agreed that, based on the facts provided, erecting TSMC’s proposed plant’s superstructure would not constitute construction “on an emissions unit” and so is not prohibited by the CAA. But EPA cautioned that any construction performed would be at TSMC’s own risk, meaning that the time and resources TSMC expended on the superstructure cannot be used to influence or justify any permitting decisions, and that TSMC would assume the risk that the permit could contain conditions requiring TSMC to modify or rebuild what was already in progress.

EPA concurrently shared its intent to finalize by the end of 2026 revisions to its regulatory definition of “begin actual construction,” to more clearly articulate the construction activities prohibited by the CAA. EPA has since updated its webpage, “Construction Activities Allowed Before Obtaining a Preconstruction Air Permit,” with this information and a reference to the TSMC Letter. In the interim, EPA will continue to provide case-by-case guidance on pre-permit construction.

The Regulatory Background

The CAA generally prohibits the construction of stationary sources of air pollutants without an NSR preconstruction permit. EPA implements the CAA’s preconstruction permitting mandate through regulations, which states must incorporate into their respective state implementation plans.

EPA’s regulations provide that major stationary sources cannot “begin actual construction” without a permit. “Begin actual construction” is defined as “in general, initiation of physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a permanent nature,” including the emission unit’s supports and foundation, underground pipework, and storage facilities.1 Emissions units are “any part of a stationary source that emits or would have the potential to emit” regulated pollutants.2

The TSMC Letter arguably preserves the status quo: based on the plain text of EPA’s regulations, project developers like TSMC have never been constrained from beginning construction on non-emitting structures. Only construction “on an emissions unit” is prohibited. More fundamentally, it is reasonable to conclude that structures with no emissions are beyond the ambit of the CAA, as MCAQD and the TSMC Letter posit.

However, earlier EPA guidance like the 1986 “Reich memo” suggested that EPA would view construction of “any accommodating installation” related to an emissions unit as prohibited by the CAA. This historically drove developers to take overly conservative approaches to pre-permit construction, to the detriment of project development timelines—a problem the TSMC Letter appears to alleviate.3

Takeaways

The impacts will vary considerably by industry and potentially also by state, given state permitting agencies are not obligated to follow EPA guidance. For manufacturing and data center development, which often have significant non-emitting infrastructure, the TSMC Letter may promote accelerated construction timelines. Indeed, EPA’s decision to revise the “begin actual construction” regulatory definition is explicitly linked to the current administration’s desire to ramp up the deployment of domestic manufacturing and data center infrastructure. However, with respect to projects where virtually all equipment has potential to emit or is a direct accessory to such emitting equipment, the potential benefits are less clear.

Bottom line: The TSMC Letter gives project developers new room to maneuver, but not without risk. Expect federal courts to weigh in—via citizen suits or rulemaking challenges—on whether the CAA bars construction of non-emitting yet essential project structures before a permit is in hand. And after Loper Bright, it is the judiciary, not EPA, that will have the last word.

What work does Type One Energy hope to do at Bull Run?

Type One is planning to build the world’s first commercial nuclear fusion plant on the former TVA site. The Knoxville-based firm aims to use a machine called a stellarator to contain superheated plasma at the pilot plant being developed with TVA.

Its design plan is a break from traditional nuclear power plants, which use fission - the process of splitting uranium isotopes apart - to create heat. Fusion reactions instead smash hydrogen isotopes together for heat.

Company scientists have built stellarators, but not under the Type One name. Once the plant is fully online - possibly in the 2030s - it could create as many as 330 jobs, according to Type One’s leaders. They previously said they hoped to start constructing Infinity One, a prototype stellarator, in 2026.

Type One Energy has had an Oak Ridge office since August 2023 and works with both TVA and Oak Ridge National Laboratory on expanding its fusion projects. It was the first company to receive a grant − $4.5 million − from Tennessee’s Nuclear Energy Fund.

The facility will hold “hundreds of thousands” of powerful NVIDIA general processing units, which will be used to train AI models. Smith said this will deliver “ten times the performance of today’s fastest supercomputers.” Microsoft officials said the Mount Pleasant facility will be the world’s most powerful AI data center.

“But what does that mean for the average Wisconsinite?” Smith wrote. “It means new jobs, new skills and new opportunities — right here at home. From union construction roles to long-term careers in operations and IT, this facility is creating pathways for Wisconsinites to be part of the future of technology. It means students at Gateway Technical College can train for high-demand roles through Wisconsin’s first Datacenter Academy. It means local companies — from manufacturers to startups — can partner with Microsoft engineers to turn AI ideas into real solutions.”

More than 90% of the facility will use a closed-loop liquid cooling system which will be filled during construction and continuously recirculated, officials said. The rest will use outside air for cooling and switch to water on the hottest days to minimize environmental impact, officials added.

Microsoft will pre-pay for energy and electrical infrastructure to offset costs for ratepayers and match kilowatt hours used by fossil fuel with renewables, officials said. A 250-megawatt solar project under construction in Portage County will help with matching, officials said.

The first data center used more than 3,000 construction workers at its peak, Microsoft officials said. When the first data center is open, it will hire around 500 full-time employees and will grow to 800 when the second is completed.

“Throughout our history, innovation has been the key to Wisconsin’s success, championing ideas of discoveries that have transformed people’s lives the world over, and this announcement is no different,” said Gov. Tony Evers in a statement. “Microsoft’s investment puts Wisconsin on the very cutting edge of AI power, not just in the U.S., but throughout the world, while creating good, family supporting jobs, growing our communities and bolstering our critical biohealth, personalized medicine and advanced manufacturing sectors here at home. We are grateful for Microsoft’s continued investment in our state and look forward to continuing to partner together to support Wisconsin’s workforce, economy and communities.”

First data center goes under environmental scrutiny

Microsoft’s data center will use 8.4 million gallons each year, data from the city of Racine showed.

In February, Milwaukee Riverkeeper requested information from the city under public records. Later, the Midwest Environmental Advocates filed a lawsuit against the city to turn over project water use information. Racine’s water utility will provide Lake Michigan water for the data center campus under an agreement with Racine and Mount Pleasant.

The facility will hit peak daily use of 234,000 gallons of water each day when its first phase is completed in 2026, city data showed.

After future phases, the data center will use 702,000 gallons of water each day or 8.44 million gallons each year. This project is for when Areas 3B, 3A and 2 are built out.

The first phase (Area 3B) will see wastewater discharge of up to 81,000 gallons per day and more than 2 million each year. After all phases, the facility will discharge 243,000 gallons each day and more than 6 million each year.

“Data centers will have major implications for Wisconsin’s environment,” said Cheryl Nenn, lead at Milwaukee Riverkeeper. “Our ability to understand the impacts and protect our water resources depends on open and transparent government.”

The request “required additional review while the city worked with Microsoft and associated parties to ensure that the release of information would not violate contractual agreements,” wrote city of Racine officials. Officials pointed to the review for the delay and said their ultimate goal was transparency.

“Open and transparent government is not optional; it is essential to public trust,” said Racine Mayor Cory Mason in a statement. “While we needed time to ensure that we handled this request responsibly and in compliance with legal agreements, we believe transparency is paramount. The information has been released, and we remain committed to making all relevant government records accessible so our community can see how decisions are made and resources are used.”

In 2018, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources approved the city of Racine to divert up to 7 million gallons each day towards the former Foxconn site in Mount Pleasant.

The diverted water would be returned to the Great Lakes Basin through the Racine Wastewater Treatment Plant, DNR officials said.

The approval was granted under the Great Lakes — St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact, which banned diversions of Great Lakes water with a few exceptions, officials said. One exception was to allow a “straddling community” to receive Lake Michigan water if certain criteria were met. Mount Pleasant is classified as such a community.

The Microsoft data center in Mount Pleasant and Vantage Data Centers facility in Port Washington would require a combined 3.9 gigawatts of electricity, a September analysis by Clean Wisconsin found. That’s enough to power 4.3 million Wisconsin homes. However, there are only 2.8 million housing units in the state, U.S. Census data showed.

Mount Pleasant and Port Washington data centers were two of five proposed data center projects which publicly shared their electricity needs. Proposals are underway for Beaver Dam, Vienna and Red Cedar.

“To put this in perspective, that is more than three times the power production capacity of Wisconsin’s Point Beach nuclear reactor,” said Paul Mathewson, science program director at Clean Wisconsin. “And because only two of the data center projects have disclosed their power needs, we know this is really just a fraction of what the energy use would be if all those data centers are ultimately built.”",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/09/Microsoft.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 18:03:35.304668

The City of Tallahassee is proud to announce it has received the Sunrise Award and Redevelopment Award from the Florida Brownfields Association (FBA), recognizing its commitment to environmental stewardship, community engagement and sustainable growth.

These prestigious awards spotlight the City's successful Brownfields program, which is recognized as one of the most successful in Florida and the southeastern United States. Through this program, the City has secured over $3 million in grant funding from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) since 1997 to turn underused, environmentally impacted sites into thriving community assets.

Brownfields are properties where the perception or presence of environmental contamination hinder growth and development. Cleaning up brownfield properties improves the environment, facilitates job growth, utilizes existing infrastructure, increases the local tax base and enables redevelopment opportunities.

The Sunrise Award recognizes the most impactful brownfields redevelopment projects in the state of Florida that successfully leverage multi-stakeholder partnerships to bring about positive change. The Redevelopment Award celebrates innovative, transformative projects that are models of resilience, environmental responsibility and strategic reuse.

The centerpiece of this dual achievement is the transformation of Cascades Park, a former polluted Superfund alternative site, into a nationally recognized park known as a vibrant cultural and recreational destination that also houses vital stormwater infrastructure.

""This achievement highlights the City's leadership in turning environmental challenges into opportunities for economic vitality and community pride,"" Deputy City Manager Karen Jumonville said. ""The dedication and expertise of staff in the transformation of Cascades Park exemplifies the power of brownfields redevelopment to restore contaminated land and revitalize communities.""

Through collaboration by the City of Tallahassee, Blueprint Intergovernmental Agency, EPA, FDEP and private stakeholders, this once-polluted site was remediated and repurposed into a thriving community asset that has spurred more than $300 million in private investment.

As part of the City's 2025-2029 Strategic Plan, the City will complete 25 environmental assessments, remediation or redevelopment projects at brownfield sites throughout the City.

Administrator Lee Zeldin wrote in a Thursday memo that plants that are resuming operations will no longer have to get a fresh permit under the New Source Review program. The determination follows a ruling last year by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

The court’s reasoning, he added, “is persuasive and illustrates that the Clean Air Act is best read not to require a permit to resume operation of an idle stationary source.” EPA will, however, continue to require a permit if the restart entails a change to the plant’s operations qualifies as a “major modification” under the New Source Review program, his memo said.
