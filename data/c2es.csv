Now it’s prepared to usher in a second one, when the country’s leaders in innovation, technology, energy and artificial intelligence meet at Carnegie Mellon University on Tuesday for the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit.
Drake’s Well, in Titusville, Pennsylvania, ushered in an energy revolution.
“People will quickly see we are on the brink of America’s next industrial revolution, just in the same way Pennsylvania led the first one when Drake’s oil was discovered,” McCormick said.
His answer: “The energy production is incredible, it is the number two energy producer in the country which is the first necessary step to power the AI revolution and to really power the energy revolution.","PITTSBURGH — It was the site of America’s first industrial revolution. Now it’s prepared to usher in a second one, when the country’s leaders in innovation, technology, energy and artificial intelligence meet at Carnegie Mellon University on Tuesday for the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit.

President Donald Trump, in an interview with me ahead of the summit, said the event is going to “open the eyes of a lot of people of what is about to be unleashed in Pennsylvania.”

Senator David McCormick, the Pittsburgh Republican who assembled the July 15 event, said the energy and AI summit will feature Trump, several cabinet members, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, big Tech leaders from OpenAI and Meta as well as energy leaders from all over the country, including the natural gas powerhouse EQT’s Toby Rice.

“And what is about to happen here in Pennsylvania, with the technology experts from our universities, the natural resources, the ability to turn around long dormant industrial communities and our unparrelled workforce is a game changer,” McCormick said.

He compares the moment to 1859, when Edwin Drake became the first American to successfully drill for oil. Drake’s Well, in Titusville, Pennsylvania, ushered in an energy revolution.

Scottish immigrant Andrew Carnegie was an early investor in this oil boom, which he then used to build the largest steel company in the world in western Pennsylvania. Carnegie became one of the richest men in American history, and donated most of it — including to the Pittsburgh research university that bears his name.

“People will quickly see we are on the brink of America’s next industrial revolution, just in the same way Pennsylvania led the first one when Drake’s oil was discovered,” McCormick said.

“We are at that moment right now, thanks to the technology that comes from [Carnegie Mellon] and the hubs of companies that surround it, as well as our incredible work force to build these AI data power centers, and the tradesmen and women who will supply the energy needed for them,” he said.

Darrin Kelly, the President of the Allegheny-Fayette Labor Council, said if the investments in projects all line up, his men and women will be ready to go. “We have the best workforce in the world and no matter what it is, we’ll shine when the time comes.”

The event comes on the heels of a boom in the labor force in Pennsylvania that kicked off last month when Trump announced the partnership and $11 billion investment from Japanese-owned Nippon Steel. That investment not only kept the American steelmaker in the U.S., but also protected more than 100,000 jobs through investments in steelmaking in Pennsylvania as well as in other plants in Indiana, Arkansas, Minnesota and Alabama.

That announcement was quickly followed by Amazon pledging $20 billion in Pennsylvania for AI infrastructure.

Shapiro told me that the investment will establish multiple high tech cloud computing and AI innovation campuses across the Commonwealth, “It will create thousands of new jobs that will build, operate and maintain the first two data center campuses in Luzerne and Bucks counties,” he said, adding, “look for more investment soon.”

Western Pennsylvania sits in the sweet spot for the growth and development of the AI boom; both the University of Pittsburgh and CMU are heralded for attracting and training some of the brightest minds in the country when it comes to engineering, research and artificial intelligence.

Western Pennsylvania has had its troubles. After the end of the steel boom, the area decayed, unemployment was rampant — still-vacant coal fired power plants, steel mills and manufacturing plants stand as ghostly sentinels of an era that has long vanished.

But things started to turn around about 15 years with a natural-gas boom and oil fracking technology. McCormick says between the access to massive amounts of energy, both natural gas, nuclear as well as coal that will turn things around in a way no one has seen for generations.

In April, in Homer City, the stacks of a former coal fired power plant were imploded, and the site is being redeveloped into a $10 billion AI and data center.

In the two years since the Homer City coal fire plant had been closed down, the tiny western Pennsylvania village had already started to show signs of depression — but the new investment changed everything.

McCormick said this isn’t just about the potential tens of thousands of construction jobs to build these AI data centers. “These jobs will also include chemists, scientists, engineers, AI experts, physicists,” he said.

McCormick said people have asked him why Pittsburgh?

His answer: “The energy production is incredible, it is the number two energy producer in the country which is the first necessary step to power the AI revolution and to really power the energy revolution. We have incredible skilled labor, with the welders, steam fitters, pipe fitters, construction workers and electricians, but we also have incredibly sophisticated technologists.”

“I think it’s arguably CMU is the best AI university in the country. It’s got incredible tradition with computer science and technologists, which is why in recent years, Google and Apple and Airbnb and everybody else, Tesla all have offices around here because they’re trying to draw on that talent,” he said.

Trump, Shapiro and McCormick all expressed great excitement about what people learn from this summit, but also to show the turn around for the region.

“Too often the stories have been about what once was, well this is a moment about how great things will be,” said McCormick, adding, “We are only beginning.”

Lockaby, Botetourt County Attorney (Spilman Thomas & Battle, PLLC, on brief), for appellee Botetourt County Board of Supervisors.","Where the appellants did not own or occupy real property in close proximity to the challenged location, and failed to demonstrate a particularized harm, they lacked standing to challenge the zoning determination.

Background

This matter is part of an ongoing series of lawsuits concerning an onshore wind project known as the Rocky Forge Wind Farm in Botetourt County, Virginia. Appellants appeal from the judgment of the circuit court finding that they lacked standing in the circuit court to challenge the decision of the Botetourt County Board of Zoning Appeals affirming the determination made by the Botetourt County Zoning Administrator.

Standard

First, the complainant must own or occupy real property within or in close proximity to the property that is the subject of the land use determination, thus establishing that it has a direct, immediate, pecuniary and substantial interest in the decision. Second, the complainant must allege facts demonstrating a particularized harm to some personal or property right, legal or equitable, or imposition of a burden or obligation upon the petitioner different from that suffered by the public generally.

Melissa Hunley

The court first considers whether Melissa Hunley, the closest of the property owners, had standing in the circuit court. Her property is approximately two miles from the concrete batch plant. Given that the concrete batch plant in this case is not dissimilar from the construction sites at issue in other Supreme Court cases assessing standing to challenge zoning decisions, and given that Hundley is located significantly farther from the concrete batch plant than successful litigants in Supreme Court cases where the court has found that there was standing, the court finds that Melissa Hundley has failed to satisfy the first prong of the standing test.

Moreover Hundley has not shown that the construction and operations of the concrete batch plant create a “particularized harm” to her or to her property that is “different from that suffered by the public generally.” While Hundley alleges that runoff from the concrete batch plant could damage her streams, the record before this court on appeal shows that her property is actually upstream from the concrete batch plant, so the streams on her property would not be harmed by any purported runoff that runs into Mill Creek.

Furthermore, it is not enough for Hundley to claim that dust and noise from the concrete batch plant will affect her. Hundley must instead allege that the dust and noise affect her in a way distinguishable from those around her—the general public—and that the concrete batch plant creates “sufficient noise, particulate matter, or pollution off site to cause actual harm.”

Remaining property owners

The remaining property owners each alleged in their petition that the dust, noise or runoff from the concrete batch plant would negatively impact their enjoyment of the natural resources on their own land and in the surrounding area. These property owners, however, have not alleged why the special environmental protections included in the modified permit that Rocky Forge Wind obtained from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality would not protect them from the alleged dust, noise and runoff from the concrete batch plant.

In addition, the property owners have not sufficiently alleged the expected impact of the concrete batch plant on their own properties. Instead, they have merely relied on news reports and other information describing the consequences of other concrete batch plants elsewhere.

The additional concerns alleged by the property owners that a potential “spill of concrete, fuel, cement, etc., could be devastating” to “the property owners abutting Mill Creek” likewise fails to satisfy the particularized harm standard for standing because none of the property owners (other than Hundley who, as noted lives upstream from the concrete batch plant) claim to own land actually abutting Mill Creek or the Rocky Forge Wind Farm site.

This committee makes recommendations for council consideration. Majority council approval would be required at a future council meeting for any resolutions to take effect.

The first resolution focuses on the proposed construction of a plastics plant by Alterra Energy LLC in Sugarloaf Township.

According to the proposed resolution, the Akron, Ohio-based company has proposed to construct a plastics pyrolysis plant at 42 Tomhicken Road that would involve transporting approximately 100,000 tons of discarded plastic into the county from major urban centers, such as New York City and Philadelphia.

It said the “proposed plant would reportedly produce approximately 80,000 tons per year of a fuel product derived from the pyrolysis of plastic waste.”

The resolution cites concerns about the emission of toxic chemicals and pollutants and would urge the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and any other relevant regulatory agencies to deny permits or other approvals for the proposed facility.

The second resolution would oppose new PPL transmission lines through Nescopeck, Black Creek, Sugarloaf and Hazle townships. PPL said that project will provide additional power and support existing and future load growth.

“Numerous residents, property owners and community organizations have expressed deep concerns regarding potential negative impacts on property values, community aesthetics, the environment and public health,” the proposed resolution said.

The resolution would urge PPL and regulatory agencies to pursue alternative routes or solutions and perform environmental and health impact assessments.

Tuesday’s committee meeting is at 6 p.m. in the county courthouse on River Street in Wilkes-Barre.

Instructions to attend remotely will be posted under council’s online meetings section at luzernecounty.org.

Councilman Jimmy Sabatino chairs the infrastructure committee, and Harry Haas is vice chair. The other members are Patty Krushnowski and LeeAnn McDermott.

Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, accused Republicans on Friday of wanting to ""bury their constituents"" after the deadly Texas floods by rolling back ways to combat climate change.

She specifically called out the Trump administration and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem for what she claimed was a delayed response to the flash flooding that devastated parts of central Texas over the Fourth of July weekend.

She went on to blame the Republican Party for voting on the ""big, ugly bill"" to effectively begin ""clawing back"" on ways to help combat climate change and prevent similar disasters.

""The reality is that we are going to continue to face emergencies, especially since as we just got done with the big, ugly bill, they are clawing back those things that would have hopefully started to cool this planet down, because they don’t believe in science,"" Crockett said on MSNBC’s ""The Weeknight."" ""The least that they could do is believe in helping American people. Unfortunately, we continue to see Republicans decide that they want to bury their constituents instead of actually doing everything that they can to make sure that they live amazing and full lives.""

More than 120 people were killed in the flash flooding with dozens reported missing.

Since last week, several Democratic figures have been quick to politicize the floods by blaming climate change and President Donald Trump’s government cuts to the National Weather Service (NWS) for exacerbating the damage.

$7,500 tax credit set to run out soon

While EVs are generally cheaper to run than their gas-powered counterparts, they tend to come with a higher upfront cost.

In the US, in a bid to get more folks to make the switch, the United States introduced an attractive tax credit of $7,500 for new US-made electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for used EVs.

However, the tax credit is set to be scrapped after the introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act, dubbed the Big Beautiful Bill by President Donald Trump.

All federal EV tax incentives will end after September 30, 2025.

The bill was passed by Congress on July 3, and means all federal tax incentives will end on September 30.

As a result, car experts are sending out a clear message to US motorists who are considering getting an electric vehicle.

“Now is the time to buy,” director of industry insights at Cox Automotive Stephanie Valdez Streaty told CNBC.

She also suggested that we might see dealers offering better savings to create a sense of urgency with the $7,500 tax credit set to run out.

Things to watch out for if you’re buying a new EV

With the $7,500 tax credit set to run out in just three months, some experts have predicted a surge in new EV purchases.

But there are some things to look out for, the tax credit only applies to new vehicles, trucks, vans, and SUVs priced under $80,000 for trucks, and under $55,000 for all other cars.

If you’re hoping to get a used car to claim up to $4,000 in tax credit, it will need to be at least two years old and cost $25,000 or under.

The vehicle itself also needs to meet some requirements, including having a battery capacity of at least seven kilowatt hours and undergoing final assembly in North America.

“That’s really unchanged.” Greylock is targeting a three- to five-well program, which isn’t a ton of wells, he said.","You need to be scrappy to survive as a private producer on the small side of the spectrum. But if you can keep that grit, hold the line on cost and set a sharp eye on the competition, you can spot the opportunities.

“That’s the fun part, but it’s certainly a challenge,” Greylock Energy CEO Kyle Mork told Hart Energy.

Greylock has grown the company by expanding in multiple directions: acquisitions, the drill bit and diversification.

Much of its leadership team worked together originally at Energy Corp. of America. In 2017, the Greylock team coalesced with backing from Boston-based private equity firm Arclight Capital and some 3,500 conventional wells in Appalachia, which the company still operates.

The next step was taking a position in Greene County, Pennsylvania, with unconventional acreage in the dry gas Marcellus play, and also some midstream assets.

“In the first several years of Greylock, we were really about growing via the drill bit in the Marcellus position in Greene County,” Mork said.

“The entire time we’ve existed, we’ve looked at opportunities to acquire new assets. Initially, we were primarily focused on other Appalachian assets and then as time went on, we started looking at other basins. In 2022, we closed a big deal to buy assets in the Rockies in both Utah and Wyoming from a public producer.”

That deal allowed Greylock “to really take an asset that was very non-core for the seller and [create] very much a core asset for us. We’ve increased production without drilling any new wells—just being able to get a lot of wells back online and working over wells.

“We’ve continued to develop, drill new wells and bring wells online in the east and are preparing for our first new activity in the Rockies in the next 12 months or so.”

Standing out

On a production basis, Greylock’s footprint is two-thirds in Appalachia and one-third in the Rockies. But two key aspects set it apart, Mork said.

Augmenting its upstream production is Greylock’s midstream business, which builds out projects for third parties.

“We’re starting to see a lot of traction and get deals done with what we call ‘demand-driven’ projects. For instance, we have two projects with a big steel producer here in Appalachia that consumes a good amount of gas as a part of the process, so we built pipelines for them. And we’re talking to data centers, like everyone else on Earth, and other big consumers of gas on the midstream side,” Mork said.

Next is the technical team in place that packs a one-two punch of expertise: the firm can develop, drill, complete and bring online new unconventional resources in multiple places, as well as workover conventional assets and optimize them.

“We’re comfortable with both operating and producing fairly complex producing assets and also doing the latest and greatest unconventional development,” he said.

Expanding development

Greylock is always looking for its next add-on, Mork said. In any given year, the firm is examining different packages and bidding on assets.

“As we think about the next 12 to 24 months, I think we will be looking to expand development in our Utica play, potentially a little more in the Marcellus and then definitely, get our first development activity going in the Rockies, but we will also be looking for outside opportunities.

“We’re pretty basin agnostic. We want to look at everything that comes to market in Appalachia and in the Western Rockies as well, but we’re open to other basins and we’ve looked at assets in a lot of other basins as well.”

The firm’s entrance into the Rockies wasn’t necessarily premeditated, he said.

“We just really liked the asset as we started to look at it and thought there were some unique things about being in that basin with their gas pricing, and we picked up some liquids with it.

“But yes, we will definitely be looking at potential acquisitions this year.”

Rocking the resource

Greylock is a gas-weighted producer, a position that is coming into its own this year as Henry Hub prices have shown stability while crude oil is rocked by market volatility, tariffs and trade turmoil. A drop in Henry Hub prices below $3/MMBtu—or a pop above $5, for that matter—might trigger a reconsideration of activity levels. As such, the firm hasn’t needed to revisit its guidance, a step many of its peers took during the first quarter.

“Our real focus in the second half of the year is our next batch of wells in our Utica position in northern Pennsylvania,” Mork said. “That’s really unchanged.”

Greylock is targeting a three- to five-well program, which isn’t a ton of wells, he said. But drilling deep, 10,000-plus ft laterals in the Utica is an expensive proposition that also promises significant volume. Year-over-year production growth by the end of 2025 could be as much as 15%, he said. Production growth is in a 10% to 15% year-over-year range.

“For us, turning in three, four, five wells a year, we can achieve steady growth with respect to new wells and total company production,” he said. “Like a lot of producers now, we’re not looking to grow dramatically and outspend cash flow to do so. We’re really looking to grow at a steady pace and be able to do it within our existing cashflow.”",https://www.hartenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/image/2025/07/drilling-site-2.jpg?itok=SpmD7yAS,N,,2025-07-13 21:04:08.911721

Under President Donald Trump’s new tax-cut law, many people for the first time also could claim a tax deduction for interest on their vehicle loans.

The new tax break will be available even to people who don't itemize deductions. But there are some caveats that could limit its reach. The vehicles must be new, not used. They must be assembled in the U.S. And the loans must be issued no sooner than this year, to list just a few qualifications.

Here are some things to know about the new auto loan interest tax deduction:

Candidate Trump promised an auto loan interest tax break

Trump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and “stimulate massive domestic auto production.”

The idea made it into the big tax-cut bill passed by Congress, which Trump signed into law July 4.

The law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of interest payments annually on loans for new American-made vehicles from 2025 through 2028. It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles. But it only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes.

The tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns. But the deduction phases out for individuals with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 or joint taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000. Those earning more cannot claim the tax break.

Millions of buyers could benefit, but millions of others will not

U.S. automobile dealers sold 15.9 million new light vehicles last year, a little over half of which were assembled in the U.S, according to Cox Automotive. It says around 60% of retail sales are financed with loans.

After excluding fleet and commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, an estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year, if purchasing patterns stay the same, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.

It's the assembly plant, not the automaker's headquarters that matters

The tax break applies to vehicles assembled in the U.S., no matter where the company making them is headquartered. All Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. are assembled in this country. But so are all Acura brands, the luxury model of Japanese automaker Honda.

Last year, 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled in this country, according to Cox Automotive. But customers wanting the tax break will need to pay attention to specific models. While the Ford Mustang is assembled in Michigan, the Mustang Mach-E is built in Mexico.

General Motors assembles all of its Cadillacs in the U.S. But just 44% of its Chevrolets sold last year were assembled in the U.S., and just 14% of Buicks, according to Cox Automotive. That's a lower U.S-assembled rate than Honda (60%), Toyota (52%) and Nissan (48%), which all are headquartered in Japan.

Taxpayers could save hundreds of dollars a year

The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year, because interest payments on loans are frontloaded while principal payments grow on the back end.

At a 9.3% interest rate, an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said. The tax savings would be less on a loan at 6.5%, which is the rate figured into calculations by the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.

Some people also could see a reduction in state income taxes

Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction.

On a tax form, the auto loan deduction will come before the calculation of a taxpayer's adjusted gross income. That's an important distinction, because many states use a taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for figuring their state income taxes. If that income figure is lower, it could reduce the state taxes owed.

The verdict is out on whether the tax break will boost sales

At Bowen Scarff Ford in Kent, Washington, customers started asking about the auto loan tax deduction before Congress had even taken a final vote on the tax-cut bill, said General Manager Paul Ray. So he decided to promote it on the dealer's website.

A website ribbon exclaims: “CAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE"" while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump's tax-cut law.

“I think it’s going to help incentivize vehicle purchases through this year,"" Ray said.

Celia Winslow, president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, concurred: “For some people deciding — should I buy it, should I not — this could be something that tips the scale.”

Others remain skeptical. According to Smoke's math, the average annual tax savings is smaller than a single month's loan payment for a new vehicle.

“I don’t think it moves the needle on somebody on the fence of buying a new vehicle or not,"" Smoke said. ""But I think it could influence their decision to finance that vehicle instead of paying cash or instead of leasing a vehicle.”",https://media.wwltv.com/assets/CCT/images/a6a388c0-ada9-4a53-839f-b3b128752c26/20250713T211918/a6a388c0-ada9-4a53-839f-b3b128752c26_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 20:09:54.123788

Since the oil crises of the 1970s, many more countries have installed policies and emergency response measures that can buffer the impacts of potential supply disruptions, while also taking steps to diversify their energy mixes and improve energy efficiency. At the same time, the world’s energy system has grown increasingly complex and interconnected – calling for an expanded set of policy tools and updated approach to emergency preparedness, as discussed at the Summit on the Future of Energy Security in April 2025.

The IEA’s Global Energy Policies Hub, first released in October 2024 and reviewed annually by IEA Members, provides a snapshot of the current state of energy policies around the world. Its latest update, published this week, features over 5 000 records for over 84 countries that collectively represent about 90% of global energy demand. This presents an opportunity to explore how the world has progressed since the IEA was founded in 1974, and to assess whether it is in a better place to withstand shocks to energy supply chains. It also allows for an assessment of the new policies countries are adopting to manage emerging risks – from cyber threats to climate resilience and the security of clean energy supply chains.

Virtually all oil importers are now buffered by oil security measures advocated by the IEA

Over the past 50 years, significant strides have been made in implementing key emergency response measures to respond to oil supply disruptions. Prior to the first oil crisis in 1973, only a small number of countries – representing fewer than 1% of net oil imports – had emergency measures in place (such as Morocco’s 1971 Law on Security Stocks). The International Energy Programme, the IEA’s founding document, introduced a binding requirement in 1974 for Member countries to maintain oil reserves equivalent to 90 days of net imports, alongside measures to restrain demand and promote greater energy efficiency, diversification and innovation. As a result, by 1975, the coverage of emergency reserves and demand-restraint policies expanded to about 10 countries representing about 35% of global net imports.

Additional policies were implemented in response to the oil market shocks prompted by the Gulf War in 1991, the Libyan Civil War in 2011, and Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Since 1991, 40 additional countries have adopted oil stockholding requirements and measures to help restrain demand in case of an emergency. Now, countries with at least one or more oil security measure cover 98% of net oil imports, with emergency oil stock requirements present in 61 countries (42 of which are net importers).

Natural gas security measures have proliferated over the past decade

Historically, natural gas security measures have been less common. However, the past 10 years have prompted a strong uptick in adoption – specifically in terms of stockholding requirements, which grew from covering only 11% of net gas imports in 2015 to 32% in 2025. Thirteen countries enacted or enhanced stockholding policies following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Notably, the European Union (EU) implemented gas stockpiling requirements – which set obligations for member states to fill storage facilities to at least 90% of their capacity by November each year – and Japan established a Strategic Buffer LNG (SBL) framework, with LNG cargoes readily available in case of supply emergencies. However, gas stockpiling remains limited outside of IEA Member countries; only Chinese Taipei, Thailand, South Africa and Ukraine have mandates for strategic gas stocks. This leaves around 98% of natural gas demand in emerging and developing economies uncovered by stockpiling requirements.

Demand-restraint measures for gas have become increasingly common since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as well. Over 40 countries that are net importers of gas now have legislation in place to implement such measures, with 25 introducing them within the past 10 years, including most EU and Balkan countries. These measures again remain limited in emerging and developing economies, with only 12 countries – including Bangladesh, India and Pakistan – incorporating explicit demand-side measures into legislation.

Efforts to diversify energy supplies and improve efficiency have become fixtures in energy security policy

Beyond emergency measures, governments have also pursued longer-term policy efforts since the 1970s to reduce their exposure to disruptions in energy supply, largely via measures to improve energy efficiency and diversify their energy mixes.

Based on the IEA’s tracking, energy efficiency policies are now in place in about 130 countries. The coverage and stringency of these policies continues to expand; more than 15% of global energy demand has been covered by new or upgraded energy efficiency regulations or incentives in the past four years. Recent policies include the 2024 EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, Australia’s first-ever federal fuel economy standard, updated carbon dioxide (CO2) standards in Mexico and stronger fuel efficiency standards in Saudi Arabia.

As a result of this expanding coverage and increased stringency, the energy efficiency of key equipment, vehicles and appliances sold has improved in all regions since 2010. Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) for appliances are getting tougher globally, the IEA Efficiency Policy Level Index shows. Meanwhile, stricter fuel economy standards have contributed to a more than 20% reduction in the road transport sector’s energy intensity, complementing trends such as increasing electrification and the substitution of other fuels for oil.

Policies aimed at diversifying countries’ energy mixes have also been implemented at an accelerated rate over the past two decades, especially in the power sector. Today, more than three-quarters of global power sector demand is covered by policies aimed at diversifying power generation, relying on measures such as utility obligations, tax credits and other incentives.

In recent years, the largest focus has been placed on renewables and nuclear. Since 2010, around 20 new countries have adopted new policies aimed at expanding renewable energy capacity, bringing the total to over 100 countries as of last year.

These efforts have had an impact. According to the IEA’s Total Energy Supply Diversification Index, in 1973, nearly 70% of today’s 32 IEA Members had what is considered high fuel concentrations in their energy mixes. Today, none remain in this category, following an increase in the shares of natural gas, nuclear power and renewable energy sources to meet their energy needs.

The focus of energy security policies is now expanding to cover critical minerals, cybersecurity and climate resilience

As the global energy system evolves, the definition of energy security is expanding, with governments increasingly considering measures to address risks related to critical minerals, cybersecurity and climate hazards. Policies and measures focused on energy supply chain risks remain less mature, but new frameworks are being adopted in a growing number of countries.

The IEA’s Global Critical Minerals Outlook 2025 highlighted the pivotal role that policy mechanisms can play in diversifying mineral supplies. While public financing support can help bring forward new projects, additional policy tools are needed to reduce investment barriers and provide long-term market signals. In light of the growing number of trade restrictions on critical minerals, strengthening resilience to potential supply disruptions is increasingly important as well.

Though efforts such as the IEA’s Voluntary Critical Minerals Security Programme, the Agency is working with governments to enhance preparedness, promote supply diversification, and foster innovation and recycling. The Critical Minerals Policy Tracker monitors and analyses policy developments on critical minerals across more than 35 countries. With an initial dataset of 200 policies, it now identifies more than 600.

Another recent IEA report, Energy Technology Perspectives 2024, highlights how countries are increasingly pursuing industrial strategies aimed at reducing supply chain risks for clean energy technologies and boosting domestic manufacturing. The EU Net-Zero Industry Act and Japan GX Promotion Strategy, for example, are set to alter the outlook for the manufacturing and trade of key energy products such as electric vehicles and batteries. Still, IEA analysis shows that further efforts are needed globally to ensure the diversification of supply chains for key energy components so they are less vulnerable to shocks.

The cybersecurity of energy infrastructure has also been receiving greater attention in the wake of several notable attacks.

Cybersecurity requirements for energy infrastructure are now in place in 71 countries. However, the frequency and complexity of attacks continues to increase; the IEA special report Energy and AI found that in 2024, a typical energy utility was subject to over 1 500 attempted cyberattacks per week – triple the number only four years earlier. The pace at which cybersecurity attacks grow and evolve will require the constant adaptation of policy frameworks to best respond to new threats – along with the use of technological innovations, such as proactive AI-enabled cybersecurity systems, which could enable quick interventions and responses to attacks.

Natural disasters continue to be among the most routine disruptions to energy systems – and risks to the secure operation of energy infrastructure are becoming more acute as a result of climate change and the increasing complexity of energy systems themselves.

To address these challenges and reduce the fallout from major weather events, natural disaster funds – which insure households and some small and medium enterprises in the case of major capital losses – are now in place in 55 countries.

During the Future of Energy Security Summit, countries asked the IEA to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the impacts of natural hazards on the energy system today and how they might evolve going forward, while identifying the policies and measures that could help address these risks.

The results will be published in a forthcoming report, and future versions of the Global Energy Policies Hub will include an expanded assessment of policies in this category.",,N,,2025-07-13 19:08:27.077860

The Trump administration is defying these principles. President Trump is rolling back longstanding protections using unlawful shortcuts that shortchange the public’s right to provide input and understand how that feedback has shaped federal agency decisions.

Enacted soon after the end of World War II, the Administrative Procedure Act outlines steps that federal agencies must take when they issue or amend regulations, also known as rules. Critically, this process includes soliciting and then responding to significant comments from the public, especially when those rules affect people’s rights and responsibilities under federal law.

The Trump administration has jettisoned this established approach to rescind bedrock legal protections for everyday Americans in the dark of night, with almost no explanation.

President Trump signaled his plan to skirt established processes for rulemaking in a presidential memorandum issued on April 9, “Directing the Repeal of Unlawful Regulations.”

The memorandum accurately recognizes that a federal agency may use an expedited approach under the Administrative Procedure Act if it has “good cause” to find that the usual process would be “impracticable, unnecessary or contrary to the public interest.”

Indeed, the Administrative Conference of the United States has recognized that expedited processes, such as direct final rules, are appropriate in some instances, such as when the proposed rule changes are noncontroversial. It further underscores the importance of public engagement whenever there is truly “good cause” to use an expedited approach.

However, the Trump administration is abusing this process by using expedited processes for changes that are clearly controversial.

For example, in May, the U.S. Department of Energy issued four direct final rules related to nondiscrimination protections in federally assisted programs or activities pertaining to general programs, new construction requirements, nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in education and regarding nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in sports.

This means that entities that receive federal funds from the Department of Energy will not have to provide interpretation and translation services when needed. They will not need to eliminate architectural barriers that make buildings inaccessible, nor will they be prohibited from engaging in activities that perpetuate the effects of discrimination.

These direct final rules are part of a broader rollback of longstanding civil rights protections under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other laws, which Trump previewed in his misguided and deceptively titled executive order on Restoring Equality of Opportunity and Meritocracy.

The Department of Energy’s direct final rules on nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs or activities fail the laugh test under the Administrative Procedure Act. As a comment recently filed with the Department of Energy by more than 40 law professors explains, “The use of direct final rules in these contexts contravenes the clear language of the Administrative Procedure Act, ignores long-established procedures on notice and comment rulemaking, and undermines the role of public participation in government rulemaking.”

Reinforcing this point, another comment filed by nearly 30 civil rights, environmental justice and environmental organizations, together with supporting individuals, underscores how the administration’s approach “violates the procedural mandates of the Administrative Procedure Act and subverts nondiscrimination principles that benefit all Americans.”

In the end, the number of comments the Department of Energy received on its nondiscrimination direct final rules speaks volumes: 19,421 comments regarding nondiscrimination (general provisions), 20,711 comments regarding new construction requirements related to nondiscrimination, 9,293 comments regarding nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in education and 21,264 comments regarding nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in sports.

So what’s the harm in allowing the Department of Energy and other federal agencies in the Trump administration to bypass established procedures? The harm is to all of us — the American public.

According to the Attorney General’s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act from 1947, the law seeks to ensure that federal agencies keep the public informed and engage them in rulemaking through uniform processes that are subject to judicial review. These goals remain as true today as they did nearly 80 years ago.

As the United States commemorates the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution, we must remember our founding principles — that a government by the people and of the people must also be accountable to the people. We cannot let the Trump administration shortchange these goals.

China's long-term strategy of dominating the manufacture of renewable energy and electric vehicles, as well as critical minerals, especially the rare earths needed in modern technology, is now paying off, big time.
This will make it virtually impossible for manufacturers in the US to compete with China in high-tech manufacturing.
The rejection of renewable energy and turning back to coal is pure ideology, a macho rejection of environmentalism and wokeism.
So, it's entirely appropriate that Anthony Albanese is meeting Xi again before he meets Trump for the first time.","A few days after Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill that ended most subsidies for renewable energy, among many other things, the leading artificial intelligence (AI) company, Nvidia Corporation, became the first to pass $US4 trillion ($6.08 trillion) in value.

And a few days after that, on Thursday, Bitcoin hit a new record high above $US117,000.

The data centres that operate both AI and cryptocurrency are already massively increasing electricity demand and investors are obviously expecting them to keep doing so — exponentially.

Meanwhile, the BRICS summit in Brazil last week — it stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa — went in the opposite direction to the United States on climate change, committing to ""intensify global efforts to contain global warming"".

China's renewable energy strategy is paying off

Chinese President Xi Jinping didn't make it to Brazil, but he chaired a meeting of China's Central Commission for Financial and Economic Affairs which issued a directive to crack down on overcapacity and ""disorderly competition"" in solar power.

Let's join the dots: America is pivoting back to fossil fuels and pulling out of renewable energy while the rest of the world continues to do the opposite, China is grappling with too much renewable energy while investors are bidding expectations to record highs for the new industries whose data centres are eating the world's electricity.

In his Independence Day address after signing the One Big Beautiful Bill, Trump said: ""I noticed something — with all the windmills that China sends us, where we waste our money because it's the most expensive energy, you know they make about 95 per cent of them, the wind turbines, I have never seen a wind farm in China! Why is that?""

That is a long way from being true: China is bristling with wind farms, and solar farms.

Mistake number two for Trump is the cost: wind and solar are now the cheapest form of energy in China, as well as in most other places, and onshore wind is by far the cheapest, less than half the cost of coal.

China's long-term strategy of dominating the manufacture of renewable energy and electric vehicles, as well as critical minerals, especially the rare earths needed in modern technology, is now paying off, big time.

'Real men burn stuff'

Meanwhile, in the US, Trump announced a 50 per cent tariff on imports of copper, which is one of the minerals needed for AI and renewable energy.

This will make it virtually impossible for manufacturers in the US to compete with China in high-tech manufacturing.

That was on top of letters Trump sent to dozens of national leaders last week telling them what the tariff is going to be on their exports to America.

Why would America embark on such a series of colossal, and obvious, acts of self-harm?

The rejection of renewable energy and turning back to coal is pure ideology, a macho rejection of environmentalism and wokeism. As Paul Krugman wrote the other day: ""Real men burn stuff and don't worry if the process is dirty.""

In his Independence Day speech, Trump declared: ""Coal is back. You can't use the word 'coal' unless you precede it by saying 'clean beautiful coal.'""

China is also building coal-fired power stations, but only because it has to; the idea of saying ""coal is back"" and calling it clean and beautiful at the same time as more than one hundred people were dying in a Texas flood is insane.

Trump's tariff lie

As for the tariffs, the world's economists and trade policy experts are mystified by America's trade wars, but I don't think that's what they are: tariffs are taxes that Trump can say are paid by foreign countries rather than by Americans.

The letters he sent last week all said: ""We will charge (insert country) a Tariff of only (insert number) on any and all … products sent into the United States.""

That's what he always says when he's talking about the tariffs — that he is ""charging"" that country, as if it's a kind of fee paid to the US government for the right to sell stuff to Americans, and that the US Treasury is making tons of money from them. It is, but not from the other countries.

He knows, of course, as does everyone else, that tariffs are a sales tax paid by the American buyers of the imported products or absorbed into the margins of the local companies importing them if they can't pass it on for some reason.

The US government is ""charging"" the Americans who buy Brazilian products a 50 per cent tax on what they buy, not Brazil, and will be putting a 50 per cent tax on copper, as well as taxes of at least 10 per cent on every import coming into the US.

It is a GST of at least 20 per cent on the $US4.1 trillion of goods imported into the US — 14 per cent of total goods sold.

Before the tariffs are fully in place, the US government is already making about $US30 billion in extra revenue and will theoretically increase to about $US500 billion.

Except that Trump keeps saying that American citizens aren't paying it — someone else is.

It is breathtaking, brilliant, political mendacity; the media, economists and his political opponents are getting tired of pointing it out, and he just keeps saying it, proving Joseph Goebbels's dictum that if you repeat a lie often enough it becomes true.

Xi now more important than Trump

The result of all this is that China — a ruthless autocracy — appears destined to take global leadership from the US, in trade, the means of producing energy and, possibly, in ""soft power"", or moral leadership, as the US withdraws from foreign aid and multilateralism.

The US dollar seems entrenched as the world's reserve currency and the basis of most finance and trade, but even that can't be taken for granted. It won't be replaced by Bitcoin, but a combination of the Euro and Chinese yuan is likely to eat into its market share.

But Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies are not going away, and the data centre capacity they require will continue to add to the ballooning demand for computing power and electricity from AI.

And while the leader in AI chip design, and now the world's most valuable company — Nvidia — is American, its chips are made in Taiwan, just as Apple's iPhones are made in China.

The American technology companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Amazon still reign supreme over the internet and AI era, but China is closing on them fast.

China is already in the process of obliterating the American and European car industries with solid, well-designed, cheaper vehicles and will almost certainly do the same with all other high-tech products, including robots.

So, it's entirely appropriate that Anthony Albanese is meeting Xi again before he meets Trump for the first time.

Investors should: Favor infrastructure plays: Charging networks and tech partners are foundational to the mandate's success.","The push to decarbonize transportation is no longer theoretical—it's regulatory reality. New York City's Green Rides Mandate, which requires all high-volume rideshare trips to use zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) or wheelchair-accessible vehicles by 2030, is a landmark policy with profound implications for ride-sharing giants like Uber and Lyft, EV infrastructure providers, and investors seeking exposure to the clean energy transition.

The mandate's phased targets—starting at 5% ZEV compliance in 2024 and escalating by 10–20 percentage points annually—create a clear timeline for stakeholders. Yet the path to full electrification is fraught with financial, operational, and logistical challenges. For investors, this is both a cautionary tale and an opportunity to identify companies positioned to thrive—or falter—in this transition.

The Cost Burden on Drivers: A Critical Hurdle

While the mandate aims to “electrify without imposing new costs on drivers,” the reality is starkly different. Ride-sharing drivers—who often operate as independent contractors—bear the brunt of upfront EV costs, maintenance, and infrastructure gaps.

High EV Prices and Maintenance: Electric vehicles (EVs) cost $30,000–$130,000, far exceeding the price of comparable gas vehicles. Battery replacements, which can cost up to $10,000 after five years, add to the burden.

Lease Constraints: Many drivers are locked into long-term leases for gas vehicles, with no easy exit to switch to EVs.

Charging Inconveniences: With 80% of NYC drivers lacking home charging access, reliance on public stations is a necessity. Yet fast-charging infrastructure is sparse, and many existing chargers are Tesla-specific or slow Level 2 units.

These challenges could pressure Uber and Lyft to absorb costs or risk losing drivers—and market share—to competitors with better EV support.

Infrastructure Gaps: The Achilles' Heel of Electrification

Even if drivers could afford EVs, the charging network must expand exponentially. The city's goal to install 40,000 Level 2 and 6,000 fast chargers by 2030 is ambitious but faces hurdles:

Geographic Inequity: Manhattan dominates charger availability, while Queens and the Bronx lag behind.

Cost and Complexity: Curbside L2 chargers are unreliable for high-mileage fleets, and private investments (e.g., Revel's superhubs) are still nascent.

Policy Delays: The TLC's delayed release of its FHV License Review report and legal challenges (e.g., the NYC Taxi Workers Alliance's lawsuit) risk further delays.

Without swift progress, the 2030 deadline may be unrealistic, forcing the TLC to revise benchmarks—a risk for investors betting on strict compliance.

Policy Support: A Double-Edged Sword

Federal and state incentives aim to bridge the EV cost gap. Tax credits, rebates, and subsidies could push EVs to price parity with gas vehicles by 2027, but timing is critical. Meanwhile, New York's mandate to sell only ZEVs after 2035 reinforces the long-term shift.

However, policy support is uneven:

Subsidies vs. Realities: While drivers qualify for up to $7,500 in federal tax credits, many lack the liquidity to wait for refunds.

Penalties for Non-Compliance: While undefined in detail, fines for missing annual targets (e.g., $50 per 1,000 underperforming trips) could pressure companies to subsidize drivers or risk penalties.

Investment Plays: Winners and Losers in the Transition

Opportunities in EV Infrastructure

Charging Network Operators:

ChargePoint (CHPT): A leader in public and commercial EV charging, with partnerships across industries.

EVgo: Specializes in fast-charging networks, critical for rideshare drivers needing quick turnaround.

Revel (private): Expanding superhubs in NYC could position it for future listings or acquisitions.

Tech and Software Partners:

Blink Charging (BLNK): Provides hardware and software solutions for fleet electrification.

Smart-charging platforms: Companies like Volta or Electrify America offering grid management tools may gain traction.

Ride-Sharing Stocks: Proceed with Caution

Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT): Both face headwinds. While they've pledged to go all-electric by 2030, their ability to incentivize drivers (via bonuses, discounted leases, or infrastructure partnerships) will determine their competitiveness. Investors should monitor their EV fleet adoption rates and any regulatory fines.

Risk Factor: If infrastructure lags or penalties escalate, costs could squeeze margins.

Equity Plays in EV Manufacturing

Tesla (TSLA): Dominates the luxury EV market, but its lack of rideshare-specific models limits direct exposure.

NIO (NIO) or Rivian (RIVN): Potential for rideshare-focused vehicles, though both face execution risks.

Conclusion: Balance Risk and Reward

New York's Green Rides Mandate is a pivotal test case for urban electrification. Investors should:

Favor infrastructure plays: Charging networks and tech partners are foundational to the mandate's success.

Monitor Uber/Lyft's adaptability: Their ability to support drivers financially and politically will determine long-term viability.

Beware regulatory risks: Delays or penalties could disrupt timelines and investor sentiment.

The path to 2030 is bumpy, but for those positioned to navigate it, the rewards—including cleaner cities and a $200 billion global EV infrastructure market—could be transformative.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-13 19:07:47.533421

Energy Secretary Chris Wright is defending the Trump administration’s decision to eliminate wind and solar subsidies as part of a broader tax cut package, arguing that renewable energy sources actually make electricity more expensive rather than cheaper. Mr. Wright, a former fracking executive, contends that intermittent renewables create costly inefficiencies in the electrical grid system.

The Trump administration’s tax legislation will phase out green energy subsidies by 2026, saving an estimated $500 billion over ten years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.

However, critics warn this will result in job losses, higher energy bills, and reduced grid capacity as renewable energy projects become less economically viable.

Mr. Wright challenges the conventional wisdom that renewable energy reduces costs, pointing to states like California as evidence. He notes that California, which has heavily invested in wind and solar while importing renewable power from neighboring states, has electricity prices twice as high as Florida, which focused on natural gas infrastructure instead.

The energy secretary argues that renewable sources require maintaining essentially two separate electrical grids — one for when renewable sources are producing power and another for backup when they’re not. This dual system forces traditional power plants to operate less efficiently, ramping up and down to accommodate intermittent renewable generation.

Opposition comes from Democrats like Sen. Ron Wyden, who authored many of the renewable tax credits and calls the cuts “an outright massacre.” Clean energy advocates warn that eliminating subsidies will force consumers to pay higher costs for unsubsidized renewable projects or drive utilities back to more expensive fossil fuels.

Mr. Wright specifically praised President Trump’s executive order blocking offshore wind projects along the eastern seaboard, describing offshore wind as among the most expensive energy sources globally. He cited Connecticut as an example where offshore wind was projected to cost nearly $100 per megawatt hour, almost double the cost of the state’s nuclear power plant.

The energy secretary believes the policy changes will encourage states to pivot toward more reliable baseload power sources like natural gas, coal, and nuclear power. He argues this shift will ultimately reduce energy costs by eliminating the inefficiencies created by intermittent renewable sources.

Critics counter that transitioning away from renewables toward natural gas would require years of permitting and construction for new plants, potentially leaving grids short of capacity and consumers facing higher prices during the transition period.

**STATE-BY-STATE FACT SHEET** Republicans Slash Vital Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Funding for States

WASHINGTON — House Appropriations Committee Republicans today released the draft fiscal year 2026 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies funding bill, which will be considered in subcommittee tomorrow. The bill raises costs for American households, undermines infrastructure investments, and weakens our national security.

For 2026, the Energy and Water bill provides $57.3 billion in discretionary funding. Within that amount, the bill provides $24.1 billion for nondefense programs, a cut of over $675 million, or 2.7 percent, below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level, and $33.2 billion for defense programs, a cut of $91 million, or 0.3 percent, below the fiscal year 2025 enacted level.

The legislation:

Increases energy costs, jeopardizes energy independence, and hurts United States’ competitiveness by slashing the Department of Energy’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy programs nearly in half, revoking more than $5 billion from the Department of Energy’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law resources, and eliminating funding for the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations.

Weakens national security and leaves Americans more vulnerable to nuclear threats by cutting the National Nuclear Security Administration’s Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation account by 17 percent.

Abandons commitments to communities to clean up radioactive waste by eliminating funding for the Corps of Engineers’ Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program and cutting the Department of Energy’s Office of Environmental Management by 9 percent.

“House Republicans have once again produced a reckless and short-sighted proposal that betrays working families and undermines America’s future.

It also weakens vital nuclear nonproliferation programs that help keep our country and allies safe. By turning their backs on communities still suffering from the legacy of our early atomic weapons programs, Republicans show how little regard they have for America’s promises. We must invest in our energy independence in perpetuity — not abandon it. I strongly oppose this bill and will continue fighting for policies that uplift our communities and secure our energy future for all the generations to come.”

“Once again, instead of working to find ways to address the cost-of-living crisis, House Republicans introduced a bill that would make the problem worse,” Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro (D-CT-03) said. “Middle class, working class, and vulnerable Americans continue to struggle to pay their bills, but House Republicans’ 2026 Energy and Water funding proposal slashes resources for programs that lower energy costs for families and businesses and eliminates resources that provide clean, affordable, secure energy to households. While President Trump continues to inflame tensions with our adversaries, House Republicans' bill would leave our country more vulnerable to nuclear threats and yield American leadership of the world’s energy future to China. With this bill, Republicans are failing to confront the climate crisis and putting tens of thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs at risk. This legislation is an attack on the country’s energy future.

Under President Donald Trump’s new tax-cut law, many people for the first time also could claim a tax deduction for interest on their vehicle loans.

The new tax break will be available even to people who don't itemize deductions. But there are some caveats that could limit its reach. The vehicles must be new, not used. They must be assembled in the U.S. And the loans must be issued no sooner than this year, to list just a few qualifications.

Here are some things to know about the new auto loan interest tax deduction:

Candidate Trump promised an auto loan interest tax break

Trump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and “stimulate massive domestic auto production.”

The idea made it into the big tax-cut bill passed by Congress, which Trump signed into law July 4.

The law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of interest payments annually on loans for new American-made vehicles from 2025 through 2028. It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles. But it only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes.

The tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns. But the deduction phases out for individuals with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 or joint taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000. Those earning more cannot claim the tax break.

Millions of buyers could benefit, but millions of others will not

U.S. automobile dealers sold 15.9 million new light vehicles last year, a little over half of which were assembled in the U.S, according to Cox Automotive. It says around 60% of retail sales are financed with loans.

After excluding fleet and commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, an estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year, if purchasing patterns stay the same, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.

It's the assembly plant, not the automaker's headquarters that matters

The tax break applies to vehicles assembled in the U.S., no matter where the company making them is headquartered. All Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. are assembled in this country. But so are all Acura brands, the luxury model of Japanese automaker Honda.

Last year, 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled in this country, according to Cox Automotive. But customers wanting the tax break will need to pay attention to specific models. While the Ford Mustang is assembled in Michigan, the Mustang Mach-E is built in Mexico.

General Motors assembles all of its Cadillacs in the U.S. But just 44% of its Chevrolets sold last year were assembled in the U.S., and just 14% of Buicks, according to Cox Automotive. That's a lower U.S-assembled rate than Honda (60%), Toyota (52%) and Nissan (48%), which all are headquartered in Japan.

Taxpayers could save hundreds of dollars a year

The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year, because interest payments on loans are frontloaded while principal payments grow on the back end.

At a 9.3% interest rate, an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said. The tax savings would be less on a loan at 6.5%, which is the rate figured into calculations by the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.

Some people also could see a reduction in state income taxes

Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction.

On a tax form, the auto loan deduction will come before the calculation of a taxpayer's adjusted gross income. That's an important distinction, because many states use a taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for figuring their state income taxes. If that income figure is lower, it could reduce the state taxes owed.

The verdict is out on whether the tax break will boost sales

At Bowen Scarff Ford in Kent, Washington, customers started asking about the auto loan tax deduction before Congress had even taken a final vote on the tax-cut bill, said General Manager Paul Ray. So he decided to promote it on the dealer's website.

A website ribbon exclaims: “CAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE"" while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump's tax-cut law.

“I think it’s going to help incentivize vehicle purchases through this year,"" Ray said.

Celia Winslow, president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, concurred: “For some people deciding — should I buy it, should I not — this could be something that tips the scale.”

Others remain skeptical. According to Smoke's math, the average annual tax savings is smaller than a single month's loan payment for a new vehicle.

“I don’t think it moves the needle on somebody on the fence of buying a new vehicle or not,"" Smoke said. ""But I think it could influence their decision to finance that vehicle instead of paying cash or instead of leasing a vehicle.”",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/CCT/images/a6a388c0-ada9-4a53-839f-b3b128752c26/20250713T211918/a6a388c0-ada9-4a53-839f-b3b128752c26_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 22:06:14.595732

“A couple of floors have already been leased to our partners from Europe who are coming over,” Darling said.
County Commissioners voted in early 2024 to begin negotiations with the company to purchase the 63-acre SunRail site for the Green Garden Village campus.
The expansion site for phase 2, south of the Falcon Trace II apartments, will initially be developed as a large pond for floodplain mitigation.
Darling said the stormwater pond in the northeast corner of the site will then be expanded in phase 2.","French green energy company CMG CleanTech is on track to break ground this November on its long-awaited $500 million Green Garden Village campus at the Poinciana SunRail Station site.

CEO John Darling told GrowthSpotter the first phase will include the first factory, a data center, and a 6-story office building that will serve as corporate headquarters for the company’s U.S. affiliate, Panacea Global Energy.

“A couple of floors have already been leased to our partners from Europe who are coming over,” Darling said. Panacea recently named Craig Miller as chief financial officer, and he’s currently assembling his executive staff. “We’re not bringing anybody from outside the United States. I want to build the whole thing as an American team.”

The 50,000-square-foot factory will be the first of seven manufacturing facilities planned for the campus, and the only one the first phase. It will produce solar-assisted heat pump water heaters. Darling said he believes there will still be a market for the company’s clean energy products despite the recent passage of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which eliminates incentives and tax credits for solar panels and related products.

“It hasn’t altered our business strategy,” Darling said. “The reason why it hasn’t altered it is because people will always buy a product that can deliver them lower-cost energies. The issue within the market is there are products out, but they’re very expensive, and so the investment is too long.”

Darling said the company has already sold about 22,000 solar-assisted heat pumps in the U.S. “That product is a real jewel in the crown of the suite of products that we have in the business,” he said.

The 100,000-square-foot data center will be designed to be as carbon-neutral as possible. Darling said Duke Energy has signed on to build a 10-megawatt substation, and Panacea will install a solar film system on the roof, combined with hydrogen fuel cells and battery storage to reduce the energy demand by 25 megawatts.

“The data center will be run as green as we possibly can,” Darling said. The user will be a “national company” and global leader, he said, but he couldn’t reveal the name because he signed a non-disclosure agreement.

Darling said the Phase 1 buildings should be completed in 2027. The entire campus will be constructed using RENCO building blocks. The development team consists of Turner Construction, construction manager; Little Diversified, architecture; and KPM Franklin, civil engineers.

A 20,000-square-foot welcome center will be constructed just north of the SunRail station. The first floor will function as a product showroom, while the second floor will be an educational center for employee training. The first phase is expected to generate about 250 jobs.

The site plan, which was submitted to the county last week, also shows a pair of mixed-use buildings that will have a state-of-the-art wellness center and gym on the first floor and 80 residential units on the upper floors.

The final component of Phase 1 is a soccer pitch with men’s and women’s locker rooms and stadium seating for about 2,500. The company is recruiting coaches and trainers from Europe to help establish a full academy.

“It’s going to have a British pub-style restaurant in there, as well,” Darling said. “But we are going to be actively looking within the local community for different soccer clubs that want to get involved with us.”

CMG Clean Tech has been working with Osceola County since 2023, when it first submitted a bid to purchase county-owned property next to Valencia College’s Poinciana campus. The company later shifted its focus to the Poinciana SunRail property due to intense opposition because of its location close to residential neighborhoods and fears about the safety of the proposed hydrogen plant.

County Commissioners voted in early 2024 to begin negotiations with the company to purchase the 63-acre SunRail site for the Green Garden Village campus. County Manager Don Fisher told GrowthSpotter the company has met all of the benchmarks set in the memorandum of understanding.

“They’re on schedule, and they did meet that deadline,” Fisher said. “So I gave them a little bit more time to respond to some of the questions that we had. But they’re in a good spot right now.”

Darling said the design team has been working with FEMA, the South Florida Water Management District, and Osceola County for about 14 months to create a site plan that meets the environmental standards without having to reduce the scope of the project, which still aims to create 1,200 high-paying jobs. The solution was to split the project into two phases.

The expansion site for phase 2, south of the Falcon Trace II apartments, will initially be developed as a large pond for floodplain mitigation. Darling said the stormwater pond in the northeast corner of the site will then be expanded in phase 2.

“And then that will allow us then to use the area to the west for six more industrial buildings,” he said. Those factories will produce next-generation solar film products, solar panels, hydrogen fuel cells, lithium batteries and EV charging systems.",https://www.growthspotter.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2020/07/30/FN7LZ5LBQNCHTBKDBURYVXHXKM.jpg?w=1024&h=670,N,,2025-07-13 19:08:32.818899
,Detroit Environment,2025-07-13 21:03:50+00:00,Detroit Free Press,Michigan under air quality alert through all of Monday - Detroit Free Press,"Amy Huschka, Kristi Tanner",,,,,https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2025/07/13/michigan-air-quality-alert-canadian-wildfires/85094809007/,"The entire state of Michigan is under an air quality alert now through all of Monday, July 14.

The shaded areas of the map show the approximate boundaries where air quality is available and listed as anything other than good.
Air Quality Index guidelines (ozone and particle pollution) Some people are more sensitive to air pollution because of their age or health.
People who are active or work outdoors are also at higher risk when the air quality is poor.","The entire state of Michigan is under an air quality alert now through all of Monday, July 14.

Elevated levels of fine particulate (PM2.5) due to residual wildfire smoke from Canada is causing the alert, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said on X.

The smoke will continue to move into Michigan on Sunday across the Upper Peninsula and the northern portion of the Lower Peninsula, the NWS says. It is expected to track east and south, expanding to the rest of Michigan as the day goes on and additional smoke is expected Monday.

""Pollutants across the state are expected to reach the Unhealthy (Red AQI) to USG (Orange AQI) range in northern locations, with ranges of USG to Moderate further south,"" NWS says.

Photos provided Sunday, July 13, by the Mackinac Bridge Authority show the Mighty Mac disappearing into the smoke from the wildfires.

The NWS recommends avoiding strenuous outdoor activities when possible, especially for people with heart disease and respiratory diseases like asthma.

Individuals should monitor for symptoms, including wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, dizziness or burning in the nose, throat or eyes.

It's recommended to reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air pollution, such as outdoor burning or use of residential wood burning devices. Avoiding activities that can lead to ozone formation like refueling vehicles or topping off when refueling, using gasoline powered lawn equipment and using charcoal lighter fluid is advised.

Although Michigan's ozone season generally runs between the warmer months of March and October, particle pollution from sources like power plants, vehicle emissions and industry can reach unhealthy levels year-round. Some of these pollutants are so small, PM2.5, they can be inhaled into your lungs and can even enter your bloodstream with serious health consequences. Other sources of particle pollution include unpaved roads, construction sites and wildfire smoke.

Michigan's current air quality

The map below displays the current air quality at monitoring sites in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Air monitoring sites are color-coded based on the pollutant (ozone or particulate matter) with the highest value. Particles that are less than 10 micrometers and 2.5 micrometers in diameter are called PM10 and PM2.5, respectively.

An AQI of 50 or below means the current air quality is good. The shaded areas of the map show the approximate boundaries where air quality is available and listed as anything other than good. The information is updated hourly.

Air Quality Index guidelines (ozone and particle pollution)

Some people are more sensitive to air pollution because of their age or health. People who are active or work outdoors are also at higher risk when the air quality is poor. Health concerns related to poor air quality may include difficulty breathing, coughing or wheezing and more serious health effects such as lung damage, asthma attacks, heart attacks and stroke.

Here's how to interpret the Air Quality Index values, according to the U.S. EPA:

Good (0-50): The level of pollution in the air is of little to no risk.

Moderate (51-100): For people who are unusually sensitive to air pollution, a moderate health concern may exist.

Unhealthy for sensitive groups (101-150): People who are more sensitive to air pollution may experience health effects. The general public is not likely to be affected.

Unhealthy (151-200): Some people may begin to experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects.

Very unhealthy (201-300): An alert is triggered; the general population is at risk for more serious health effects.

Hazardous (301-500): Emergency conditions health alert: Everyone is likely to be affected.

Economic and public health impacts are also affected by using coal such as increased healthcare costs due to respiratory illnesses and other health issues caused by air pollution. These health issues also result in lost productivity and higher healthcare expenditures. More jobs can be created by switching to renewable energy and will give communities like Estevan and Coronach, they say, real opportunities for the future.

The coalition says Saskatchewan must move forward with policies that ensure healthy communities, economic reconciliation, clean air, a stable climate, and sustainable jobs for generations to come.

The coalition is calling for:

-An immediate halt to the coal fleet rebuild

-Compliance with Canada’s 2030 coal phase-out mandate

-A just transition strategy for coal-dependent communities such as Estevan and Coronach

-Major public investment in renewables, storage, energy efficiency, and grid modernization

-Respect for Indigenous rights and clean energy partnerships with Indigenous communities and governments, particularly given the disproportionate impact of pollution and climate disasters on Indigenous and rural communities.

Guinness World Record Lucid Grand Longest EV Drive

Lucid Group has set a new GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS title after its Lucid Air Grand Touring drove 1,205 kilometers (approximately 749 miles) on a single charge, surpassing the previous record by 160 kilometers. The journey, from St. Moritz, Switzerland to Munich, Germany, showcased Lucid’s advanced electric powertrain and efficiency, reaffirming its leadership in EV range and performance.

Global Light-Duty Market Drive to Electrification

A new report from Guidehouse Research forecasts a major shift in the global light-duty vehicle (LDV) market, with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) leading the transition. In 2024, BEVs are expected to account for 15% of global LDV sales, but that figure is projected to rise dramatically to 53% by 2033—representing a compound annual growth rate of 16%. Meanwhile, traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles will see a steep decline from nearly 65% of sales in 2024 to just under 20% in 2033. The report highlights this shift as part of a broader global effort toward decarbonization and sustainable transportation.

Despite growing momentum, the transition to full electrification faces significant hurdles. Charging infrastructure remains a critical barrier in many regions, and some governments have slowed climate-related initiatives, prompting automakers to scale back earlier commitments. In addition, political and economic uncertainty—especially in the wake of the 2024 U.S. presidential election—has led to a more cautious investment environment. Still, Guidehouse analysts believe that the electrification trend is irreversible, as the combined forces of regulation, innovation, and consumer demand continue to drive growth.

The report, Light Duty Vehicle Electrification, outlines sales projections for various vehicle types, including BEVs, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs), fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), and ICEs. It analyzes how factors like government incentives and lower cost-per-mile will influence market dynamics through 2033. While the road to full electrification may include detours and delays, the report underscores that EVs are poised to dominate the LDV market in the years ahead.

Ford, Michigan Battery Plant “On Track” for Federal Tax Credits

Ford’s $3 billion battery plant in Marshall, Michigan—currently 60% complete—is expected to qualify for federal battery-cell production tax credits under the newly adjusted tax bill. The plant, set to begin production in 2026 and employ around 1,700 workers, had faced eligibility concerns due to its use of technology licensed from China’s CATL. An automakers’ group praised recent policy adjustments that preserve credits while excluding direct foreign ownership.

Panasonic Delays Kansas Battery Plant with Tesla

Panasonic is postponing the full-scale ramp-up of its Kansas EV battery plant, originally planned to reach 30 GWh capacity by March 2027. The delay is linked to cooling Tesla demand, as the plant was primarily built to serve Tesla’s needs. While initial production will continue, the timeline for reaching full capacity remains uncertain.

Automakers Push EV Sales Ahead of $7,500 Tax Credit Expiry

U.S. automakers are stepping up incentives, including offers like free home chargers, as the $7,500 federal EV tax credit is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2025. Industry analysts warn that EV registrations could drop as much as 27% without the credit, prompting companies to fast-track promotions and sales efforts in the coming months.

Tesla Stock Wobbles on Battery and Political Headwinds

Tesla’s stock remains under pressure amid delays in Panasonic’s Kansas battery facility and increasing political controversy surrounding CEO Elon Musk. Although the stock saw a mild rebound, it remains down 2% for the week and 23% for the year. Slowing EV demand, reduced incentives, and an aging product lineup are all contributing to investor uncertainty.

EV Charger Tax Credit Remains but Faces Earlier Expiration

The federal 30% tax credit for residential and commercial EV charger installations—up to $1,000—is still active, but will now expire on June 30, 2026, instead of running through 2032 as originally planned.

Same thing for businesses and utilities.

While many of HR1’s cuts to safety net programs like Medicaid and food assistance won’t kick in until after the 2026 midterm elections congress made sure the elimination of clean energy incentives is immediate.

HR1 rapidly ends federal tax credits that have helped ordinary homeowners (like us, when I installed rooftop solar two years ago) afford clean energy upgrades.

We Installed a Solar Power System at Our House: This is Our Story – AZ Public Health Association

That includes a soon to expire 30% Residential Clean Energy Credit, which helped thousands of Arizonans install solar panels, batteries, and other home efficiency improvements.

That tax credit will be eliminated on December 31, 2025, with no phase-out and no grace period. To qualify for a tax credit systems must be fully installed & connected to the grid before the deadline New Years Day 2026 (not just contracted).

The timeline is even tighter for EVs. The $7,500 new EV tax credit and $4,000 used EV credit both expire on September 30, 2025.

And for businesses and utilities?

The bill strips away the long-term certainty they’d counted on as many businesses, community health centers (like Chiricahua), and utilities made plans to convert to a bigger renewable portfolio. To qualify for the Investment Tax Credit, business and utility projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026, and be connected and in service by the end of 2027.

HR1’s elimination of tax incentives to invest in clean energy will slow down but not end the conversion to renewables as the ROI for clean energy projects is rapidly becoming the least expensive way to boost power generation even without the tax credits. In addition, new solar components in panels that source less and less expensive, improving the ROI.

Note: Tariffs on solar panels from China are also impeding conversion to solar as China is a global leader in production of inexpensive solar panels. Same goes for electric vehicles – which have a 100% tariff imposed on them.

If you’ve been thinking about solar or an EV the time to act is now. With the coming ‘gold rush’ of solar installation that’ll be created by the impending end of the credits, permitting delays, installer backlogs, and supply chain snags… you better get started NOW.

The Republican majority in Congress may have delayed politically sensitive cuts to healthcare and nutrition assistance but they’ve fast-tracked the end of clean energy support.

Castor agreed with the messaging approach, adding that her Tampa-area constituents are already well aware of how climate change is affecting their lives.
Economics over climate Environmental and clean energy groups have largely swung behind the economic message.
One group in the pro-pocketbook crowd, Climate Power, called Republicans’ bill a “National Rate Hike” in a memo last month.
Grounding conversations in how climate change affects pocketbooks — such as rising insurance premiums — also moves people.","Their targets would include the moderate Republicans who spent months urging Congress to preserve the Biden tax breaks because of their projected economic gains for GOP-held districts — only to fold and vote for Trump’s bill anyway. Trump is moving aggressively to enforce the law, ordering agencies to hasten the phase-out of green energy incentives despite a widespread consensus that the U.S. will need to ramp up electricity from all sources to meet the growing power demands of artificial intelligence.

“Democrats now have the high ground of price and Republicans are now the party of electricity shortages,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said in an interview. “We’re just not going to have enough electrons to go around and the prices will go up — and that will be 100 percent because Republicans passed this ridiculous bill.”

Schatz added that Democrats don’t need to lead with their traditional message that clean energy is essential for dealing with climate change. “The people who care about climate are already with us,” he said.

Besides Schatz, Democratic climate leaders aligned on the new messaging include Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Rep. Kathy Castor of Florida. Eleven Democrats said in interviews that an emerging consensus in their party is cohering around a new campaign emphasizing pocketbook issues.

Some of the Democrats’ environmental allies are going all-in on the message. Clean Energy for America, an advocacy group, plans to plaster billboards with ads in seven swing districts attacking Republican House members who “just voted to raise your electricity bill.” Climate Power, a Democratic-aligned strategic communications operation, launched a six-figure national advertisement playing heavily on Fox News contending that the GOP’s policies renege on Trump’s promise to lower prices.

Republicans scoffed at the notion that Democrats will succeed in promoting themselves as energy price populists.

“It’s tough for the Democrats because they’ve made climate their energy priority for decades,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist and former aide to then-Sen. Marco Rubio who is a partner at Firehouse Strategies. “Voters associate liberals with prioritizing climate change over energy affordability.”

Also inconvenient for the Democrats is the fact that oil prices are hovering near four-year lows, GOP strategist Ford O’Connell said. So even if Democrats cling to a message that Republican policies raise energy prices, he said, those price hikes are unlikely to show up in the real world before the midterms.

“That’s just something that Democrats keep saying over and over, but it’s just not going to be true because the argument defies gravity,” O’Connell said.

Blaming Republicans for future energy price increases is “too abstract,” said David Victor, an expert on climate change and energy markets who works as a professor of innovation and public policy at the University of California San Diego. He added that for people who simply believe that green energy is expensive, the Democratic counterargument will be drowned out.

“People don’t believe it,” he said. “All kinds of claims are being made.”

Try, try again

The Democrats’ plans to seize on the energy argument is part of a larger effort to hammer Republicans over projections that the megabill will steer huge tax breaks to the wealthy while kicking millions of poorer Americans off Medicaid.

It also recognizes the new realities of the U.S. energy markets, including the rise of AI data centers and the fact that U.S. power consumption is moving up after almost 20 years of nearly flat demand.

Democrats believe the time is ripe to revive the call to speed the growth of wind and solar power — and bash the Republicans for taking the green power incentives off the table. They also contend that Trump’s law will spike power prices by making renewable electricity more expensive.

“We’re going to need to build assets for a growing grid. Choosing not to build things is fucking stupid,” Rep. Sean Casten (D-Illinois) said.

Castor agreed with the messaging approach, adding that her Tampa-area constituents are already well aware of how climate change is affecting their lives. But when she talks to them about what’s at stake in the Capitol and the White House, she said she focuses on “higher costs, higher electric bills.”

“Bread and butter, kitchen table issues — costs, their electric bills — are not going to see relief from Republicans,” said Castor, who chaired the now-defunct House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis when Democrats controlled the House from 2020 through 2022.

Of course, the jobs-and-prosperity message failed Democrats at the ballot box last year, possibly because the slow rollout of Biden’s $1 trillion-plus in energy, climate and infrastructure spending meant that many of its projected economic gains had not yet appeared. The Biden administration’s gargantuan spending initiatives also played little role in the campaign messaging by his would-be successor, then-Vice President Kamala Harris.

One economic data point in the Democrats’ favor this time: Power bills have increased an average of 9 percent since January, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, giving Democrats a chance to try to tie any utility bill increases to the Republican law.

That upward pressure on prices is likely to accelerate, given that the U.S. doesn’t have enough power supply to meet a nearly 20-percent projected increase in demand during the next five years. And the new Republican budget law raises costs on wind and solar — even though those sources, combined with batteries, accounted for 93 percent of all new power added to the grid last year, according to the EIA.

Republicans have vowed to plug the gap with fossil fuels and nuclear energy. (Trump’s new law includes policies to boost production from those sources, for example by slashing royalties for fossil fuel production on federal land.) But orders for natural gas turbines face a years-long delay. New nuclear energy faces cost challenges and long lead times. And no utility has announced plans to build new coal-fired power plants, which still face an uncertain regulatory environment and stiff competition from other energy sources.

Economics over climate

Environmental and clean energy groups have largely swung behind the economic message.

One group in the pro-pocketbook crowd, Climate Power, called Republicans’ bill a “National Rate Hike” in a memo last month. It cited an analysis by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, a trade group working with data center developers, that said repealing tax credits would raise household power bills $110 annually as early as next year.

But John Marshall, CEO of the Potential Energy Coalition, said the most persuasive way to get people to care about transitioning to clean energy and tackling planet-heating emissions is to talk about climate change more, not less.

On a matter that may be instructive for energy policy, voters prefer positions that encourage more options, not fewer, said Marshall, whose nonpartisan, nonprofit organization conducts research on climate communication. Grounding conversations in how climate change affects pocketbooks — such as rising insurance premiums — also moves people. But talk of future jobs at the national scale sounds too theoretical, he said.

“Climate is not a dirty word,” he said. “The smart play is to talk about the issue, but just talk about it in a slightly different way and make it relevant to different people’s lives.”

During last year’s campaign, supporters of the Democratic policies faced “a continual challenge” in trying to warn that Republican policies would kill future clean energy jobs and investments, said Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor and environmental groups. But he said enough of those jobs have since materialized that it’s possible to hold GOP lawmakers accountable for businesses that close or construction projects that shut down.

“The new thing is we are moving from the abstract and the conceptual to, ‘This is what they did,’” Walsh said.

Democrats’ environmental allies also need to confront the lingering reputation of a “green premium” that leads many people to believe that wind and solar power are expensive, said Holly Burke, spokesperson for the green group Evergreen Action. In fact, wind and solar are cheaper per megawatt-hour than coal, and in many places they’re even competitive with natural gas, the United States’ dominant electricity source.

Those facts give Democrats a potential opening, Burke said.

“In October 2026 I’d be surprised if candidates are messaging on this specific bill, but what they will be messaging on is the impacts,” she said. “Your utility bill is your utility bill. Folks know Trump ran on lowering electricity costs and that Republicans are in charge.”",https://static.politico.com/ca/98/55a752c742cba72557a37fe4211c/u-s-congress-50654.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 16:08:56.734914

The small Alaskan tribal village sits on permafrost, which is thawing fast as global temperatures rise. That’s left the banks of the Kugkaktlik River unstable — and more likely to collapse when floods hit, as they often do. Buildings, boardwalks, wind turbines and other critical infrastructure are at risk, according to Rayna Paul, the village’s environmental director.

So when the village learned late last year that it had been awarded a $20 million federal grant to protect the riverbank, tribal members breathed a sigh of relief.

But that relief was short-lived. On May 2, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency canceled the grant. Without that help, Paul says, residents may be forced to relocate their village.

“In the future, so much land will be in the river,” Paul says.

Kipnuk’s grant was one of more than 600 that the EPA has canceled since President Donald Trump took office, according to data obtained by Floodlight through a Freedom of Information Act request. Through May 15, the cuts totaled more than $2.7 billion.

Floodlight’s analysis of the data shows:

Environmental justice grants took by far the biggest hit, with more than $2.4 billion in funding wiped out.

The EPA has also canceled more than $120 million in grants aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of cement, concrete and other construction materials. Floodlight reported in April that the cement industry’s carbon emissions rival those of some major countries — and that efforts to decarbonize the industry have lost momentum under the Trump administration.

Blue states bore the brunt. Those states lost nearly $1.6 billion in grant money — or about 57% of the funding cuts.

The single largest grant canceled: A $95 million award to the Research Triangle Institute, a North Carolina-based scientific research organization that had planned to distribute the money to underserved communities. RTI also lost five other EPA grants, totaling more than $36 million.

More cuts could be coming. The Washington Post reported in late April on a court filing that showed the EPA had targeted 781 grants issued under Biden. The data obtained by Floodlight shows the majority of those grants have already been canceled.

Lawsuit challenges grant cancellations

Two weeks ago, a coalition of nonprofits, tribes and local governments sued the EPA, alleging the Trump administration broke the law by canceling environmental and climate justice grants that Congress had already funded.

“Terminating these grant programs caused widespread harm and disruption to on-the-ground projects that reduce pollution, increase community climate resilience and build community capacity to tackle environmental harms,” said Hana Vizcarra, a senior attorney at Earthjustice, one of the nonprofits that filed the lawsuit. “We won’t let this stand.”

The EPA declined to comment on the lawsuit. But in a written response to Floodlight, the agency said this about the grant cancellations:

“The Biden-Harris Administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission. The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

Congress created the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program in 2022 when it enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), President Joe Biden’s landmark climate bill. The program was designed to help the disadvantaged communities that are often hit hardest by pollution and climate change.

But on Jan. 20, Trump’s first day back in office, he signed an executive order halting funding under the IRA, including money for environmental justice, and canceling a Biden-era executive order that prioritized tackling environmental racism. Separately, in his orders on diversity, equity and inclusion, Trump called for the closures of all environmental justice offices and positions in the federal government.

Underserved communities are often the most vulnerable to climate impacts such as heat waves and flooding because they have fewer resources to prepare or recover, according to a 2021 analysis by the EPA.

Inside the agency, not everyone agrees with the new direction. In a “declaration of dissent,” more than 200 current and former EPA employees spoke out against Trump administration policies, including the decision to dismantle the agency’s environmental justice program.

“Canceling environmental justice programs is not cutting waste; it is failing to serve the American people,” they wrote.

On Thursday, the EPA put 139 of the employees who signed the petition on administrative leave, Inside Climate News reported.

From hope to heartbreak in Texas

The people at Downwinders at Risk, a small Texas nonprofit that helps communities harmed by air pollution, thought they were finally getting a break.

Last year, they learned that the EPA had awarded them a $500,000 grant — enough to install nine new air quality monitors in working-class neighborhoods near asphalt shingle plants, a gas well and a fracking operation in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The data would have helped residents avoid the worst air and plan their days around pollution spikes.

But on May 1, the group’s three employees received the news they’d been dreading: Their grant had been canceled.

“It was a very bitter pill to swallow,” said Caleb Roberts, the group’s executive director.

He and his team had devoted more than 100 hours to the application and compliance process.

The nonprofit’s annual budget is just over $250,000, and the federal funding would have allowed the group to expand its reach after years of scraping by. They’d even paused fundraising for six months, confident the federal money was on the way.

“We feel like we’re at ground zero again,” Roberts said. “And that’s just very unfortunate.”

A newly approved transmission line project will add thousands of megawatts (MW) to Minnesota’s energy grid, improving energy reliability and efficiency across the state.

In April, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission approved Xcel Energy’s Minnesota Energy Connection (MEC) transmission project. The project consists of a 174-mile, 345-kilovolt double-circuit high-voltage transmission line and related infrastructure. The MEC project will address the generation gap expected to occur when Xcel’s Sherburne County Generating Station (Sherco), a coal-fired power plant located in Becker, Minnesota, retires in 2030.

The MEC upgrade to the electric transmission system will cost-effectively deliver 2,000 MW of electricity to the Sherco Station and connect over 4,000 MW of renewable energy to the grid.

The MEC and similar projects represent vital improvements to Minnesota's aging transmission infrastructure. The Minnesota Department of Commerce’s 2023 Biennial Transmission Projects Report identified 164 current and anticipated transmission inadequacies — up from 103 in 2021.

Expanding and modernizing the grid is essential to ensuring Minnesotans can access electricity when they need it. Transmission improvements alleviate bottlenecks that have led to curtailment, a process in which energy systems are forced to temporarily halt operation due to a lack of capacity on the transmission lines.

Renewable energy projects provide a valuable source of tax revenue for rural communities, aiding in the funding of local schools, emergency services, infrastructure, and law enforcement. Projects also offer landowners a reliable source of income and create employment opportunities in rural areas. To fully capture these benefits, the state’s transmission grid must be updated to ensure it has capacity to support new, local renewable generation.

Once completed in 2028, the MEC transmission line will carry power from southwest Minnesota to the Sherco site, delivering enough electricity to serve more than 1 million homes across the Upper Midwest.

BEIJING (Reuters) -The world needs China to show more leadership on climate action, EU Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said on Sunday, highlighting the importance of cutting planet-heating emissions and reducing the Chinese economy’s reliance on coal.

Hoekstra is in Beijing for high-level talks with Chinese officials on environmental and climate issues at which he also wants to encourage China to stop building new coal-fired power plants and phase out use of the fossil fuel.

“We do encourage China to take more of a leadership role going forward and really hit the road with meaningful emission reductions in the next couple of years, and also move out of the domain of coal,” Hoekstra told Reuters in an interview.

The number of coal power plants in the pipeline has been increasing in China – the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, according to the World Economic Forum.

In the first three months this year, China’s approved 11.29 gigawatts (GW) of new coal power plants exceeded the approval rate in the first half of 2024, a June report by environmental group Greenpeace showed.

Last week, Hoekstra told the Financial Times the EU was holding off on signing a joint climate declaration with China unless Beijing pledges a greater commitment to reduce emissions.

“We are open to looking into a potential declaration, but … the thing that is most important about these types of statements is the content that goes into it,” he said when asked about the issue, without specifying what commitment the EU hopes to see from China.

Hoekstra said the EU is interested in seeking areas of cooperation with China ahead of the COP30 U.N. climate conference that will be held in Brazil in November.

It will hurt Americans first, particularly those in Republican states. But eventually, we will all pay.

Trump’s goal with the BBB, as it has become known, was not, firstly, to assault the world’s climate. His primary goal was to lock in tax cuts for big business and America’s wealthiest citizens.

To placate the few remaining deficit hawks in Republican congressional ranks, the BBB’s authors had to make at least a pretence of seeking to pay for some of these cuts. They did so first by stripping funding that had been directed to the benefit of America’s poorest citizens.

For example, spending cuts to healthcare and food assistance programs in the bill will average about $US1.2 trillion over the next decade, while new tax cuts for households already making over $US500,000 each year will cost about the same, the Congressional Budget Office shows.

Because this transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich will not even touch the sides when it comes to paying for the BBB, Republicans also hacked into government spending on green technology.

This serves several purposes beyond paying for some of those tax cuts. It satisfies Trump donors in the fossil fuel industry, but more importantly, it undoes the signal achievement of the Biden administration – the Inflation Reduction Act.

The IRA served as both a post-COVID stimulus measure and as the world’s single largest ever investment in fighting climate change, a vast incentive scheme for new green tech in the US. If left in place, the incentive payments and tax cuts were expected to cost $US656 billion and drive around $US2 trillion in private capital expenditure.

Republican “red” states, set to benefit most from the IRA’s largesse, will now be worst hit while the BBB’s assault on the social safety net will disproportionately impact states which backed Trump.

But it will eventually hurt us all because the IRA, had it not been dismantled, would have spared the world around four billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.

Indeed, the total carbon cost of terminating the IRA, supercharging the US fossil fuel industry, and various other Trump executive actions, is now estimated to be around 7 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. Or, as the specialist climate publication CarbonBrief notes, around the total annual output of Indonesia, the world’s sixth-largest carbon emitter.

According to an analysis by Princeton University’s REPEAT project, US emissions are now set to fall by just 3 per cent by 2030, rather than the 40 per cent required should the US have reached its abandoned Paris Agreement target. This is around four per cent of current total global emissions each year.

This is the price we must all pay for Trump’s BBB, in both the incalculable increase in the impact and incidence of climate catastrophes over the coming years, and in the cost of offsetting those lost cuts by increasing the burden on other nations.

That Trump does not care about the global impact of domestic policies is no surprise. But what is harder to fathom is the costs he is willing to heap upon Americans.

Trump’s various climate and energy policies, including those in his BBB and the trashing of the IRA, plus his various executive orders, will see Americans paying more for dirtier sources of energy.

It will see a decrease in clean electricity generation in 2035 by more than 820 terawatt-hours – more than the entire contribution of nuclear or coal to its electricity supply today. It will increase US household and business energy expenditure by US$28 billion annually by 2030 and over $US50 billion by 2035, according to REPEAT.

Average US household energy costs will increase by around $US165 per household per year in 2030.

Even more perversely, the initiatives will lock the US out of competition with China for a share of the technologies of the future beyond wind and solar. The burgeoning EV industry is being crippled not just by a loss of incentives and tax breaks for battery development, but by sanctions on the Chinese components the industry will need in the absence of US alternatives.

“We are in a global competition with China, and it’s not just EVs. And if we lose this, we do not have a future Ford,” Ford’s chief executive Jim Farley said at a conference last month, describing recent visits to China as the “most humbling experience” of his life.

Tellingly, even as Trump abandons the industries of the future with his BBB, he has propped up not just those of the fossil fuel era, but even one that came before. To secure the crucial support of the Alaskan senator Lisa Murkowski Trump found the cash to increase tax deductions for Alaskan subsistence whaling.

Indeed, by the time the bill had been forced through Congress, it had gathered so many tax cuts and pay-offs that it failed to pay for itself. Rather, over the next decade it will add US$2.5 trillion to the already eye-bleeding US debt of $US36.8 trillion.

Climate advocates have been locked in a debate over whether the only way to save the climate would be to destroy the global economy. Over recent years optimists had begun to toy with the notion that perhaps the revolution in green tech over recent years, such as the 90 per cent collapse in the cost of solar power, might just allow us to preserve both.

With his sprawling omnibus bill, a “showcase for fiscal incontinence and ideological exhaustion” in the words of The Economist, it is as though Trump has concluded that with enough effort, both could be destroyed at once.

While criticised by environmentalists, officials claim the recalibration is efficient and climate-conscious.

NEW DELHI: The mandatory retrofitting of coal-fired generation plants with mechanisms to reduce sulphur emission will apply to only units within 10 km of cities with population exceeding 10 lakh instead of all power stations under a 2015 mandate. The revised policy, notified on Saturday, is expected to reduce the cost of power by 25-30 paise per unit, officials and experts involved in the revision of the earlier mandate for installation of FGD (flue gas desulphurisation) units at all power plants said. The new norm lets off the hook 79% of the country’s thermal generation capacity, a fact that environmental activists have used to criticise the revision. But officials argued that the “evidence-based recalibration” makes the policy “focused, efficient and climate-conscious."" For example, they said, under the revised policy, new plants in critically polluted areas or non-attainment cities will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis instead of an omnibus application that would push up the cost of power. The notification justified the revision, saying it is in line with the analysis by the Central Pollution Control Board, which found increased carbon dioxide emissions resulting from the operation of existing control measures. Additionally, studies by IIT-Delhi, CSIR-NEERI and the National Institute of Advanced Studies put ambient sulphur dioxide levels in most parts of the country within the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Power producers have been opposing the blanket FGD mandate for all plants due to the high cost involved. Industry estimates put the cost of installing FGDs at all power plants at Rs 2.5 lakh crore, or Rs 1.2 crore per megawatt. This, industry representatives had said, would jack up tariff for consumers. Additionally, the average timeline of 45 days for each unit was also cited as a threat to grid stability during peak seasons. Differentiated compliance based on proximity to urban populations and the sulphur content of the coal used will ease the burden on power producers, industry executives said. Indian coal typically has a sulphur content of less than 0.5% and due to high stack heights and favourable meteorological conditions, dispersion of SO2 is efficient. Measurements across multiple cities showed sulphur oxide levels ranging between 3 and 20 micrograms per cubic meter, significantly below the NAAQS threshold of 80 micrograms per cubic meter. The officials said studies had also questioned the environmental and economic efficacy of a universal FGD mandate in the Indian context.

The sweeping legislation rolls back critical incentives for solar, wind, electric vehicles, and energy-efficient home improvements. The result: billions in lost investment, tens of thousands of lost jobs, and a rising sense of uncertainty among Arizona energy leaders.

A Devastating Blow: Solar and Wind Incentives Slashed

Immediate Consequences for Arizona Households and Businesses

The bill eliminates a series of federal tax credits that had helped fuel Arizona’s clean energy boom, including:

The 30% federal solar tax credit (worth about $9,000 per average installation)

Incentives for wind energy installations

Credits for purchasing electric vehicles

Home energy-efficiency upgrades

Under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), these credits were originally scheduled to run through 2036. Trump’s budget bill not only ends them prematurely but also authorizes federal agencies to accelerate their removal through executive action.

As a result, Arizona residents and businesses now have only until the end of the year to capitalize on federal incentives for clean energy installations.

$58 Billion in Investment and 69,000 Jobs at Risk

Governor Katie Hobbs, in a letter to lawmakers during the bill’s debate, warned of dire economic consequences. She cited Arizona Commerce Authority figures that estimate the rollback could jeopardize:

$58 billion in planned and potential clean energy investments

69,000 high-paying construction and tech sector jobs

“These are real projects, real workers, and real dollars walking out the door,” said Michael Barrio of Advanced Energy United.

Clean Energy Projects Already Collapsing Across the State

A Wave of Closures and Cancellations

Since the bill’s passage, Arizona has seen multiple clean energy projects halted or cancelled:

Meyer Burger, a solar panel manufacturer, shuttered its Goodyear facility in May.

Nikola, an electric vehicle producer, cut 855 jobs in February.

A $1B battery plant in Buckeye was scrapped, eliminating more than 6,000 anticipated jobs.

A Casa Grande solar and electric boiler project, which would have slashed emissions by 90%, was cancelled after federal funding dried up.

Autumn Johnson, executive director of the Arizona Solar Energy Industries Association, said industry installs are at their lowest levels since COVID. Several companies have gone bankrupt in recent months, and many more are in limbo due to mounting economic uncertainty.

Arizona’s Energy Future in Jeopardy

Climbing Utility Rates and Demand Collide with Policy Rollbacks

Arizona’s largest utility, Arizona Public Service, is proposing a 14% rate hike this year, following multiple increases in recent years. The rising cost of electricity, paired with record-breaking summer heat and population growth, puts additional strain on Arizona families.

Complicating matters further is the rise of AI and data-driven industries, which are dramatically increasing energy demand.

Clean Energy: The Only Scalable, Rapid Solution?

Energy advocates argue that renewables are the only viable short-term option to meet this surging demand. Nuclear power, often touted as an alternative, takes over a decade to build, while other technologies are still in their infancy.

“We have the sunshine and the open land,” said Johnson. “But we’re falling behind states like Texas, which have embraced renewables across party lines.”

Political Gridlock Threatens Local Response

State Lawmakers Divided as Federal Pullback Intensifies

Despite the crisis, local legislative efforts to support clean energy in Arizona have largely failed. The only pro-clean energy bill died in committee, while Governor Hobbs has vetoed several anti-clean energy proposals. The Republican-controlled legislature continues to show little interest in bridging the gap.

Sandy Bahr of the Sierra Club put it bluntly: “I’m not optimistic. This federal bill is damaging, and our legislature is unlikely to act to protect Arizona’s future.”

Autumn Johnson added that while some challenges — like tariffs — are federal issues, state leaders can still step up by supporting in-state development, incentivizing adoption, and offering policy stability.

A Call for State Action: “We Still Hold the Steering Wheel”

Michael Barrio remains hopeful that Arizona can take its energy future into its own hands — if state leaders act quickly.

“Washington tapped the brakes,” he said. “But we can still grab the steering wheel and hit the accelerator. The opportunity hasn’t completely passed us by.”

Conclusion: A Fork in the Road for Arizona’s Clean Energy Future

Arizona stands on the brink of a clean energy collapse, brought on by sweeping federal changes and a lack of local legislative urgency. Yet, the state also holds the tools — abundant sunshine, open land, and a skilled workforce — to lead the renewable revolution.",https://actia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Trumps-Tax-Plan-Cuts-Clean-Energy-Incentives-Putting-Billions-in-Arizona-Investment-at-Risk.webp,N,,2025-07-13 18:11:05.400522

While investing in such projects may seem “plain vanilla” and also increasingly competitive –given the falling prices of solar electricity – these technologies are deemed to be “geopolitically resilient” as they are “scaled opportunities” with a “narrower range of outcomes”, said Temasek’s senior executives.

Solar energy projects combined with energy storage can be deployed faster than conventional forms of energy. It is also becoming one of the cheapest forms of energy around the world, while being inflation-protected and cashflow-generating, said Park Kyung-Ah, chief sustainability officer of Temasek.

“The opportunity sets are very compelling. People probably over-index to a lot of the headlines that keep coming out, whether it’s tariffs on certain clean energy supply chain or whether it’s in the context of pulling out of certain (climate) commitments and so forth. But we have to remember, at the end of the day for the market, the economics are what really matters,” said Park, who was speaking to The Business Times at the recent launch of its 2025 sustainability report.

Even though solar prices are falling across the board, thereby affecting the returns of such investments, Park said that there are ways to make returns by entering some markets earlier, and leveraging some of the development opportunity sets.

“It is becoming more sustainable infrastructure, which is again, more resilient, bigger growth opportunity set and cashflow visibility. And so it’s actually a compelling part of our portfolio construction,” she added.

The dislocation of some renewable energy companies in the public market – due to uncertainty around energy transition globally as the US dialled back on its climate commitments – has also provided the investor with more attractive opportunities, said chief investment officer Rohit Sipahimalani.

For example, Temasek, along with its partner Brookfield, acquired listed French renewable energy company Neoen for US$6.6 billion and took it private in December last year.

The pivot towards renewable energy is part of Temasek’s risk management strategy amid heightened volatility in sustainability investing. Spurred by US President Donald Trump pulling the country out of the Paris Agreement and rolling back some policies incentivising clean energy development, there has been a broader reassessment among governments and corporates on their climate ambition and strategies.

In addition to leaning more towards renewable energy, Park said the Singapore investment company would be “more selective and intentional” when investing in early stage companies.

“So we are doing early stage deals, but where there’s true differentiation and innovation, as well as where we see companies really cementing their competitive differentiation, scaling and go-to market,” she added.

Climate commitments

Despite the scaling back of climate ambition globally, Temasek said that it will stay on course for its net-zero targets.

In 2020, the investor made a commitment to halve its portfolio emissions from its 2010 levels by 2030 – to 11 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, and is also targeting to be net zero by 2050.

For one, while the US might be retreating, Franziska Zimmermann, managing director for sustainability at Temasek, said that the European Union as a collective is still advancing on sustainability, and would likely not be impacted by developments in the US.

Secondly, Park said that delayed climate action will actually result in higher costs further down the road.

In addition, she noted that while policy stability provides investors with confidence in the return profile, Temasek does not make investment decisions with policy dependencies in mind.

“When we do our investment thesis, we want the companies to stand on their legs... There will be bumpiness along the way. And it’s the case with any industry in any market. It’s never a glide path, but the opportunity sets are very compelling,” she added.

The shifting landscape on climate has also meant that Temasek is currently in the process of revising some of its underlying assumptions behind its climate scenarios.

The investor’s current baseline scenario, which projects temperatures to rise by 1.8 degree Celsius by 2100, assumes significant acceleration in climate policy by 2025 with higher upfront transition costs.

The recent policy actions from the US, as well as the latest results from climate science, would now be factored in as part of this review, said Zimmermann.

The portfolio value of Temasek’s sustainability-aligned investments stood at S$46 billion for FY2025, an increase of S$2 billion from S$44 billion in the previous financial year.

However, the investor’s share of sustainability investments – out of its entire portfolio – dipped slightly, accounting for 11 per cent of its net portfolio value of S$434 billion after including institutional assets and liabilities, compared to 12 per cent in the previous year.

The sustainability report also reviewed Temasek’s total portfolio emissions for FY2025, which remained unchanged at 21 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.

This is after the deadline for installing FGD systems, initially slated for 2017, was repeatedly pushed, the Congress general secretary said.
Estimates suggest that anywhere between 12 per cent to 30 per cent of PM2.5 is attributable to such sulphur dioxide compounds, he said.
“The Ministry claims that sulphur dioxide levels in India are largely within the limits of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).
India established stringent sulphur dioxide emission standards for coal-based power plants in December 2015, requiring compliance within two years.","With the government exempting about 78 cent per cent of coal-fired plants from installing key anti-polluting systems, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Sunday said the Environment Ministry’s rationale for the policy is based on “faulty premises”.

He asserted that the government’s policymaking will continue to be driven by “flawed metrics” in the absence of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) revision.

The former environment minister attacked the government after the central government once again extended the deadline for coal-based thermal power plants to comply with sulphur dioxide emission norms and fully exempted those located away from critically polluted areas or cities with a population of over one million.

“The Modi Government has already achieved the dubious distinction of having made India the global leader in sulphur dioxide emissions. Now we learn that the Environment Ministry has exempted 78-89 per cent of India’s thermal power plants from installing flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) systems that cut sulphur dioxide emissions,” Ramesh said in a social media post.

This is after the deadline for installing FGD systems, initially slated for 2017, was repeatedly pushed, the Congress general secretary said.

Sulphur dioxide is a direct threat to public health and has also been known to impact cloud formation, disrupting the monsoon that is the lifeline of the Indian economy, Ramesh said.

“More damagingly, research has increasingly shown that a large part of India’s ambient PM2.5 (fine particulate matter of diameter less than 2.5 mm) is attributable to secondary particulate matter formed when sulphur dioxide reacts with other compounds,” he said.

Estimates suggest that anywhere between 12 per cent to 30 per cent of PM2.5 is attributable to such sulphur dioxide compounds, he said.

“The Ministry’s rationale for this policy is based on two faulty premises. The Ministry had earlier amended the focus of the National Clean Air Program (NCAP) to focus largely on PM10 emissions (particulate matter of less than 10mm diameter).

“PM10 is a lot less dangerous to human health than PM2.5 but is more obviously visible and somewhat easier to tackle, since it includes elements such as road dust.” he said.

By choosing to turn a blind eye towards PM2.5 in its policymaking, the ministry has consigned us to many years more of our ongoing public health crisis – and this decision to tolerate sulphur dioxide compounds is only set to exacerbate this trend, he said.

“The Ministry claims that sulphur dioxide levels in India are largely within the limits of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). As we have repeatedly pointed out, the NAAQS were last updated in 2009, when the prevailing levels of particulate matter and emissions were of a decidedly lower order of magnitude, and when the catastrophic public health consequences of particulate matter were not known, Ramesh said.

A revision of the NAAQS therefore is long due,” he added.

In the absence of such a revision, the ministry’s policymaking will continue to be driven by flawed metrics, Ramesh said.

India established stringent sulphur dioxide emission standards for coal-based power plants in December 2015, requiring compliance within two years.

Even after multiple extensions, 92 per cent of coal-fired power plants have not yet installed flue gas desulphurisation units to control SO2 emissions, a major air pollutant that converts into fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and causes a range of diseases.

In a notification dated July 11, the Environment Ministry said the compliance deadline for Category A plants, located within a 10-km radius of the National Capital Region or cities with a population of over one million, has been extended from December 2024 to December 2027.

Category B plants, situated within a 10-km radius of critically polluted areas or non-attainment cities, will now be assessed on a case-by-case basis instead of adhering to the earlier 2025 deadline.

Category C plants -- all others not falling under Category A or B -- have been completely exempted from the sulphur dioxide norms, provided they meet the prescribed stack height criteria by December 31, 2029. These plants were earlier required to comply by December 2026.

Of around 600 thermal power units in India, 462 are Category C units and 72 are Category B units.

The ministry said it received many representations seeking exemption or relaxation in the timelines of the emission standards due to factors such as the “limited availability of technology providers, its techno-economic feasibility, negative impact of COVID-19 pandemic on supply chain, price escalation due to high demand and low supplies, low SO2 concentration in ambient air and heavy burden on consumer due to increase in electricity prices etc”.",https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 16:09:11.491904

UK Export Finance (UKEF) has stepped in to support the development of a massive offshore wind farm in Taiwan, thereby unlocking new opportunities for British exporters in the fast-growing renewable energy market.

As part of the government’s broader economic growth agenda under the Plan for Change, UKEF is providing a €146 million Buyer Credit Guarantee. This funding will help bring 632 megawatts of clean energy capacity to life in the Taiwan Strait, enough to power hundreds of thousands of homes.

This isn't just about turbines in the water. The deal puts UK firms like Cadeler, CRP Subsea, Ordtek, and Cathie on the map for international contracts. These companies will supply highly specialized services and key components for the project, strengthening the UK’s renewable energy supply chain and creating high-value jobs across the country.

It also reinforces Britain’s ambition to become a true clean energy superpower, an idea that sits at the heart of the country’s modern Industrial Strategy.

Leading the charge is Ørsted, the Danish energy giant that has made one of the most dramatic pivots in the energy sector, moving away from fossil fuels to become one of the world’s most prominent renewable energy developers.

The wind farm is expected to reduce emissions by an estimated 1.1 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent annually. That’s a serious environmental win, not just for Taiwan, but for the planet.

This project isn’t happening in isolation either. It’s part of a global financing effort, with support from other export credit agencies in Denmark, Norway, South Korea, and Taiwan. This collaborative push underscores just how international the clean energy transition is.

Minister for Exports, Gareth Thomas, said:

""This shows how the Government is boosting exports in our key growth sectors and supporting jobs across the country as part of our Plan for Change.""

""This investment will enable British innovation in renewable technology to scale up Taiwan’s clean energy transition and follows our modern Industrial Strategy, which provides up to £13 billion of direct lending for UKEF to help businesses to export.""

Trond Westlie, Group CFO of Ørsted, said:

""We’ve received very strong support from both international and local banks and export credit agencies for the project financing of Greater Changhua 2. This shows that there is a healthy appetite for premium assets with robust contractual structures, and it’s a clear sign that we’re working diligently to deliver on our divestment and partnerships programme.""

Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill has ended the EV handout, much to the dismay of Elon Musk, Ford, and others trying to sell EVs to Americans who have not embraced the technology.

Business Insider reports that the race is on for automakers to sell as many EVs as possible before the $7,500 tax credit, a crucial incentive for buyers, comes to an end on September 30. President Donald Trump’s recently passed Big Beautiful Bill is set to eliminate this subsidy, which has played a significant role in making EVs more attractive to consumers.

In response to the looming deadline, Tesla and Ford are taking proactive measures to capitalize on the last-minute surge in demand. Tesla’s website prominently features a banner warning potential buyers about the expiring tax credit and urging them to take delivery by the end of September. Elon Musk’s EV giant is also reportedly sending out emails to would-be customers, emphasizing the importance of completing their purchases before the deadline to qualify for the $7,500 discount.

Analysts have cautioned that the removal of the tax credit, along with other measures in Trump’s bill targeting handouts for renewable energy, will lead to higher EV prices and significantly impact Tesla’s bottom line. However, Elon Musk has argued that the elimination of these incentives will disproportionately affect the company’s rivals and ultimately boost Tesla’s position in the long run, despite many of its vehicles currently benefiting from the tax credit.

Musk has become a vocal critic of the Big Beautiful Bill, claiming that it will increase the federal deficit and give China an advantage in the clean energy race. He has continually claimed that his rabid opposition of the bill and his personal betrayal of President Trump are not driven by the elimination of subsidies for EVs, but Trump disagrees.

In a post to Truth Social about Musk’s plan to launch a new political party, Trump commented on the Tesla CEO’s love of government money:

The one thing Third Parties are good for is the creation of Complete and Total DISRUPTION & CHAOS, and we have enough of that with the Radical Left Democrats, who have lost their confidence and their minds! Republicans, on the other hand, are a smooth running “machine,” that just passed the biggest Bill of its kind in the History of our Country. It is a Great Bill but, unfortunately for Elon, it eliminates the ridiculous Electric Vehicle (EV) Mandate, which would have forced everyone to buy an Electric Car in a short period of time. I have been strongly opposed to that from the very beginning. People are now allowed to buy whatever they want — Gasoline Powered, Hybrids (which are doing very well), or New Technologies as they come about — No more EV Mandate. I have campaigned on this for two years and, quite honestly, when Elon gave me his total and unquestioned Endorsement, I asked him whether or not he knew that I was going to terminate the EV Mandate — It was in every speech I made, and in every conversation I had. He said he had no problems with that — I was very surprised!

Ford, meanwhile, is also taking steps to encourage buyers to act quickly. The automaker has extended its offer of a complimentary home EV charger and installation from July 8th to September 30th, coinciding with the tax credit’s expiration date. Stacey Ferreira, Ford’s head of sales strategy in the US, told Business Insider, “There’s never a better time to buy an EV than now,” citing the various incentives currently available in the marketplace.

Ferreira noted that Ford has introduced a “zero-zero-zero” incentive program, which includes zero down payment, zero payments for the first 90 days, and 0 percent interest for the first 48 months on select models. This program replaces an earlier incentive that offered employee discounts to all customers. Ferreira also pointed out that in other markets where tax credits have been phased out, there tends to be a spike in interest from consumers who haven’t yet made the switch to EVs but want to take advantage of the incentives before they disappear.

“U.S. EPA should object to this permit because it’s inconsistent with the Clean Air Act and the region’s Hoosiers should not feel like they are living in a sacrifice zone,” Kerri Gefeke, associate attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center, said in a news release. “Numerous studies show that residents living near Gary Works already suffer from some of the highest rates of air pollution in the nation — resulting in high rates of asthma, cancer and other diseases.”

The petition, submitted on July 3, claims the permit “fails to include many basic provisions of the Clean Air Act,” according to a Thursday news release from the Environmental Law and Policy Center. The petition alleges that the permit renewal is missing clear and enforceable monitoring, testing and recordkeeping requirements sufficient to assure compliance with all applicable requirements, according to the news release.

r

“Permitting decisions are made based on an applicant’s ability to demonstrate compliance with applicable state and federal rules and regulations, including the Clean Air Act,” IDEM responded in a Thursday statement. “The U.S. Steel Gary Works Part 70 Operating Permit was issued following an EPA review and comment period.”

U.S. Steel also responded to the petition in a Thursday statement.

“Environmental stewardship is a core value at U.S. Steel, and we remain committed to the safety of our communities as do our more than 3,400 Gary Works employees,” a spokesperson said in an email.

In addition to the Environmental Law and Policy Center, two regional groups participated in the petition: Gary Advocates for Responsible Development and Just Transition Northwest Indiana.

In the petition, the organizations argue that IDEM disregarded concerns from the EPA and commenters during the public comment period. The petition asks for the EPA to object to the renewal permit.

The petition asks IDEM to revise the renewal permit to include supplemental monitoring for various emission limits, and include contents of the continuous compliance plan and corrective action plan, among others.

Petitioners also want IDEM to provide detailed rationales in the renewal permit record about the adequacy of monitoring requirements to assure compliance, according to petition documents.

An October report from Industrious Labs found that most residents in Gary are in the top 10% of U.S. residents most at-risk for developing asthma and at-risk of low life expectancy.

Earlier this year, the American Lung Association gave Lake County failing grades in three categories: ozone pollution, 24-hour particle pollution and annual particle pollution. Porter County only received a passing grade for annual particle pollution.

Ozone and particle pollution can cause premature death and other health effects, including asthma attacks, heart attacks, strokes, preterm births and impaired cognitive function, according to the American Lung Association. The organization also found that particle pollution can cause lung cancer.

In a statement Thursday, GARD President Dorreen Carey mentioned how Gary residents have suffered from air pollution, saying that upgrades in pollution monitoring are required to ensure public health is protected.

“EPA must object to this deficient IDEM permit renewal and require revisions to the air monitoring methodology that will include updated and supplemental monitoring of emissions and opacity limits to ensure permit compliance and current and ongoing protection of Gary residents’ health and environment,” Carey said.

Susan Thomas, director of policy and press for Just Transition Northwest Indiana, said the permit is missing “the most basic environmental management provisions,” including monitoring, testing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements.

“This dangerous situation is totally unacceptable and unprecedented, opening the door to an ‘anything goes’ model for industry pollution standards in a community that has historically been pushed to the brink,” Thomas said in a statement. “Access to clean air, safe water and healthy soil is a fundamental human right, one that Gary, and every community, deserves without compromise.”

A Smarter Solar Future Both the Build Public Renewables Act and the Big Beautiful Bill point toward a more electrified, climate-conscious future, but they take different paths.","The sun may be shining on solar in New York today, but what about tomorrow?

With a web of federal incentives and ambitious state goals, New York has become one of the top states for residential solar. But as the landmark federal Inflation Reduction Act begins to wind down key tax credits after 2025, and as New York’s own programs face funding and policy changes, many homeowners are asking: What’s next for solar in the Empire State?

In this article, we’ll break down what New York homeowners need to know about the changing solar landscape, what’s already in place, and what might be coming next. If you’re thinking about going solar—or wondering how recent policies affect your existing system—this is the time to pay attention.

The Federal Clock Is Ticking

Let’s start with the most pressing deadline: the 30% federal solar tax credit, officially called the Residential Clean Energy Credit (Section 25D).

This credit, which allows homeowners to deduct 30% of their total solar installation cost from their federal taxes, was extended under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022. But it won’t last forever. Unless Congress acts again, this incentive will drop to 26% in 2033, 22% in 2034, and expire altogether by 2035.

But here’s the real catch: In order to qualify for the full 30% credit, your system must be installed and turned on by December 31, 2025.

That’s why solar providers across the country—including local companies like New York Electric & Solar, are encouraging homeowners to plan their projects now, not later. As the deadline gets closer, demand is expected to surge, leading to potential delays in permitting, utility approvals, and equipment availability.

What the Big Beautiful Bill Did (and Didn’t Do)

In July 2025, the U.S. Congress passed what’s officially known as H.R. 1 — but what many in the media have dubbed the “Big Beautiful Bill.” This sweeping piece of federal legislation made major changes to tax policy, energy funding, and climate programs nationwide. For homeowners interested in going solar, it’s especially important to understand what this bill did — and what it didn’t do.

One of the most significant impacts of the Big Beautiful Bill was its rollback of clean energy tax credits that had previously been expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act. This includes a phase-out of the 30% Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit (Section 25D) — the credit that homeowners use to reduce the cost of installing solar panels. Under the new federal law, the credit is set to expire after December 31, 2025, unless further action is taken. For many homeowners, this makes 2025 the final window to access the full federal incentive.

In addition to cutting tax credits, the bill introduced stricter requirements for solar equipment sourcing — including new rules around foreign entities and domestic content. While these changes aim to boost American manufacturing, they also add complexity for solar installers and may impact equipment availability or pricing.

What the Big Beautiful Bill did not do, however, is directly affect New York State’s climate legislation, including the much-discussed Build Public Renewables Act, which passed at the state level in 2023.

What New York’s Build Public Renewables Act Actually Covers

Before the Big Beautiful Bill, New York passed its own landmark climate legislation: the Build Public Renewables Act (BPRA). Signed into law in 2023, this bill expanded the authority of the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to develop, build, and operate large-scale renewable energy projects across the state.

The BPRA was a major win for public power advocates, particularly in terms of equity. It gave NYPA the green light to build clean energy infrastructure in underserved communities, ensuring a more just transition to renewable energy. It also created pathways for union jobs and emphasized long-term decarbonization of the state’s power grid.

But here’s the key point for homeowners: the Build Public Renewables Act does not provide new financial incentives for residential solar. It focuses primarily on utility-scale and community-level clean energy. While it strengthens the grid and supports statewide sustainability goals, it doesn’t lower out-of-pocket costs for individual families looking to install solar panels on their rooftops.

So Where Does That Leave Homeowners?

The combination of these two bills; one federal, one state, paints a clear picture:

New York’s Build Public Renewables Act is a long-term infrastructure strategy that strengthens the role of public power but doesn’t provide direct financial help for homeowners.

The federal Big Beautiful Bill (H.R. 1), on the other hand, reduces or removes the tax incentives that homeowners have relied on to make solar affordable.

That’s why, for New Yorkers thinking about going solar, 2025 is a crucial year. To lock in the 30% federal tax credit, your system must be fully installed and connected to the grid by December 31, 2025 — no exceptions.

Start with a free consultation

Make sure your system is installed and interconnected by the end of the year.

Secure your 30% federal tax credit before it’s gone.

And remember, while New York’s commitment to clean energy remains strong, there’s no replacement on the books yet for the federal residential credit that’s set to expire. If you wait until 2026, you may be paying significantly more out of pocket.

A Smarter Solar Future

Both the Build Public Renewables Act and the Big Beautiful Bill point toward a more electrified, climate-conscious future, but they take different paths. New York is investing in public infrastructure. The federal government is shifting focus toward domestic manufacturing and energy security. But for homeowners, it’s clear: 2025 is your moment.

As Inside EVs reported, Ionity announced it will begin rolling out new ultra-fast chargers across Europe in the second half of 2025. These chargers will be capable of adding up to 186 miles of range in under eight minutes, making road trips and daily commutes much more convenient for EV drivers.

Although EVs available in today’s European market can’t tap into this level of power yet, this upgrade lays the groundwork for the next generation of EVs. The system is also designed to be more efficient overall, sharing power between vehicles when multiple cars are plugged into the same station.

Faster charging means less time waiting at the charging station and more time living. Whether commuting, running errands, driving for rideshare services, or taking a family road trip, shorter charging stops reduce downtime, ease scheduling stress, and can help shave money off travel costs.

With less time spent charging, EV ownership becomes even more practical and accessible.

On a broader scale, the faster flow of traffic at charging stations can help cut congestion at these stations and make the act of owning and driving an EV that much more of a no-brainer for drivers. That will lead to less tailpipe pollution, especially in cities, and roughly halve the total pollution per mile driven, according to MIT.

By speeding up the turnover at charging spots, this shift can bring cleaner air, quieter streets, and a healthier planet for everyone.

Some companies are also factoring charging infrastructure into their cars’ software. As The EV Report noted on LinkedIn, Audi’s route planner can “streamline the search for charging stations.”

When you pair faster EV charging with solar power at home, the benefits add up even more. By powering your car with energy from rooftop panels, you can significantly reduce your electricity bills and make an especially meaningful impact on the environment. EnergySage allows you to compare quotes from trusted installers and save thousands on solar installations.

Ionity CEO Jeroen van Tilburg said in the press release that the rollout represents “another key milestone in our mission to deliver ultra‑fast, convenient charging at scale for EV drivers across Europe.”",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/EuropeEV-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-07-13 15:10:56.891023

I never got there, being a workaholic. I was mainly a Cairo guy during my nearly 4 years off and on in that country.

So I didn’t know anything about Ras Gareb, about a hundred miles north of Hurghada on the Red Sea, and more specifically on the latter’s Gulf of El Zayt. The same Gustave Eiffel who designed the Eiffel Tower in Paris was hired by Ottoman viceroy Khedive Ismail in 1871 to design a lighthouse at Ras Gareb. Ras Gareb was only founded as a town in 1932, because there is an oil field in the area. It is a small town, probably with a population of less than 50,000. So this part of Egypt is already entangled in modernism — the lighthouse was for Red Sea steamship traffic.

Now, it is now the site of the largest wind farm on the African continent, and a complex of two wind farms there now generates nearly a gigawatt (914 megawatts) of power, enough to provide electricity to 1.1 million Egyptian households!

Back in the 1950s, when Egypt wanted to build an Aswan Dam, it initially went to the US because of its wealth and expertise. When Washington tried to dominate Egypt and cut it off from its Eastern European markets, Cairo rebelled and turned to the Soviet Union to finish the dam.

But now the United States and Russia aren’t in the picture for this enormous infrastructure project. Japan and France are.

Toyota Tsusho built Gulf of Suez Wind Farm I near Ras Gareb in 2019, with a a power generation capacity of 262.5 megawatts.

The company then partnered with its partially owned subsidiary, Japan’s Eurus Energy, which is also partly owned by TEPCO; with France’s Engie S.A., and with Egypt’s Orascom Construction PLC to create a truly vast wind farm with really huge turbines, the Gulf of Suez Wind Farm II.

And now, ESI Africa reports the Gulf of Suez Wind Farm II is fully operational, having added 150 megawatts in capacity in March. It is therefore putting out 654 megawatts.

The new wind farm cost $790 million, having begun construction in 2023. The financing was handled by Japanese banks, a French one, and by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. A Japanese concern covered the insurance. The speed with which Toyota Tsusho and its partners erected this massive project is just incredible, and it underlines why wind and solar are the future. The installation has 104 turbines. Twenty of them are so gigantic that they each put out 7.5 megawatts. The other 84 aren’t chopped liver, either, each with a 6 megawatt nameplate capacity.

Gulf of Suez Wind Farm II is now fully connected to the Egyptian grid. Along with Wind Farm I at the same location t will power as many households as there are in the entire state of Kansas. It is a 25-year contract and Japan will repatriate profits from it.

Trump’s United States will not. Of wind power, Trump said, “We’re not going to be having that.”

Egypt wants 42% of its electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030, and this new large Japanese-built wind complex will help it meet that (overly modest) goal.

“Suez Wind,” Digital, Dream / Dreamland v3 / Clip2Comic, 2025

Rendering of the NuScale VOYGR SMR power plant approved by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ABILENE, Texas — Bolstered by $3.2 million from a former Midland oilman, this West Texas city of 130,000 people is helping the Lone Star State lead a national nuclear energy resurgence.

Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year. Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site, and require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.

The company Robison founded, Natura Resources, is investing another $30.5 million in the project. Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S.

“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”

Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.

In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.

“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”

The push is bipartisan. In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.

But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.

“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.

In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.

In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.

Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal. Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.

Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.

“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as he welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”

But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.

In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.

“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”

Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.

“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”

Ramping up

The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.

Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives. But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.

Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”

The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.

Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast. The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller. The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.

The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.

The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center. The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.

“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”

Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.

‘What Henry Ford did for cars’

John Sharp, the outgoing chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.

Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?

“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”

Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.

“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”

Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years. He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.

“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”",https://www.realvail.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nuscale-Nucllear-Power-Plant.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 14:07:47.045118

When congressional Republicans decided to cut some Biden-era energy subsidies to help fund their One Big Beautiful Bill Act, they could have pruned wasteful subsidies while sparing the rest. Instead, they did the reverse. Americans will pay the price with higher costs for dirtier energy.

The nearly 900-page bill that President Donald Trump signed on July 4, slashes incentives for wind and solar energy, batteries, electric cars and home efficiency while expanding subsidies for fossil fuels and biofuels. That will leave Americans burning more fossil fuels despite strong public and scientific support for shifting to renewable energy.

As an environmental engineering professor who studies ways to confront climate change, I think it is important to distinguish which energy technologies could rapidly cut emissions or need a financial boost to become viable from those that are already profitable but harm the environment. Unfortunately, the Republican bill favors the latter while stifling the former.

Cuts to renewable electricity: Wind and solar power, often paired with batteries, provide over 90 percent of the new electricity added nationally and around the world in recent years. Natural gas turbines are in short supply, and there are long lead times to build nuclear power plants. Wind and solar energy projects — with batteries to store excess power until it’s needed — offer the fastest way to satisfy growing demand for power. Recent technological breakthroughs put geothermal power on the verge of rapid growth.

However, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act rescinds billions of dollars that the Inflation Reduction Act, enacted in 2022, devoted to boosting domestic manufacturing and deployments of renewable energy and batteries.

It accelerates the phaseout of tax credits for factories that manufacture equipment needed for renewable energy and electric vehicles. That would disrupt the boom in domestic manufacturing projects that had been stimulated by the Inflation Reduction Act.

Efforts to build new wind and solar farms will be hit even harder. To receive any tax credits, those projects will need to commence construction by mid-2026 or come online by the end of 2027. The act preserves a slower timeline for phasing out subsidies for nuclear, geothermal and hydrogen projects, which take far longer to build than wind and solar farms.

However, even projects that could be built soon enough will struggle to comply with the bill’s restrictions on using Chinese-made components. Tax law experts have called those provisions “unworkable,” since some Chinese materials may be necessary even for projects built with as much domestic content as possible. For example, even American-made solar panels may rely on components sourced from China or Chinese-owned companies.

Princeton University professor Jesse Jenkins estimates that the bill will mean wind and solar power generate 820 fewer terawatt-hours in 2035 than under previous policies. That’s more power than all U.S. coal-fired power plants generated in 2023.

That’s why BloombergNEF, an energy research firm, called the bill a “nightmare scenario” for clean energy proponents.

However, one person’s nightmare may be another man’s dream. “We’re constraining the hell out of wind and solar, which is good,” said U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, who is backed by the oil and gas industry.

Electric cars and efficiency: Cuts fall even harder on Americans who are trying to reduce their carbon footprints and energy costs. The quickest phaseout comes for tax credits for electric vehicles, which will end on Sept. 30. And since the bill eliminates fines on car companies that fail to meet fuel economy standards, other new cars are likely to guzzle more gas.

Tax credits for home efficiency improvements such as heat pumps, efficient windows and energy audits will end at the end of 2025. Homeowners will also lose tax credits for installing solar panels at the end of the year, seven years earlier than under the previous law.

The bill also rescinds funding that would have helped cut diesel emissions and finance clean energy projects in underserved communities.

Support for biofuels and fossil fuels: Biofuels and fossil fuels fared far better under the bill. Tens of billions of dollars will be spent to extend tax credits for biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel.

Food-based biofuels do little good for the climate because growing, harvesting and processing crops requires fertilizers, pesticides and fuel. The bill would allow forests to be cut to make room for crops because it directs agencies to ignore the effects of biofuels on land use.

Meanwhile, the bill opens more federal lands and waters to leasing for oil and gas drilling and coal mining. It also slashes the royalties that companies pay to the federal government for fuels extracted from publicly owned land. And a new tax credit will subsidize metallurgical coal, which is mainly exported to steelmakers overseas.

The bill also increases subsidies for using captured carbon dioxide to extract more oil and gas from the ground. That makes it less likely that captured emissions will only be sequestered to combat climate change.

The result: With fewer efficiency improvements, fewer electric vehicles and less clean power on the grid, Princeton’s Jenkins projects that the law will increase household energy costs by more than $280 per year by 2035 above what they would have been without the bill. The extra fossil fuel-burning will negate 470 million tons of anticipated emissions reductions that year, a 7 percent bump.

The bill will also leave America’s clean energy transition further behind China, which is deploying more solar and wind power and electric vehicles than the rest of the world combined.

No one expected President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act to escape unscathed with Republicans in the White House and dominating both chambers of Congress, even though many of its projects were in Republican-voting districts. Still, pairing cuts to clean energy with support for fossil fuels makes Trump’s bill uniquely harmful to the world’s climate and to Americans’ wallets.

On the first day of his presidency, President Donald Trump declared a national energy emergency, pledging an aggressive push for energy dominance. His action builds on the goal of energy independence that was prevalent since the 1970s oil crisis, but now the ambition goes beyond freeing the United States from foreign oil by leveraging US energy abundance as a strategic asset.

Yet for all the rhetoric, the concept remains loosely defined. Going a step beyond mere self-sufficiency, the administration wants energy to be reliable, affordable, and abundant—and domestically-sourced wherever possible. The following pillars of energy abundance emerge: solidifying American leadership in fossil fuel production and exports, rejuvenating the American nuclear and coal industries, a deregulatory push, securing supply chains, and abandoning the federal pursuit of decarbonization.

These priorities aim toward reducing American dependency on foreign imports, growing the economy, and addressing the rising national debt and budget imbalances.

Dominant in What?

Trump’s vision of energy dominance centers on American strengths: oil, gas, coal, and nuclear. In stark contrast to the 1970s, today, the United States shapes international energy markets as a net exporter of liquified natural gas (LNG) and as a prominent producer of liquids —crude oil, condensates, and natural gas liquids (NGLs). According to the Texas Oil and Gas Association, in 2024, the U.S. generated as much crude oil and NGLs as it consumed from a volumetric standpoint.

In this area, the United States has achieved its energy independence goals. American producers operate in a robust cost environment: many shale fields remain profitable at oil prices near $70/barrel, enabling their flexibility and competitiveness throughout production cycles. Geopolitically, American LNG exports have undercut Russia’s energy revenues and strengthened its ties with the EU, Japan, South Korea, China, and Turkey, which are major purchasers of American LNG.

Deregulation is another pillar of energy dominance. By lifting permitting hurdles and rolling back environmental regulations, the administration’s goal is to halt the early retirement of coal plants, and accelerate the building of pipeline, other LNG infrastructure, and refining projects. In practice, this involves revisiting aspects of the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts and easing carbon-capture mandates. This is likely to benefit the coal industry most of all.

Energy dominance also involves resilient supply chains, particularly for critical minerals like lithium, graphite, and rare earths. With China currently dominating the production and processing of these materials, the United States has begun “friend-shoring” (relocating processing to allied nations or domestically) to control the entire energy supply chain from extraction to manufacturing.

Not an “All of the Above” Solution

The administration focuses on energy sources that deliver dispatchable, “always-on” electricity. Besides fossil fuels, conventional nuclear energy, alongside small modular nuclear reactors, is a scalable baseload solution. If the United States successfully exports its domestic nuclear designs, it will forge long-lasting alliances with the recipients of these technologies. These relationships could span a hundred years due to the nuclear plants’ longevity. Support for nuclear power is further fueled by the urgent energy needs of the data center industry. Energy dominance will help the United States maintain its current leadership in the AI race, a position that is constantly challenged by China.

Notably, however, wind and solar have been sidelined in the energy dominance narrative. The first Secretarial Order by Chris Wright, the U.S. Secretary of Energy, does not address these technologies at all. Despite excellent wind and solar resources in the United States, there has been little federal push to compete with China in renewable hardware or electric vehicle battery supply chains. The United States seems to be at peace with letting China lead the clean energy transition.

President Trump is unapologetic that his energy policy is unconstrained by the greenhouse gas emissions profile of the energy sector. This is a clear break from Joe Biden’s ambitious targets for solar and wind sectors; for example, the prior administration’s thirty gigawatts (GW) target for offshore wind installed capacity by 2030 is now clearly unachievable.

The Gambit for Dominance

Energy dominance isn’t just a slogan. It is a deliberate, multi-layered strategy akin to an industrial policy that emphasizes US market-share expansion and supply chain control. Energy is not merely a commodity, but also a tool of economic statecraft.

True dominance requires long-term investments, sustained international partnerships, a stable business environment with high amounts of certainty in government policy, continued technological leadership, and a non-confrontational trade policy that builds alliances. The United States may gain leverage abroad and cheaper fuel at home, but its current approach increases the risks of isolation and trade conflicts.

Moreover, energy dominance might not mix well with trade tariffs. For example, the US and Canadian electric grids are integrated, and the tariffs might create issues shifting energy across the border.

Still, for now, the US seems to hold a strong hand. It has access to cheap, abundant hydrocarbons and is home to the largest nuclear power plant fleet in the world. Yet energy dominance is not a destination—it is a statement of policy priorities that must continuously adapt to shifting markets and alliances. The current interpretation of energy dominance also leaves out US leadership in clean energy, which might not be the best approach in the long run.

NLC India Limited will invest significantly to boost its power generation. The company aims to increase its capacity substantially by 2030. A large portion of the investment is dedicated to renewable energy projects. NLC is also exploring opportunities in critical mineral mining globally. NLC India Renewables Limited is planning an IPO.

NLC India Ltd, a public sector enterprise, is planning to invest Rs 1.25 lakh crore by 2030 to expand its capacity from the existing 6.7 gigawatt to 20 gigawatt, Prasanna Kumar Motupalli, Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) of the company has said.

He said, out of Rs 1.25 lakh crore planned capex, the company will be spending around Rs 65,000 crores on renewables and other green initiatives, while around Rs 45,000 crores will be earmarked for thermal and around 15,000 crores for mining.

The official elaborated that out of the Rs 65,000 crore capex on renewables, around Rs 15,000 crore will be on the battery storage system.

""We are having an aggressive capacity addition plan, adding the renewable capacity as well as the conventional capacity to take the capacity from the existing 6.7 gigawatt to 20 gigawatt. For that, the Capex requirement is around 1.25 lakh crore by 2030,"" Kumar told PTI Videos.

NLCIL is arranging finance for the planned capex of Rs 1.25 lakh crore through internal accruals, domestic loans, Initial Public Offering's (IPOs), External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs), he explained.

Live Events

NLC is contemplating starting a consulting business abroad, initially in Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar, Africa, and the Middle East and acquire battery mineral assets overseas - especially in Vanadium, Cobalt, Lithium and Copper, among others, he said.

Recently, NLC got two critical mineral blocks in Chhattisgarh and with that experience the company is exploring the possibilities of critical mineral mining abroad also.

Understanding Pre-Owned EV Tax Credits Federal Pre-Owned EV Tax Credit Overview Buying used?
FAQ 1.Do Mercedes EQ Models Qualify For The Federal EV Tax Credit?
Some Mercedes EQ models, like the U.S.-assembled EQB SUV, may qualify for federal EV tax credits.
4.How Do I Claim The EV Tax Credit For A Mercedes EQ Vehicle?","So, you’re thinking about making the jump into a Mercedes-Benz electric vehicle—maybe the sleek EQS Sedan, the versatile EQB SUV, or something new in the pipeline. But before you plug in and hit the road, let’s talk about one of the most satisfying parts of going electric:

The EV tax credit. It’s like getting rewarded for being both eco-conscious and style-savvy. But the truth is, the world of tax credits for Mercedes-Benz EQ models isn’t just plug-and-play. There are eligibility criteria, evolving legislation, and a few surprises along the way.

Eligibility Criteria For EV Tax Credits

First things first—let’s talk federal. The Federal EV Tax Credit offers up to $7,500 off your tax bill if you buy a qualified clean vehicle. But not every electric model qualifies. The rules now consider where the car is assembled, where battery components come from, and even where the minerals are sourced.

And here’s the kicker: the vehicle needs to be new, have a price under certain caps (around $80,000 for SUVs), and you—the buyer—must meet income limits. These rules evolved after the Inflation Reduction Act, so what worked in 2023 may not apply now in 2025.

Specific Requirements For Mercedes EQ Models

So where does that leave our beloved Mercedes-Benz EV models? Well, some do qualify, some don’t—at least not for the full credit. For example, the U.S.-assembled EQB SUV may qualify for partial credit depending on the trim and final assembly location. Meanwhile, the German-made EQS Sedan typically doesn’t qualify for federal incentives, though it still shines with national offers and dealer finance specials.

The best way to check? Head to the dealership’s finance center or use IRS tools to confirm current qualification status by Mercedes-Benz model and VIN.

Differentiating Between EVs And PHEVs

This is where things get tricky. Not all electric vehicles are fully electric. Some are PHEVs (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles). That matters. PHEVs like the upcoming 2025 GLC Plug-in Hybrid can qualify for reduced federal tax credits—based on battery size and electric-only range.

So while a hybrid electric vehicle might not be as “clean” as a full EV, it can still put some cash back in your pocket if it meets IRS benchmarks.

Available Tax Credits For Mercedes EQ Models

List of Eligible Mercedes EQ Models

As of June 2025, here’s a quick look at how Mercedes-Benz EQ models align with tax credits:

EQB SUV: May qualify (assembled in the U.S. in some cases)

EQS Sedan: Generally doesn’t qualify for federal, but special offers often available

GLC Plug-in Hybrid (new model): Expected to receive partial credit

Certified pre-owned Mercedes-Benz EV models: Eligible for used EV tax credit (details below)

Keep in mind that vehicle specials may apply regardless of federal incentives. You can often find shopping tools, finance specials, and lease return deals to stack savings.

Insights On The Mercedes-Benz EQ Lineup

The Mercedes EQ vehicle lineup is growing fast. From the flagship EQS Sedan with its hyper-luxury interior to the family-ready EQB SUV, there’s an electric car for nearly every lifestyle. These vehicles feature cutting-edge EQ Technology, built-in DC fast charging support, and tech-heavy dashboards that feel straight out of 2030.

And yes, even if a model doesn’t qualify for a tax credit, it’s hard to ignore the value of driving a luxury electric vehicle that blends performance, Mercedes-Benz S-Class comfort, and futuristic design.

How To Claim The Federal Tax Credit

Steps to Applying for the Tax Credit

If you’re buying an eligible new Mercedes-Benz EV, claiming the EV tax credit is pretty straightforward:

Confirm vehicle eligibility: Verify the model and trim qualify on the IRS website.

File IRS Form 8936: You’ll need this form when doing your taxes.

Use your Payment Calculator: Work with the finance center to estimate post-credit pricing.

Retain documents: Purchase agreement, VIN, and dealership verification of tax credit eligibility.

Just remember: this is a tax credit, not a rebate. It reduces your owed federal tax—not the vehicle’s sticker price.

Required Documentation And Forms

In most cases, you’ll need:

IRS Form 8936 (Qualified Plug-In Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Credit)

Purchase agreement with VIN

Dealership’s documentation showing Mercedes-Benz qualify status for the selected model

If the vehicle qualifies, your tax return will reflect the full or partial credit as a deduction on what you owe Uncle Sam.

Understanding Pre-Owned EV Tax Credits

Federal Pre-Owned EV Tax Credit Overview

Buying used? There’s still good news. A federal pre-owned EV tax credit of up to $4,000 is now available. This applies to certified pre-owned vehicles or even pre-owned specials under $25,000—great news if you’re eyeing a slightly older EQ model.

But again, you must buy from a licensed dealer, and the vehicle must be at least two model years old.

Criteria For Pre-Owned Mercedes EQ Models

To qualify for the used EV credit, the pre-owned Mercedes-Benz must:

Be from the Mercedes-Benz EQ family (like a 2022 EQB or EQS)

Be priced under $25,000

Not have been sold as a credit-claimed vehicle before

Be used by the buyer (not resold immediately)

Certified dealerships like Autonation Inc often stock qualifying models, and they’ll help you navigate the finance application and related paperwork.

Maximizing Tax Credit Benefits

Leveraging Dealer Advice and Resources

Dealers are your secret weapon here. Many Mercedes-Benz retailers offer shopping tools, calculators, and express service for quick inspections and EV evaluations. Ask about Mercedes-Benz Partner Programs that may offer additional savings or employer discounts.

Oh—and don’t skip the parts specials if you’re personalizing your new EQ ride.

Strategies For Maximizing Savings

Want to stack your savings? Try this:

Start with a new vehicle special or pre-owned vehicle special

Apply your tax credit at tax time

Use dealer finance specials to lower your APR

Explore national offers and Mercedes-Benz certified vehicles for extra perks

Even if the federal credit doesn’t fully apply, many EQ models are supported by state-level incentives and Electrify America charging promotions. Combined, these can make your first year of ownership surprisingly cost-effective.

Considerations For New EV Technologies

Innovations in 2025 GLC Plug-in Hybrid

The 2025 GLC Plug-in Hybrid is particularly exciting. It’s a hybrid electric vehicle that blends traditional gasoline power with an extended electric-only range—ideal if you’re transitioning from gas to electric. Plus, it’s expected to meet requirements for partial EV credits, making it a sweet middle ground.

It also features upgraded DC fast charging, real-time battery monitoring, and next-gen EQ Technology that rivals even full EVs in driving smoothness and power delivery.

Benefits Of Adopting New Technologies

Let’s be honest—early adopters get perks. Beyond the tax credit, you’re getting:

Lower maintenance vs. gas cars

Quiet, ultra-smooth rides

Access to priority parking and HOV lanes in many cities

Support from Mercedes-Benz’s expanding new inventory of service-friendly EVs

Plus, innovations in electric cars work best when adopted early—like over-the-air updates and smart charging networks.

Broader Context Of Qualified Clean Vehicle Tax Credits

Overview of Other Eligible Manufacturers and Models

Mercedes isn’t alone in the game. Other eligible electric vehicle makers include Ford (F-150 Lightning), Tesla (Model Y), and Rivian. However, few match the luxury and refinement of a Mercedes-Benz electric vehicle—especially in interior design and brand status.

So while others qualify, driving a Mercedes EQ vehicle is about more than credits. It’s about lifestyle, confidence, and long-term vision.

Insights From Dealership Locations

Whether you’re browsing in-person or online, dealership support is everything. The Mercedes-Benz Finance Center can:

Check current recall information

Confirm pre-owned vehicle specials

Help submit your finance application

Navigate new Mercedes-Benz inventory vs. certified pre-owned inventory

Some even offer lease return programs with flexible upgrade options—perfect if you’re planning to switch from gas to electric over time.

Final Thoughts

Here’s the truth: EV tax credits aren’t one-size-fits-all. But if you’re strategic, they can tip the scales in favor of a smarter, cleaner investment. Whether it’s a new Mercedes-Benz EV, a pre-owned Mercedes-Benz, or an upcoming hybrid electric vehicle, the key is knowing your options.

And when you pair all that tech and style with a little money back at tax time? That’s what I call a win.

Used EV prices fell nearly 32% in 2024 from 2023, almost 10 times the drop in used gas-powered car prices, according to iSeeCars.com, an automotive research site.

Last year, the average used EV cost around $30,900, in line with the average used gas car, even though a new EV sells for $17,300 more than a comparable gas model on average.

Discounts have drawn in buyers like Christopher Andrzejczak, a systems engineer from Orlando, Fla., who has owned five EVs over the past decade. Last year, he picked up a 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E with 6,000 miles on it for $36,000—less than half of its sticker price.

That price included an extended warranty and several upgrades like tinted windows that the previous owner had paid for.

Deals on used EVs are especially pronounced because EVs lose value faster than gas-powered cars once they drive off the lot. The depreciation often reflects concerns about battery life and longevity. Replacing a battery out of warranty is costly but uncommon. New technology could quickly make a used EV antiquated. The vehicles also require specialized parts and labor that make them more expensive to repair when something goes wrong.

“I was like, You know what? I’m willing to take a risk on that,” Andrzejczak said. The previous owner “probably took a terrible depreciation hit.”

In the new-car market, higher sticker prices and the fast pace of depreciation can make it hard for many car shoppers to justify going green.

New electric vehicles cost about $800 more a year to own than gas-powered cars when factoring in fuel, maintenance, insurance and fees. But removing the cost of depreciation results in a saving of more than $900 annually versus a gas car, according to an analysis of AAA data. EVs have lower fuel and maintenance costs, but cost more to insure.

In 2024, charging an EV at home worked out to the equivalent of about $1.41 a gallon of gas, according to the Energy Department. That is less than half of what most drivers paid at the pump last year.

EV owners spend roughly half as much on upkeep and repairs compared with gas-car drivers, according to Consumer Reports. Over the life of the car, that adds up to about $4,600 in maintenance costs for an EV compared with $9,200 for a traditional one.

Used cars also don’t depreciate as quickly. In January, Andrzejczak purchased a used 2021 Audi E-Tron Prestige for $27,000, with the intent to get ahead of tariffs and eventually gift it to his teenage son. When his son made it clear he wasn’t interested in March, Andrzejczak sold the car to Carvana for $26,000.

“It’s like I borrowed it for a few months for $1,000,” he said.

Jason Wallace, who owns Electrified Autos, a used EV dealership in Joplin, Mo., says more buyers are realizing they can save money by making the switch to electric. In an economy pinched by years of inflation and high interest rates, he said, “that’s all that matters to them.”

The used-car dealership has been in Wallace’s family since 1975 when his grandfather opened it, but Wallace and his brother made the decision to focus exclusively on selling electric vehicles last year. So far, it has paid off.

“There’s demand for EVs at the right price,” he said. “Not everyone is going to spend $60,000 on a car but they will look harder when it’s $20,000 or less, and we have no problem selling those.”

Another reason for the rush is looming changes in EV policy. A $4,000 federal tax credit for used EVs is set to expire at the end of September as a result of the new tax law passed earlier this month. The $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs, which made new models more affordable and helped keep prices down in the used market, is also expiring at the same time.

Eli Cook decided to buy an electric vehicle after researching gas prices in the Bay Area. He and his wife, both recent college graduates, plan to move there from Missouri later this year for work. Expecting far higher gas prices in California than Missouri, the couple wanted something affordable and efficient. As newlyweds, they are determined to avoid going into debt.

They could have waited until after the move, but worried they would miss out on the tax credit. Last month, they paid $15,000 cash for a 2020 Tesla Model 3. The window sticker, Cook said, showed it had sold for nearly $40,000 four years earlier.

“It really seems like we’re buying the dip for used EVs right now,” he said.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/07/13/1600x900/im-14903142_1752422224330_1752422278563.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 15:10:25.290696

In January, Andrzejczak purchased a used 2021 Audi E-Tron Prestige for $27,000, with the intent to get ahead of tariffs and eventually gift it to his teenage son. When his son made it clear he wasn’t interested in March, Andrzejczak sold the car to Carvana for $26,000.

“It’s like I borrowed it for a few months for $1,000,” he said.

Jason Wallace, who owns Electrified Autos, a used EV dealership in Joplin, Mo., says more buyers are realizing they can save money by making the switch to electric. In an economy pinched by years of inflation and high interest rates, he said, “that’s all that matters to them.”

The used-car dealership has been in Wallace’s family since 1975 when his grandfather opened it, but Wallace and his brother made the decision to focus exclusively on selling electric vehicles last year. So far, it has paid off.

“There’s demand for EVs at the right price,” he said. “Not everyone is going to spend $60,000 on a car but they will look harder when it’s $20,000 or less, and we have no problem selling those.”

Another reason for the rush is looming changes in EV policy. A $4,000 federal tax credit for used EVs is set to expire at the end of September as a result of the new tax law passed earlier this month. The $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs, which made new models more affordable and helped keep prices down in the used market, is also expiring at the same time.

Eli Cook decided to buy an electric vehicle after researching gas prices in the Bay Area. He and his wife, both recent college graduates, plan to move there from Missouri later this year for work. Expecting far higher gas prices in California than Missouri, the couple wanted something affordable and efficient. As newlyweds, they are determined to avoid going into debt.

They could have waited until after the move, but worried they would miss out on the tax credit. Last month, they paid $15,000 cash for a 2020 Tesla Model 3. The window sticker, Cook said, showed it had sold for nearly $40,000 four years earlier.

“It really seems like we’re buying the dip for used EVs right now,” he said.

The Rush Island plant was used fairly sparingly in its later years — primarily as a “peaker” plant, when power demand was greatest.
“The technology has matured.” The proposed gas plant faces questions from some, for reasons beyond making a large financial investment in fossil fuels that contribute to climate change.
Ameren, though, said that simple-cycle plants are better for peaker plants, rather than those relied on for baseload power generation.
Some would also prefer to see more emphasis on energy efficiency, rather than focusing on building new power plants.","Ameren is looking to build a natural gas-fired power plant and the company’s first large lithium-ion battery facility on the Jefferson County site of its former coal-based Rush Island Energy Center, which closed last year after continuous Clean Air Act violations.

The St. Louis-based electric utility will call the complex the Big Hollow Energy Center, the company announced late last month. Collectively, the 800-megawatt gas plant and the 400-megawatt battery storage facility would roughly match the generating potential that Rush Island had, taking advantage of the site’s existing transmission capacity and access to the power grid.

“That was the idea,” said Ajay Arora, Ameren Missouri’s senior vice president and chief development officer. “The infrastructure is extremely valuable … certainly the transmission aspect of it.”

The proposed switch to gas at one of its former coal plant sites follows a familiar playbook for Ameren. The utility is also building an 800-megawatt gas plant — called the Castle Bluff Energy Center — for about $800 million at the former site of its smallest and oldest coal plant, the Meramec Energy Center in south St. Louis County, which closed at the end of 2022.

The Rush Island plant was used fairly sparingly in its later years — primarily as a “peaker” plant, when power demand was greatest.

Ameren said it intends for the new facility to play a similar role, “as a reliable backup source of energy,” with the gas plant designed to provide power when demand peaks on cold winter days, hot summer afternoons, and to support the grid when renewable generation is unavailable.

Meanwhile, the project’s energy storage component would do much of the same. For instance, the batteries could be charged when cheap, excess energy is on the grid and then used when needed, in any weather conditions.

“Fully charged, the entire array could power thousands of homes for hours and help overall grid reliability, especially during times of peak energy needs,” Ameren said in its announcement.

While the site offers plenty of existing attributes, such as its readymade transmission access, Ameren said that the Rush Island building could not be retrofitted to accommodate the new projects, and that its demolition is already underway.

Ameren still needs approval from state utility regulators before proceeding with its Big Hollow proposal, which it hopes to receive by March. The company then aims to complete the project by 2028.

The utility said that the estimated cost of the project is currently confidential.

‘About time’ for battery storage

Ameren’s plans for the Rush Island site’s redevelopment have elicited some mixed reactions from energy experts — and raised questions about costs.

For example, the company’s push to build new generation and aid grid reliability comes as it says it faces a wave of demand from prospective developers of highly energy-intensive projects, like data centers.

Utilities are fielding similar requests nationwide, although Missouri has not yet seen the explosions in energy demand that so far have been concentrated in scattershot places across the map, such as Virginia, Texas and North Dakota.

Predicting if or when that wave of demand could materialize in Missouri is one challenge that now confronts regional utilities and state regulators, raising questions about how to shoulder costs of energy projects that largely cater to heavy users, and carrying risks of a possible “overbuild” that leaves customers on the hook for hefty investments.

“The question is what supply should be built and how do you pay for it?” said Ashok Gupta, a Kansas City-based energy economist for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

While the payment question will eventually be part of the regulatory review process for Ameren’s Big Hollow proposal, it is also being broadly examined and debated in separate cases before the Missouri Public Service Commission. For example, outside groups and watchdog agencies that police utility spending will soon weigh in on cases about how to serve large-load customers seeking power from the state’s biggest electric utilities: Ameren and Kansas City-based Evergy.

Federal energy policy whiplash out of Washington now “makes the calculus even harder” in determining what to build and when to build it, Gupta said, as tax credits for wind and solar projects are now set to lapse within a couple years — projects that represent the bulk of new power generation in the U.S.

But costs at Big Hollow could at least partially be reduced by federal tax credits for battery storage projects. Unlike the tax credits for wind and solar, those for battery storage projects were spared the widespread cuts contained in the massive spending bill passed by Congressional Republicans this month, and signed by President Donald Trump.

Some, like Gupta, cheered the battery portion of the proposed project.

“It’s about time,” said Gupta, noting that storage can nicely complement renewable energy and smooth out issues with intermittent generation, whenever solar or wind generation stops or slows. “It’s exciting, it’s necessary.”

Ameren said its battery investment aligns with industry trends and that it can learn from other utilities that adopted the technology earlier.

“A lot of our peer utilities are investing heavily in batteries,” said Arora, the Ameren senior vice president. “The technology has matured.”

The proposed gas plant faces questions from some, for reasons beyond making a large financial investment in fossil fuels that contribute to climate change.

Gas has had issues with reliability and affordability at times, particularly in the extreme weather conditions when peaker plants are needed, as illustrated during Winter Storm Uri in 2021, when gas plants faltered and fuel prices skyrocketed.

And building gas plants, themselves, has become considerably more expensive in recent years, with costs tripling amid high demand and long waits for gas turbines, said John Ketchum, the CEO of NextEra Energy, a giant Florida-based utility, at recent energy conferences in March and June.

Gupta, of the Natural Resources Defense Council, questioned Ameren’s choice to pursue a simple-cycle gas plant — a less efficient alternative than combined-cycle gas plants, which recover exhaust heat and use it to generate additional power.

“You’re gonna burn all this gas. Let’s get as much energy as possible,” Gupta said.

Ameren, though, said that simple-cycle plants are better for peaker plants, rather than those relied on for baseload power generation.

Some would also prefer to see more emphasis on energy efficiency, rather than focusing on building new power plants.

“The lowest-cost resource is still energy efficiency,” said Gupta. “We should be doing hundreds if not thousands of megawatts of energy efficiency to keep energy affordable.”

Filling the void

The proposed next chapter for the site would mark the coda to Rush Island’s unique — and criminal — background. Between 2007 and 2010, Ameren illegally modified the plant’s generators near the end of their intended lifespan without obtaining permits — enabling them to produce more energy and emit more air pollutants, and sparking a decade-plus lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice.

The plant was one of a dwindling number of U.S. coal plants that did not have widely adopted pollution controls, called scrubbers, that remove sulfur dioxide, or SO2, from emissions. Ameren’s biggest coal plant, the Labadie Energy Center west of St. Louis, also lacks scrubbers and emits far more SO2 than any other U.S. coal plant.

A judge in the marathon legal case over the plant’s air pollution sought to have the company offset Rush Island’s illegal SO2 emissions by reducing Labadie’s emissions by an equal amount. But an appeals court scrapped that order, saying that Ameren was never given notice of an alleged Clean Air Act violation at Labadie — despite the fact that the Environmental Protection Agency had issued “Notices of Violation” to the company about that very issue at Labadie, years ago.

The company ultimately reached an agreement to pay $61 million for electric school buses and charging equipment, as well as the distribution of air purifiers to residential customers, prioritizing low-income households.

The new plans for the site bring potential relief to local leaders dealing with lost tax revenue from Rush Island’s closure. For instance, the Jefferson R-VII School District will see a budget reduction of $1.1 million in the upcoming school year, thanks to the plant’s retirement.

“It’s a tough number to look at,” said David Haug, the district superintendent.

But the site’s planned redevelopment figures to eventually bring the money back. And it would provide longer-term certainty and stability compared to Rush Island, with Haug saying it felt as if the “clock was ticking” throughout the aging plant’s later years, as both the facility and the school district’s finances faced an unclear future.

“It was certainly a good day when we became aware that this was official,” Haug said. “This is a big, long-term win for the district.”

ByDan Gearino for Inside Climate News

President Donald Trump issued an executive order on July 7 that he said will “end taxpayer support for unaffordable and unreliable ‘green’ energy sources” such as wind and solar.

But it’s not clear whether the order will have much of an effect other than to underscore the president’s antipathy for those power sources. Some observers speculate this action is fulfilling a promise to hardline conservative House members in order to win their votes last week for the massive budget reconciliation bill.

The order is titled “Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable Foreign Controlled Energy Sources.” It directs the Treasury department to “strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits” as specified by the bill.

Related | Trump thinks 'windmills are killing our country'—yes, really

The legislation, called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed on July 4, says that projects must begin construction by mid-2026 or be placed in service by the end of 2027. This is a rapid phaseout compared to the previous law that had a phaseout that was to begin in 2032.

The executive order advises the Treasury department to allow no wiggle room on the new deadlines. It also says the department must take prompt action to follow the bill’s new limits on tax credits going to entities with ties to China.

In addition, it says the Department of the Interior must revise any policies or practices that give solar and wind power preferential treatment compared to other energy sources.

The Treasury and Interior departments also must make reports within 45 days about how they are complying with the order.

Analysts, lawmakers and officials from renewable energy industry groups had mixed reactions about the significance of the order.

But they do not downplay the effects of the bill that has become law. It is a gutting of incentives from President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that will reduce federal government support for renewable energy, electric vehicles and manufacturing of those products and related components. The result, according to reports from Rhodium Group, Princeton University’s REPEAT Project, the think tank Energy Innovation and the Clean Energy Buyers Association, is likely to be a decrease in U.S. jobs and an increase in electricity prices.

And yet, the executive order is likely to have minimal additional effect, said Pavel Molchanov, a managing director for the investment firm Raymond James.

“Contrary to the EO’s headline, the EO does not abolish any tax credits,” he said in an email. “To state the obvious, only Congress can change tax law—which, in fact, is what Congress did last week via the budgetary megabill.”

He expects little or no practical effect from the Interior department provision

“It is worth noting that, under the Federal Power Act, the government cannot favor one type of power generation over another,” he said. “Thus, the EO simply restates existing law in that regard.”

Derrick Flakoll, a senior policy associate for BloombergNEF, sees much greater potential for harm to the wind and solar industries.

“It’s a big deal, but how big a deal it is we don’t know,” he said.

He explained that the order is attempting to create uncertainty around the 2026 deadline, which is a crucial deadline for projects to have a smooth path to qualifying for tax credits.

“It could push a lot of projects out of eligibility or into such an uncertain state of eligibility that it becomes hard to build and finance them,” he said.

Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, offered this statement:

“This executive order appears to target long-standing and well-established tax standards that allow for realistic financing timelines for all sorts of energy projects—including solar, wind, carbon capture and hydrogen projects,” she said. “We will continue to make the case that business certainty, predictability, and even-handedness are bedrocks of federal policy that cannot be undone by the stroke of a pen. We expect the Treasury Department to follow the law.”

Rep. Sean Casten (D-Illinois), who has a background running clean energy businesses, said the order is about helping the market for fossil fuels by harming competing sources of electricity.

“Donald Trump doesn’t hate renewable energy because it is clean,” he said in an email. “He hates it because it’s cheap. His latest executive orders are about making it harder for Americans to access cheap and reliable energy to ensure he keeps profits up for his friends in the fossil fuel industry.”

Taylor Rogers, an assistant press secretary for Trump, pushed back on concerns that the president’s actions would lead to higher energy prices.

“No one takes disingenuous cost concerns seriously from ‘clean energy’ groups that supported a $200 billion tax hike on the American people to fund the Green New Scam,” she said. “The One Big Beautiful Bill will continue to unleash America’s energy industry, dropping electricity costs that increased dramatically due to Joe Biden’s climate agenda.”

She listed the many aspects of the bill that increase oil and gas production and reduce regulations, which she said will cut costs for consumers.

Her response to questions did not include any comment about whether the executive order was part of a commitment made to Congressional Republicans.

The budget bill passed the House on Friday, 218-214, with all Democrats and two Republicans voting against it. Several fiscally conservative House members initially balked at the spending levels in the bill, but most of them ended up voting for it after meeting with Trump.

Asked about how Trump had earned their votes, Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) told CNBC on Friday that the president had told members he would use executive powers to stop renewable energy sources from being able to use subsidies.

“A lot of these subsidies won’t remain in effect from here on out,” Norman said.

He posted on Facebook on Tuesday that the order was “a pledge [Trump] had made, and one he kept.”

He added, “I proudly support an all-of-the-above energy approach—ensuring coal, gas, nuclear, hydropower, and yes, responsibly advanced renewables can compete in an honest market. THIS is how you make energy policy work for everyday Americans, not special interests.”

It’s not much of a stretch to see a connection between Norman’s comment on CNBC and the executive order, said Glen Brand, vice president of policy and advocacy for Solar United Neighbors, a nonprofit that works to expand access to rooftop solar.

“I assume that this is the direct response to that promise,” he said.

He said it’s difficult to predict the ramifications of the order without knowing how federal agencies will choose to respond.

“It all depends on how Treasury interprets the guidance. It could be nothing. It could be a lot,” he said.

Brand believes the order’s intent was to increase uncertainty and discourage companies from using the tax credits, which it may succeed in doing even if it doesn’t lead to any substantive changes in the way the credits work.",https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1455382/story_image/AP23060767877666.jpg?1752268392,N,,2025-07-13 12:23:08.837595

As of June 30, eight federal agencies published proposed NEPA regulation updates to the Federal Register, opening up a 30-day public comment period for the changes.
While there are nuances to the rule changes proposed by each of these federal agencies, there are a few through-lines as the agencies comply with recent executive orders, laws and Supreme Court decisions.
Part of this is that the Biden reforms included resource allocations to help agencies conduct NEPA reviews.
This allows for project sponsors, including private entities, to pay for expedited environmental reviews.","Multiple federal agencies have rolled out new rules for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, as the Trump administration aims to expedite environmental reviews.

However, environmental groups warn the changes could erode the act’s intended purpose and safeguards around government decision making.

NEPA was signed into law in 1970, requiring federal agencies to assess the environmental impacts of proposed actions such as issuing development permits, adopting federal land management actions, building highways and publicly-owned facilities and more.

The latest agency changes are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to ensure “environmental reviews cannot be weaponized to stall the growth of the American economy or halt energy infrastructure construction,” according to a June 30 memo from the White House .

These reforms follow a withdrawal of the Council on Environmental Quality’s authority, as ordered by the executive order to increase domestic energy production. The council, which was created at the same time as NEPA, historically has created a default set of regulations for agencies to adopt or build upon.

In the spring, the council pulled back its authority and rescinded its regulations . While many agencies already had their own NEPA regulations, this wholly shifted the responsibility to individual federal departments.

As of June 30, eight federal agencies published proposed NEPA regulation updates to the Federal Register, opening up a 30-day public comment period for the changes. This includes the U.S. departments of agriculture, commerce, interior, energy, transportation and defense as well as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

While there are nuances to the rule changes proposed by each of these federal agencies, there are a few through-lines as the agencies comply with recent executive orders, laws and Supreme Court decisions.

This includes deadlines and page limits for environmental reviews meant to expedite NEPA processes and reduce costs, some of which were prescribed through the ​​Fiscal Responsibility Act’s BUILDER Act amendments under the Biden administration in 2023 .

Additional changes around what actions and effects are subject to review lean on the May Supreme Court ruling regarding the proposed 88-mile Uinta Basin Railway narrowed the scope of what environmental impacts an agency is required to analyze under NEPA.

In the case, the plaintiffs (Eagle County and five environmental groups) argued that the review of the railway failed to study downstream impacts such as how increased rail traffic would impact wildfire risk and impacts on water resources and other biological resources.

The Supreme Court ruled that NEPA was “purely procedural” and agencies don’t have to study these up and downstream impacts and put the onus on agencies to determine the scope of analysis required for projects.

Both the Department of Agriculture and Department of the Interior ‘s interim final rules indicate the changes will get back to NEPA’s procedural roots and make reviews “faster, more flexible and more efficient” as guided by this court decision and other recent regulations and directives including Trump’s domestic energy executive orders, which gave guidance to expedite and simply NEPA processes.

One thing the Department of Agriculture is proposing to increase efficiency is to issue a uniform set of procedures for all agencies under it, including the U.S. Forest Service, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, Farm Service Agency and four more. The interim rule proposes rescinding all the individual regulations previously held by these agencies.

In a statement , Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said the permitting process “has been abused for decades to block affordable, reliable energy production, delay critical infrastructure projects and stunt America’s economy,” lauding the revised NEPA procedures as a fix of the system.

Melissa Simpson, president of the Western Energy Alliance, an oil and gas trade group that represents Colorado and 12 other Western states, applauded the NEPA changes proposed as a “major step in removing roadblocks and spurring capital investments in American energy and infrastructure.”

Environmental advocates argue NEPA reforms will diminish act, public input

Ronni Flannery, senior staff attorney with The Wilderness Society, said the national environmental nonprofit is still combing through the various proposals, but sees some concerning themes.

“One thing that sort of strikes us is that there’s likely to be a lot of inconsistency in how these various provisions are applied, which means confusion among the regulated parties and just some challenges there,” Flannery said. “It certainly is a significant departure from what has operated as the rules of the game up till this point.”

While The Wilderness Society was supportive of some of the NEPA permitting reforms passed under Biden, other actions by the Trump administration and Republicans have signaled concerns for what the proposals will actually do. Part of this is that the Biden reforms included resource allocations to help agencies conduct NEPA reviews.

“Congress has now revoked resources and dollars that were earmarked for helping the agencies staff up and make sure that their environmental review processes and permitting processes are efficient and so that there’s adequate staffing,” Flannery said, adding that this will make it more difficult for agencies to conduct these environmental reviews.

A 2022 research study , which studied over 41,000 NEPA decisions completed by the U.S. Forest Service — which conducts more environmental impact statements than any other federal agency — between 2004 and 2020, concluded that delays in the permitting process were most often attributed to staff turnover, inadequate budgets, delays in receiving information from applications and more.

The study noted that these statements represent less than 1% of all NEPA decisions, but that data on other decisions is limited.

In addition to these reforms, Republicans included a “pay-to-play” provision for NEPA in Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill,” which was signed into law last week. This allows for project sponsors, including private entities, to pay for expedited environmental reviews. (A previous provision that would have also allowed entities paying the fee to avoid any judicial review of projects was removed from the final bill.)

These types of expeditious environmental reviews not only follow the administration’s effort to prioritize profit over people and shut out public input, but erode the protections NEPA offers, Flannery argued.

Already, there have been examples of “projects moving through the process at warp speed,” Flannery said.

This includes the Bureau of Land Management’s decision to expedite review of a proposal to increase oil transport out of the Uinta Basin in Utah — which Colorado lawmakers criticized — as well as a Bureau approved uranium mine expansion in southeast Utah , which was the first project to go forward with Trump’s expedited 14-day environmental review process that excluded public, input.

On the whole, Flannery said that in effect, these reforms and the administration, are “shutting the public out of government decision-making on decisions that impact the public and our national lands and waters.”

Public input, Flannery argued, is a key tenant of the environmental policy, also pointing to a 2025 study from the University of Arizona , which concluded that public comment on environmental impact statements influences outcomes and often results in substantive changes in federal agency decision making.

“NEPA was always intended to ensure that the government takes a close look at the health and environmental impacts of their actions and cumulatively,” Flannery said. “What we’re seeing from the administration and from some acts of Congress, is the severe eroding of these protections and the ability of the public to not only understand what the government is doing, but also to weigh in, express concerns and help influence the process to make sure that communities are protected.”",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/8/2017/06/04221025/ROAN_1_8-24-1240x854.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:21:37.705701

One of the key changes for the automotive industry is that the bill eliminates the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles. EVs will become more expensive up front. The lease loophole, responsible for shockingly cheap deals on EVs, closes. The Slate pickup's entire business model is under threat. The move may even impact Jeep Wrangler sales; the popular 4xe hybrid model had been eligible for the full $7,500 credit.

Fortunately, if you're in the market for an EV, the federal tax credit is not going away immediately. Buyers can still take advantage of it if they take delivery before Sept. 30, 2025. Several EVs and plug-in hybrids meet the criteria for federal tax credit eligibility. Here are ten that you should consider buying before the tax credit gets eliminated in September.

All on this list are eligible for the full $7,500 federal tax credit until Sept. 30, 2025. We sourced performance data from manufacturer websites and EV range data from the EPA.

10 Acura ZDX

Acura revived the ZDX nameplate for its first EV. It's a midsize crossover, and like its Honda Prologue sibling, the ZDX runs on GM's Ultium platform that underpins the Chevrolet Blazer EV. It offers up to 500 horsepower, in Type S guise, and up to 313 miles of EV range.

Acura ZDX Specs

The ZDX starts at an MSRP of $64,500 for the rear-wheel-drive base model. The AWD version starts at $68,500, and the Type S begins at $73,500. So, all ZDX trims are currently below the $80,000 threshold to be eligible for the federal tax credit. Tax credits had potentially been pushing the price below that of the Honda CR-V hybrid.

9 Cadillac Lyriq

The Lyriq is Cadillac's first fully electric vehicle. It's a midsize crossover, and like the Acura above, it also uses the GM Ultium platform. The Lyriq offers up to 326 miles of range in single-motor and 319 miles of range in dual-motor AWD form. Buyers can level up to a 500 horsepower version.

Cadillac Lyriq Specs

The Lyriq has been a strong seller for Cadillac, thanks in part to the federal tax credit. All Lyriq trims are currently eligible for this, but it's not the only Caddy, as the new new three-row Visitiq crossover also squeezes in below the threshold in it's base configuration.

8 Chevy Equinox EV

The Chevrolet Equinox EV is not the sexiest electric vehicle on the market, but the compact crossover does deliver perhaps the best range for dollar spent value offer in the affordable realm. The Equinox offers 319 miles of EV range, which is impressive for a base trim starting at $33,600.

Chevrolet Equinox EV Specs

The Equinox EV is eligible to receive the full $7,500 federal tax credit. That can bring the base price down to an effective $26,100, bringing every Equinox EV trim below $40,000. The tax credit has also helped Chevrolet offer affordable, sub-$300/month lease deals. The federal tax credit also affects the Blazer EV and certain Silverado EV configurations.

7 Ford F-150 Lightning

The Ford F-150 pickup is America's most popular vehicle, so the automaker wanted to recreate that in the electric realm. Thus, the Blue Oval released the F-150 Lightning, which is, quite literally, an F-150 that happens to be electric. It offers up to 580 hp, 775 lb-ft of torque, and 320 miles of range with the Extended Range battery. It can also serve as a backup generator for your home, thoughthis does require a pricey home power setup.

Ford F-150 Lightning Specs

The F-150 Lightning starts at $54,780. However, buyers must upgrade to the $69,995 Flash trim to get an extended-range battery pack. All F-150 Lightning trims below Platinum are eligible for the federal tax credit, and Ford has been relaying that full credit to customers to bring the F-150 Lightning's costs down.

6 Genesis Electrified GV70

The Genesis Electrified GV70 isn't the most elegant name for an EV, or any car really. But if you can overlook that, it's a seriously impressive package. It resembles the standard GV70, especially since there is EV badging, but it does feature a faux grille. Although it rides on a different platform, it still utilizes the same electric motors and 350 kW fast-charging technology found in other Hyundai group EVs. It packs 429 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque, and that's before you send it into boost mode.

Genesis Electrified GV70 Specs

The Electrified GV70 starts at $64,380 MSRP with the base AWD trim. Buyers can level up to the Prestige AWD for $75,350. All trims are eligible for the federal tax credit, which keeps the base MSRP under $60,000.

5 Honda Prologue

We've already mentioned the Honda Prologue, so you might remember that it is a midsize electric crossover that rides on GM's Ultium crossover platform. The Prologue borrows some design language from the Civic. It has dramatically less power, though, topping out at 288 hp in AWD spec, but it can deliver up to 308 miles of range in FWD form.

Honda Prologue Specs

The Prologue starts at $47,400 and tops out with the $57,900 Elite trim. So, all versions are eligible for the $7,500 tax credit. Affordability has been a key part of the EV's appeal, as it can bring the effective cost of even the most expensive Prologue trims under $55,000.

4 Hyundai Ioniq 5

The Hyundai Ioniq 5 is a former World Car of the Year Award winner and one of the best all-around EVs on the market, with a combination of style, practicality, and advanced EV tech. The 2025 refresh introduces a larger 84-kWh battery pack, offering up to 318 miles of range in RWD and 290 miles in AWD, along with helpful additions such as a rear wiper. And it can deliver up to 641 hp in bursts with the Ioniq 5 N version.

Hyundai Ioniq 5 Specs

The Ioniq 5 starts at $42,600 for the SE Standard Range base model. However, most buyers will opt for the $46,650 SE version with the larger battery pack. The federal tax credit, eligible for all Ioniq 5 trims, can push the base price below $40,000. Hyundai has also been using the credit to offer affordable lease deals.

3 Kia EV6

The Kia EV6 shares the E-GMP platform and electric motors with the Ioniq 5. Kia opted for a sleek and sporty style over a retro-futuristic one, so the EV6 is a bit more wagon-like in its design than the Ioniq 5's hatchback shape. The EV6 offers up to 319 miles of range in RWD and 295 miles in AWD. The 577-hp EV6 GT can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just 3.5 seconds.

Kia EV6 Specs

The EV6 starts at $42,900. Trims range up to $63,800 for the EV6 GT model. All trims are eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit, which can bring the base price to $35,400. Kia has been using the federal tax credit to pass on outstanding lease deals to customers as part of a bid to boost sales.

2 Kia EV9

The EV market needed an affordable, three-row family crossover, and Kia delivered it with the World Car of the Year Award-winning EV9. This model delivers stately and rugged style, performance (up to 379 hp and 516 lb-ft of torque), and the Hyundai E-GMP platform's class-leading charging tech. It can seat up to seven passengers or offer more than 80 cubic feet of cargo space. Kia is set to level things up even further with the EV9 GT.

Kia EV9 Specs

The Kia EV9 starts at $54,900 MSRP, which can be pushed below $50,000 using the federal tax credit. Kia has also been using the federal tax credit to offer affordable EV9 lease deals.

1 Tesla Model Y

The Model Y is Tesla's smaller crossover. It offers the same combination of range (up to 357 miles), style, and affordability as the Model 3, but in the crossover body style that most buyers prefer. And it has become the best-selling Tesla and best-selling EV by a wide margin. It was America's fourth best-selling overall vehicle in 2024, with more than 400,000 units sold. And it just received an overhaul for 2025.

Tesla Model Y Specs

Tesla has used the federal tax credit to keep the Model Y very affordable. The starting price currently sits at $44,900 MSRP for the RWD model and $48,900 for the AWD model. This brings both cars under $42,000 with the federal tax credit factored in. Every Tesla Model 3 and non-Cyberbeast Cybertruck is potentially eligible for the federal tax credit.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/10-evs-you-should-buy-before-trump-s-big-beautiful-bill-comes-into-effect.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:21:11.028297

It’s not part of the planned wetlands or other investments the city and its implementing partners are pouring into the rest of South Baltimore.
One of those critics is Nicole Fabricant, an anthropology professor from Towson State University and environmental activist working in South Baltimore.
“The toxicity in South Baltimore has to do with the overburden of industries down there.
But they also do not deserve it less than Curtis Bay,” Rogers said.","BALTIMORE—Gravel crunched underfoot as Brad Rogers and Andrew Forbes stepped onto a narrow strip carved along a portion of the Patapsco River shoreline that’s slated to be a 9-acre tidal wetland.

At the site, just south of the Hanover Street Bridge, crews had been at work since last September, constructing a gravel sill that would hold new grasses. A muddy platform wound its way farther into the river, its edges blurring against the waves shimmering in the distance.

It’s just one small part of a multimillion dollar initiative jointly implemented by South Baltimore Gateway Partnership, a nonprofit led by Rogers, and its partner environmental engineering firm, Greenvest, where Forbes is a senior project manager.

Rogers slowed to observe the scene.

“When we were out here this morning, literally three hours ago, the tide was higher and this whole area was flooded—everywhere that looks like puddles now was ankle- or chin-deep water,” he said. “The gap in the breakwater allows water to flood in and out, and that sort of flushing connects what happens here with the Bay—fish, microorganisms and protein all exchanging between the wetland and open water.”

This stretch of shoreline along Hanover Street is one of four major sites under the Middle Branch Resiliency Initiative, a massive project aiming to breathe ecological life back into a river battered by decades of industrialization, stormwater runoff and urban neglect. When completed, the Hanover Street site will have low and high marshes and intertidal mudflats designed to absorb tidal surges, stabilize the shoreline and provide refuge to wildlife.

Rogers says the ecosystem is already attracting native species.

“The first thing I see is a beautiful great blue heron wading through a tidal pool we just finished building,” Rogers recalled. “We had just put the sand out, just planted the grasses. The water flooded in, and that heron—it just knew it was home. To one side was a snowy egret fishing, to the other, Canada geese with goslings nibbling in the grass.”

Only a year ago, the site was choked with trash and thick tangles of non-native plant species. Now, dead trees salvaged through the city’s Camp Small debris reuse program serve as perches for birds and carbon-rich habitat for organisms further down the food chain.

Construction began in the middle of last year with a stone sill snaking out roughly 150 to 200 feet from the shore into the Patapsco. Forbes and his team filled the interior with layers of sand and organic matter, a task made difficult by centuries of sedimentation at the river’s mouth. “The sub-base here is soft,” Forbes said. “You need more stone and sand than you think because it sinks. A lot of it disappears beneath the surface to create stability. You can’t see it, but it’s there, doing the work.”

But this spring, just as the marsh was beginning to take shape, a letter arrived. It was from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

“The notification itself was very curt: There will not be money for the construction phase. No guidance, no next steps, just very factual. No explanation,” Rogers recalled.

Rogers’ nonprofit was originally awarded $32 million for wetlands restoration through FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, a major climate resilience funding mechanism launched during the Biden administration. But in April, the Trump administration abruptly terminated BRIC, calling it a “wasteful, politicized grant program” in an official statement.

For Rogers, the sudden clawback could have delivered a major blow to the entire Middle Branch initiative. But his organization has been able to receive funding from multiple sources.

“We’ve built a program that goes beyond any one project. And having secured the BRIC grant brought us credibility to pull together a robust pipeline of multiple different avenues for raising capital funds,” Rogers said. “That grant provided a significant amount of credibility that accelerated our ability to grow the program.”

By Rogers’ estimate, the Hanover wetlands will be 90 percent complete by late summer. “All of these pieces are beginning to come together, and by the end of the summer, it’ll be 90 percent of the way there, and we’ll call the project done. And then a year later, the plants will be that much more grown in, and before you know it, it’ll just look like a giant natural system that’s always been there,” he said.

As he and Forbes walked back toward the exit, Rogers paused again near the new plantings. “This used to be a dumping ground,” he said. “Now, it’s becoming a refuge.”

Weathering FEMA’s Pullback

Brad Rogers remembers the moment clearly. He had already secured the funding. Years of planning and coalition-building were finally yielding results. Then the email came. FEMA was rescinding $26 million of the $32 million it had awarded his organization.

The BRIC cuts didn’t just affect his nonprofit—they impacted nearly a billion dollars’ worth of flood prevention and climate resilience projects across the Chesapeake Bay watershed.

“The BRIC program was yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program. It was more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters,” the agency said in a statement announcing the cuts.

Of the $1 billion provided to BRIC under the 2021 Infrastructure and Jobs Act, around $882 million will be returned to the U.S. Treasury or reapportioned by Congress in the next fiscal year, according to the agency’s plans. Trump administration officials noted that their predecessors disbursed $133 million to about 450 applicants since the establishment of the grant program, according to the statement.

FEMA did not respond to multiple requests for comments about the rescinded funds and the likely impact an abrupt withdrawal of federal support will have on the projects already underway throughout Maryland and elsewhere in the country.

In Maryland, the cancellation affected dozens of planned upgrades to stormwater systems, shoreline protections and ecological buffer zones in vulnerable communities. Local governments were left scrambling to identify replacement funds.

“There are many organizations and governments across the country which are in far worse conditions than we are,” Rogers said. “I try to be respectful of the difference between what other people are facing and what we are.”

Rogers credited his nonprofit’s resilience to its structure—a unique hybrid of public and nonprofit actors—and its ability to forge alliances quickly.

The BRIC clawbacks hit Maryland’s small towns particularly hard. Crisfield, a low-lying city on the Eastern Shore, lost key funding for long-awaited stormwater upgrades and a planned flood barrier meant to shield the town from chronic flooding. The project, a key element of Crisfield’s Southern Flood Mitigation Plan, was years in the making and is now on hold.

In Baltimore City and across the county, sewer rehabilitation projects designed to reduce flooding and backups have been paused. Plans to invest in green infrastructure in historically neglected neighborhoods have similarly stalled.

Overall, the loss of funds has reverberated across rural towns and urban centers statewide. In places like Crisfield, where tax bases are small and adaptation plans depend on outside dollars, the absence of federal support has left little room to maneuver. In cities, climate and public health goals are impacted, forcing leaders to prioritize short-term goals over longer-term resilience projects.

FEMA’s decision has left communities scrambling for alternatives, as extreme weather events take a toll across Maryland and sea level rise threatens the gains made after decades of investments in restoring the Chesapeake Bay watershed.

Rogers found it ironic that funds meant for resilience got pulled at a time when climate change and extreme weather events are making those investments all the more important.

Despite the loss, new support came from the state of Maryland, local agencies and private philanthropies. Smaller grants were put together. Some projects were scaled back. But the work continued.

Rogers felt that walking away from South Baltimore’s disinvested neighborhoods like Cherry Hill and Westport when the going got tough was not an option. It was important to show up, he said, even when it’s hard.

Reconnecting the River

A few hundred feet across the Hanover Street Bridge, traffic zipped past with the usual urgency of a weekday afternoon.

Rogers and Forbes stood still at the curb momentarily, scanning the oncoming traffic before crossing. On the other side, a narrow passage gave way to a shrubby clearing. Shoulder-high weeds brushed their sleeves as they pushed through, arriving suddenly into a wide, barren field plowed by heavy equipment.

This was Patapsco Delta East, Rogers said, the second wetlands site under construction as part of the Middle Branch Resiliency Initiative. Unlike the gentle feel of the Hanover Street project, this site was defined by blunt force.

Excavators punctured the humid air, lifting tangled mats of mud and debris and dumping them to the side. A heap of dead reeds, storm-battered logs and trash sat exposed on one side of the landscape. The smell of earth and diesel came through in waves.

“This whole area used to be one giant mat of phragmites,” Rogers said of the invasive reeds, pointing toward the center of the site, where crews had begun carving a long, curving channel through the wetland base. “Invasive species choked the entire area and made it completely inaccessible.”

Here, between Hanover Street and Potee Street, was this stretch of land, left behind as a sort of ecological dead zone decades ago when overpasses were built around it. “There was no interaction between this site and the river,” Rogers explained. “So you have fish going up and down the river that have no access to the wetland over here that impaired its ecological function.”

That’s starting to change.

The team had been sculpting what Rogers called a “tidal gut”—a winding, sinewy channel meant to reintroduce the daily tidal flows from the Patapsco into the site. “It moves like a snake,” he said, adding that this design allows the tidal channel to naturally connect the restored wetland with the river, enabling water, fish and nutrients to flow in and out with the tides.

The regular exchange also brings in microorganisms and nutrients, creating a dynamic ecosystem that’s constantly refreshed by the Bay’s waters.

By planting new marshes and opening water channels to reconnect the ecosystem, the project aims to restore more than 12 acres of impaired land to the Middle Branch tidal system. “Instead of dumping more soil, like we did across the bridge, here we’re excavating,” Rogers said. “We’re removing the disconnect. That’s the work.”

Construction at the site broke ground in late February, just weeks before FEMA rescinded climate infrastructure funding. Though the Delta East site survived the cut, in part because construction on it had already begun, the clawback did affect the broader project. Designs for a fourth site, farther along the river’s bend, didn’t make it beyond the planning phase.

The MedStar Harbor Hospital site to the north will be the third major wetland restoration under the initiative and is due to break ground later this year. While each site differs in many ways, they fit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle: one extending into the river, another carved back into land, the third reclaiming industrial fill.

The Road Ahead

After leaving Forbes, Rogers drove past the edge of the cleared wetland, now behind metal fencing, and headed north toward the Baltimore Peninsula. In the distance, tower cranes dotted the skyline.

New apartment complexes came into view alongside the shimmering waterfront and the global headquarters of the activewear brand Under Armour. The development in the last couple of years has been unrelenting, spurring the wave of gentrification that now defines this part of South Baltimore.

But not every neighborhood has seen similar growth. Curtis Bay, for instance, a working-class community on the city’s southern edge, sits isolated from these developments. There, residents live next to coal terminals and chemical tanks.

The neighborhood shares the same Patapsco shoreline that remains vulnerable to storm surge and has eroded during decades of disinvestment. It’s not part of the planned wetlands or other investments the city and its implementing partners are pouring into the rest of South Baltimore.

The question of whether Curtis Bay should develop as an industrial zone, as some city authorities have previously suggested, or thrive as a residential community has eclipsed its development. Residents and local community groups have long urged officials to enforce stricter environmental controls to mitigate toxic pollution and invest in civic amenities. But the tension has resulted in lost opportunities, advocates believe.

As Inside Climate News previously reported, communities across South Baltimore have also questioned whether the city’s environmental restoration projects—however ecologically beneficial—also reinforce existing inequities by concentrating benefits where capital investment is already flowing. Despite its habitat gains, some critics feel the Middle Branch Resiliency Initiative aligns too comfortably with real estate timelines and branding efforts surrounding the waterfront redevelopment.

One of those critics is Nicole Fabricant, an anthropology professor from Towson State University and environmental activist working in South Baltimore. She believes that the problems in neighborhoods like Curtis Bay and Cherry Hill stem from the legacy industries, including coal piers and the giant incinerator that burns much of the city’s trash.

“I’m always skeptical of some of these shiny projects that often extract from the poor and benefit the wealthy. It’s like a quick-fit techno solution to deeply structural problems,” Fabricant said. “If instead we actually held corporate polluters accountable, and enforced some of the environmental regulations at the state level, we would see much cleaner, healthier environments.”

Fabricant said projects like shoreline improvements are attractive to public and private funders because they avoid going after corporate polluters, which is where the problem lies, in her opinion.

“The toxicity in South Baltimore has to do with the overburden of industries down there. But a lot of these bigger environmental projects are not willing to take on big polluters or to really identify the corporate entities that benefit from cheap lands and demobilize communities,” she said. “Until we actually enforce those environmental regulations, we’ll continue to see these techno quick fixes that aren’t really addressing the root problems.”

In the end, she said, a project like the Middle Branch Initiative, designed to restore the natural world lost to decades of industrialization, is unable to reconnect the Black communities in places like Curtis Bay because its very design prevents it from doing so. That, critics like Fabricant say, is one of its biggest weaknesses: a structural limitation that risks deepening the very inequities it aims to heal.

Rogers is aware of the criticism.

He said that while Curtis Bay is a part of South Baltimore and touches the Patapsco River, it is not adjacent to the Middle Branch and is outside the remit of their work. “This is the difficult reality: reimagining 11 miles of shoreline is incredibly ambitious and difficult, but it also doesn’t resolve all the problems faced across South Baltimore,” he said.

Rogers said he understood the concern that the initiative might only restore environmental quality for people who can afford to live in gentrifying areas where the people the project purports to serve once lived. “These are legitimate worries, and we should always be attentive to them,” he said, adding that the two ongoing projects and the one waiting to break ground at MedStar Harbor Hospital will benefit the Brooklyn and Cherry Hill neighborhoods, home to low-income Black and brown communities with limited shoreline access.

“Cherry Hill and Brooklyn do not deserve environmental quality and resiliency more than Curtis Bay. But they also do not deserve it less than Curtis Bay,” Rogers said.

For disinvested neighborhoods like Curtis Bay, which is not served by the Middle Branch Resiliency Initiative, the abrupt cut in federal funding has made a bad situation worse. Since FEMA pulled the plug on BRIC grants and similar uncertainty surrounds the promised funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, smaller community nonprofits and well-funded groups like Rogers’ alike are left to navigate a rapidly changing funding landscape.

But there’s opportunity in every crisis. Rogers’ nonprofit just secured new funding from the Maryland Department of the Environment—$17 million in total—through the Chesapeake Bay Restoration Fund and the Comprehensive Flood Management Program.

The infusion, he said, reinforces his belief that the Middle Branch strategy can align multiple priorities at once: flood protection, habitat renewal and water quality. “We sit at this interesting nexus point between resiliency, restoration, recreation, water quality and habitat. Depending on the site and the funder’s goals, we’re able to mix and match and tap into multiple simultaneous funding streams,” he said.

As he drove past the new townhomes along Cromwell Street, Rogers pointed out another reality.

“Many people who are well educated in environmental science or climate science may be able to talk for hours about carbon sequestration, but wouldn’t know what to do with an excavator,” Rogers said. “You really need to have a team that brings together all of those disciplines—estimating costs, designing, permitting and building the project. Those are essential components of being effective in the world.”

It’s a perspective he’s come to appreciate over years in the nonprofit sector—one shaped less by idealism and more by implementation. “Our state and local partners have been more interested in figuring out opportunities for collaboration than they even were in the past,” he continued, “because now they know that their budgets are going to be tighter, and so they have to think creatively about how to find new partners.”

While Rogers’ organization has weathered the first round of cuts, the broader picture remains fuzzy. Many community-scale nonprofits—especially those without in-house technical staff, grant writers or political access—are still left to ponder the fate of their canceled plans.

As he parked the car outside his office, Rogers glanced at his phone, already vibrating with a new string of messages. He exhaled, shifted the gear into park, and looked up once more toward the shimmering shoreline visible in the distance.

“It’s not easy,” he said. “But I’m glad it’s coming together.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Library-4-of-11-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 15:10:46.863582

Local residents are demanding better communication and transparency from the refinery.

The coalition is requesting a community meeting, an alert system, a 24/7 contact number, regular monitoring data reports, and neighborhood air quality monitors.

El Pasoans were left with little to no answers as huge black plumes of smoke overtook the city and flames burst through smokestacks at the Marathon Refinery in South Central.

""We deserve to know what is going on at the refinery,"" said Matthew Moriel, who lives in the Corbin-Sambrano neighborhood a few blocks from the refinery. ""We need to know if we need to be indoors and whether we need to turn off our swamp coolers to keep the polluted air from coming inside. It is unacceptable for a refinery in the middle of the city to be unreachable by those who live closest to its pollution.""

Large plumes of black smoke and flames started coming out of smokestacks from Marathon Refinery, located at 212 North Clark Drive near Alameda Avenue, about 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, July 8.

Moriel and other neighbors began calling the refinery for information on what was happening at the plant, but only heard from a security guard, who took a message. The neighbors never heard back from the refinery operators.

In an unnamed emailed statement, a Marathon Petroleum Corp. spokesperson told the El Paso Times the incident was caused by a power outage.

""Due to a power outage from a third-party provider on July 8, operating conditions at Marathon’s El Paso refinery made flaring necessary,"" the statement said. ""Flares are safety devices that allow for the safe combustion of excess gases during certain operating conditions.""

The company reported no injuries during the incident or harmful environmental impact on the area.

""Air monitoring was deployed as a precaution, and no off-site impacts were detected,"" the statement said.

Community asking for transparency, better communication

Houston in Action’s Sembrando Esperanza Coalition, a group led ""by residents of 11 of the most historic, resilient, polluted, and hottest working class neighborhoods in El Paso County,"" is asking for more transparency and communication from Marathon Refinery leaders, a news release from the coalition said.

“Even if what happened (July 8) does not result in a violation of state or federal rules, it does not mean the fumes were not toxic and dangerous to our health, environment and pets,"" Sembrando Esperanza Coalition's Climate Justice and Civil Rights organizer Veronica Carbajal said. ""Further, we won’t know what was in the fumes or how it affected our air quality until the monitoring data is released. In the meantime, nearby residents deserve to know what precautions to take and who to call in such emergencies.”

The group is asking for Marathon Refinery to:

Host a meeting for neighbors to attend and discuss their concerns

Create an alert system for neighbors close to the refinery

Provide neighbors a number they can call 24/7 and speak with a human being every time neighbors see, hear or smell something out of the ordinary

Regular reports of the monitoring data

Air quality monitors to be placed in the neighborhood, including those that read the carcinogens released by the refinery

Marathon Refinery officials said they already have policies in place to alert residents to any dangers.

""The safety of workers, our neighbors, and the environment is our top priority,"" Marathon Refinery's statement said. ""If a situation potentially requires action by members of the community, we advise designated local authorities, following pre-established frameworks, and then work with those authorities, media and others to convey information to the community as needed.""

What is flaring?

The El Paso refinery ""processes sweet and sour crude oils into gasoline, distillates, heavy fuel oil, propane, asphalt, and NGLs (Natural Gas Liquids) and petrochemicals,"" according to an annual report by the company.

Flaring is the process of burning off excess or waste gases that cannot be processed or reused, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Flaring safely releases excess pressure from refinery equipment, especially during emergencies or maintenance.

Flaring can release harmful pollutants like sulfur dioxide and particulate matter, a study published in the Science research journal. The pollutants released by flaring can lead to health issues like asthma, heart attacks, and premature deaths, particularly in communities near refineries, the study states.

Data on the types and quantities of pollutants released during the El Paso Marathon Refinery's flaring have not been released.

Under President Donald Trump’s new tax-cut law, many people for the first time could also claim a tax deduction for interest on their vehicle loans.

The new tax break will be available even to people who don’t itemize deductions. But there are some caveats that could limit its reach. The vehicles must be new, not used. They must be assembled in the U.S. And the loans must be issued no sooner than this year, to list just a few qualifications.

Here are some things to know about the new auto loan interest tax deduction:

Candidate Trump promised an auto loan interest tax break

Trump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and “stimulate massive domestic auto production.”

The idea made it into the big tax-cut bill passed by Congress, which Trump signed into law July 4.

The law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of interest payments annually on loans for new American-made vehicles from 2025 through 2028. It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles. But it only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes.

The tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns. But the deduction phases out for individuals with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 or joint taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000. Those earning more cannot claim the tax break.

Millions of buyers could benefit, but millions of others will not

U.S. automobile dealers sold 15.9 million new light vehicles last year, a little over half of which were assembled in the U.S, according to Cox Automotive. It says around 60% of retail sales are financed with loans.

After excluding fleet and commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, an estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year, if purchasing patterns stay the same, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.

It’s the assembly plant, not the automaker’s headquarters that matters

The tax break applies to vehicles assembled in the U.S., no matter where the company making them is headquartered. All Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. are assembled in this country. But so are all Acura brands, the luxury model of Japanese automaker Honda.

Last year, 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled in this country, according to Cox Automotive. But customers wanting the tax break will need to pay attention to specific models. While the Ford Mustang is assembled in Michigan, the Mustang Mach-E is built in Mexico.

General Motors assembles all of its Cadillacs in the U.S. But just 44% of its Chevrolets sold last year were assembled in the U.S., and just 14% of Buicks, according to Cox Automotive. That’s a lower U.S.-assembled rate than Honda (60%), Toyota (52%) and Nissan (48%), which are all headquartered in Japan.

Taxpayers could save hundreds of dollars a year

The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year, because interest payments on loans are frontloaded while principal payments grow on the back end.

At a 9.3% interest rate, an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said. The tax savings would be less on a loan at 6.5%, which is the rate figured into calculations by the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.

Some people also could see a reduction in state income taxes

Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction.

On a tax form, the auto loan deduction will come before the calculation of a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. That’s an important distinction, because many states use a taxpayer’s federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for figuring their state income taxes. If that income figure is lower, it could reduce the state taxes owed.

The verdict is out on whether the tax break will boost sales

At Bowen Scarff Ford in Kent, Washington, customers started asking about the auto loan tax deduction before Congress had even taken a final vote on the tax-cut bill, said General Manager Paul Ray. So he decided to promote it on the dealer’s website.

A website ribbon exclaims: “CAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE” while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump’s tax-cut law.

“I think it’s going to help incentivize vehicle purchases through this year,” Ray said.

Celia Winslow, president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, concurred: “For some people deciding — should I buy it, should I not — this could be something that tips the scale.”

Others remain skeptical. According to Smoke’s math, the average annual tax savings is smaller than a single month’s loan payment for a new vehicle.

“I don’t think it moves the needle on somebody on the fence of buying a new vehicle or not,” Smoke said. “But I think it could influence their decision to finance that vehicle instead of paying cash or instead of leasing a vehicle.”",https://myfox8.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/07/AP25191678216150-e1752413902118.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-13 13:08:00.901041

Despite countries pivoting and investing in clean energy sources in the last decade, global greenhouse gas emissions still hit new highs in 2023.

This infographic ranks the top 15 countries by carbon emissions, based on 2023 data from The Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research. It shows national-level greenhouse gas emissions in gigatonnes of CO₂ equivalent (GtCO₂e).

Together, these nations account for nearly 80% of global emissions.

This reflects its role as the world’s manufacturing hub, with heavy reliance on coal and high industrial output.

In fact, China’s share of global manufacturing is also about the same (27%) showing the direct consequence of becoming the world’s production base.

The country has committed to peaking emissions before 2030, but its growth trajectory poses challenges.

This also means any progress on climate will hinge heavily both on China’s policy decisions and global consumer behavior.

U.S. and India Round Out the Top Three Carbon Emissions

The U.S. is the second-largest emitter at 6.0 GtCO₂e (11.3% of global emissions).

And this is with around 330 million people, or one-fourth of China’s population. It’s per capita emissions (15 tCO₂e) is also top-15 in the world.

In stark contrast, India ranks third with 4.1 GtCO₂e (7.8%), lower than the U.S., with four times the number of people. However, its emissions are rising as its economy and population grow, following a similar path Western industrialized countries took to prosperity.

Smaller Countries with Outsized Carbon Emissions

Nations like Saudi Arabia, Australia, and Canada appear further down the list, but have some of the highest per capita emissions globally.

Their rankings reflect both resource-driven economies and energy-intensive lifestyles.

Meanwhile, countries like Brazil and Indonesia have large emissions tied to economic development, deforestation, and land use.

But lurking between every generation of Civic Type-R, and the championship-winning 1986 Williams Honda F1 car is something small, mysterious, and that has our full attention. It's called the Super EV concept, and Honda isn't saying much about it.

The little electric has already been getting real-world testing in the UK, complete with that quirky and delightful purple camouflage. Honda wants to bring it to market around the world, and it could make the perfect replacement for the already-missed Honda e. One that might be a lot easier to sell than that tech-heavy electric. Now we've finally gotten up close and personal with the Super Honda.

Super EV's First In-Person Appearance

Our first look at the Super EV came a month ago. Honda launched a teaser campaign for the vehicles it planned to bring to Goodwood, and while the robot lawnmower and the production Prelude were neat, it was the tiny purple box in front of the Palace of Westminster that really grabbed our eyeballs.

Yes, it's just another tiny electric city car. There's only so much an automaker can do with that footprint, but somehow Honda has given this a load of character. Even though we can't even really see the bodywork, this little car screams fun. Well, more like shouts fun quietly but adorably.

Honda called it an ""all-electric urban concept vehicle."" Now it is saying the car ""realizes both practical usability and the 'joy of driving' only Honda can offer.""

Check out those TE37s. This is proof positive that the design works on anything, at least anything built after about 1975. They're a 16-inch size, which is delightfully compact. No, we don't think a production car will use this wheel, but we can dream, right?

Funky Design, Affordable Features

Up close, the Super EV looks just as adorable and funky as it did in Honda's shots. We can see more of it now, too, including just how boxy those arches are, the cuts in the doorlines, and the Honda badge in the nose. Honda is hiding the interior away from us, sadly, but that's probably because it's an early prototype.

Honda's also hiding many of the details, but we did manage to get them to admit it's front-wheel drive with a single electric motor, will be a direct successor to the Honda e, and will be far more affordable. Things like the conventional door mirrors are key in achieving that affordable price point, although the exact figure Honda is targeting is still a secret.

Why does Honda think this one could work when the Honda e couldn't? This car looks like it will be more cost-effective than the e. While that other Honda was another adorable electric, it was loaded with high-tech and expensive goodies. Cameras instead of side mirrors, for example, and screens that ran from pillar to pillar inside the cabin. And yes, those are rear drum brakes. On a car this size, it doesn't matter. Regen does most of the work, and drums are cheaper. Even some Audi EV models that cost tens of thousands more have rear drums for exactly those reasons.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/honda-super-ev-concept-goodwood-3.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:23:35.539924

Mr. Wright said the wind and solar projects have produced “more expensive electricity,” incentivized by lucrative government subsidies.
This intermittent use raises the cost of energy, Mr. Wright said.
In Connecticut, a significant portion of rising consumer electric bills is dedicated to funding green energy projects.
“They are going to be saved the outrageous costs from the additional offshore wind,” Mr. Wright said.","Energy Secretary Chris Wright has heard a lot of doomsday predictions about the rollback of wind and solar subsidies in President Trump’s sweeping tax cut bill.

He has one simple answer: “They’re just wrong.”

Mr. Wright, a former fracking executive with roots in solar and geothermal, said intermittent renewables are a costly impediment on the nation’s electrical grid, and the sooner they are replaced by reliable sources such as natural gas, coal or nuclear, the faster costs will come down.

“If you look at the places that have spent the most subsidies and built the largest amount of wind and solar, the more cheap energy you put on our grid, the more expensive the grid becomes,” Mr. Wright said in an interview with The Washington Times.

The cost of cutting taxes in Mr. Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill is paid for in part by axing a slate of subsidies for green energy projects, including wind and solar, by 2026.

The elimination of the renewable subsidies, the Joint Committee on Taxation determined, will save nearly $500 billion over ten years.

But opponents warn it will kill jobs, hike energy bills and ultimately weaken the power grid by discouraging future wind and solar projects, which will slow the growth of grid capacity as demand rises. Or, they warn, solar and wind projects will move ahead but at a higher, unsubsidized cost that will be passed along to ratepayers.

Sen. Ron Wyden, who authored many of the tax subsidies, called the cuts “an outright massacre” for wind and solar.

“Not only will hundreds of thousands of Americans who work in clean energy lose their jobs right away, individual families and businesses of all sizes nationwide will get clobbered with higher utility bills,” the Oregon Democrat said.

The media coverage has been overwhelmingly dire, honing in on states like Minnesota, which have invested heavily in wind and solar projects, and turning to clean energy advocates for assessments on how these states will be impacted by the cuts.

San Francisco-based Energy Innovation, which advocates for ending fossil fuels, calculated that subsidy cuts would increase annual energy bills in Minnesota households by $6 billion between 2025 and 2034.

“This is due to higher dependence on fossil fuels and higher fossil fuel prices,” the organization wrote in an analysis of the legislation.

Mr. Wright said the wind and solar projects have produced “more expensive electricity,” incentivized by lucrative government subsidies.

Natural gas, he said, “is just by far and away, the cheapest source of electricity today.”

California, for example, ditched coal and natural gas for wind and solar, and imports its renewable power from Utah and Nevada, among other states. Florida went in the opposite direction, investing in the construction of natural gas pipelines.

“California’s electricity prices today are twice as high as Florida’s. California has by far the largest population of any state in the country. They produce less electricity than Florida does,” said the energy secretary.

On average, the cost of onshore wind and solar is cheaper than fossil fuels, but they only produce power some of the time and require nuclear, coal and natural gas to rev up at night, when it’s cloudy or when the wind is not blowing. This intermittent use raises the cost of energy, Mr. Wright said.

Wind turbines and solar arrays take up more land than non-renewable energy plants and require new transmission lines.

“You really have to maintain two grids,” Mr. Wright said. “When it’s the middle of the day, when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining, all the other plants have to turn down to accommodate the wind and sun. Then they’ve got to be turned back up. And that is not an efficient way to run huge machinery. You have to operate your existing grid less efficiently than before, and you have to pay for a second grid.”

Mr. Wright said the tax cut legislation will steer states away from adding renewables to the grid and drive them to build reliable sources that run all the time.

“You still have the ability to generate electricity in all these states. They’re just not going to keep adding to that secondary, parasitic, more expensive grid,” he said.

In Minnesota, subsidized costs of wind and solar climbed even after passage of the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which implemented many of the tax credits for new renewable projects now targeted for elimination in Mr. Trump’s bill.

More than a third of the state’s energy is produced by renewables. A state law requires utilities to produce 100% of their electricity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2040.

The Center of the American Experiment, a conservative think tank in Minnesota, found that rising wind and solar prices have made them the most expensive sources of electricity in the state “by a substantial margin.”

It calculated that electricity produced by new wind projects costs twice as much as electricity from existing coal plants.

The cost of electricity from new solar projects in the state was triple the cost generated by existing coal plants, the group found. It blamed rising prices for wind turbines and solar panels.

Many states have shifted to renewables to reduce emissions and convert to clean energy produced by solar and wind.

In Connecticut, a significant portion of rising consumer electric bills is dedicated to funding green energy projects. Gov. Ned Lamont signed a law in 2022 mandating that the state achieve a zero-carbon electrical grid by 2040.

The ambitious plan is blamed in part for the state’s skyrocketing energy bills, although green energy groups say the real blame lies with global warming, which they say has caused extreme weather events and ultra-hot summers.

Mr. Wright said Mr. Trump’s January executive order blocking most new offshore wind projects along the eastern seaboard will spare Connecticut ratepayers even higher utility bills in the future.

Offshore wind is one of the most expensive forms of energy on the planet, he said.

Connecticut energy bills are among the highest in the nation and were expected to increase when the offshore wind projects went online. Eversource, a main provider of power in New England, projected offshore wind would cost nearly $100 per megawatt hour, which is almost double the cost of energy provided by the state’s Millstone Nuclear Power Plant.

“They are going to be saved the outrageous costs from the additional offshore wind,” Mr. Wright said.

Mr. Wright said the high energy costs in the northeast will be reduced by the Trump administration’s revival of a natural gas pipeline project extending from the Marcellus Shale gas fields in northern Pennsylvania to New York and into markets in New England, where consumers pay the highest electricity rates in the nation.

“New England has expensive energy for choices, and the biggest choice they’ve made is just to not have enough connection to the natural gas pipeline network,” he said.

Critics warn that if states abandon solar and wind for natural gas, it would take several years for the permitting and construction of new natural gas plants and much longer to build nuclear power plants. This could leave electrical grids without enough energy and consumers on the hook for higher prices.

Mr. Wright said states will have to change regulations to allow for the expansion of natural gas, which could happen faster now that subsidies for wind and solar are headed for a quick phase-out under the new tax cut law and Mr. Trump’s executive orders.

“Ultimately, if they don’t build all the offshore wind and all that, you’ll probably see an expansion in natural gas-generated electricity,” he said.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/06/02/Alaska_Trump_Energy_Oil_Field_Tour_13733_c0-207-4964-3102_s1200x700.jpg?05818a1aae4a18625e6d2f3787522970c4e058bd,N,,2025-07-13 11:18:45.020922

If you have to build one then it's way longer. All this chaos is costing us jobs. Companies that don't feel safe to invest are canceling programs due to uncertainty. Then they're laying people off due to lack of work.

EVs are priced taking the tax credit into account, and with huge margins in comparison to ICE cars, so I wouldn't be surprised if out the door prices end up being more or less the same after the credit goes away. The cost of LFP batteries is projected to drop to $50 a kwh by the end of 2025, which means EVs will hit manufacturing cost parity with ICE cars.

I'll admit EVs still have a ways to go for apartment dwellers or people without access to overnight or work charging, but for many homeowners, we spend less time at charging stations than you spend at the gas station.

Here's a scenario. I used to fill up 1-2x per week in my ATS. I drove a lot, about 20k a year. I recently got an EV. I upped my driving even more and now i'm driving 24k a year. In one entire year, i spent 18 minutes total at supercharger stations. The rest was simply plugging my car in while it sit and while i sleep in my driveway. I think homeowners(or anyone with easy access to overnight charging) should think of it this way, ""If i left every morning with 3/4 tank, how often would I need to visit the gas station"". For me the answer to that was 2x the whole year. I imagine for most people that would be between 4-8x per year.

A lot of ICE owners try to think of things like you need to go out of your way to charge and you need to wait until you're empty to start charging, but you don't charge like that

EVs were taking off and the infrastructure was coming very soon at the previous rate.

Here are some things to know about the new auto loan interest tax deduction:

Candidate Trump promised an auto loan interest tax break

Trump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and “stimulate massive domestic auto production.”

The idea made it into the big tax-cut bill passed by Congress, which Trump signed into law July 4.

The law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of interest payments annually on loans for new American-made vehicles from 2025 through 2028. It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles. But it only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes.

The tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns. But the deduction phases out for individuals with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 or joint taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000. Those earning more cannot claim the tax break.

Millions of buyers could benefit, but millions of others will not

U.S. automobile dealers sold 15.9 million new light vehicles last year, a little over half of which were assembled in the U.S, according to Cox Automotive. It says around 60% of retail sales are financed with loans.

After excluding fleet and commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, an estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year, if purchasing patterns stay the same, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.

It’s the assembly plant, not the automaker’s headquarters that matters

The tax break applies to vehicles assembled in the U.S., no matter where the company making them is headquartered. All Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. are assembled in this country. But so are all Acura brands, the luxury model of Japanese automaker Honda.

Last year, 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled in this country, according to Cox Automotive. But customers wanting the tax break will need to pay attention to specific models. While the Ford Mustang is assembled in Michigan, the Mustang Mach-E is built in Mexico.

General Motors assembles all of its Cadillacs in the U.S. But just 44% of its Chevrolets sold last year were assembled in the U.S., and just 14% of Buicks, according to Cox Automotive. That’s a lower U.S-assembled rate than Honda (60%), Toyota (52%) and Nissan (48%), which all are headquartered in Japan.

Taxpayers could save hundreds of dollars a year

The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year, because interest payments on loans are frontloaded while principal payments grow on the back end.

At a 9.3% interest rate, an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said. The tax savings would be less on a loan at 6.5%, which is the rate figured into calculations by the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.

Some people also could see a reduction in state income taxes

Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction.

On a tax form, the auto loan deduction will come before the calculation of a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. That’s an important distinction, because many states use a taxpayer’s federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for figuring their state income taxes. If that income figure is lower, it could reduce the state taxes owed.

The verdict is out on whether the tax break will boost sales

At Bowen Scarff Ford in Kent, Washington, customers started asking about the auto loan tax deduction before Congress had even taken a final vote on the tax-cut bill, said General Manager Paul Ray. So he decided to promote it on the dealer’s website.

A website ribbon exclaims: “CAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE” while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump’s tax-cut law.

“I think it’s going to help incentivize vehicle purchases through this year,” Ray said.

Celia Winslow, president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, concurred: “For some people deciding — should I buy it, should I not — this could be something that tips the scale.”

Others remain skeptical. According to Smoke’s math, the average annual tax savings is smaller than a single month’s loan payment for a new vehicle.

“I don’t think it moves the needle on somebody on the fence of buying a new vehicle or not,” Smoke said. “But I think it could influence their decision to finance that vehicle instead of paying cash or instead of leasing a vehicle.”",https://www.cbs17.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2025/07/AP25191678216150-e1752413902118.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-13 11:20:32.298693

Conclusion: A Lithium Cornerstone for the EV Age Thacker Pass is not just a mine—it's the first nail in the coffin of U.S. lithium dependency.","The U.S. electric vehicle (EV) revolution hinges on one critical factor: domestic control of critical minerals like lithium. Lithium Americas' Thacker Pass Project in Nevada is now the linchpin of this ambition, combining secured funding, strategic partnerships, and federal incentives to position the U.S. as a self-sufficient player in the lithium supply chain. With construction ramping up and a 2027 operational target, investors are presented with a rare opportunity to profit from the intersection of energy independence, EV demand, and geopolitical risk mitigation.

The Funding Firewall: DOE Loans and Private Investments Secure the Supply Chain

Thacker Pass is no longer a speculative project—it is a fully funded, shovel-ready juggernaut. The $2.26 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), approved under the Biden administration's Critical Mineral Strategy, will see its first draw in Q3 2025, with the remaining funds staged to cover construction through 2027. This public backing is paired with a $250 million strategic investment from Orion Resource Partners, which closed in April 2025, and a $100 million cash infusion from General Motors (GM). Together, these moves have created a funding “firewall” to shield the project from market volatility and geopolitical disruptions.

The DOE's involvement is particularly critical. The loan includes terms requiring domestic content for equipment and labor, directly aligning with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives. Lithium Americas' focus on local jobs—2,000 direct construction roles—and partnerships with the North America Building Trades Unions ensure compliance while bolstering U.S. manufacturing ecosystems.

GM's Stake: A Direct Pipeline to EV Demand

GM's 38% equity stake in Thacker Pass is more than a financial bet—it's a strategic play for EV supply chain dominance. The automaker has secured a 20-year offtake agreement for 100% of Phase 1's 40,000-tonne lithium carbonate output, enough to power 800,000 EVs annually. This partnership eliminates middlemen, reducing costs by 15-20% compared to spot-market lithium procurement.

For investors, GM's involvement is a guarantee of demand. As EV sales grow at a 25%+ CAGR through 2030, Thacker Pass's production will directly feed into GM's battery factories (e.g., Ultium Cells' $7 billion investment in Ohio). This symbiosis positions Lithium Americas as a de-risked play on EV adoption, insulated from lithium price swings through long-term pricing agreements.

The IRA Multiplier Effect: Tax Credits and Geopolitical Risk Mitigation

The Inflation Reduction Act's $30 billion in clean energy incentives supercharges Thacker Pass's value. Lithium Americas qualifies for IRA credits tied to domestic production, including:

- 40% investment tax credit for facilities using union labor and local materials.

- Battery credits for EVs using U.S.-sourced lithium, which could add $1,500–$7,500 per vehicle in subsidies for GM.

These incentives create a virtuous cycle: Thacker Pass's lithium enables U.S.-made EVs to claim IRA credits, while the IRA's tax breaks lower project costs. Meanwhile, the project's proximity to Nevada's “Lithium Loop” (from mining to recycling) ensures it becomes a hub for domestic battery supply chains, reducing reliance on Chinese lithium refining.

Timeline and Risk Mitigation: A 2027 Milestone with Safeguards

Construction is on track to meet its late 2027 completion target, with:

- 60% of engineering already complete (90% expected by year-end).

- Structural steel fabrication underway, with first installations in September 2025.

- Risk mitigation via a limestone quarry (to cut costs) and a 75% local cost base (labor/services), minimizing tariff exposure.

While regulatory risks linger (e.g., tribal land disputes), the project has secured permits and court rulings supporting its path forward. Lithium Americas' cash reserves ($446.9M as of March 2025) provide further financial cushioning.

Investment Thesis: Buy the Dip Before 2027's Payoff

Lithium Americas' stock (LAC) has underperformed lithium peers recently, reflecting near-term losses from construction costs. However, the 2027 operational ramp-up is the inflection point. Key catalysts include:

1. Q3 2025 DOE Loan Draw: Signals execution strength.

2. 2026 Earthworks Completion: A physical milestone for investors.

3. GM's Production Ramp: Lithium sales will begin flowing into earnings by 2028.

Investment Strategy:

- Buy on dips below $5.50/share (current ~$6.20), targeting a 2027 valuation of $10–12/share.

- Hold for the long term: Thacker Pass's 40+ year mine life and expansion potential (up to 100,000 tpa) create multi-decade earnings growth.

- Consider options or ETNs: Lithium ETFs (e.g., LIT) offer diversification but lack the pure-play upside of LAC.

Conclusion: A Lithium Cornerstone for the EV Age

Thacker Pass is not just a mine—it's the first nail in the coffin of U.S. lithium dependency. With GM's demand locked in, DOE's financial and regulatory backing, and IRA incentives turbocharging returns, this project is a generational investment. For those willing to look past short-term volatility, the path to 2027—and dominance of the EV supply chain—is clear.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-13 13:07:52.880373

Among them, Rio Tinto's dual-state strategy in Arizona and Utah positions it as a pivotal player in reshaping the nation's mineral security. With President Trump's 50% copper import tariffs now in effect, domestic projects like Resolution Copper and the expanded Kennecott mine are set to capitalize on structural demand shifts. This article argues that Rio Tinto's investments represent a compelling opportunity to profit from both policy-driven market dynamics and the surging need for critical minerals.

The Tariff Tailwind: Manufacturing a Domestic Copper Renaissance

The Trump administration's 50% tariff on copper imports, effective August 1, 2025, marks a decisive shift toward reshoring critical mineral production. By penalizing imports from top suppliers like Chile and Peru—sources of 82% of U.S. copper imports—the tariffs create a $1.5 billion annual price advantage for domestic producers. This structural shift has already driven U.S. copper prices to a $5.60/lb premium over global benchmarks, a trend set to accelerate as global demand for clean energy infrastructure (electric vehicles, solar panels) outpaces supply.

Resolution Copper: A Game-Changer in Reducing Import Dependency

Resolution Copper, Rio Tinto's flagship project in Arizona, is poised to supply up to 25% of U.S. copper demand once operational by the late 2020s. With 1.6 billion metric tons of ore and a $61 billion projected economic impact, the mine's development hinges on a final August 2025 land transfer approval. This milestone follows a Supreme Court ruling dismissing Indigenous land claims, clearing a major legal hurdle. The project's block-caving technology and water-efficient design (using 5 gallons/lb of copper, half the industry average) also address environmental concerns, ensuring alignment with ESG priorities.

Kennecott's Role in Utah: A Steady Engine of Production

While Resolution Copper captures headlines, Rio Tinto's Kennecott mine in Utah remains the unsung backbone of its U.S. strategy. Producing 300,000 tons of refined copper annually, Kennecott's underground expansions (including the NRS project) will extend its lifespan to 2040. By integrating mining, smelting, and refining under one roof, Kennecott avoids tariff-driven supply chain disruptions, acting as a reliable domestic supplier for industries like construction and renewables.

Strategic Alignment with U.S. Critical Minerals Policy

The U.S. government's Critical Minerals Strategy, updated in 2025, explicitly names copper as essential for national defense and energy infrastructure. Rio Tinto's projects directly address this mandate:

- Geopolitical Security: Reducing reliance on foreign sources (82% of imports from politically unstable regions).

- Energy Transition: Copper's role in EV batteries (40 kg per vehicle vs. 20 kg in ICE vehicles) ensures steady demand.

- Tax Incentives: The Inflation Reduction Act's $369 billion clean energy tax credits further subsidize domestic production.

Why Invest Now? Timeline, Demand, and Risk-Adjusted Returns

Project Milestones: The August 2025 land transfer for Resolution Copper is a binary catalyst. If approved, construction begins by 2027, with first production by 2031.

Demand Surge: Global copper demand for EVs alone is projected to grow by 250% by 2030, per the International Energy Agency.

Risk-Adjusted Case: While permitting delays or legal challenges linger, Resolution's progress and the tariff-driven premium create a robust margin of safety.

Risks and Considerations

Permitting Delays: U.S. environmental reviews can stretch timelines, though Resolution's decade-long EIS process mitigates this risk.

Environmental Opposition: Tribal groups and green advocates may prolong litigation, though courts have consistently upheld the project's legal basis.

Global Oversupply: A potential copper glut in 2030 could pressure prices, though tariffs and domestic demand should cushion impacts.

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

During this real-life test of the battery base installed in Texas, it generated more than 6 GW of electricity on Friday evening, helping to stabilize the grid with less input from fossil fuel-powered plants that are typically used for managing load during peak times.

The robust performance of the large-scale battery energy storage systems in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid came without shutdowns like the one that happened in Southern Europe this spring, too.

After the global solar power installation reached 600 GW last year, and is on its way to hit 1 TW annually in the next few, storing all that energy for discharge in peak times has become a pressing question.

It is not clear what share of the storage battery projects in Texas is done with Tesla Megapacks. Just last August, ERCOT added 480 MW in battery storage projects to the grid, and these included Tesla's own BESS installed at its Gigafactory in Austin.

Its Megapacks still use Chinese LFP cells, though, of the type that are in popular mobile power stations like the Anker Solix C1000. So do most other grid-level battery systems in Texas, and even Tesla's intent to produce LFP batteries in America won't change that share in a meaningful way any time soon.

Texas is leading the country in the deployment speed of BESS projects coming online, and the installed US base is now second after China. Scale is important, as renewable energy sources like wind and solar might be one of the cheapest ways to generate electricity, but pairing all that energy with storage solutions quickly changes the calculus in favor of nuclear and others.",https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/Tesla-gigafactory-texas.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 15:11:06.905264

According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, marine energy, a term researchers use to refer to power generated from tides, currents, waves or temperature changes, is the world's largest untapped renewable energy resource.
Achieving six years in the water with constant operations is a ""very significant milestone"" that bodes well for the future of tidal energy, said Rémi Gruet, CEO of Ocean Energy Europe.
Scotland and the United Kingdom are global leaders in tidal energy.
With four turbines, MeyGen is considered the largest tidal energy project of its kind worldwide, said Johnson.","Submerged in about 44 yards of water off Scotland's coast, a turbine has been spinning for more than six years to harness the power of ocean tides for electricity -- a durability mark that demonstrates the technology's commercial viability.

Keeping a large, or grid-scale, turbine in place in the harsh sea environment that long is a record that helps pave the way for bigger tidal energy farms and makes it far more appealing to investors, according to the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. Tidal energy projects would be prohibitively expensive if the turbines had to be taken out of the water for maintenance every couple of years.

Tidal energy technologies are still in the early days of their commercial development, but their potential for generating clean energy is big. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, marine energy, a term researchers use to refer to power generated from tides, currents, waves or temperature changes, is the world's largest untapped renewable energy resource.

The MeyGen tidal energy project off the coast of Scotland has four turbines producing 1.5 megawatts each, enough electricity collectively to power up to 7,000 homes annually. Earlier this month, the Swedish company SKF announced that its bearings and seals on one of the turbines had passed the 6½-year mark without needing unplanned or disruptive maintenance. It has been working closely with the industry for a decade on design and testing.

Achieving six years in the water with constant operations is a ""very significant milestone"" that bodes well for the future of tidal energy, said Rémi Gruet, CEO of Ocean Energy Europe.

Scotland and the United Kingdom are global leaders in tidal energy. The MeyGen site, operated by SAE Renewables, has been sending electricity to the grid for about eight years.

There are very few tidal energy projects generating electricity continuously. Most have been tests and demonstrations, said Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development. Copping said there are still large hurdles to overcome before tidal energy can be adopted more widely, such as dealing with regulatory issues, potential environmental effects and conflicts with other ocean users.

Still, the Scotland project seems to have addressed the question of whether the turbines can last in seawater, added Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.

""I think they have checked the boxes,"" she said. ""Because skeptics, and that includes investors of course and governments, said, 'How on Earth are you going to operate these things especially for any length of time in this very tough environment?' And that's what I think they proved.""

It's very hard to take what is essentially a wind turbine normally found on land and put it under water, said Fraser Johnson, operations and maintenance manager at MeyGen. The record-setting turbine should keep going for at least another year before it needs to come out of the water for maintenance, he added.

The four turbines are in the Inner Sound of the Pentland Firth, a narrow channel between the Scottish mainland and Stroma Island known for strong tidal currents. Tidal energy systems need strong currents to make electricity efficiently. MeyGen plans to add 20 turbines in 2030 to produce more electricity, after needed upgrades to the electricity grid are finished. The site could eventually hold as many as 130 turbines that are more powerful than those at the site today.

The MeyGen site is in the open water, while another type of tidal project involves creating a dam-like structure called a barrage across tidal waters. With four turbines, MeyGen is considered the largest tidal energy project of its kind worldwide, said Johnson.

""It's a title we wish we didn't have. We want more, we want others,"" he said. ""Unfortunately others are having difficulty achieving what MeyGen has achieved.

The Long-Term Case: Moats, Cash Flows, and Dividend Resilience Despite these near-term headwinds, Enbridge's core strengths remain intact.
Investment Strategy: Hold for Income, Avoid Momentum Plays For income investors, Enbridge's combination of a high yield, stable cash flows, and a disciplined capital allocation strategy makes it a compelling buy-and-hold candidate.","Investors in Enbridge (ENB) face a classic conundrum: a company with a fortress-like balance sheet and a pipeline of regulated, cash-generating projects is currently trading at valuation levels that reflect little margin for error. While near-term risks—elevated debt, regulatory uncertainty, and overperformance—loom large, the stock's intrinsic value is underpinned by structural tailwinds. For income investors, the math remains compelling, but momentum traders should tread carefully.

The Near-Term Crosscurrents: Debt, Valuation, and Regulatory Overhang

Enbridge's debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.9x (as of Q1 2025) has drawn scrutiny, particularly as the metric includes partial contributions from recently acquired U.S. gas utilities. Management expects the ratio to improve toward its 4.5–5.0x target range as these assets contribute fully in 2025. However, the company's $2.8 billion in February 2025 senior note issuances—spanning 3-year to 30-year maturities—highlight its reliance on debt markets to fund growth.

Meanwhile, Enbridge's valuation metrics have stretched. At a trailing P/E of ~18x (vs. its 5-year average of 15x), the stock trades at a premium to peers like Kinder Morgan (KMI) and TC Energy (TRP). This premium reflects investor optimism about its $28 billion secured growth backlog, but it leaves little room for missteps. A misfire on regulatory approvals or a delay in projects like the Traverse Pipeline (pending permits for its 1.8 Bcf/d capacity expansion) could trigger a reassessment.

Regulatory risks remain a wildcard. In Canada, the newly elected government's stance on energy infrastructure—particularly the contentious Alberta-to-Prince Rupert pipeline—could introduce headwinds. In the U.S., state-level rate cases in North Carolina and Utah underscore the need for disciplined regulatory engagement to protect margins.

The Long-Term Case: Moats, Cash Flows, and Dividend Resilience

Despite these near-term headwinds, Enbridge's core strengths remain intact. Its Mainline expansion, a cornerstone of its growth strategy, is progressing steadily. The pipeline's record Q1 throughput of 3.2 million barrels per day (mbpd) signals strong demand from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, which Enbridge expects to grow by ~1 mbpd by 2035. Phase 1 of the Mainline Optimization—leveraging 150 kbpd of incremental capacity on the Flanagan South Pipeline—bolsters this narrative.

The company's regulated asset base—including its U.S. gas utilities and Canadian distribution networks—provides a predictable earnings stream. Regulated projects like the Birch Grove expansion (adding $400 million to the backlog) and the Traverse Pipeline are underpinned by cost-of-service models, shielding cash flows from commodity price volatility.

Crucially, Enbridge's dividend resilience remains a pillar of its appeal. With a 5-year average dividend growth rate of ~2%, the stock's ~5.8% dividend yield (as of July 2025) offers income investors a cushion against short-term price fluctuations. Management's reaffirmed 2025 DCF guidance ($5.50–$5.90 per share) underscores confidence in its ability to fund payouts even amid macro challenges.

Investment Strategy: Hold for Income, Avoid Momentum Plays

For income investors, Enbridge's combination of a high yield, stable cash flows, and a disciplined capital allocation strategy makes it a compelling buy-and-hold candidate. The stock's ~7–9% EBITDA growth through 2026 and its long-term 5% annual growth trajectory post-2026 suggest that total shareholder returns (TSR) will outpace short-term volatility.

However, momentum traders face a tougher calculus. The stock's ~18% YTD return in 2025 (as of July) has compressed its valuation cushion. Near-term catalysts—including regulatory outcomes for the Traverse Pipeline and the Southern Illinois Connector's open season results—could lead to sharp price swings. Without a catalyst to justify further upside, the risk-reward tilts toward caution.

The world's first intelligent grid-forming photovoltaic and energy storage power station, tailored for ultra-high altitudes, low-temperatures and weak-grid scenarios, has been connected to the grid in Ngari Prefecture, southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region.

In a landscape with an average altitude of about 4,700 meters, this pioneering energy storage system developed by tech giant Huawei, based in south China's Shenzhen, has rewritten the rules of power delivery in extreme conditions.

Situated on the edge of the region's power grid, Ngari has a high proportion of new energy installations but a weak grid -- connected to the main grid 500 kilometers away via a single 110-kilovolt line.

A 30MW solar power project's output was previously capped at 1.5MW. Moreover, equipment cooling and operation are hampered by air pressure and thin oxygen. The innovative new battery system, notably, has stepped in where conventional power solutions have fallen short.

As an engineering breakthrough, the station does not amount to mere storage units, but rather features digital power plants capable of creating stability -- generating their own voltage and frequency signals to improve the local grid infrastructure.

Now, the project's photovoltaic output has increased from the previous maximum of 1.5MW to 12MW.

This grid-forming tech has taken off in Xizang, with 2,522 MWh of grid-forming energy storage capacity built there in 2024, marking China's first large-scale application of such technology.

Also, it has gained global recognition. In Saudi Arabia, the grid-forming system has enabled the world's largest 100-percent new energy microgrid project -- which has been operating stably for over 21 months and has supplied more than 1.5 billion kWh of green electricity.

""Grid-forming technology has become essential for new energy power stations, crucial for ensuring grid stability and supporting the safe operation of modern power systems,"" said Zheng Yue, president of Huawei Digital Energy's grid-forming energy storage division. ■",,N,,2025-07-13 12:22:13.417000

Nextracker, a leader in solar tracker technology, is positioning itself at the forefront of this transition. By combining advanced hardware innovation, domestic manufacturing expertise, and a circular economy partnership with SOLARCYCLE, the company is redefining how solar energy systems are built, maintained, and recycled. For investors, this strategic alignment with global decarbonization goals and supply chain reshoring trends presents a compelling growth opportunity.

The Power of Advanced Tracker Technology

Nextracker's SMART Solar Trackers are engineered to maximize energy output while minimizing environmental impact. The NX Horizon-XTR series, for instance, features terrain-following capabilities that allow solar arrays to conform to uneven landscapes without costly grading or foundation modifications. In a 328 MW Texas project, this technology reduced foundation pile lengths by 27 inches and cut steel usage by 1,928,602 lbs, slashing construction costs by millions.

The NX Horizon Hail Pro, meanwhile, addresses extreme weather risks with rapid stow mechanisms and 75-degree tilt angles, reducing insurance costs and operational downtime in hail-prone regions. Paired with Nextracker's TrueCapture software suite, which includes AI-driven Zonal Diffuse algorithms, these trackers optimize energy yield by dynamically adjusting to cloud cover and terrain variations.

Domestic Manufacturing: Securing Supply Chains

Nextracker's commitment to domestic production is a strategic response to supply chain vulnerabilities and U.S. government incentives like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). By achieving 100% U.S. domestic content compliance for trackers, the company has secured a competitive edge in the booming North American solar market.

This focus on local manufacturing has fueled revenue growth. In FY2025, Nextracker reported a 18% year-over-year revenue increase to $3 billion, with bookings surpassing 26 GW. The IRA's production tax credits and domestic content requirements are expected to further boost demand, as projects relying on federal incentives will increasingly favor U.S.-made components.

Circular Economy: Closing the Solar Lifecycle Loop

Nextracker's partnership with SOLARCYCLE, a leading solar panel recycler, addresses a critical blind spot in the renewable energy lifecycle: end-of-life panel disposal. By ensuring panels are recycled into raw materials for new systems, Nextracker reduces waste and lowers the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) over time. This closed-loop model aligns with the EU's Circular Economy Action Plan and global ESG mandates, positioning Nextracker as a sustainability leader.

Investment Thesis: Riding the Renewable Wave

Nextracker's strategic moves—advanced tech, domestic manufacturing, and circular partnerships—align perfectly with two megatrends:

1. Global Renewable Targets: The International Energy Agency projects solar capacity must grow by 40% annually through 2030 to meet climate goals. Nextracker's high-efficiency trackers are critical to achieving this scale.

2. Supply Chain Reshoring: As governments prioritize domestic production, Nextracker's IRA-compliant facilities and partnerships (e.g., the Bentek Corporation acquisition for eBOS systems) create a moat against global competitors.

Risk Considerations and Opportunities

While Nextracker's trajectory is strong, risks include solar panel oversupply in some regions and geopolitical trade disputes. However, its focus on high-value, high-margin tracker systems—versus commoditized panels—mitigates pricing pressures. Additionally, its expansion into AI-driven predictive maintenance and terrain analytics could unlock new service revenue streams.

Conclusion: A Leader in the Renewable Transition

Nextracker is not just a tracker manufacturer—it's a solutions provider for the entire solar lifecycle. With a robust order backlog ($3.4 billion as of Q1 2025) and partnerships that reduce carbon footprints, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the $1.3 trillion U.S. clean energy market under the IRA. Investors seeking exposure to a decarbonizing economy and resilient supply chains should consider Nextracker as a core holding.

Recommendation: Buy Nextracker stock with a long-term horizon. Monitor its FY2026 guidance for further upside, particularly in international markets like Australia and Latin America.

The Idaho company designs small nuclear reactors that produce intense heat and electricity. These compact units serve manufacturing plants and isolated locations that need constant power without sending carbon into the atmosphere.

Nuclear power is derived from splitting atoms, which produces massive amounts of energy without a carbon output. Each NuCube system is built in a workshop and can be transported on a typical truck, unlike conventional nuclear plants, which often take years to construct.

The system stands out because it could replace natural gas in industries that need extremely high temperatures. Many manufacturing facilities still burn gas because solar and wind energy cannot generate enough heat for industrial processes. NuCube provides an alternative with around-the-clock clean power.

Switching from gas to nuclear means less pollution that causes breathing problems and contributes to rising global temperatures. It also adds another option to our clean energy mix alongside solar and wind, helping maintain power even during cloudy or windless periods.

A clear regulatory framework that secures investment and maintains the UK’s position as a global leader in offshore wind is now imperative.
OEUK’s Wind Energy Manager, Thibaut Cheret, said: 'AR7 must be the turning point in making UK wind ambitions a reality.","Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) has proposed key reforms to accelerate offshore wind generation following the government’s publication of its Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (REMA).

OEUK says the decision to take a national approach to pricing will encourage more wind energy investment to help the government hit its Clean Power 2030 targets and boost growth in the critical offshore energy supply chain.

The National Energy System Operator has given 5,000 energy projects in the queue for grid connections until 29th July to submit evidence for preferential treatment.

The move is intended to prioritise 'shovel-ready' projects and scrap the first-come, first-served approach, which has allowed speculative schemes to delay viable clean energy developments.

This proposal must be matched by reforms to the Contacts for Difference (CfD) scheme and planning system to ensure the next allocation round – AR7 – delivers the scale and pace needed.

OEUK’s analysis shows that to meet the CP30 goal of 95% clean power by 2030, the UK must deliver half of this target from offshore wind. This means at least 43 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity must be installed by 2030, but current projections fall short at just 35GW. The next three CfD rounds must therefore secure an additional 20GW- equivalent to powering around 15 million homes.

Only two offshore wind generation projects – GreenVolt in Scotland and East Anglia Two – have been supported by the government’s CfD scheme since 2022.

A clear regulatory framework that secures investment and maintains the UK’s position as a global leader in offshore wind is now imperative.

Offshore wind is one of the UK’s greatest energy success stories – generating low carbon electricity at scale, creating jobs, and revitalising coastal communities.

Fixed-bottom turbines, with so-called monopiles attached to the seabed in shallower waters, have driven the UK’s rapid growth of wind energy generation to date but floating wind turbines using newer technologies, can be anchored in deeper waters with stronger wind resources, opening new areas for development.

They also have fewer environmental constraints than fixed-bottom projects and can progress more smoothly through the consenting process.

Speed and clarity to reform grid access and a more transparent approach with equal treatment for fixed and floating wind farms would give developers and the supply chain greater confidence to invest.

OEUK’s key recommendations for AR7 and beyond:

• Support for offshore wind: Provide assurance that sufficient funding is available for both fixed and commercial floating wind projects over the next three years, including projects to decarbonise offshore oil and gas operations, strengthen the UK supply chain, and create export opportunities.

• Grid and consent reform: Improved risk sharing between developers and grid network operators plus increased administrative capacity and streamlined planning to reduce delays to grid connection. Compensation should be offered for unexpected hold ups.

• Eligibility and investment: Reform eligibility criteria to allow both fixed and floating wind projects that have not received full consent to bid in the auction, extend CfD contracts from 15 to 20 years and introduce a well-balance cap and floor to transmission charges to improve investor confidence, lower subsidies and reduce costs to consumers. Introduce a well-balanced cap and floor to transmission charges.

OEUK’s Wind Energy Manager, Thibaut Cheret, said:

'AR7 must be the turning point in making UK wind ambitions a reality. That means enabling floating wind to compete on equal footing, unlocking grid access, and giving developers the confidence to invest at scale.

'We’re calling for clear eligibility rules that allow well-progressed but unconsented projects to bid, longer CfD terms to reduce costs to consumers, and a firm commitment to grid and consenting reform – including compensation for delays. These are the changes our members need to deliver the next 20GW.

'At the same time, we are working with our members to reduce project risk and borrowing costs as well as improving contractual relationships and promoting standardisation of modular wind turbine components to make them cheaper and faster to install.

'There is only one energy supply chain for offshore wind and oil and gas – and it cannot be allowed to decline. With the right reforms and a pragmatic energy strategy which supports homegrown oil and gas alongside the acceleration of UK renewables, the North Sea can remain a global energy powerhouse, supporting economic growth, jobs, and our climate goals.'

ScotWind: OEUK supports the ambition of the ScotWind leasing round and is calling for clarity on delivery timelines, grid access, and supply chain investment to ensure projects can rapidly move forward.

INTOG: OEUK backs INTOG schemes using wind energy to decarbonise offshore oil and gas production. We are urging government and regulators to ensure these projects are prioritised for grid access and CfD eligibility, and that planning processes reflect their dual role in emissions reduction and clean power generation.

Celtic Sea Round 5 of Celtic Sea wind auctions held last month (June) aims to unlock the potential for floating offshore wind off the coasts of South Wales and Southwest England. The Crown Estate has selected Equinor and Gwynt Glas to develop two 1.5GW floating wind farms. The leases come with grid connections already approved, but only two out of three leases on offer have been taken up.

TNUoS: Transmission Network Use of System Charges. Transmission has a cost which is paid by the generator and the user which appears in electricity bills. This cost is expected to increase dramatically in future years as more energy is brought from Scotland to England. The connection cost for the generator rises for remote areas but in heavily populated areas generators are paid to connect. The price difference must be adjusted with a proposed cap and floor system that would introduce an upper maximum cost to Scottish projects.

Review of electricity market arrangements (REMA): The government is still to announce the full outcome of its REMA consultation beyond the already published decision on zonal pricing. OEUK is calling for introduction of ‘deemed contracts for difference’ (based on potential, not actual output). This would mean wind energy producers being paid according to their potential capacity in a system that would give producers the opportunity to benefit from high global wind energy prices when they are available and keep a proportion of the additional profits

In repealing the carbon rule, the Trump administration is ensuring that our country’s electric grid will be more reliable and that America can continue to remain an economic superpower in the century ahead.","One of the drivers of these disruptions in the electricity market has been the EPA’s regulatory overreach under the Biden administration. This has been the case with its carbon rule, which would have shut down the nation’s fleet of coal power plants despite warnings from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation that more than half of the United States is at risk for electricity shortages over the next five years.

The risk of electricity shortages is being fueled by the explosion in electricity demand from artificial intelligence and the new data centers required to power this technology. An Energy Department report found that the amount of U.S. electricity consumed by data centers is expected to jump from 4.4% in 2023 to between 6.7% and 12% by 2028.

While electricity providers and grid operators have been talking about how to prepare for this massive demand spike, EPA regulations have made their job even more challenging. For example, the carbon rule would have illegally forced utilities to either shift generations away from coal, install expensive and unproven technology on existing coal plants, or shut the plants down altogether. Already, more than 120 coal units across 32 states are now scheduled to shut down within the next five years, unless steps are taken to stop these retirements. The carbon rule would have made matters even worse.

The goal of the Biden carbon rule was to make the U.S. reliant on wind and solar power, but such a dramatic transition carries heavy risks to the reliability of our grid.

We can look to the recent blackouts in Europe as a warning for us here in our country. For example, Spain has pursued aggressive policies to transition its grid to renewables. On April 16, the country boasted that for the first time, and for just a few minutes, renewables were delivering 100% of the nation’s electricity. Just 12 days later, a grid failure led to a prolonged blackout that plunged the country into darkness for days.

Solar and wind are intermittent sources of electricity because they, unlike coal, lack the capabilities necessary to serve as baseload sources of power capable of meeting demand at all hours and in all weather conditions. And it is reliable, dispatchable power that will be required to meet the demands of data centers, which operate 24/7.

In addition to hurting our nation’s electric reliability, the Biden-era carbon rule also undermines our national security. While premature coal retirements shrink America’s power supply, China is rapidly building new coal plants to strengthen its grid and expand its economy.

WHY THE KREMLIN HAS DELEGATED ITS TRUMP REBUKES TO STATE MEDIA

China, which already has the world’s largest coal fleet, plans to build another 420,000 megawatts of coal power. With these additions, China’s coal fleet will be almost 10 times larger than that of the U.S. Coal’s resurgence in China and other countries including India underscores how taking America’s coal fleet offline would make little impact on global greenhouse gas emissions. Today, the U.S. power sector is responsible for just 3% of global carbon emissions.

The growth of AI and other advanced technologies will require the U.S. to build new sources of electricity generation, but at a minimum, we need to stop needlessly retiring our existing coal fleet. In repealing the carbon rule, the Trump administration is ensuring that our country’s electric grid will be more reliable and that America can continue to remain an economic superpower in the century ahead.

Passive air cooling, as seen in the original Nissan Leaf, is simple and cost-effective, but its cooling ability is limited.
Cold plates are usually made of aluminum alloy, stainless steel, or copper and can cool one pack of cells or two.
Ford's F-150 Lightning also uses cold plates, but places battery packs in aluminum enclosures rather than steel.
The gist is that passive air cooling has gone the way of dodos, active air cooling is almost extinct, and liquid cooling is the still-thriving dominant species.","EV battery cooling tech has come pretty far in the last 30 years. The GM EV1, for instance, was reengineered in 1999 with an air tunnel to properly cool its optional nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries, but it still couldn't be sold in Arizona because the battery still got too hot. Now, however, we have advanced cylindrical, prismatic, and pouch-style lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries with liquid cooling (typically ethylene glycol, a.k.a. antifreeze) and active air solutions to handle environmental extremes — even in Arizona.

Passive air cooling, as seen in the original Nissan Leaf, is simple and cost-effective, but its cooling ability is limited. Active air cooling employs fans or chilled air from the HVAC system, and is still the method used by the Lexus UX300e, though indirect liquid cooling can better tackle current EV power levels. Direct liquid cooling isn't used for consumer EVs because the batteries would need to make, well, direct contact with a liquid, and it would need to have zero electrical conductivity to avoid shorting the battery.

Most EVs use cold plates (also called cooling plates), which feature coolant passages strewn through a flat sheet of metal adhered directly to the bottoms of battery cells. Cold plates are usually made of aluminum alloy, stainless steel, or copper and can cool one pack of cells or two. Rivian, Hyundai, Ford, GM, and Lucid all use cold plates. Tesla, on the other hand, routes coolant pipes throughout the cells, which may be done so that its 4680 batteries can vent from the bottom in case of thermal runaway, or to be different and make this article longer.

Tesla's battery cooling has undergone quite a few revisions to improve temperature regulation of its cylindrical cells. In the Model S P85D, one coolant path chills 444 cells. The problem is that coolant gets quite warm by the end of its journey, especially given how many cells it must handle. So, for the P100D, Tesla switched to two paths that each cool 258 cells. In the Model S Plaid, 11 individual coolant pipes are responsible for just 144 cells each. Coolant passages also changed from being relatively straight up to 2017, meaning they contacted a small portion of each cell's side, to serpentine in 2018, dramatically improving the contact patch.

While Tesla has refined intra-cell piping, cold plates have two big advantages. First, cold plates allow the battery to have more cells packed horizontally. Second, as Peter Rawlinson of Lucid told Auto Evolution, cold plates in the remarkably quick Lucid Air Sapphire cool the battery more efficiently since they contact the bottom of the cell, or the anode, where much of the heat builds up. Either way, temperature monitoring ensures the battery stays in a safe, usable range.

Each automaker employs cold plates in its own way. Lucid uses a super-thin layer of adhesive to join the cells to each cold plate for the best possible thermal conductivity, while the Hyundai Ioniq 5 uses a comparatively thick adhesive that results in more distance between the cells and the plate. However, the Ioniq 5 also uses one massive cold plate rather than individual plates for each battery pack. Rivian uses cold plates too, but sandwiches them between the cells to cool two layers at once.

The Hummer EV, a vehicle larger than some buildings, places cold plates on top of individual battery packs in a gargantuan steel enclosure. These cold plates can become hot plates, warming the battery to the optimal temperature range when entering Watts To Freedom (WTF) mode, unlocking the full 1,000 hp. The Hummer's heat pump also chills the motors for peak efficiency.

Ford's F-150 Lightning also uses cold plates, but places battery packs in aluminum enclosures rather than steel. Not only is aluminum lighter, but it's more efficient at dissipating heat. Of course, the Hummer EV 3X doesn't care about the weight of steel because it makes 1,000 hp and a ridiculous 11,500 lb-ft of torque, if you listen to marketing, or a more realistic but still insane 1,000 to 1,100 lb-ft (if you go by Road & Track and Autoweek's reporting).

If a Hummer EV is like winning the torque Powerball, an extended range Ford F-150 Lightning at 580 hp and 775 lb-ft is still like winning a $500 a week for life scratch-off. Incredible, but not quite in the same power ballpark. Plus, if Hummers have to heat the battery in WTF mode anyway, steel's thermal properties might be irrelevant. Strange how the Hummer EV is the least efficient EV you can buy.

The huge variety of cooling solutions is mind-boggling, and detailing every system would result in a Dostoyevsky-length novel. The gist is that passive air cooling has gone the way of dodos, active air cooling is almost extinct, and liquid cooling is the still-thriving dominant species. Still, like Galapagos finch beaks, there's still plenty of micro-evolution happening, like GM's U-shaped prismatic batteries, and we have yet to see which changes help EVs adapt to our world the best.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/how-electric-vehicles-like-teslas-fords-gms-keep-batteries-cool/l-intro-1752183144.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:23:05.545757

Recent research suggests that natural hydrogen, continuously produced by the Earth’s crust, could power our planet for an astounding 170,000 years. This immense potential transforms the conversation around energy transitions, offering a tantalizing glimpse into a future powered by a resource that has been quietly accumulating for millions, if not billions, of years. But what is the reality of accessing this hidden treasure?

An Abundant Yet Largely Untapped Gas

Hydrogen today is pivotal in various industrial applications, such as ammonia and methanol production. It’s also heralded as a clean energy carrier, with the potential to power vehicles and energy grids. However, most of this hydrogen is derived from hydrocarbons, which emit greenhouse gases during production. Natural hydrogen, in contrast, forms without human intervention through geochemical reactions between specific rocks and water, emitting no carbon and requiring no external energy input. This naturally occurring hydrogen can remain trapped underground for thousands of years, creating potentially exploitable reserves.

While these reserves were once thought rare, recent studies indicate they might be widespread if we know where to look. This revelation could significantly alter our approach to clean energy, as natural hydrogen represents a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional energy sources.

“This Reactor Is a Game-Changer for America”: US Launches World’s First Nuclear Plant Producing Hydrogen, Triggering a New Era in Clean Energy

The Three Key Conditions for Deposit Formation

According to geochemist Chris Ballentine and his team, creating a natural hydrogen deposit depends on three critical elements: a production source, a reservoir for gas storage, and a geological barrier to trap it. Production typically results from geochemical processes, with the most common being the reaction of iron or magnesium-rich rocks with water, continuously releasing hydrogen underground.

The reservoir must be sufficiently porous to store hydrogen, while the cap rock, often composed of clays or salts, must prevent the gas from escaping. These criteria, familiar in the oil and gas industry, can now be applied to hydrogen exploration, opening new avenues for sustainable energy sourcing. Understanding these geological conditions is essential for identifying viable hydrogen reserves.

Certain geological formations are particularly conducive to hydrogen accumulation. These include ophiolites, which are ancient oceanic floors lifted to the surface, igneous provinces with volcanic rock, and ancient greenstone belts, some over three billion years old.

In the United States, attention is focused on Kansas, where an old rift zone rich in basalts may contain significant hydrogen reserves. In Albania, a vast reservoir has been identified within an ophiolite complex. These discoveries are attracting industrial interest from companies like Koloma, backed by Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy, and others like Hy-Terra and Snowfox, supported by major energy corporations.

“This Changes Everything Overnight”: New US Fuel Cell Simultaneously Generates Power, Stores Massive Energy, and Delivers Clean Hydrogen Without Compromise

A Parameter Not to Overlook: Bacteria

Despite the potential abundance of underground hydrogen, its exploitation is not guaranteed. Subsurface bacteria that consume hydrogen can significantly reduce available volumes. According to researcher Barbara Sherwood Lollar, environments conducive to these microorganisms are less promising for exploration. Understanding and mitigating this biological factor is crucial for assessing the true potential of natural hydrogen deposits.

A Roadmap for Exploration

The study offers a comprehensive synthesis of hydrogen formation and accumulation mechanisms, providing geologists and energy companies with a clear roadmap for exploration. It guides exploration campaigns toward areas most likely to contain economically viable deposits.

While uncertainties remain, particularly regarding the extractable quantity of natural hydrogen, the prospects are immense. An abundant, naturally renewing, clean resource already stored underground could make natural hydrogen a central player in the energy transition over the coming decades. What new developments will unfold as we continue to explore this untapped energy frontier?

For investors, the sector presents compelling opportunities in energy-efficient EV manufacturing and supply chains aligned with the government's priorities—provided risks like regulatory delays and cost volatility are managed.","The UK's automotive sector is undergoing a seismic shift, propelled by the government's £2.5bn DRIVE35 initiative and a suite of trade deals aimed at reclaiming its position as a global leader in zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) manufacturing. While the program promises to unlock £50bn in economic potential by 2030, investors must navigate a complex landscape of subsidies, energy costs, and regulatory hurdles to capitalize on emerging opportunities. This analysis dissects the strategic advantages and risks tied to the sector's transformation, offering actionable insights for investors.

Funding the Transition: Targeting Pain Points with Precision

The DRIVE35 program allocates £2bn for R&D in automotive and related sectors by 2030, alongside an additional £500m for scale-up grants (up to £20m per project). This funding directly addresses three critical pain points:

1. Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: By prioritizing battery production, gigafactories, and green hydrogen infrastructure, the UK aims to reduce reliance on foreign supply chains.

2. Private Investment Gaps: The £6.6bn target for private capital underscores the government's role in de-risking projects like battery manufacturing and software-defined vehicles.

3. Competitiveness: Scale-up grants for EV technologies (e.g., vehicle-to-grid systems) position UK firms to dominate emerging markets.

The program's focus on sectors like EV charging infrastructure (£400m allocated) and defense-aligned dual-use tech also creates niches for specialized firms.

Trade Deals: A Competitive Edge, but Not Without Hurdles

Recent trade agreements have slashed tariffs and expanded markets:

- UK-US Deal: Tariffs on cars exported to the US fell from 27.5% to 10%, benefiting luxury brands like Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin.

- India Deal: A 100% tariff reduction to 10% opens a booming market for high-end vehicles.

- CPTPP Access: Entry into the Trans-Pacific Partnership grants access to £12tn in markets, though automotive specifics remain under negotiation.

However, the EU-UK “reset” remains incomplete. Rules of origin ambiguities and lingering customs delays could undermine the 80% of UK car exports that still rely on EU supply chains.

The Energy Cost Conundrum: A Make-or-Break Factor

High energy prices threaten to negate the sector's potential. UK manufacturers pay up to four times more for electricity than US competitors, with battery producers in Scotland facing costs 20% higher than in Germany. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme aims to reduce industrial electricity costs by £35–40/MWh, but its narrow focus on battery production—excluding broader automotive manufacturing—leaves critical gaps.

Without extending relief to the entire sector, the UK risks losing investment to lower-cost regions like Spain or Poland.

EV Market Challenges: Lagging Demand and Policy Uncertainty

Despite £6.5bn in industry investments to boost EV adoption, sales fell 12.8% in early 2025, underscoring the need for urgent reforms:

- Tax Incentives: The Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) and Expensive Car Supplement (ECS) penalize EV buyers, costing the sector £360m annually.

- Regulatory Volatility: Past reversals on ZEV mandates have eroded industry confidence. SMMT estimates that halving EV VAT could shift 2m sales to electric by 2030.

The 2030 ICE phaseout remains at risk unless policies align with consumer affordability and charging infrastructure.

Unlocking the £50bn Potential: The Path Forward

To realize this economic ambition, the UK must:

1. Accelerate Energy Cost Reforms: Extend the competitiveness scheme to all automotive manufacturers, not just battery producers.

2. Fix the Tax Code: Remove punitive levies like the ECS and reinstate EV purchase incentives.

3. Streamline Regulation: Finalize the Subsidy Advice Unit's review of DRIVE35 grants (due August 2025) and align EU battery recycling rules to avoid trade barriers.

4. Invest in Skills: Scale up apprenticeships and visas for tech talent in AI and engineering.

Investment Strategy: Where to Focus

Opportunities to Watch:

- Battery Manufacturers: Companies like Britishvolt or those partnering with gigafactories (e.g., Tata's £1bn Somerset plant) stand to benefit from £5.8bn allocated to energy storage.

- EV Charging Infrastructure: Firms like EO Charging or Pivot Power, which operate nationwide networks, are critical to meeting the £1.4bn EV uptake goal.

- Software-Defined Vehicles: Startups developing autonomous driving or V2G tech may attract DRIVE35 grants.

Risks to Monitor:

- Energy Cost Delays: A failure to address Scotland's high tariffs or extend reforms could trigger capital flight.

- Policy Inconsistency: Fluctuating ZEV mandates or EU trade disputes could disrupt supply chains.

- Global Competition: China's dominance (31% of global vehicle output) and U.S. subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act require agility.

Conclusion: A High-Reward, High-Risk Journey

The DRIVE35 program and trade deals offer a clear roadmap for the UK to become a ZEV manufacturing powerhouse. Yet success hinges on resolving energy cost disparities, stabilizing policy frameworks, and accelerating EV adoption. For investors, the sector presents compelling opportunities in energy-efficient EV manufacturing and supply chains aligned with the government's priorities—provided risks like regulatory delays and cost volatility are managed.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-13 12:21:20.818869

Dr. Rubén Domínguez Maldonado from Anáhuac Mayab University told reporters that without scheduled blackouts, heat damage to lines and transformers would create more expensive repairs and longer Yucatán blackouts.
Residents report Yucatán blackouts occurring daily and lasting anywhere from a few hours to 14 hours.
Residents decided to close Calle 50A from 119 to 131, in protest after weeks of unreliable power and recurring Yucatán blackouts.","A summer of blackouts in Yucatán will extend into Monday as the Federal Electricity Commission schedules power cuts for 16 coastal communities. The planned blackouts will run from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m., though CFE said the work might take less than eight hours.

Temperatures along the coast are expected to reach almost 90°F / 32°C under sunny skies. Residents will be relying on Gulf breezes to stay cool.

The scheduled blackouts affect Progreso and surrounding areas. CFE said the work connects a new substation and modernizes the electrical system in response to ongoing power cuts that have plagued the region.

The announcement follows weeks of unplanned blackouts across Yucatán. Some neighborhoods in Mérida and Campeche have experienced frequent and prolonged power failures, leaving residents without electricity, clean water, or basic services. In southern Mérida, residents of the Zazil-Há and Cinco Colonias neighborhoods have endured constant Yucatán blackouts for two weeks, lasting several hours at a time.

Blackouts in Yucatán Follow Regional Pattern

Yucatán’s frequent blackouts, brownouts and appliance-killing power surges reflect chronic electrical infrastructure challenges that stretch back years. In May 2024, blackouts hit 21 of Mexico’s 32 states, forcing the National Energy Control Center to declare emergency conditions multiple times. Blackouts in Yucatán weren’t spared from the national crisis.

The CFE electrical network is stressed due to excessive demand for supply to mitigate the extreme heat that prevails during Yucatán blackouts. Local experts say the blackouts in Yucatán require long-term fixes. Dr. Rubén Domínguez Maldonado from Anáhuac Mayab University told reporters that without scheduled blackouts, heat damage to lines and transformers would create more expensive repairs and longer Yucatán blackouts.

Residents report Yucatán blackouts occurring daily and lasting anywhere from a few hours to 14 hours. The persistent have pushed some communities to protest. Residents decided to close Calle 50A from 119 to 131, in protest after weeks of unreliable power and recurring Yucatán blackouts.

Political Response Draws Criticism

President Claudia Sheinbaum’s June visit to Yucatán sparked controversy over her comments about the blackouts in Yucatán. She declared that “the opposition’s campaign about the lack of electricity in Yucatán is not in line with reality, since there is sufficient infrastructure.”

Her statement contrasted sharply with residents’ experiences of Yucatán blackouts. In communities like Cheumán, families with babies struggle to store milk and food for their children during extended blackouts in Yucatán. Local researcher Gina Villagómez Valdés documented cases where residents have been without power for days, with blackouts damaging their electrical appliances.

CFE has announced multiple infrastructure projects over the years to address blackouts in Yucatán with mixed results. In 2019, President López Obrador promised a new power plant during a Yucatan tour, declaring it would ensure “there will never be any blackouts” in the state. However, energy sector experts noted that this promised plant was not part of CFE’s strategic plan to address Yucatán’s frequent power failures.

CFE has invested over 151 billion pesos to improve energy supply and reduce blackouts in Yucatán, including plans for two combined-cycle power plants in Mérida and Valladolid. The plants were originally scheduled to begin operations by summer 2024 to help end Yucatán blackouts, but delays pushed timelines into the future.

The Yucatán state government now works with CFE on a plan to eliminate blackouts by 2027 and achieve energy self-sufficiency by 2030. Governor Joaquín Díaz Mena acknowledged that “Yucatán is facing a complex energy situation, especially during this season of extreme heat” that contributes to blackouts in Yucatán.

National Investment Plans Target Blackouts

The Mexican government presented a National Strategy for the Electricity Sector 2024-2030, planning to invest $23 billion in CFE to address nationwide power issues including Yucatán blackouts. CFE’s 2025-2030 plan includes 12 new power plants with combined capacity of 5,840MW across nine states. However, Yucatán isn’t among the states getting new generation facilities to directly combat blackouts in Yucatán.

To prepare for increased demand during summer 2025 and reduce blackouts in Yucatán, capacitor banks will be installed in seven substations in northern Quintana Roo, representing an investment of 194.39 million pesos ($9.32 million).

Beyond generation capacity, Yucatán blackouts stem from fundamental infrastructure problems. Aging infrastructure and “a mess of ancient wiring” continues to cause blackouts in Yucatán, with haphazardly installed power, telephone, and fiber optic lines characterizing most streets. CFE employees revealed that Yucatán blackouts during the hot season are inevitable due to overloaded connections in new subdivisions.

The communities affected by Monday’s scheduled blackouts include Progreso, Chelem, Chicxulub Puerto, Chuburná Puerto, Dzidzilché, San Ignacio, Misné Balam, Flamboyanes, Santa María Chí, Tamanché, Cosgaya, Komchén, Suytunchén, Kikteil, Xcunyá and Sierra Papacal.

CFE Director General Emilia Esther Calleja Alor recently visited the state and pledged to provide advance notice of future scheduled blackouts to help residents prepare for planned Yucatán blackouts. The commission emphasized these actions “seek to improve the energy infrastructure for the benefit of residents” and businesses in the coastal area affected by recurring blackouts in Yucatán.

For international visitors and residents, the ongoing Yucatán blackouts represent a significant infrastructure concern in a region that depends heavily on tourism and economic development. The peninsula covers roughly 70,000 square miles (181,000 square kilometers) and includes popular destinations like Cancún, Mérida, and the Riviera Maya, all affected by periodic blackouts.",https://yucatanmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CFEexpensive.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:22:44.318149

The energy audit training program offers multiple certification levels, including building science principles and building analyst technician certifications.
The sessions begin July 18 and Aug. 22, according to George Callas, founder of energy training firm Build Green Maine.
Trainees will work through basic electrical and construction certifications, learn the tools of the trade, and help install heat pumps in Wabanaki tribal communities.
The Sustainable Energy Team continues to meet monthly to discuss strategies for expanding the programs and finding non-federal partners.","For years, Wabanaki tribal communities faced a costly dilemma: pay outside contractors $500 to $1,000 per home for energy audits, or go without services that could slash utility bills for hundreds of tribal members.

Now, the federally recognized tribes in Maine are trying a different approach. They’re training their own members as energy auditors and heat-pump technicians, creating immediate cost savings and long-term career pathways that keep energy dollars flowing within the tribal communities.

“We don't want to go outside of the nations to get these services,” Kelsey Flores, coordinator of the Wabanaki Sustainable Energy Team, told Tribal Business News. “The overall goal is to feed into our resilience and our self-sufficiency.”

The workforce development strategy represents a shift toward self-sufficiency that has become even more urgent after the Environmental Protection Agency rescinded a $1.1 million grant in May that supported the tribes’ renewable energy programs.

The effort is led by the Wabanaki Sustainable Energy Team. The team is composed of representatives from four Native nations: the Penobscot Nation; the Passamaquoddy Tribe (with communities at Pleasant Point and Indian Township); the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians; and the Mi'kmaq Nation. The team also includes partners at the University of Maine.

The team is now offering two energy-related workforce development programs: energy audit training available free to members of the Penobscot Nation, and a three-week pre-apprenticeship program on heat pump installation for up to 20 members of the Wabanaki tribes.

The energy audit training program offers multiple certification levels, including building science principles and building analyst technician certifications. The sessions begin July 18 and Aug. 22, according to George Callas, founder of energy training firm Build Green Maine.

The training is conducted online, with Callas leading the courses and providing ongoing mentorship to help participants interested in launching their own energy audit businesses. Training costs are covered by the Penobscot Nation, and applications are still being accepted for the program through reaching out to Flores or by contacting Build Green Maine directly through their website.

The training is conducted online, with Callas leading the courses and providing ongoing mentorship to help participants interested in launching their own energy audit businesses. Participants in the program can reduce their home energy consumption by 25% and successful business owners could potentially audit hundreds of homes, Callas told Tribal Business News.

“There’s a couple of different degrees of accomplishment here,” Callas said. “When people come through and do training like ours, they often look around their own house and make changes, at the very least. Some people go on to be entrepreneurs, who will run with this and make it a business to provide this service for other people, or help contractors looking to install things like insulation and sealing.”

The heat pump training takes a different approach, focusing on construction trades and union careers. The three-week pre-apprenticeship program is open to Wabanaki tribal members or descendants who have a high school diploma or equivalent and a valid driver's license, according to Sam Boss, apprenticeship and workforce development director for the Maine chapter of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO). The program covers lodging, tuition and up to $150 in gas cards for selected trainees.

Trainees will work through basic electrical and construction certifications, learn the tools of the trade, and help install heat pumps in Wabanaki tribal communities. The program will train 20 people from across the Wabanaki nations, and applications are still being accepted through Flores with an Aug. 4 deadline.

Boss said the program prepares participants for union apprenticeships that offer paid training, benefits, healthcare and pensions.

“Usually, these pre apprenticeship programs are considered a first step on your pathway to getting into a registered apprenticeship with a union,” Boss told Tribal Business News. “[Those apprenticeships] are a great pathway into the trades, because you're not going into debt, you're getting benefits, great health care and a pension.”

Heat pumps have become increasingly popular in Maine, which has installed more than 100,000 of the energy efficient devices over the past decade — three times the national average, according to Bloomberg. The state’s push toward heat pump adoption has created growing demand for skilled installers.

The workforce programs are moving forward in this growing market, despite losing a primary funding source. Community action grants through the state of Maine have enabled Flores to stay in her position as coordinator and supported the energy audit training. The AFL-CIO partnership has enabled the August 11-29 heat pump training session to continue.

The University of Maine is pursuing a legal dispute to try to recover the EPA funding, according to Flores.

The funding loss highlighted the vulnerability of federal support and reinforced the need for economic strategies that don't depend on government programs, Flores said.

""It's really unfortunate to see how easy it is to strip away crucial funding that was set to positively impact these communities that have been historically underserved,"" Flores said.

But the setback hasn't derailed the long-term vision. The Sustainable Energy Team continues to meet monthly to discuss strategies for expanding the programs and finding non-federal partners. The ultimate goal is creating tribally-owned businesses in the green energy sector that can serve both tribal and broader markets.

“The Wabanaki Nations have always been and will always be resilient, so their energy, visions and goals will remain the same,” Flores said. “We are more than open to expanding our network, solidifying our partnerships, and really working with any partner that is willing to support these projects.”

The wind power industry acknowledges that the disposal of wind turbine blades is an issue.","United States president Donald Trump expressed his disdain for wind power during a meeting with his Cabinet recently, calling it an expensive form of energy that ""smart"" countries don't use.

His comments contained false and misleading information about the use of wind power in the U.S. and around the world, and came on the heels of an executive order he signed Monday that would end subsidies around ""green"" energy, reports The Associated Press.

Here's a look at the facts.

CLAIM: ""Wind is a very expensive form of energy.""

THE FACTS: Onshore wind is one of the cheapest sources of electricity generation, with new wind farms expected to produce electricity around US$30 per megawatt hour. This compares to a new natural gas plant, around $65 per megawatt hour, or a new advanced nuclear reactor, which runs over $80, according to estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Onshore wind farms cost less to build and operate than natural gas plants on average in most regions of the U.S., even without tax credits. Though-gas plants are available to produce electricity at any time of the day, unlike wind. Offshore wind is among the sources of new power generation that will cost the most to build and operate, at $88 per megawatt hour, according to the EIA.

While electricity rates have risen across the U.S. over the past decade, states that have added a significant amount of onshore wind power, such as Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma and New Mexico, have kept rates from rising as fast as other states, said Brendan Pierpont, director of electricity modeling at the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation. For example, the share of electricity generated from wind in Iowa increased from 15% in 2010 to nearly 60% of the state's electricity generation in 2023, while the state's electricity rates grew at a rate slower than that of 42 other states, his research found.

Wind power can be expensive if it's built where winds are weaker, but the United States is adding it in places with strong wind resources, he added.

""Wind should be seen as part of an overall portfolio of electricity system resources and is an important part of keeping costs down,"" he said Wednesday.

Trump has committed to increasing U.S. energy production, particularly fossil fuels. He signed an executive order Monday aimed at phasing out tax credits for wind and solar facilities.

CLAIM: Wind turbines are ""almost exclusively"" made in China, but President Xi Jinping told Trump they have ""very, very few.""

THE FACTS: China is the world's largest manufacturer of wind turbines, producing more than half of the supply. It is also installing them in China at a record pace. In total, China has 1.3 terawatts of utility-scale wind and solar capacity in development, which could generate more electricity than neighbouring Japan consumed in all of 2023, according to a report from the Global Energy Monitor released Wednesday. The report highlighted China's offshore wind development, calling China the undisputed leader in the offshore wind sector, though it also said coal and gas are still on the rise across China.

""The whole narrative that we're led to believe in the West is that China is building coal plants and that it's doing nothing for its carbon footprint,"" Tom Harper, partner at the global consultant Baringa, said Tuesday. ""So the surprising thing is China is building a portfolio of zero-carbon resources that are designed to not perfectly complement each other, but to work alongside each other to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.""

CLAIM: ""If you look at smart countries, they don't use it.""

THE FACTS: At least 136 countries and territories around the world use wind power to generate electricity, according to the EIA, with many countries growing the amount they produce. The top five markets for wind power in 2024 were China, the U.S., Brazil, India and Germany, while Uzbekistan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia represent the next wave of wind energy growth, according to the Global Wind Energy Council.

Council CEO Ben Backwell said 2024 marked yet another record year for wind energy growth, with the ""industry increasingly pushing into new regions.""

Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, disputed the idea that smart countries don't use wind power. China is soaring ahead in building a massive amount of wind power while Germany, the United Kingdom, Finland, Spain, Sweden, France and many other countries in Europe have large programs of wind construction, he said Wednesday.

""By cutting back on wind power development, the U.S. is ceding the lead to China in this important technology, and killing a lot of U.S. jobs,"" Gerrard said in an e-mail.

CLAIM: In New England, two whales washed up over 50 years, ""and last summer they had 14 washed up. Now, I'm not saying that's the wind farm that was built, that maybe it is right.""

THE FACTS: There are no known links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA says it analyzes the causes of death whenever possible, following the science and data. Unfounded claims about offshore wind threatening whales have surfaced as a flashpoint in the fight over the future of renewable energy.

The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm officially opened in 2024 east of Montauk Point, New York. The nation's second-largest offshore wind farm is under construction off the coast of Massachusetts. A five-turbine pilot project has been operating since 2016 off the coast of Rhode Island.

CLAIM: ""The birds are dying all over the place.""

THE FACTS: Turbines, like all infrastructure, can pose a risk to birds. However, the National Audubon Society, which is dedicated to the conservation of birds, thinks developers can manage these risks and climate change is a greater threat. An Audubon report found that two-thirds of North American bird species could face extinction due to rising temperatures.

In January, the nonprofit said responsible offshore wind development is a clear win for birds, the U.S. economy and the climate.

""While persistent myths claim widespread and devastating effects of offshore wind turbines on wildlife, the science tells a different story. Our findings clearly indicate that we can responsibly deploy offshore wind in a manner that still protects birds and their habitats,"" Sam Wojcicki, Audubon's senior director for climate policy, wrote in a January post. The organization also supports wind energy on land when it is sited and operated properly to minimize the impact on birds and other wildlife.

CLAIM: ""You can't take them down because the environmentalists don't let you bury the blades.""

THE FACTS: Wind turbine blades are challenging to recycle. They are designed for durability to withstand hurricane-force winds. However, the U.S. already has the ability to recycle most wind turbine materials, according to the Department of Energy. It issued a report in January that found 90% of wind turbines can be recycled using existing infrastructure, while new strategies and innovative recycling methods will be needed to tackle the rest.

The wind power industry acknowledges that the disposal of wind turbine blades is an issue. Danish wind energy developer rsted committed in 2021 to never sending turbine blades to landfill, instead reusing, recycling or otherwise recovering them.

United States president Donald Trump expressed his disdain for wind power during a meeting with his Cabinet recently, calling it an expensive form of energy that ""smart"" countries don't use.

His comments contained false and misleading information about the use of wind power in the U.S. and around the world, and came on the heels of an executive order he signed Monday that would end subsidies around ""green"" energy, reports The Associated Press.

Here's a look at the facts.

CLAIM: ""Wind is a very expensive form of energy.""

THE FACTS: Onshore wind is one of the cheapest sources of electricity generation, with new wind farms expected to produce electricity around US$30 per megawatt hour. This compares to a new natural gas plant, around $65 per megawatt hour, or a new advanced nuclear reactor, which runs over $80, according to estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Onshore wind farms cost less to build and operate than natural gas plants on average in most regions of the U.S., even without tax credits. Though-gas plants are available to produce electricity at any time of the day, unlike wind. Offshore wind is among the sources of new power generation that will cost the most to build and operate, at $88 per megawatt hour, according to the EIA.

While electricity rates have risen across the U.S. over the past decade, states that have added a significant amount of onshore wind power, such as Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma and New Mexico, have kept rates from rising as fast as other states, said Brendan Pierpont, director of electricity modeling at the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation.

The Japanese automakerNissan Raises $4.5 Billion to Ease Debt Pressure as EV Plans Slow Down has secured $4.5 billion through a fresh bond sale in U.S. dollars and euros, aiming to buy itself time and space to manage a growing pile of debt.

The funds will help Nissan refinance around ¥700 billion (roughly $4.76 billion) in debt due this fiscal year. It’s a necessary move for a company that’s facing rising costs, a tougher EV market, and a recent downgrade to “junk” status by all three major credit agencies.

Borrowing Now, Breathing Room Later

According to a term sheet seen by Reuters, Nissan issued three dollar-denominated bond tranches worth $3 billion, alongside two euro tranches totaling €1.3 billion ($1.52 billion). The bonds stretch over four to ten years, with interest rates between 7.5% and 8.125% — higher than usual, but expected for a company under pressure.

For Nissan, this isn’t just about numbers, it’s about regaining financial footing after a few difficult years.

EV Plans Postponed as Caution Sets In

Nissan’s ambitions in the electric vehicle space are being quietly scaled back, especially in North America. Two new electric SUVs, one for Nissan, the other for its luxury brand Infiniti — were supposed to roll out of its Mississippi plant by 2028. That timeline has now slipped to late 2028 or even 2029.

It’s a reflection of the bigger picture: EV demand isn’t as hot as it once seemed. Policy shifts in the U.S., especially the rollback of key tax credits and the introduction of a 25% tariff on vehicle exports to Canada, are making things even more complicated. In response, Nissan has pulled two EVs from its U.S. lineup and halted Canadian shipments altogether.

Holding Tight to Cash

To conserve money, Nissan has reportedly asked some of its suppliers to delay payments — a tough ask that hints at internal cash flow concerns. At the same time, its battery partner AESC has paused work on a new factory in South Carolina. That site was meant to support Nissan’s EV production, but with plans now in flux, the construction has been put on hold.

These choices aren’t easy, but they show a company trying to stay afloat while recalibrating its path forward.

Investors Still Hopeful, For Now

Interestingly, retail investors are staying optimistic. Social platform Stocktwits reported a spike in discussions about Nissan, with sentiment labeled “bullish” and message volume marked “extremely high.” Whether this is grounded in confidence or just speculation remains to be seen.

A Company at the Crossroads

Nissan’s story right now is about survival but also resilience. It’s juggling short-term financial fixes while rewriting long-term plans in a shifting industry. The $4.5 billion it just raised doesn’t solve everything, but it gives the automaker breathing room to regroup.

With AI-driven energy demands surging and hydrogen poised to become a cornerstone of the energy transition, Bloom's strategic moves in 2025 underscore its ambition to dominate both markets. However, the path is not without hurdles, including tariff pressures and competition from legacy energy systems.

Growth Engine #1: Fuel Cells for Data Centers – A Scalable Solution for AI's Appetite

Data centers are the unsung power hogs of the digital age, and their energy needs are exploding as AI workloads grow. Bloom's solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) offer a compelling alternative to grid-dependent power. Key advantages include:

- High Power Density: Up to 100 MW per acre, making them ideal for dense AI infrastructure.

- Reliability: 99.999% uptime (6-9s reliability), critical for mission-critical data centers.

- Emissions Reduction: 34% lower CO₂ emissions than grid power, with near-zero SOx/NOx.

A landmark partnership with American Electric Power (AEP) highlights Bloom's scalability. The 1 GW procurement agreement, with an initial 100 MW order, addresses the urgent need for reliable, low-carbon power in AI hubs. This deal alone could generate over $500 million in revenue by 2026, assuming $0.5/W pricing.

Growth Engine #2: Hydrogen Electrolyzers – The Key to Green Hydrogen's Rise

Bloom's electrolyzers, which split water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable energy, are central to its vision of a decarbonized economy. The Bloom Electrolyzer™ boasts:

- Industry-Leading Efficiency: 37.5 kWh per kilogram of hydrogen, 20-25% better than PEM or alkaline systems.

- Speed to Deploy: A 4 MW unit at NASA's Ames Research Center was operational in two months, producing 2.4 metric tons of hydrogen daily.

- Cost Advantages: A 28% learning rate (vs. 13% for PEM) drives down the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH), making green hydrogen viable faster.

The 80 MW project in South Korea with SK Eternix—a world-first for solid oxide electrolyzers—demonstrates Bloom's global reach. By 2030, the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects hydrogen could supply 12% of global energy demand. Bloom is well-positioned to capture this growth, especially as governments like the EU and the U.S. (via the Inflation Reduction Act) offer tax incentives for green hydrogen infrastructure.

Navigating Tariff Challenges and Competitive Pressures

Bloom isn't without risks. JPMorgan warns that tariffs could shave up to 100 basis points off its gross margins, though the company mitigates this by:

- Diversifying Supply Chains: U.S.-based manufacturing and global sourcing from non-Chinese suppliers.

- Leveraging Tax Credits: The Inflation Reduction Act's $48 billion in federal tax credits reduces customer costs, making Bloom's systems more competitive than gas turbines.

Competitors like gas turbine providers face headwinds: higher operational costs, longer lead times (18–24 months), and compliance risks. Bloom's modular systems, deployable in weeks, undercut these disadvantages.

Financials and Catalysts: A Turnaround in Motion

Bloom's Q1 2025 results were stellar:

- Revenue: $326 million (+39% YoY), a record for the quarter.

- Margins: Gross margins improved to 28.7%, up from 17.5% in Q1 2024.

- Operating Income: $13.2 million (vs. -$30.7 million in Q1 2024).

The company forecasts $1.65–$1.85 billion in 2025 revenue, with 2026 poised for a margin boost as IRA tax credits kick in. However, debt ($2.01 billion in liabilities) remains a concern. Bloom's $794.8 million cash reserves and convertible bonds maturing in 2028 provide a buffer, but refinancing will be critical.

Investment Thesis: Buy the Dip, but Watch the Risks

Bloom Energy presents a compelling long-term opportunity for investors willing to tolerate volatility. Its dual growth engines—data center fuel cells and hydrogen electrolyzers—are aligned with two of the clean energy transition's most urgent needs. Key catalysts in 2025 include:

1. Q2 2025 Earnings: Strong bookings in AI data centers and industrial sectors would validate demand.

2. Hydrogen Partnerships: Announcements of government or corporate contracts could solidify Bloom's leadership.

3. IRA Tax Credit Realization: Margins could jump 5-10% in 2026 as credits take effect.

Risks to Consider

Execution Risks: Supply chain delays or leadership instability (post-CFO transition) could disrupt timelines.

Macroeconomic Sensitivity: The stock's beta of 3.28 means it's highly reactive to market swings.

Competitor Adaptation: Cheaper battery storage or rival electrolyzer tech could erode margins.

Final Take

Bloom Energy is a buy for investors with a 3–5 year horizon. Its technological edge, tax-advantaged projects, and scalable solutions for data centers and hydrogen make it a critical player in the clean energy transition. While near-term risks like debt and volatility persist, the long-term tailwinds of decarbonization and AI's energy demands position Bloom to deliver outsized returns.

Investment Grade: Buy (Medium-High Risk)

Target Price: $20–$25 by 2026, assuming revenue growth and margin expansion.

Stay tuned for Q2 earnings and hydrogen partnership updates—these could be the next catalysts to watch.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-13 19:08:35.972247
