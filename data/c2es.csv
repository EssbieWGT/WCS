New poll has Talarico leading, Cornyn tied with Paxton

A new poll of the state’s U.S. Senate primaries shows state Rep. James Talarico, D-Round Rock, leading U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Dallas by 9 percentage points, 47% to 38%, among likely Democratic voters, The Texas Tribune reported. The Emerson College poll indicates a significant shift since a Texas Southern University poll in December showed Crockett with a similar-sized lead.

In both polls, Talarico leads among white and Latino voters, while Crockett has a commanding lead among Black voters.

On the GOP side, the latest polls show U.S. Sen. John Cornyn and Attorney General Ken Paxton deadlocked, with Paxton at 27% and Cornyn at 26%. U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Houston, trailed with 16%. If those margins hold, that race would head to a runoff.

The survey also found Gov. Greg Abbott with a sizable lead over his main Democratic challenger, state Rep. Gina Hinojosa, 50% to 42%.

Solar power surpasses coal in feeding ERCOT grid

For the first time, solar power supplied more electricity in 2025 to the state’s main power grid than coal-fired power plants, the Houston Chronicle reported.

Solar farms provided 67,800 gigawatt-hours of electricity last year, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which is the power grid operator for most of the state. Power plants burning coal supplied 63,000 gigawatt-hours of power to ERCOT last year.

The Chronicle report notes that in 2019 solar supplied so little power to the ERCOT grid that it wasn’t even included as a separate category in its annual pie chart of where the grid’s power comes from. It is now the third-largest supplier to ERCOT, behind second-place wind and first-place natural gas. Coal has dropped to number four.

“It’s a remarkable milestone,” said Daniel Cohan, a Rice University professor who studies the state’s energy transition. “I don’t think anyone 10 years ago would have thought that solar would have surpassed coal this quickly.”

Texas set to ban smokeable cannabis this month

Smokable cannabis products currently sold legally in Texas could disappear by Jan. 25 under new rules proposed by the Texas Department of State Health Services. According to the Texas Standard, DSHS has drafted new regulations for the hemp industry, “including child-resistant packaging, stronger warning labels, expanded testing, recall procedures and fee increases of roughly 10,000% for manufacturers and retailers.”

Annual fees for hemp manufacturers would rise from $250 to $25,000 per facility, while retailers would see their registration fees jump from $150 to $20,000.

The proposed regulations would effectively outlaw most smokable hemp products.

DSHS last week heard from dozens of small hemp business owners and cannabis users, many of whom said they support stricter packaging rules and age limits but oppose the ban on smokable products and the steep hike in licensing and registration fees.

“These proposed fees don’t regulate small businesses, they eliminate them,” Estella Castro, owner of Austinite Cannabis Co., told commissioners. “This proposal would force me to close, despite doing everything right.”

Some speakers spoke in support of the proposed regulations, including a mother who said her son developed psychosis from using cannabis and required medial treatment.

DSHS expanding anti-rabies program to El Paso area

DSHS is expanding its 32nd annual Oral Rabies Vaccination Program to the El Paso area while continuing its aerial bait distribution along the Texas-Mexico border. The rabies vaccine baits will be distributed by hand in targeted areas around El Paso.

“Our mission is to vaccinate wildlife along the borders of Texas to maintain herd immunity against rabies and keep new or previously eliminated rabies variants from becoming established in any part of Texas,” said Kathy Parker, ORVP Director. “However, we continue to monitor all the counties of Texas for outbreaks and/or potential areas of rabies interest.”

The baits do not pose threats to livestock, wildlife or pets. The project costs $2 million annually and is funded by both state and federal agencies. Since the program began, no human cases of rabies attributable to the rabies variants found along the border have been confirmed in Texas.

The program covers 19 Texas counties: El Paso, Hudspeth, Culberson, Jeff Davis, Presidio, Brewster, Pecos, Terrell, Val Verde, Kinney, Maverick, Zavala, Dimmit, Webb, Zapata, Starr, Hidalgo, Cameron and Willacy.

Texas is back on top of U-Haul’s list of “growth states,” according to the Austin American-Statesman. The company determines each state’s net gain or loss by recording how many customers used one-way equipment in 2025.

This is the fourth time the state has topped U-Haul’s rankings in five years. In 2024, South Carolina topped the list but fell to No. 5 last year. In second place is Florida, followed by North Carolina and Tennessee.

Coming in dead last in U-Haul’s ranking was California.

Justice Clarence Thomas asked about the practical effect of having the case heard in state versus federal court.","Lawyers for the oil giant Chevron and a small Louisiana parish squared off Monday in a case that could have major consequences for how local communities can rectify environmental damage that may have been caused by oil company operations going back decades.

In April, a Louisiana state court jury ruled that Chevron must pay almost $745 million to help restore coastal wetlands in Plaquemines Parish that were damaged as far back as World War II. Chevron is asking the Supreme Court to order the case moved to federal court, where it could get more favorable terms.

The ripple effects could be large: If the justices rule that the company can move the case to federal court, the hefty award for Plaquemines Parish could be wiped out, legal experts say. Moreover, the case could affect the outcomes of nearly a dozen other lawsuits that make similar allegations about the oil and gas industry.

The justices on Monday questioned Chevron’s arguments that it should be allowed to take the case to federal court even though its federal contracts did not squarely deal with oil drilling, which Plaquemines Parish says caused the coastal damage. Chevron’s attorneys argued that the oil production was “related to” the production of aviation fuel for World War II, which they say should be enough to meet the test to have the case heard in federal court.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. asked whether there was a “butterfly effect problem” with their argument — a reference to the concept that a butterfly flapping its wings could set off a chain of causation that could eventually lead to a tornado — suggesting that he thought almost anything could be considered “related to” a government contract.

“It’s hard to see where you stop,” he said.

Justice Neil M. Gorsuch likewise referred to the butterfly effect issue.

“The Big Bang is ‘related to’ you being here today, counsel,” he told Aaron Z. Roper, an attorney with the solicitor general’s office, which is supporting Chevron.

Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. was not present for arguments. On Thursday, Alito recused himself, citing financial interests in ConocoPhillips, the parent of Burlington Resources Oil & Gas Co., a party in a related case.

Although the case focused on a narrow legal question, experts highlighted its importance in how companies fight claims of environmental damage.

“The stakes are higher than just where this one case is going to be heard,” said Mark Davis, director of the Center for Environmental Law at Tulane University.

If the company prevails in having the verdict thrown out and the long-running case moved to federal court, other companies that do business with the federal government are likely to pursue similar arguments in the future, Davis said.

At the heart of Chevron’s case is the argument that during World War II, the firm’s predecessors played a key role in helping to expand oil extraction to meet the demands of the war. Because they were working on behalf of U.S. government interests, the company and its backers have argued, claims regarding the actions at the time should be heard in a federal court rather than at the state level.

Judges and juries in federal courts are less inclined to have a bias toward local interests, experts say. But John Carmouche, an attorney representing Plaquemines Parish, said that if his side loses at the high court, he would confidently litigate the case in federal court and seek an even higher sum.

“All they’re doing is playing the delay game, which they’ve played for 13 years,” Carmouche said in an interview.

Justice Clarence Thomas asked about the practical effect of having the case heard in state versus federal court.

Ben Aguiñaga, Louisiana’s solicitor general, which argued on behalf of Plaquemines Parish, replied that state courts were far better equipped to interpret state law.

“We want the actual experts interpreting state law, especially when we get to the Louisiana Supreme Court, on an important statute like this, and especially with respect to a problem that is so sweeping in scope,” he said.

But cases of national importance should be argued at the federal level, lawyers for Chevron argued in response to a question from Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.

“If they can prove their case in federal court, then everybody’s going to accept the outcome and they’re not going to view it as something that’s a product of local prejudice,” said Paul D. Clement, the former U.S. solicitor general who represents the company.

Plaquemines Parish filed its lawsuit in 2013 alongside five other coastal parishes. It alleged that oil companies had caused environmental damage in violation of a 1978 state law aimed at conserving the imperiled coastline.

The case in front of the high court holds particular relevance in Louisiana, where the oil and gas industry remains a massive employer and the coastal region has steadily vanished in recent decades.

One 2017 analysis by the U.S. Geological Survey found that the state had lost about 2,000 square miles of land along its coast from 1932 to 2016. That equates to losing about a football field’s worth of coastal wetlands every 34 minutes during periods of most rapid loss.

The authors called Louisiana’s wetlands “one of the most critically threatened environments in the United States” and detailed how the state had lost more wetlands than all other states in the Lower 48 combined. Those losses are projected to persist in the years ahead.

Scientists have documented how oil and gas extraction has played a significant role in the degradation of such landscapes over time. Oil spills have stressed vegetation and wildlife. The dredging of canals and construction of pipelines have altered natural hydrology, increased saltwater intrusion and undermined wetlands.

But the fossil fuel industry is hardly the only threat facing the coast, where humans have built levees that have changed the flow of the Mississippi River and constrained its historical ability to deposit sediment and build land. The process of sinking land, also known as subsidence, has continued to affect the coast.

After the $745 million verdict in April, oil industry figures sharply criticized the decision.

The verdict “not only undermines Louisiana’s position as an energy leader but also threatens our country’s trajectory to America-first energy dominance,” Tommy Faucheux, president of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association, said at the time.

“These lawsuits were never about restoring the coast,” he said in a statement. “As the number-one private investor in our working coast, the energy industry is already doing that. Instead, this is deep-pocketed trial lawyers driving baseless lawsuits, hoping to make millions in legal fees.”

When the Supreme Court later agreed to take up the case, Faucheux said the decision presented “an opportunity for the high court to uphold fair and consistent application of the law and to help preserve legal stability for the industry that fuels America’s economy.”

The issue on the flip side, Davis of the Tulane Center said, is the question of what obligations oil and gas firms have to rectify environmental damage caused by their operations.

“What obligations do you have to fix what you broke?” he said.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2026/01/Coastal-Damage.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 17:00:06.896111

January 19, 2026 – Regina, Saskatchewan – PrairiesCan

As Canada’s energy needs evolve, communities across the country are seeking innovative solutions that deliver clean, affordable power. In Saskatchewan, small modular reactors can deliver reliable, low-emission power to meet the needs of the future while driving economic growth—but further research and testing is needed to unlock their full potential.

Today, the Honourable Buckley Belanger, Secretary of State (Rural Development), on behalf of the Honourable Eleanor Olszewski, Minister of Emergency Management and Community Resilience and Minister responsible for Prairies Economic Development Canada (PrairiesCan), announced federal support for the University of Regina to build the Small Modular Reactor Safety, Licensing, and Testing centre (SMR-SLT).

The new testing facility will ensure that Canadian researchers and businesses are equipped to safely develop and deploy these next-generation nuclear technologies. It represents a Government of Canada investment of $1.96 million through PrairiesCan, alongside $4 million from the Government of Saskatchewan.

The SMR-SLT will provide industry and academic partners with access to the first modern SMR test loops in Western Canada and will enable the testing of components under conditions that replicate operating reactors. This will support innovation, workforce development, and the safe deployment of next-generation nuclear technologies.

Canada generates 15 percent of its power from nuclear energy, but none of it is produced in Western Canada. Saskatchewan has the largest high-grade uranium deposits in the world and provides almost a quarter of the world's uranium supply for electrical generation.

Developed by researchers at Texas A&M University in partnership with ExcelThermic Enterprises, the PICC system skips over the expensive solvents and high-temperature regeneration used in traditional amine-based capture technologies. Instead, it applies a basic physical principle—CO₂ dissolves in water under pressure, and escapes when that pressure drops.

In effect, PICC mimics the release of fizz from a soda bottle, but at industrial scale. The result is a system that can reportedly capture up to 99% of carbon dioxide emissions using only water, standard equipment, and pressure differentials. The same water can be recirculated, further minimizing operating costs and maintenance overhead.

From Exhaust to Storage: How PICC Works

Rather than relying on chemical reactions, PICC uses a sequence of physical steps to isolate and collect carbon dioxide. Emissions from sources like power plants, cement kilns, or hydrogen production are first cooled and compressed. This compressed gas enters an absorption unit where it meets a downward flow of cold water inside a packed column designed for maximum gas-liquid interaction.

As the CO₂ dissolves into the water, the treated exhaust exits with minimal carbon content. The now CO₂-rich water is then sent through a series of lower-pressure tanks where the gas gradually bubbles out and is collected for compression and either permanent storage or industrial reuse.

In some configurations, the process can be enhanced with small amounts of lime to improve CO₂ removal, especially from combustion air—pushing capture rates to 100% and enabling net-negative emissions when paired with biomass.

What makes this model noteworthy is its simplicity. Unlike solvent-based systems that degrade over time, require chemical handling, and involve complex thermal regeneration steps, PICC leans on well-understood physical laws and modular hardware. That translates to faster permitting, easier retrofits, and lower long-term operational risk.

A Cost Curve Shift for Heavy Industry

While carbon capture has long been seen as essential to decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors, it remains constrained by high costs. The standard amine-based systems typically capture about 90% of CO₂ at a cost between $50 and $100 per metric ton.

In contrast, early economic models for PICC suggest capture and compression at around $26 per ton. Even with added lime for full carbon removal, costs stay below $28 per ton on average—making it a compelling option for industries confronting emissions mandates and carbon pricing.

By focusing on pressure and water instead of heat and chemicals, PICC offers a scalable, infrastructure-compatible bridge for legacy assets in power, cement, and manufacturing. It won’t replace the broader need for clean energy, but it could buy time—and reduce emissions—while the transition unfolds.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20260119-102337-b1e-engin-akyurt-C0MyvY65vgY-unsplash.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 16:59:56.415705

She said the Ohio EPA approached them and was willing to “fully fund” the project.
“It got funded in the controlling board meeting on Monday, so the money is allocated toward the site,” Wagner said.
He then said they will be opened on Thursday, Feb. 19, at the land bank meeting.
The land bank board approved Terry Britton as president of the board.","The involvement of the Ohio EPA in a Brownfield Remediation Grant Program (BRGP) site caused the removal of the project at the monthly meeting of the Highland County Land Reutilization Corporation (land bank).

Jason Johansen, land bank administrator, said the land bank will “possibly” need to pull its application for the Bell Foundry site due to the City of Hillsboro’s intention to use a different source of grant funding for the project.

Johansen said that Lauren Walker sent an email saying that the Hillsboro Community Improvement Corporation decided to pull its involvement from this specific project so it can pursue funding from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Division of Environmental Response and Revitalization (DERR) program. She said the Ohio EPA approached them and was willing to “fully fund” the project. Walker said they “would be honored to work with them directly” and obtain the No Further Action letter and Covenant Not to Sue.

“It got funded in the controlling board meeting on Monday, so the money is allocated toward the site,” Wagner said. “The recommendation would be to, and they obviously are doing that, is to withdraw it from ODOD, letting them know, and by doing so, that allows and frees up roughly $400,000 for this board to look at other projects within the county for the best interest of the land.”

The land bank board then approved the removal of Bell’s Foundry from the BRGP.

For other BRGP projects, Johansen said the East Monroe tank farm, the former machine shop and the former East Main gas station are all complete for the 2024/25 BRGP cycle. He said all reporting has been approved and he is now waiting for the final reimbursements.

At the Rocky Fork Truck Stop, he said that he “believes” that the 90-day waiting period is over and that Tetra Tech did some samples for the monitoring wells last week.

Matt Wagner, a certified professional at Tetra Tech, said the company was out doing sampling on the wells to make sure the injections worked. He also said he anticipates having the analytical results next week and will give an update to the board on the next steps.

“But, the project obviously is under budget, still committed to the June 30 deadline for the project,” Wagner said. “You know, we’ve kept the owners as well informed in terms of what we’re doing and they’ve been cooperating since they’ve been utilizing the lot for some storage. So, with that being said, we’re just in the throes of it as we speak for actual remediation.”

Concerning the Building Demolition and Site Revitalization Grant Program, Johansen said he is still waiting for approval from the Ohio Department of Development (ODOD) for the additional projects of the 2024/25 leftover round. He said that if any of those projects cause the funds to go over the $131,140.30 leftover funds, the projects that can’t be done will be moved to the 2026 version of the (BDSRGP).

He also said his plan is to release the bids after the meeting, after which he will set the due date for Feb. 18, 2026, at 4 p.m. He then said they will be opened on Thursday, Feb. 19, at the land bank meeting. He then highlighted that the contractors do not need to be present at the meeting to be awarded any of the projects.

He said more projects can be added until April 30, 2026, with those additional projects likely to need an extension approved by ODOD because those projects would need an asbestos inspection, a possible abatement and then a demolition by June 30 if there is no extension.

The land bank board approved asbestos abatements by Industrial Installation Specialists (IIS) at 21 S. Fairfield St., Leesburg; 226 S High St., Hillsboro; 237 East Lilley Ave., Hillsboro; and 6539 Spring Hill Dr., Hillsboro, for $3,395. Johansen said the abatements would be complete and the documentation submitted to him by 4 p.m. on Feb. 18, 2026.

Johansen also gave an update on the demolition of 133 and 137 S. Washington St. in Greenfield. He said those properties are related to the former Elliott Hotel, which was included in a previous BRGP cycle. He also said 137 S. Washington is owned by the Village of Greenfield and it is being held up structurally. Greenfield is currently looking to purchase the other property from a private property owner because the property it owns has “unaffordable” renovation costs.

“This is very similar to the downtown Lynchburg buildings, where it was very difficult to tear down one without possible structural damage to the other, and I just don’t think the land bank should take on the liability, unless the adjacent property owner is willing to sign a release, which is highly unlikely, as we saw in Lynchburg,” Johansen said. “So the village would like to put these into the demolition program. I think they’re going to get ownership of that adjacent structure next to them, and really, what they want to know right now is how much would that commitment be.”

The land bank board approved the two properties to be considered two structures, and the maximum demolition price-matching cost would be $5,000.

Johansen also delivered updates of multiple other properties, which are as follows:

*Regarding 222 McClain Ave. in Greenfield, Johansen said the property was listed at $20,000 in August, but the land bank has not received any offers other than someone who said they would make payments on it until it was paid off. However, he then said the land bank received a $3,000 offer, with that offer coming from someone who also made an offer for 216 McClain Ave. in Greenfield. Following multiple members of the land bank saying they wanted the organization to recoup more of its costs from the property than $3,000, the board approved lowering the price of the property to $10,000.

The land bank board approved Terry Britton as president of the board. However, it tabled a discussion on vice president due to neither of the possibilities, Randy Mustard and Lauren Walker, being present at the meeting.

Randy Mustard and Lauren Walker were also nominated as representatives of the Paint Township Trustees and the City of Hillsboro, respectively, on the land bank board.

The next meeting of the land bank will take place on Thursday, Feb. 19, 2025, at 9 a.m.

As Davy Crockett once put it, “Texas is the garden spot of the world.”

Soon spring rains will bring bluebonnets and Indian paintbrush, refilled creeks and rivers, and wildlife stirred back into motion. Migratory birds will return to coastal marshes and urban greenbelts, while paddlers, hikers, and anglers rediscover Texas’s rivers, lakes, and trails.

Throughout the year, Texans seek out wild adventures – pondering the starry skies of Big Bend, floating clear Hill Country rivers, fishing along the coast, and walking shaded trails in city parks from Dallas to Houston to the Rio Grande Valley. These places support wildlife and the quality of life that makes Texas home.

Each year, we stand shoulder to shoulder with Texans across the state to protect the “garden spot” we all love by protecting parks and wildlife, expanding clean energy, keeping our water safe to drink and swim in, reducing waste and expanding recycling and repair opportunities, and holding polluters accountable for harmful air pollution. In 2026, we will continue advancing practical solutions that protect both people and the places we love.

In 2026, our priorities include:

Safeguarding parks, open spaces, and wildlife habitat

Texas’ parks and natural lands provide places to explore, recharge, and connect with nature, while also supporting wildlife and ecological health. We are working to protect what we have and expand access to nature for a growing state.

Supporting the creation of new and expanded Texas state parks through the Centennial Parks Conservation Fund

Connecting landscapes through wildlife corridors, including wildlife crossings that protect animals from vehicle collisions, to preserve biodiversity and ecosystem health

Advancing clean energy

Texas leads the nation in renewable energy and we can continue to power our state while cutting pollution and protecting the landscapes and communities Texans care about.

Speeding up rooftop solar and home energy resilience through streamlined permitting

Reducing pollution and strain on the electric grid by improving the energy efficiency of, and ending taxpayer subsidies for, fast-growing data centers

Pushing back against discriminatory barriers to renewable energy development while ensuring projects are responsibly sited and built to protect land, water, and wildlife

Protecting clean water and the coast

Clean water is fundamental to public health, outdoor recreation, and thriving ecosystems. We are working to stop pollution at its source, invest in modern infrastructure, and protect Texans’ drinking water from toxic contaminants.

Stopping plastic pellet (“nurdle”) pollution before it reaches rivers, bays, and the Gulf

Fighting fecal bacteria pollution in rivers, lakes, and swimming holes by securing funding to repair and upgrade broken wastewater infrastructure that contaminates waterways and drinking water supplies

Protecting drinking water from lead, PFAS, and other toxic pollutants that threaten public health in communities across Texas

Stop oil companies from dumping fracking wastewater into the Pecos River and other waterways

Save the Lavaca River from a proposed dam which would threaten oyster reefs and fish populations

Improving recycling systems and reducing waste

Texas’s waste system is a major and often overlooked source of pollution. Landfills, trash incineration, plastic waste, and so-called “chemical recycling” contaminate air and water, drive climate change, and harm wildlife and human health — even as valuable materials that could be reused or truly recycled are thrown away. We are working to modernize recycling, cut waste at the source, and give Texans more control over the products they buy and use.

Leading the campaign to improve recycling and reduce waste in Houston

Opposing chemical recycling schemes that burn plastic, release hazardous pollution, and lock Texas into continued plastic production instead of real waste reduction

Expanding Right to Repair so Texans can fix their own products, waste less, and keep usable materials out of landfills and waterways

Protecting birds, bees and butterflies

Bees, butterflies, and birds are part of the quiet beauty of the natural world – the flicker of wings over a meadow, the hum in a garden, and the ancient migrations that return life to our landscapes. Many of these species are now in steep decline. We are working to protect them and the places they need to exist, not only for what they do, but because they belong.

Expanding pollinator-friendly habitat along roadsides, in parks, and in communities

Reducing the use of harmful pesticides that threaten bees, butterflies, birds, and other wildlife

Advancing bird-friendly design practices in buildings in Dallas and across the state

Holding polluters accountable

Air pollution is linked to asthma attacks, heart disease, premature deaths, and other serious health harms — and in Texas, much of it comes from oil and gas operations, refineries, and chemical plants. We are working to reduce dangerous air pollution, enforce existing laws, and protect public health across the state.

Reducing methane and other air pollution from oil and gas operations

Preventing harmful emissions from refineries and petrochemical plants

Expanding transit and building bikeable, walkable communities

Texas communities are stronger, healthier, and more connected when people have safe, clean and convenient options for getting around. We are working to expand public transit and create bikeable, walkable places that give Texans more freedom in how they travel and more access to jobs, schools, and everyday destinations.

Supporting the successful build-out of Project Connect to expand high-capacity public transit in Central Texas

Advancing improved service, reliability, and expansion at Dallas Area Rapid Transit and other transit systems across the state

Promoting bikeable and walkable community design, including safer streets, connected trail networks, and infrastructure that protects people walking and biking

AgAmerica Lending says higher interest rates, compressed margins, and uneven income performance are converging just as many operations rely more heavily on financing to maintain cash flow.

Despite those pressures, balance sheets across agriculture remain relatively strong, supported by resilient farmland values. That equity has helped cushion recent volatility, but lenders are becoming more selective. According to AgAmerica, lenders are placing greater emphasis on liquidity, repayment capacity, and documentation, signaling a shift from readily available credit to more disciplined underwriting.

Crop producers face the most strain. Lower grain and fiber prices, paired with elevated input and labor costs, have tightened working capital and increased dependence on operating credit. A Farmer Mac survey cited by AgAmerica shows nearly 70 percent of ag lenders now view grain and cotton operations as their top risk concern, up sharply from two years ago.

Earned Income Tax Credit: This is a refundable credit for working filers.
Education Expenses Tax Credits: • American Opportunity Tax Credit, or AOTC: Up to $2,500 per eligible student per year.
See more details and find other tax credits and deductions at IRS.gov/credits-and-deductions.","LITTLE ROCK — The passage of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act last year will mean significant changes for some taxpayers this season.

Laura Hendrix, extension associate professor of personal finance and consumer economics for the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture, said the changes include no tax on tips, no tax on overtime and an enhanced deduction for seniors age 65 and older.

Hendrix said some of the new changes include the following:

Increased standard deduction amounts for tax year 2025:

• $31,500 for married couples filing jointly.

• $15,750 for single filers and married individuals filing jointly.

• $23,625 for heads of household.

Elimination of taxes on:

• Overtime (for qualified overtime income up to $12,500 or $25,000 for joint filers).

• Tips (for tips totaling up to $25,000).

• This phases out for incomes above $150,000 (or $300,000 for joint filers).

Deduction for seniors:

• Effective from 2025 through 2028, individuals age 65 and older may claim an additional $6,000 deduction.

• This is in addition to the standard deduction for seniors available under existing law.

• This applies per eligible individual (or $12,000 for a married couple if both spouses qualify).

• This phases out for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income over $75,000 (or $150,000 for joint filers).

• Filers must be 65 or older on or before the last day of the tax year.

• This is available for both itemizing and non-itemizing taxpayers.

Increased State and Local Taxes, or SALT, cap:

• The maximum itemized deduction for state and local taxes is temporarily raised to $40,000 (or $20,000 for married filing separately), with a phaseout for high-income earners.

1099-K and 1099-DA:

• “Taxpayers who received more than $20,000 in payments for goods and services in more than 200 transactions through an online marketplace or payment app in 2025 should expect to receive a Form 1099-K in January 2026,” Hendrix said. “The IRS will also receive a copy of your Form 1099-K. 1099-DA is used for reporting digital assets.”

Hendrix said taxpayers should use the new Schedule 1-A to claim recently enacted tax deductions.

Some energy-efficient deductions and credits are being eliminated or capped in 2025, Hendrix said, including the following:

• Home improvements, such as energy-efficient windows, doors and solar installations, sunset after 2025.

• Electric vehicle credits (up to $7,500) go away for EVs purchased after Sept. 30, 2025.

Start Early

The Internal Revenue Service announced it will begin accepting and processing 2025 tax year returns on Jan. 26, with a deadline of April 15. Hendrix recommends preparing early for a smooth tax filing process. Hendrix said consumers should gather the following documents and information to prepare for filing:

• Bank account information for returns via direct deposit

• W-2s from employers

• 1099s from banks and other payers

• Records of digital asset transactions

• Other documents as needed to verify qualifying tax credits or adjustments

Failure to pay taxes by the deadline can result in penalties, but filing extensions are available.

“If you can’t file by the due date of your return, you can request an automatic six-month extension of time to file,” Hendrix said. “However, it’s important to note that an extension of time to file is not an extension of time to pay. You should pay any owed taxes by your original due date to avoid the penalties.”

Those who wish to file an extension should file Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, by the original due date of their return.

Optimizing Filing Status

Hendrix said that for most married people, filing jointly has benefits, but that is not always the case.

“The best way to find out if you should file jointly or separately is to prepare your tax return both ways,” Hendrix said. “Some couples may prefer to keep their finances separate. Filing separately can limit your liability for your spouse’s tax obligations or debts. Some couples may qualify for more tax credits by filing jointly.”

Major life events can also impact taxes, including marriage, divorce, a new job, having children or buying a home, Hendrix said. Visit irs.gov/individuals/managing-your-taxes-after-a-life-event to learn more.

Taxpayers should also be cautious of calls and emails, as scams are rampant during filing season. To learn more about tax-related scams, visit irs.gov/help/tax-scams.

Tax Credits for 2025

Hendrix said a few common tax credits for the 2025 tax year include the following:

Child Tax Credit: Up to $2,200 per qualifying child under age 17. Income limits and other qualifications apply.

Child and Dependent Care Credit: For the care of a qualifying child under age 13 or a dependent who cannot care for themselves.

Earned Income Tax Credit: This is a refundable credit for working filers. The maximum amount of credit is as follows:

• No qualifying children: $649

• One qualifying child: $4,328

• Two qualifying children: $7,152

• Three or more qualifying children: $8,046

Adoption Credit: This is for qualified expenses paid to adopt an eligible child. For 2025, the maximum credit is up to $17,280.

Education Expenses Tax Credits:

• American Opportunity Tax Credit, or AOTC: Up to $2,500 per eligible student per year. Up to 40 percent (or $1,000) of the credit may be refundable, meaning you can get money back even if you owe no tax.

• Lifetime Learning Credit, or LLC: Up to $2,000 per tax return per year, non-refundable. The LLC is nonrefundable, meaning it can reduce your tax bill to $0 but won't result in a cash refund.

“You cannot claim both credits for the same student in the same year, but you can claim different credits for different students in the same year,” Hendrix said. “For example, you could claim AOTC for one child and LLC for another. You also cannot claim these credits if you are claimed as a dependent on someone else's return.

“Visit IRS.gov to see details of expenses that qualify for each type of education tax credit and income limits,” Hendrix said.

Filing Resources

Depending on an individual filer’s circumstances, Hendrix recommended several filing resources.

“AARP is for filers age 50 and older, and MilTax is for military service members,” Hendrix said. “Income limits apply for most types of free filing.”

Other recommended resources include:

• IRS Free File: gov/filing/irs-free-file-do-your-taxes-for-free

• My Free Taxes: com

• Find sites for VITA and Tax Counseling for the Elderly, or TCE: for.irs.gov/s/sitelocator

• MilTax: mil/financial-legal/taxes/miltax-military-tax-services

That’s why President Trump asked governors across the Mid-Atlantic to come together and call upon PJM to allow America to build big reliable power plants again.
The direction includes: Providing long-term certainty for new power generation: Provide 15-year revenue certainty for new power plants to accelerate the development of reliable power generation.
Protecting residential electricity rates: Protect ratepayers by limiting the amount existing power plants can be paid in the PJM capacity market.
The measures will also help keep electricity prices affordable for residential customers, while addressing rising demand from data centers.","U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, vice-chair and chair of the National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC), respectively, joined Mid-Atlantic governors urging PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM), to temporarily overhaul its market rules to strengthen grid reliability and reduce electricity costs for American families and businesses by building more than $15 billion of reliable baseload power generation.

The initiative calls on PJM to conduct an emergency procurement auction to address escalating electricity prices and growing reliability risks across the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. The action follows a series of PJM policies over the years that have weakened the electric grid, including the premature shutdown of reliable power generation.

President Trump declared a National Energy Emergency on his first day in office, warning that the previous administration's energy subtraction agenda left the country vulnerable to blackouts and soaring electricity prices. During the Biden administration, PJM forced nearly 17 gigawatts of reliable baseload power generation offline. For the first time in history, PJM’s capacity auction failed to secure enough generation resources to meet basic reliability requirements. If not fixed, it will lead to further rising prices and blackouts.

“High electricity prices are a choice,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright. “The Biden administration’s forceful closures of coal and natural gas plants without reliable replacements left the United States in an energy emergency. Perhaps no region in America is more at risk than in PJM. That’s why President Trump asked governors across the Mid-Atlantic to come together and call upon PJM to allow America to build big reliable power plants again. Our directives will restore affordable and reliable electricity so American families thrive and America’s manufacturing industries once again boom. President Trump promised to unleash American energy and put the American people first. This plan keeps that promise.""

""For too long, the Green New Scam has left Mid-Atlantic families in the dark with skyrocketing bills,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. “Today, under President Trump's leadership, the National Energy Dominance Council has come up with a solution to end these high costs, roll back the Biden administration’s policies of energy scarcity, and ensure we are powering the Mid-Atlantic and part of the Midwest’s future without charging its citizens a cent. This initiative will ensure we usher in the age of artificial intelligence with new power plants funded by the technology companies, not taxpayers, securing the steel of Pennsylvania, the manufacturing of Ohio, and the ships of Virginia. The Trump administration is keeping the lights on, the factories humming, and the American Dream affordable.""

The direction includes:

Providing long-term certainty for new power generation: Provide 15-year revenue certainty for new power plants to accelerate the development of reliable power generation.

Protecting residential electricity rates: Protect ratepayers by limiting the amount existing power plants can be paid in the PJM capacity market.

Ensuring data centers pay their fair share: Make data centers pay more for new generation than residential customers by allocating costs for any new generation procured to data center customers that have not self-procured new capacity or agreed to be curtailable.

Prioritizing immediate grid stability: Take other steps to ensure more affordable, reliable, and secure electricity for the American people.

The recommendations propose temporary but critical measures to ensure American businesses, especially those in some of the nation’s most manufacturing-intensive regions, have the reliable power they need to operate. The measures will also help keep electricity prices affordable for residential customers, while addressing rising demand from data centers.",https://www.bicmagazine.com/downloads/25968/download/HTVIL74PMNNGJNBJCB52DLTTE4.jpeg?cb=9a02004506a3c358255f4efd53f06326&w=960,N,,2026-01-19 17:58:50.876415

While additional details for the hearing are not yet available at this time, the release of the Discussion Draft marks a notable milestone in Congress’s increasingly vocal promises to address perceived shortcomings in both the landmark 2016 amendments to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) nearly ten years of implementation that followed. This is the first time that many of the contemplated legislative changes have been shared publicly.

The Discussion Draft would impose sweeping changes to many of the key sections in TSCA, including those pertaining to definitions, testing authorities, review of new chemicals, review and management of existing chemicals, TSCA Inventory nomenclature, relationship to other federal laws, citizens’ petitions, TSCA fees, and more. Although Bergeson & Campbell, P.C. (B&C®) will continue to review carefully this text and its potential implications, we are pleased to share the following highlights and initial observations.

Definitions

Changes to the statutory phrase “conditions of use” that limit EPA’s discretion to identify reasonably foreseen circumstances to those “more likely than not to be” and, in turn, narrow the scope of risk evaluations.

New Chemical Reviews

A narrowed scope of new chemical reviews, limiting the assessment to just the conditions of use “identified by the submitter of the notice” — rather than the current requirement that EPA consider known, intended, and reasonably foreseen circumstances;

A qualifier on how EPA can determine a new chemical may present an unreasonable risk, in that it must be “more likely than not that such unreasonable risk will occur”;

A nondelegable requirement for the EPA Administrator personally to issue a statement for each premanufacture notice (PMN) review that EPA fails to review timely;

A new requirement that EPA make “best efforts” to prioritize review of certain new chemical notices, including those that a submitter identifies as offering specified risk reduction benefits, eligible for Safer Choice program inclusion, or are necessary to “improve the security and resiliency of … domestic critical material supply chains” as identified by the Secretary of Commerce;

Limitations on voluntary suspensions of the new chemical review period;

Changes making EPA’s requirement to address identified risk through Section 5(e) orders now discretionary instead of mandatory; and

New authority for EPA to exempt new chemicals from the review process upon a showing that the activity has been approved by another Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member country.

Existing Chemical Risk Evaluations

New emphasis on the likelihood of exposures/hazards, directing EPA to consider only those that “are more likely than not” to result in unreasonable risk;

Explicit direction to consider the impact of existing federal regulatory limits, and not to assume noncompliance — including noncompliance with U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards;

Change to make all final risk evaluations “final agency action” and thus immediately judicially reviewable, rather than the current requirement that limits judicial review of an unreasonable risk determination until after the promulgation of a final TSCA Section 6 risk management rule;

New compensation process and provisions to address the TSCA fee issue of reliant parties that do not fairly contribute to the risk evaluation fee for the particular chemical;

Extension of TSCA fee authority for another ten years from date bill is signed into law, that would allow EPA to continue to collect fees for risk evaluation activities; and

Further direction to prioritize actual information on the chemical versus analog or modeled data.

Existing Chemical Risk Management

Change to the risk management standard, from requiring EPA to eliminate the identified unreasonable risk to a requirement that EPA “minimize, to the extent reasonably feasible” such risk; and

Amendments to TSCA Section 9 that prohibit EPA from issuing risk management rules that are “inconsistent” with other existing federal requirements.

TSCA Inventory Nomenclature

New requirements for EPA to consider the equivalency of certain Unknown or Variable Composition, Complex reaction products or Biological materials (UVCB) chemical substances, such that they would not be considered new chemical substances and not subject to PMN and review requirements in TSCA Section 5.

Citizens’ Petitions

Removal of authority for citizens to petition EPA for issuance of a TSCA Section 6(a) risk management rule — replaced with new authority for citizens to petition EPA to consider designating a chemical as a high-priority substance for risk evaluation.

TSCA Fee Collection

A ten-year reauthorization of EPA’s authority to collect fees to help defray the costs of its implementation efforts, currently set to expire at the end of Fiscal Year 2026.

Commentary

The Discussion Draft is a culmination of nearly a decade of pent-up frustration with EPA’s efforts to implement TSCA and its perceived failure to live up to the bipartisan expectations and over-brimming optimism of 2016. Nonetheless, the scope and extent of the proposed changes are surprising and begs the question of who exactly the target is of the desired “discussion.” B&C reported last year on cautious agreement by key Senate Democrats that TSCA could benefit from improvement around the edges. Some public health and environmental organizations, to the contrary, have taken the public position that legislative amendments are unnecessary. While many of the ideas outlined in the Discussion Draft are interesting and laudable, this 37-page rewrite of many of the major compromises in the 2016 TSCA amendments is not likely to gain much traction with those constituencies. In the meantime, the clock continues to tick on EPA’s TSCA fee collection authority, the expiration of which B&C believes could exacerbate the TSCA program’s ongoing resource and workload challenges. The forthcoming hearing should shed some light on initial reactions to the Discussion Draft and perhaps set the stage for another round of bipartisan debate leading to addressing the shortcomings of the 2016 amendments.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15432_3114.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 14:59:51.227913

For decades, Canada’s economic survival has relied on a single, unshakeable truth: our proximity to the United States is our greatest shield. However, as we enter 2026, that shield has begun to feel more like a cage. Prime Minister Mark Carney’s recent pivot toward China—marked by his historic January visit to Beijing—is not merely a sudden change in trade policy, but a calculated response to an increasingly transactional and unpredictable Washington. With President Trump openly musing about Canada as a “51st state” and threatening broad tariffs on continental trade, the Carney administration appears to have concluded that the “fortress North America” ideal is crumbling from within. This pivot is a “strategic realism” born of necessity, signaling that Canada can no longer afford to be a passive bystander in a trade war it didn’t start.

The immediate tension of this strategy lies in the trade-off between the $19.2 billion automotive sector and the $14.5 billion canola industry. By slashing EV duties to 6.1% for a 49,000-unit quota in exchange for China dropping its 80% punitive tariffs on Canadian seeds and shellfish, the government is making a clear choice to rescue the Prairies at the potential expense of Ontario’s industrial floor. Yet, the math suggests this is less of a “flood” and more of a managed experiment. A 49,000-unit cap represents only about 3% of the total Canadian vehicle market—essentially restoring the 2023 import levels that were largely dominated by Chinese-made Teslas. By framing this as a “stabilization effort” rather than a broad liberalization, the administration is attempting to provide a vital lifeline to farmers while keeping the actual displacement of domestic manufacturing to a minimum.

This high-wire act faces its greatest test with the looming July 1, 2026, CUSMA review. The initial analysis rightly identifies the risk of American retaliation, as Washington could view the EV quota as a “backdoor” for Chinese influence. There is a real danger that the U.S. might invoke Section 301 investigations or apply 40% “transshipment” tariffs on any Canadian-made vehicle containing Chinese components. However, Carney seems to be building a different kind of leverage. By diversifying Canada’s trade portfolio now, he is signaling to Washington that Ottawa has other options. If the U.S. demands extreme concessions during the summer review, Canada now possesses a “snap-back” chip: the ability to return to a hardline stance against China in exchange for ironclad guarantees on North American market access.

Ultimately, this shift represents Canada’s transition from a junior partner in a continental alliance to a multipolar player in a fragmented global economy. Even as the government lowers financial barriers for Chinese imports, it is simultaneously fortifying “regulatory moats” through strict cybersecurity and national-security screenings for connected vehicles. These measures allow Canada to remain technically aligned with Western security standards while reaping the economic benefits of reopened Eastern markets. It is a gamble, certainly, but it is one predicated on the belief that in 2026, the only thing more dangerous than breaking ranks with an unpredictable ally is having no rank to stand in at all.

USD: Tariff certainty is a myth

Global shocks keep piling up — Venezuela, Iran, Fed independence — and now the Greenland dispute has opened a fresh front. US President Trump has threatened a 10% tariff, rising to 25% in June, on eight key European allies for opposing US control over Greenland. The move effectively torpedoes the US‑EU trade truce agreed only six months ago and has forced Brussels to prepare retaliatory tariffs on €93bn of US goods.

The episode has re‑inflamed NATO tensions, blindsided EU leaders, and ensures Trump dominates the agenda at Davos this Wednesday. It also signals that anyone expecting a calmer second year on trade policy may need to rethink — this is starting to look a lot like last year all over again.

The tariff threat injects another layer of uncertainty into an already crowded geopolitical landscape, raising the risk of a broader risk‑off turn if rhetoric escalates. For markets, the immediate pressure point is Europe: EUR and NOK look most exposed to headline risk, while the Swiss franc looks to be the stand-out winner, acting as a natural hedge against geopolitical stress. European equities — particularly exporters and industrials — face renewed vulnerability. Industrial commodities would likely soften on tariff‑driven demand concerns, while gold and silver stand to benefit if tensions spill over into a wider volatility bid.

The US dollar reaction is likely to remain mixed and relatively contained. A modest bout of USD weakness is logical as markets price a more isolationist US stance, briefly reviving the ‘sell America’ narrative and stirring de‑dollarisation chatter, with the country’s sizeable external liabilities back in focus.

Still, investors have grown increasingly numb to tariff headlines, which tempers the downside, and some investors will likely lean into the ‘TACO trade’ — viewing Trump’s tariff threats as a negotiating tactic rather than a firm policy path — offering the dollar a degree of support. Even so, the latest developments serve as a reminder that the US economy is not immune to the uncertainty generated by Trump’s policy shifts, while lingering concerns over Fed independence — amplified by the delayed nomination of a new chair and the ongoing probe into Jerome Powell — add another layer of caution around the US currency.

Emerging Markets: Rally resumed

The global financial landscape in early 2026 is defined by a sustained period of suppressed currency volatility that has paved the way for a highly profitable regime in the foreign exchange carry trade. Following a structural shift in market dynamics during the second quarter of 2025, the inverse relationship between market turbulence and yield-seeking behavior has become more pronounced, allowing the carry index to climb steadily as investor confidence returns. This environment of relative calm has fundamentally lowered the risk premium required for cross-border investments, encouraging a broad-based migration of capital toward high-yielding assets as the fear of sudden exchange rate swings continues to dissipate.

This macro-level stability has acted as a powerful tailwind for emerging market equities, which are aggressively outperforming global benchmarks in the opening weeks of the year. Capital flows are concentrating in regions that offer the most attractive combination of yield and growth potential, with Latin American and Emerging European markets leading the pack and delivering returns that significantly outpace the broader world index. The synergy between a maturing carry trade and surging local equity valuations indicates a robust “risk-on” cycle, where the convergence of currency stability and high-growth prospects is currently rewarding investors who have pivoted toward developing economies.

The Mexican Peso is staging a surprising technical breakout, slicing through key psychological support levels near the 17.60 handle to mark its most significant weekly advance since November last year. This move has effectively invalidated several bearish divergence signals from late 2025, reclaiming momentum with enough conviction to suggest the 50-day moving average, a level it has respected for months, is no longer a ceiling but a launchpad. With USD/MXN now trading at its lowest levels since July 2024, the path of least resistance appears skewed toward further appreciation. However, sustaining double-digit returns remains a high bar for Latin American currencies as they contend with the gravity of a firming Greenback. Should 2026 see even a modest recovery in the US Dollar Index, the Mexican Peso’s yield advantage will likely struggle to drive further spot appreciation.

Muscat, Oman, January 19, 2026 – IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, announced an investment to help United Solar Polysilicon (FZC) SPC, United Solar, finance its greenfield polysilicon plant in Oman’s Sohar Freezone. The financing aims to boost the manufacturing of polysilicon, creating nearly 3,000 direct and indirect jobs, helping attract foreign direct investments, and advancing Oman’s vision for economic diversification and reduce reliance on oil.

Polysilicon is a key ingredient for the global solar photovoltaic (PV) value chain. At full capacity, the plant is expected to enable the production of approximately 40 gigawatts of solar modules annually, enough to power up to 12 million homes. It will also contribute to the avoidance of 8.8 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year. The polysilicon plant aims to strengthen the resilience and diversification of the global solar PV supply chain and expand energy access. The polysilicon produced from the plant will also be fully traceable, enhancing transparency, and competitiveness.

""The successful financial close reflects a true team effort, supported by the Omani government's agility and strong international confidence in Oman's economy, OIA as the largest shareholder, and United Solar Polysilicon's ability to deliver a world-class project responding to the global energy transition,"" said HE Mulham Al Jarf, OIA's Deputy President for Investment. ""This project will create employment opportunities for Omanis and enable SMEs, while establishing a foundation for future upstream projects and downstream renewable energy integration. It underscores the Authority's commitment to diversifying funding through partnerships with leading institutions such as IFC, and will drive expansion into solar cell and module production, amplifying its long-term economic impact.""

“This is a transformative moment for United Solar, Oman, and the global solar industry,” said Sam Zhang, Founder and Chairman of United Solar. “With OIA and IFC's support, we are building the infrastructure needed to strengthen the global solar supply chain and ensure manufacturers have reliable access to high-quality, traceable polysilicon that meets the world's most rigorous standards.”

“This financing reflects the OPEC Fund’s commitment to supporting low-carbon industrial growth and to strengthening renewable energy value chains in partner countries. By participating as a parallel lender alongside IFC and other partners, the OPEC Fund is supporting the delivery of a project that advances Oman’s economic diversification objectives, strengthens local manufacturing capacity and job creation,” said, Tareq Alnassar, OPEC Fund Vice President for Private Sector.

“Together with USP, Oman Investment Authority, and our international partners, we are committed to strengthening Oman’s export capacity, diversifying the global polysilicon supply chain, and enabling pioneering projects such as this one,” said Ashruf Megahed, IFC Regional Industry Head for Manufacturing, Agribusiness, and Services in the Middle East and Central Asia. “By reinforcing industrial capabilities, the project will significantly expand polysilicon exports, contribute to the growth of global energy production, and support Oman’s long-term economic diversification and industrial transformation.”

Once complete, the $1.6 billion plant, with several investors, will be the Middle East’s largest and only operational polysilicon manufacturing facility, with a planned annual production capacity of 100,000 tons. Oman is United Solar’s largest shareholder.

Globally, about 1,100 gigawatts of new renewable capacity must be added each year, more than double the current expansion rate. Yet renewable energy growth remains concentrated in advanced economies, leaving the vast majority of developing countries behind despite significant economic and development needs, according to a 2024 IFC report.

Xinjiang Daqo is Daqo New Energy’s major polysilicon production subsidiary. The company began producing polysilicon in the Xinjiang region of northwestern China in 2013, having previously operated in the Chongqing region. Polysilicon and other industries in Xinjiang have been associated with alleged forced labour practices by the Chinese government against the region’s native Uyghur Muslim population.

Polysilicon sector shifts

China’s polysilicon industry is in a state of change as the industry and government pursue ways to counteract the low prices and oversupply, which have caused problems for the sector’s biggest players.

Last year, the government unveiled a number of “anti-internal competition” laws across various industries, in order to curb the low prices and fierce competition which had emerged between Chinese firms. The polysilicon industry has seen that “cutthroat” dynamic play out over the last two years, leading to massive industry overcapacity and ensuing low prices which saw the sector’s major players post regular financial losses.

More recently, the major polysilicon industry firms, led by Daqo, Tongwei and GCL Technologies, established a RMB3 billion “inventory platform” company designed to manage the flow and level of polysilicon capacity and inventory. This would mark a significant change, from harsh competition to a more managed price and supply environment.

Broader Clean Energy Strategy Google’s clean energy purchasing strategy goes beyond these 1.2 GW agreements.","Google has agreed to buy nearly 1.2 gigawatts (GW) of carbon-free energy to power its data centers across the United States. The tech company signed a set of long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with Clearway Energy Group (Clearway). These deals will deliver clean electricity from new wind and solar projects in Missouri, Texas, and West Virginia.

The energy will support the electric grid regions where Google’s data centers are located. The agreements are a big step for the tech giant. They help meet its rising electricity needs and cut carbon emissions from its operations.

Amanda Peterson Corio, Global Head of Data Center Energy, Google, stated:

“Strengthening the grid by deploying more reliable and clean energy is crucial for supporting the digital infrastructure that businesses and individuals depend on. Our collaboration with Clearway will help power our data centers and the broader economic growth of communities within SPP, ERCOT, and PJM footprints.”

How Google Secures Carbon-Free Power

A Power Purchase Agreement is a long-term contract between a power buyer and a clean energy producer. In Google’s case, these contracts ensure that the projects Clearway builds will sell electricity to the grid. In return, Google pays for the energy produced over many years.

Clearway agreed to provide Google with 1.17 GW of new carbon-free energy. This energy will support regional grids like SPP, ERCOT, and PJM. The total partnership includes a 71.5 megawatt (MW) clean power deal in West Virginia. This brings the total to around 1.24 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy for Google’s use.

These projects will generate wind and solar power and deliver it into U.S. grid systems that serve Google’s data centers. The total investment in the new energy infrastructure tied to these deals exceeds $2.4 billion.

Construction for the new wind and solar assets is expected to begin soon, with the first facilities planned to start operations in 2027 and 2028.

The states involved are Missouri, Texas, and West Virginia. These states cover parts of major grid regions like SPP (Southwest Power Pool), ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas), and PJM Interconnection, which deliver power to millions of customers and data centers.

Why Google Is Investing in Clean Power

Google has set clear climate goals tied to its fast-growing energy use. In 2020, the company became the first major corporation to match 100% of its annual electricity use with renewable energy purchases. This means Google buys enough clean power each year to equal all the electricity its operations consume. However, this approach does not guarantee clean energy at every hour.

To address this gap, Google launched a more ambitious target. The company aims to operate on carbon-free energy, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, by 2030. This goal goes beyond traditional renewable matching. It requires clean electricity to be available every hour in the same regions where Google uses power. This makes energy sourcing more complex and increases the need for new clean generation near data centers.

Google has also committed to reaching net-zero emissions across its operations and value chain by 2030. This includes direct emissions, purchased electricity, and indirect emissions from suppliers and construction.

The tech company does not plan to rely heavily on carbon offsets for this goal. Instead, it focuses on cutting emissions at the source, mainly by cleaning up the electricity supply.

Progress so far shows both gains and challenges. In 2024, Google reported net emissions of about 18 million metric tons of CO₂-equivalent, up from 14.3 million in 2023. The increase came largely from data center expansion and higher electricity demand from artificial intelligence workloads.

At the same time, Google reduced the carbon intensity of its electricity use by about 12% compared with the previous year. This shows efficiency gains, even as total energy use rose.

Clean energy purchases play a key role in this strategy. By signing long-term power purchase agreements, Google helps bring new wind and solar projects online. These projects add clean power to local grids and lower emissions over time.

The nearly 1.2 GW of carbon-free energy announced for U.S. data centers supports this approach. It increases clean supply in regions where Google’s power demand is growing fastest.

Broader Clean Energy Strategy

Google’s clean energy purchasing strategy goes beyond these 1.2 GW agreements. The company continues to enter renewable contracts around the world. For example:

Google and TotalEnergies signed a 15-year PPA to supply 1.5 terawatt-hours (TWh) of certified renewable electricity from the Montpelier solar farm in Ohio. This power will help support Google’s data centers in that region.

Google is also active in international renewable power agreements. It has signed a 21-year PPA with TotalEnergies. This deal provides 1 TWh of solar power for its data centers in Malaysia.

In India, Google made a deal with ReNew Energy. They will build a 150 MW solar project in Rajasthan. This project will generate about 425,000 MWh of clean electricity each year, which is enough to power more than 360,000 homes.

These deals illustrate how Google is diversifying its clean energy supply by securing multiple sources and technologies across continents.\

Impact on Data Centers and Regional Grids

Data centers use large amounts of electricity. U.S. data centers’ electricity consumption reached 183 TWh in 2024, accounting for more than 4% of the nation’s total power demand amid surging AI workloads. ​This marked a continued rise from 176 TWh (4.4%) in 2023. Projections suggest 5% or higher in 2025 as hyperscale facilities expand rapidly.

When powered by fossil fuels, they also produce high carbon emissions. Clean energy purchases help reduce the carbon footprint of these facilities over time.

As data center demand continues to grow, companies like Google are adding new clean power to the grid. Long-term power purchase agreements support the construction of new wind and solar projects. These projects supply clean electricity to regional grids and benefit all users, not only data centers. This helps lower the overall carbon intensity of power systems.

What This Means for Corporate Renewable Leadership

Google’s nearly 1.2 GW clean energy purchase reflects a wider industry shift. Large technology firms are becoming some of the world’s biggest buyers of renewable power. As artificial intelligence and cloud services expand, long-term clean energy contracts help companies secure a stable power supply and manage energy costs.

These corporate agreements also play a key role in the U.S. energy market. Long-term PPAs give developers the financial certainty needed to build new renewable projects. Supported by policy incentives and rising corporate demand, U.S. wind and solar capacity continues to grow. This makes large clean energy portfolios increasingly viable for companies like Google.

The Clearway deal adds to Google’s global portfolio of renewable energy contracts. This portfolio spans multiple regions and energy technologies. By securing large volumes of clean power, Google is strengthening the sustainability of its data centers as digital demand continues to rise.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2401582411.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 12:59:32.961948

A national study finds that more than half of those facilities may already be at risk as soon as 2050, turning future storms into potential toxic events rather than just high water.

These sites store or handle sewage, trash, oil, gas, and other materials, and many sit next to neighborhoods that already live with heavy pollution. The research, led by Lara J. Cushing at the University of California, Los Angeles and funded by the Environmental Protection Agency, concludes that low-income communities and communities of color are more likely to live close to facilities projected to flood.

Thousands of coastal facilities already on a ticking clock

To map the danger, Cushing’s team examined more than 47,600 coastal facilities, then combined their locations with sea level projections for 2050 and 2100. They focused on floods with about a one in one hundred chance of happening in any given year, a standard often used for insurance and building rules.

Under a high-pollution path, the study projects that 5,500 sites could face that level of flooding by 2100 and nearly 3,800 as soon as mid century. About 44 percent of the at-risk facilities are fossil fuel ports or terminals, with 30 percent power plants, 24 percent refineries, and 22 percent sewage treatment plants, largely in seven states including Louisiana, Florida, New Jersey, Texas, California, New York, and Massachusetts.

How rising seas can turn industrial sites into toxic floods

Sea level rise might sound slow, but it changes the starting point for every storm and high tide. As oceans warm and expand and some stretches of coastline sink, water can reach farther inland, overtopping defenses that once felt solid and pooling in low-lying industrial zones.

So what happens when floodwater moves through facilities that store fuel, chemicals, or waste? It can pick up those substances and carry them into nearby streets and homes. Public health experts such as Sacoby Wilson at the University of Maryland warn that people near sewage plants or large animal farms could encounter bacteria such as E. coli, while those near refineries face metals and chemicals tied to stomach illness, rashes, breathing trouble, and in the long run higher risks of organ damage or cancer.

Who lives closest to the danger?

The researchers then asked who lives within about two thirds of a mile of facilities that are expected to flood and compared those neighborhoods with other coastal areas that do not have an at-risk site. They found higher shares of renters, households in poverty, seniors, people who identify as Hispanic, and residents without cars near the hazardous sites.

That pattern echoes broader research on environmental injustice and earlier mapping of toxic flood risks in coastal California.Derek Van Berkel at the University of Michigan, who was not involved in the new study, said the most “alarming” part is the feedback loop as repeated floods spread contamination and make it harder for residents to recover before the next disaster.

Limits of the analysis and what could still change

Like any model, the analysis has blind spots. It leaves out some risky infrastructure such as oil and gas pipelines and does not estimate how future storms will change flooding, so the real-world threat could be higher.

The future is not fixed, and the authors say their flood model is best used as a screening tool rather than a precise forecast. Under a lower-pollution path, the study estimates that over 300 sites could avoid serious flood danger by 2100, and Thomas Chandler at Columbia University’s National Center for Disaster Preparedness calls this “a really important study” for planners trying to prevent disasters where damaged facilities spread toxins into floodwater. Cushing said “we do have time to respond and try to mitigate the risks and also increase resilience,” but that will only happen if officials, companies, and residents start planning before the next big flood arrives.

A New Approach to Power Efficiency

Researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have developed a new silicon carbide based power module designed to dramatically improve how electricity is converted and delivered. A power module is the housing that contains power electronics, which regulate the flow of electricity between systems. This new design delivers record-breaking efficiency, higher power density, and a manufacturing process that keeps costs low.

The technology is known as NREL's Ultra-Low Inductance Smart power module, or ULIS. By using silicon carbide semiconductors, ULIS can achieve five times the energy density of earlier designs while taking up less space. That combination allows manufacturers to build equipment that is smaller, lighter, and more energy efficient. The 1200-volt, 400-amp module is well suited for data centers, electrical grids, microreactors, and heavy-duty platforms such as next-generation aircraft and military vehicles.

Why Ultra-Low Inductance Matters

A key advantage of ULIS is its exceptionally low parasitic inductance, which refers to resistance that slows changes in electrical current and limits efficient power conversion. ULIS reduces this resistance by seven to nine times compared with today's most advanced silicon carbide power modules.

Because the system can switch electrical current extremely quickly and efficiently, it converts more of the available electricity into usable power. That capability allows ULIS to extract significantly more value from the same energy supply, making it a strong candidate for addressing growing global energy needs.

""We consider ULIS to be a true breakthrough,"" said Faisal Khan, NREL's chief power electronics researcher and the principal investigator for the project. ""It's a future-proofed, ultrafast power module that will make the next generation of power converters more affordable, efficient, and compact.""

Built for Reliability in Extreme Conditions

ULIS is designed not only for efficiency, but also for reliability in demanding environments. According to Khan, the lightweight yet powerful module can monitor its own condition and anticipate component failures before they happen.

This feature is especially critical for high-risk applications such as aviation and military operations. For aircraft operating at 30,000 feet or vehicles navigating combat zones, early failure detection can be the difference between mission success and catastrophic loss.

""ULIS was a truly organic effort, built entirely in-house here at NREL,"" Khan said. ""We are very excited to demonstrate its strengths in real-world settings.""

A Radical Redesign for Lower Cost Manufacturing

Many of ULIS' performance gains come from a completely new physical design.

Traditional power modules stack semiconductor devices inside box-like packages. ULIS instead arranges its circuitry in a flat, octagonal layout. This disk-shaped structure fits more components into a smaller footprint, reducing both size and weight. At the same time, its innovative current routing minimizes magnetic interference, which helps deliver cleaner electrical output and higher overall efficiency.

""Our biggest concern was that the device switches off and on very quickly, and we needed a layout that wouldn't create a chokepoint within the design,"" said Shuofeng Zhao, an NREL power electronics researcher who designed ULIS' flux cancellation architecture.

Early concepts explored complex three-dimensional shapes, including designs resembling flowers or hollow cylinders. However, these ideas proved too expensive or difficult to manufacture. The breakthrough came when the team simplified the concept into a nearly two-dimensional structure. Sarwar Islam, another NREL power electronics researcher, proposed the flattened design that balanced performance, cost, and manufacturability.

""We squished it flat, like a pancake,"" Zhao said, ""and suddenly we had a low-cost, high-performing design that was much easier to fabricate.""

Joshua Major, also part of the NREL power electronics team, developed new fabrication methods that allowed the intricate structure to be produced using only in-house tools and facilities. The result was a design that combined the electrical advantages of three-dimensional systems with the practicality of flat manufacturing.

Flexible Materials and Wireless Control

ULIS also departs from conventional materials. Traditional power modules bond copper directly to rigid ceramic bases to conduct electricity and manage heat. While effective, this approach limits flexibility.

Instead, ULIS bonds copper to a flexible polymer called Temprion. This change produces a thinner, lighter, and more adaptable structure. The material bonds to copper using only heat and pressure, and its components can be machined with widely available equipment. As a result, manufacturing costs fall into the hundreds of dollars rather than the thousands.

Another major advance allows ULIS to operate wirelessly. The module can be controlled and monitored without physical cables, functioning as a self-contained unit. This modular, Lego-like design allows it to be integrated into a wide range of systems, from data center servers to advanced aircraft and military vehicles. A patent for the low-latency wireless communication protocol, led by Sarwar Islam, is currently pending.

Designed for Future Technologies

While ULIS currently relies on advanced silicon carbide semiconductors, the design was intentionally built to evolve. The module can be adapted for future semiconductor materials, including gallium nitride and gallium oxide, which has not yet reached commercial use.

Together, these innovations support a central goal. As societies become increasingly dependent on reliable electricity, ULIS is designed to deliver efficiency without sacrificing dependability.

Where ULIS Could Make the Biggest Difference

ULIS is expected to have broad impact across multiple sectors.

In the U.S. power grid, electricity must be converted into usable forms before it reaches consumers. This process often depends on large, low-frequency equipment that wastes energy. ULIS' fast switching improves efficiency while its ability to tolerate high temperatures may reduce long-term maintenance costs.

In aviation, the module's ability to move electricity quickly and conserve energy enables lighter and more powerful converters. This could help make electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft more practical and commercially viable.

ULIS could also play a role in future fusion energy systems. Although commercial fusion remains under development, these systems will require compact and reliable pulsed power components. ULIS' ultralow inductance and durable design make it well suited for that challenge.

As industries pursue more reliable electricity, advanced artificial intelligence, and next-generation vehicles, ULIS is now available for licensing.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/nrel-ulis-power-module.webp,N,,2026-01-19 13:58:48.087637

CONTACT: John Peevers Bruce Power 5193863799 john.peevers@brucepower.com","Kincardine, Ontario, Jan. 19, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Ontario Chamber of Commerce (OCC) independent economic impact analysis final report confirms a proposed new large-scale Bruce C nuclear project would deliver lasting job creation, stimulate Ontario’s economy, and reinforce Canada’s long-term energy security for decades to come.

The economic analysis – Bruce C Economic Impact Assessment – Summary of Findings — conducted by the Ontario Chamber of Commerce and Prism Economics and Analysis for the Nuclear Innovation Institute — finds that the Bruce C Project would generate major economic benefits locally, provincially and nationally, driven by both its construction and operating life.

The Bruce C project’s direct benefits would be concentrated in Ontario, contributing more than $217-billion to Ontario’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) during its 80-year lifespan; and would contribute $2.3 billion to the Clean Energy Frontier (Bruce, Grey and Huron Counties) regional GDP on an average annual basis.

“Ontario’s nuclear advantage is powering our future and showcasing the very best of Canadian technology, resources, and workers,” said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Energy and Mines. “Bruce C represents one of greatest drivers of economic growth in Canada, creating 18,900 jobs and $238 billion lift to Canada’s GDP over its 80-year lifespan. It is clear that Bruce Power’s C is essential to Ontario’s energy and economic future, as we build on-time and on-budget.”

The proposed addition of up to 4,800 megawatts (MW) of energy production through the Bruce C Project, currently undergoing a federal integrated Impact Assessment, would make Bruce Power the largest nuclear generator in the world with a capacity of 12,000 MW. The company is Canada’s largest public-private partnership and its Life-Extension Program and Major Component Replacement Project is the country’s biggest privately financed electricity infrastructure project in Canada.

“The Ontario Chamber of Commerce independent economic impact analysis confirms what our communities already know — Bruce C has the potential to be a once‑in‑a‑generation economic engine,” said James Scongack, Bruce Power’s Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice-President. “From job creation and economic growth to long-term energy security, the benefits will be felt in the Clean Energy Frontier region, as well as across Ontario and Canada.”

Of the nearly $238-billion contribution to Canada’s GDP, approximately $61 billion would be generated during the site preparation and construction phase, and more than $176 billion during the operations phase.

“The Bruce C Project would be an investment in strengthening our communities and the economy, while empowering skilled workers and innovation across Ontario,” said Pat Dalzell, Bruce Power’s Vice-President, Corporate Affairs and Market Development. “Bruce Power is committed to creating lasting prosperity while delivering the reliable, carbon‑free electricity and cancer-fighting medical isotopes to power the next century of Canadian innovation and opportunity.”

During the proposed site preparation and construction phase, an estimated annual average total of 18,900 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs would be created or supported nationally, of which nearly 15,900 jobs would be created or supported in Ontario.

The subsequent operations phase would result in an annual average of over 6,700 FTE jobs nationally, with nearly 5,900 jobs in Ontario. Overall, more than 10,100 total FTE jobs would be created or supported in Canada each year over the Project’s entire lifespan, of which approximately 8,700 would be in Ontario.

These jobs would provide average annual labour income (including wages and benefits) of approximately $1 billion at the national level, of which nearly $900 million would be earned annually by those employed in Ontario.

Aside from employment benefits, tax revenues of $55-million annually for municipal governments within the Clean Energy Frontier would help spawn growth in Bruce Power’s surrounding communities.

“As the host community, we’re proud to work with Bruce Power to advance the Bruce C Project and understand the significant economic impact it would bring,” said Kenneth Craig, Mayor of the Municipality of Kincardine. “Our region has long been a leader in clean energy and this project ensures we remain at the forefront of Canada’s clean-energy future.”

“This project represents a transformational opportunity for Bruce County,” said Luke Charbonneau, Bruce County Warden and Mayor of the Town of Saugeen Shores. “The economic benefits, training opportunities, and long-term jobs will make life better for families and businesses throughout our region for decades.”

Bruce Power’s current Life-Extension Program and ongoing operations create and sustain 27,000 direct and indirect jobs annually.

With 95 per cent of Bruce Power’s current spend in Canada through a robust and long-standing made-in-Ontario supply chain, the Bruce C Project would build on Bruce Power’s Canadian at our Core campaign, which hinges on commitments to provide safe, reliable power to Ontario and cancer-fighting medical isotopes globally, drive the economy and strengthen partnerships with Indigenous communities.

The companies on January 7 noted that the transaction, first announced as a $16.4-billion deal a year ago, unites Constellation’s nuclear power fleet with Calpine’s natural gas-fired and geothermal generation. The cash-and-stock deal, when including debt, has a total value of $26.6 billion.

The groups said the merged company will power data centers, advanced manufacturing facilities, and critical infrastructure.

“This isn’t just about two great companies coming together—it’s about strengthening America’s future,” said Joe Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation, in a statement “Constellation is stepping up to power America’s growth when our nation’s demand for energy is surging, and our global competitors are racing to capture AI leadership. By uniting Constellation and Calpine, we’re providing the reliable, clean energy that keeps our communities strong, our businesses competitive and our nation secure.”

‘Exciting Day’

Andrew Novotny, president and CEO of Calpine, said, “This is an exciting day for both our companies and for the customers and communities we serve. We have the assets that power America today and meet the needs of tomorrow. Our expanded capabilities will allow us to better serve customers and communities, enable investment in critical infrastructure and support national priorities for energy security, economic competitiveness and technological leadership. Our teams share a relentless commitment to safety, sustainability and operational excellence, and I’m excited about what we will accomplish together.”

“As a decades-long investor in power generation, ECP aims to unlock value, drive long-term growth opportunities and strengthen asset reliability—often serving as a bridge between public and private markets,” said Tyler Reeder, president and managing partner of ECP. “We are proud to have achieved those goals in partnership with Calpine’s management team and believe this combination validates that vision, setting the company up for future success while meeting the evolving needs of its customers, communities and the U.S.’s electrical grid.”

The combined company will serve 2.5 million retail and business customers nationwide. The groups said the acquisition also strengthens Constellation’s footprint in high-demand regions, including Texas and California, while maintaining significant operations in Illinois, Maryland, New York and Pennsylvania.

Constellation and Calpine together have 55 GW of generation capacity. The company will maintain headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland, along with a significant presence in Houston, Texas.

Antitrust Settlement

The U.S. Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, together with the attorney general of Texas, on December 5 said it would require divestiture of six power plants in Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Texas to resolve antitrust concerns arising from Constellation’s acquisition of Calpine. The Antitrust Division had filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to block the proposed acquisition. At the same time, the Division filed a proposed settlement that it said, upon court approval, would resolve the Division’s competitive concerns.

“The price of electricity is a pocketbook issue to American consumers working hard to afford their monthly utility bills. When it comes to their electricity bills, Americans deserve the benefit of robust competition among electricity generators,” said Assistant Attorney General Abigail Slater of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. “This settlement includes a six-plant divestiture to an acquisition that risked harming tens of millions of electricity consumers in the mid-Atlantic and Texas. I am appreciative of the partnership with our co-plaintiff, the State of Texas, to secure relief for consumers.”

The DOJ said the divestitures “resolve the Division’s concerns that the acquisition would harm competition and lead to higher prices on consumers reliant on the ERCOT and PJM electricity grids.” Specifically, the settlement requires the companies to divest their ownership interests in four electricity plants serving PJM and two electricity plants serving ERCOT. The divested plants are:

Bethlehem Energy Center, a natural gas combined cycle plant, located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

Safeguarding Heritage Through Adaptation This transition from awareness to action signals the emergence of a new generation of agricultural stewards in southern Iraq.
They are shaping its outcome and ensuring that agricultural heritage in southern Iraq remains productive, resilient, and alive for generations to come.","Across southern Iraq, agriculture has long been the backbone of communities, sustaining livelihoods, cultures, and identities for generations. From the iconic date palms of Basra to the wheat fields and vegetable farms of Thi Qar, Maysan, and Muthanna, farming has never been simply an occupation. It is a living inheritance. Today, that inheritance is under pressure, but a new generation of farmers is reshaping its future through science, renewable energy, and climate-resilient practices.

Inheritance Under Pressure

For decades, traditional agricultural systems provided stability in southern Iraq. However, accelerating climate pressures have begun to erode these foundations. Farmers are facing chronic water scarcity, rising soil salinity, saltwater intrusion into rivers, and widening energy gaps that undermine productivity and sustainability. Practices such as flood irrigation, once effective, are increasingly incompatible with declining water availability and degraded land.

Field assessments revealed the scale of the challenge. Nearly two-thirds of surveyed farmers still relied on flood irrigation, while soil and water salinity testing remained limited. Financial constraints, lack of technical knowledge, and unreliable access to energy were consistently cited as barriers to modernization. Dependence on diesel fuel and unstable electricity supplies further increased costs and vulnerability. Without timely intervention, agricultural systems that had endured for centuries risked becoming unsustainable.

Recognizing this urgency, the Government of Japan and UNDP Iraq launched a targeted programme under the initiative “Strengthening Conflict-Sensitive, Peace-Positive Climate Action in the Southern and Euphrates Region of Iraq.” The objective extended beyond introducing new technologies. It aimed to enable farmers to transition toward low-emission, climate-resilient practices capable of protecting land, livelihoods, and social stability for future generations.

A Scientific Awakening Rooted in Local Reality

The transformation began with evidence. Prior to implementation, the project conducted surveys, land assessments, and market studies across Basra, Thi Qar, Maysan, and Muthanna. More than 250 farmers were consulted to identify constraints, priorities, and realistic entry points for change. The findings shaped a practical, context-specific curriculum designed to address salinity, inefficient water use, energy insecurity, and limited exposure to climate-smart agriculture.

Learning was grounded in practice rather than theory. In late 2025, intensive three-day trainings were delivered across the four governorates, engaging over 185 farmers in a hands-on, learning-by-doing approach. Abstract concepts were translated into tangible skills that could be applied immediately in the field.

Farmers strengthened their ability to manage land under saline and water-scarce conditions by improving drainage, increasing irrigation efficiency, and adopting measures to reduce soil degradation. They deepened their understanding of how salinity affects crops, explored salt-tolerant varieties, and learned how informed water management can restore productivity rather than exhaust resources.

For many participants, science became tangible for the first time. Farmers tested their own soil and water, measured electrical conductivity, learned by the word of mouth of peers. Knowledge shifted from distant theory to practical decision-making embedded in daily agricultural work.

The training also extended to livestock management. Improved feeding practices, manure handling, and hygiene measures demonstrated how animal health, environmental protection, and productivity are interconnected.

From Knowledge to Confidence and Action

The results were immediate and measurable. Pre- and post-training assessments showed significant gains in technical knowledge across all governorates. More importantly, these gains translated into confidence. Farmers reported a stronger ability to understand, adapt, and apply modern practices within their own constraints.

Across Basra, Thi Qar, Maysan, and Muthanna, the majority of participants expressed readiness to implement at least one new practice immediately, while others indicated strong intent to adopt changes in the near term. Improved irrigation scheduling, modern irrigation systems, and renewable energy solutions consistently ranked as top priorities.

At the center of this shift was a growing commitment to solar energy. Farmers identified solar-powered water pumping as a viable alternative to unreliable electricity grids and costly diesel fuel. Solar power offered stability, reduced emissions, and long-term affordability. When combined with improved irrigation management, it enabled farmers to reduce water loss, stabilize production during peak seasons, and protect soil and income from climate and energy volatility.

Sustainability, once perceived as an abstract concept, became a practical strategy grounded in everyday choices. Cleaner energy, smarter water use, healthier soils, and lower operating costs formed a pathway toward resilient livelihoods.

Safeguarding Heritage Through Adaptation

This transition from awareness to action signals the emergence of a new generation of agricultural stewards in southern Iraq. Farmers are no longer positioned solely as those affected by climate change. They are increasingly acting as agents of adaptation, using science and renewable energy to preserve their heritage through transformation rather than resistance.

By anchoring traditional knowledge in evidence and pairing ancestral practices with modern tools, these farmers are doing more than sustaining production. They are protecting a way of life. Fields are becoming spaces of experimentation and resilience, where solar energy replaces uncertainty, irrigation is guided by data rather than guesswork, and stewardship is measured not only by harvests, but by the long-term health of ecosystems.

They are not merely enduring the climate crisis. They are shaping its outcome and ensuring that agricultural heritage in southern Iraq remains productive, resilient, and alive for generations to come.

About the Project

The project “Strengthening Conflict-Sensitive, Peace-Positive Climate Action in the Southern and Euphrates Region of Iraq” is implemented by UNDP Iraq with the support of the Government of Japan through the Japan Supplementary Budget. It responds to intensifying climate pressures in southern Iraq, particularly water scarcity, soil salinity, land degradation, and energy insecurity, which threaten agricultural livelihoods, food security, and community stability. The initiative promotes scalable, evidence-based solutions that link climate resilience with peacebuilding and sustainable development.",https://www.undp.org/themes/custom/undpglobal/images/meta-undp-logo.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 14:59:43.467317

The Trump administration initiative calls on PJM Interconnection, which serves 67 million customers in 13 states, not including South Carolina, and Washington, D.C., to conduct an emergency procurement auction to address escalating electricity prices and growing reliability risks across the mid-Atlantic region.

PJM later on Friday unveiled its own plan, which called for big data centers to voluntarily bring their own new generation or face the potential of having their power supply curtailed during peak demand periods. The grid operator also called for the creation of an accelerated interconnection track for state-sponsored generation projects.

At a White House event, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum joined several state governors to discuss initiatives to speed the construction of more than $15 billion in new power generation on PJM, which has been criticized for being too slow to build a cushion against rotating blackouts as demand rises.

Rapid expansion of data centers to fuel things like artificial intelligence has stretched the resources of PJM and other regional U.S. electric grids. President Donald Trump is seeking to combat consumer price inflation that risks undermining support for Republicans ahead of November's midterm elections.

The White House is seeking caps on the amount existing power plants can charge in the PJM capacity market. A recent PJM capacity market auction set record-high prices for power generators that were more than 800% higher than the previous year, increasing electricity prices for homes and businesses.

The agreement would also require data centers to pay for the new generation built on their behalf – whether they show up and use the power or not - rather than buying up existing power. The concept is called BYOG, or ""bring your own generation.""

PJM said it is reviewing the principles set forth by the White House and governors. PJM was not invited to the event, a PJM spokesperson told Reuters.

PJM has forecast that the grid's peak usage in the summer will climb by about 70 gigawatts to 220 gigawatts over the next 15 years. The record summer peak for PJM was 165 gigawatts in 2006.

Since 2023, PJM says it has processed more than 170 gigawatts of new generation requests. Nearly 60 gigawatts of projects have completed PJM's study process and have either signed or been offered generation interconnection agreements.

Rising power bills in PJM's region have led to a political backlash over the last year and threats by some governors to abandon the regional grid. Last summer, nine state governors wrote an open letter to the PJM board of managers criticizing the grid operator for not doing enough to address an escalating electricity affordability crisis.

""Unfortunately, what we have seen in our region is that PJM has been too damn slow to let new generation onto the grid at a time where energy demand is going up,"" Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said at the White House event on Friday.

Burgum said PJM has been lucky so far in avoiding widespread blackouts.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/d0/4d062032-0238-4d7f-b0ed-c71a5acb313b/66b22c3870bb0.image.jpg?crop=1762%2C925%2C0%2C0&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-19 13:59:09.816180

25%: Canada’s EV Tariff Deal With China Puts The U.S., Auto Industry On Alert

As we reported on Friday, the China-Canada deal is small for now—it’s capped at 49,000 cars for its first year, with expansion to 70,000 within five years. But it’s a start (or rather a restart, since it returns Canada to its pre-2023 tariff deal) to something potentially big: the growing expansion of Chinese EVs into North America. And as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney explicitly said, most of these imports will cost under $25,000 U.S. (about $35,000 CAD).

Naturally, not everyone is happy about what could be a threat to automotive jobs in North America. Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, blamed the Trump administration’s strained relations with Canada, reports The Hill:

“We just got absolutely rolled in this Canada – China deal. A stark foreign policy failure with domestic economic consequences,” Schatz wrote in a post on social platform X.

“The most basic principle in politics and geopolitics is loyalty to friends. And we weren’t just disloyal – we were hostile. So here we are,” he added.

President Donald Trump, for his part, appeared to give the deal a thumbs-up: “If you can get a deal with China, you should do that,” Trump told reporters. Other U.S. economic officials said Canada will ultimately regret the deal.

My colleague Kevin Williams has a good story about what’s at stake, and why leaders in the auto-producing parts of Canada are especially unhappy about the deal. And it brings plenty of concern among U.S. auto industry observers as well. From the Associated Press:

Chinese automakers will have to meet standards required for the Canadian auto market for the latest trade arrangement to be successful—standards that are similar to those in the U.S.—which is likely to incentivize Chinese auto manufacturing investment in Canada.

They’ll also have to establish which segment of the market they are targeting there: Higher-end vehicles, or less-expensive ones that sell at higher volumes.

Regardless, “It brings it home to what is needed to compete globally,” said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at AlixPartners. The firm predicts Chinese brands will account for 30% of the global market by 2030.

“They’ve already started in Europe. They started in South America. Now Mexico and Canada,” Wakefield said. American carmakers “don’t want to end up as a Brazil with your ethanol-based cars that aren’t sellable anywhere else in the world and ... like Britain or Australia that used to matter in the auto world, and no longer really matter.”

Emphasis mine above, because that is indeed a scary outcome for the U.S. auto industry.

Then again, if it brings more affordable hybrid and zero-emission options to North America—and the way things are potentially going, the U.S. included—and is that such a bad thing? Ultimately, North Americans will have to make a choice: affordability or loyalty to local production.

Unless, of course, our automakers can meet people halfway and get that $50,000 average new car price down considerably.

50%: The Canada-China Trade Deal Is Good News For Tesla

Tesla had a bad year in Canada in 2025, with sales dropping nearly 64% amid the U.S. trade war and CEO Elon Musk’s multiple controversies. But the China trade deal could be good news for the electric automaker: it builds a ton of cars in China, including ones it exports to Canada (unlike the U.S.)

And now, those just got a whole lot cheaper, potentially. Here’s Reuters with more:

While many Chinese automakers will be keen to seize the opportunity as they expand exports, Tesla has an advantage as it in 2023 already equipped its Shanghai plant, its biggest and most cost-efficient factory globally, to build and export a Canada-specific version of its Model Y.

The U.S. automaker had that same year started shipping the car from Shanghai to Canada, boosting Canadian imports of automobiles from China to its largest port, Vancouver, by 460% year over year to 44,356 in 2023.

But it was forced to stop in 2024 and switched to shipping from its U.S. and Berlin factories after Ottawa imposed 100% tariffs, citing a wish to counter what they called China's intentional state-directed policy of overcapacity.

""This new agreement could allow resumption of those exports rather quickly,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of research firm AutoForecast Solutions.

Now, to see if Canadians actually line up to buy those cars.

75%: Affordability Anxiety Will Define 2026’s Car Market

But all of this, I’d argue, isn’t even a technology issue or a geopolitical one: it’s an affordability issue. The appeal of Chinese imports is that they’re good and they’re cheap—a combination that feels in short supply in the North American car market.

According to Automotive News, affordability anxiety was the overwhelming vibe at the 2026 Detroit Auto Show. And while carmakers may breathe a sigh of relief that they’re no longer under a regulatory gun to make tons of EVs now that fuel economy requirements have been eased, they can’t lean on super-expensive gas trucks to save the day like they used to:

“What’s holding the market back is certainly affordability and really the lack of low-priced vehicles,” said Michael Robinet, executive director of automotive consulting at S&P Global Mobility. “Not only in the United States, but around the world, this is a problem.”

Sen. Bernie Moreno, a former car dealer and member of the committee working to reschedule testimony from the Detroit 3 CEOs, said the Trump administration is easing regulations to help bring down vehicle costs and that automakers also have a role to play. The government is rolling back emissions standards and in September eliminated a $7,500 tax credit that had greatly fueled EV demand.

It now takes about 36 weeks of median income to buy an average new vehicle, according to Cox Automotive data. That’s down from 42 weeks three years ago but not necessarily a sign affordability has significantly improved, Cox Executive Analyst Erin Keating said.

“Even with affordable vehicles out there, fewer buyers are buying. The consensus is that this shift isn’t temporary. ... That’s one reason dealer sentiment reflects concern. The missing customers aren’t sidelined. They’re essentially excluded.”

So how do they plan to meet the moment? According to that story, Jeep and Ram parent company Stellantis is preparing more models priced under $40,000 and even $30,000 (though I’ll believe the latter when I see it) and even Ford said it might consider making sedans again after canceling all of them in 2020.

One bright spot for EV fans: the falling costs of batteries should make electric power more affordable. But clearly, the demand is there for new cars that won’t break the bank. And if the familiar automakers won’t deliver, it seems China Inc. is ready to.

100%: How Much Does It Matter To You Where Your Car Is Made?

I have owned Toyotas made in the United States, a Chevrolet and a Mazda made in Mexico, and a Kia made in South Korea (that's now made in Georgia instead), among other things. I can't say that production origin means all that much to me in a globalized world.

So is that a priority for you when you buy a car? Sound off in the comments.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) of 2025 introduced comprehensive foreign entity of concern (FEOC) rules that prohibit taxpayers considered “prohibited foreign entities” from claiming clean energy tax credits.

The FEOC rules apply to the following clean energy tax credits:

Section 45Q: Carbon oxide sequestration credit

Section 45U: Zero-emission nuclear power production credit

Section 45X: Advanced manufacturing production credit

Section 45Y: Clean electricity production credit

Section 45Z: Clean fuel production credit

Section 48E: Clean electricity investment credit

The FEOC rules are designed to prevent entities subject to certain foreign ownership, control, or influence – primarily from China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea – from benefiting from these tax credits. The rules also include restrictions based on material assistance from such entities for Sections 45X, 45Y and 48E, which took effect on January 1, 2026.

What Is a Prohibited Foreign Entity?

A prohibited foreign entity is any “specified foreign entity” or “foreign-influenced entity.”

Specified Foreign Entity

Generally, a specified foreign entity is:

any designated terrorist organization; specially designated national or blocked person identified by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC); entity alleged by the Attorney General to be involved in violations of certain federal laws relating to espionage, arms exportation, or the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEPPA); or entity determined by the Secretary of Treasury to be engaged in conduct detrimental to US national security or foreign policy;

any Chinese military company, entity subject to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act or certain entities that are ineligible for Department of Defense contracts or funding;

the government of China, Russia, Iran or North Korea (including any agency or instrumentality thereof); any entity or business incorporated, organized, or having its principal place of business therein; or any non-publicly traded entity that, taking into account certain constructive ownership rules, is more than 50 percent owned (by vote or value, capital or profits or otherwise by beneficial interest) by any such government, entity, or business; and

any other entity identified under designated federal statutes.

Foreign Influenced Entity

Generally, a foreign influenced entity is:

any entity with respect to which, during the taxable year:

a specified foreign entity has the direct authority to appoint a covered officer (e.g., board member, CEO, CFO);

a single specified foreign entity owns at least 25 percent, or multiple specified foreign entities own 40 percent; or

at least 15 percent of its debt is issued to one or more specified foreign entities; and

an entity that, during the prior taxable year, made a payment to a specified foreign entity under a contract or arrangement that gives the specified foreign entity (or any person related to the specified foreign entity) “effective control” over any qualified facility, energy storage technology or eligible component (including the production thereof, or the extraction, processing, or recycling of any applicable critical mineral with respect thereto) of such entity (or any person related to such entity).

What Is Effective Control and How Does It Impact Clean Energy Tax Credit Eligibility?

Effective control refers to any contractual or licensing arrangement that gives a specified foreign entity authority over key aspects of a project or component, such as the ability to:

determine quantity or timing of component production or electricity output or storage;

direct sales or usage of output;

restrict access to any critical data, site of production, or part of a facility;

maintain or operate, on an exclusive basis, any plant or essential equipment; or

with respect to licensing agreements, direct sourcing, operations, or certain service arrangements or receive royalties beyond 10 years.

If a taxpayer makes a payment under such an arrangement, and such arrangement is not a bona fide purchase or sale of intellectual property, it may be classified as a foreign-influenced entity that is not eligible to claim tax credits under Sections 45X, 45Y and 48E. Effective control limitations do not apply under Sections 45Q, 45U or 45Z. For Section 48E, there is a 10-year recapture period for tax credits if such payments are made after the project is placed in service.

When Do FEOC Restrictions on Clean Energy Tax Credits Take Effect?

The effective dates for FEOC restrictions vary by tax credit type and taxpayer status, as outlined below:

Sections 45X, 45Y, 48E and 45Q

The specified foreign entity and foreign-influenced entity prohibitions apply to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., starting January 1, 2026, for calendar-year taxpayers).

Sections 45U and 45Z

The specified foreign entity prohibition applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., starting January 1, 2026, for calendar-year taxpayers).

The foreign-influenced entity prohibition applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027 (i.e., starting January 1, 2028, for calendar-year taxpayers).

What Are the Material Assistance Rules and to Which Clean Energy Tax Credits Do They Apply?

The material assistance rules are additional restrictions imposed under Sections 45X, 45Y and 48E that disqualify a project or component from tax credit eligibility if it receives “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.” The material assistance rules apply with respect to any project the construction of which begins in 2026 or later (for qualified facilities and energy storage technology) and any components sold in 2026 or later (for eligible components).

Material assistance is measured by the “material assistance cost ratio” (MACR), which is the percentage of total direct costs (for qualified facilities and energy storage technology) or direct cost of materials (for eligible components) that are not attributable to a prohibited foreign entity.

Sections 45Y and 48E (qualified facilities and energy storage technology):

The MACR is calculated at the project level, with required threshold percentages that increase over time (e.g., for 2026, 40 percent for qualified facilities and 55 percent for energy storage technology).

Section 45X (eligible components):

The MACR is calculated for each component sold in a given year, with thresholds varying by component type and year (e.g., for 2026, 50 percent for solar components, 85 percent for wind components, 60 percent for battery components and 50 percent for inverters).

If the MACR falls below the applicable threshold, the tax credit is denied for that project or component.

How Is Material Assistance Determined, and What Can Taxpayers Do to Comply?

Material assistance is determined by calculating the MACR:

MACR = ((T – P) / T) x 100%

T = Total direct cost of all manufactured products or components

P = Total direct cost of all manufactured products or components from a prohibited foreign entity

Taxpayers must maintain documentation and, until Treasury issues new safe harbor tables (by December 31, 2026), may rely on the tables in IRS Notice 2025-08 (relating to the domestic content requirements) and supplier certifications. Suppliers who provide false certifications may be subject to penalties.

Can Clean Energy Tax Credits Be Transferred to Specified Foreign Entities?

No. The OBBBA prohibits the transfer of any portion of the tax credits under Sections 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z or 48E to specified foreign entities under Section 6418.

What Should Taxpayers and Project Developers Do Now?

China is also Canada’s second‑largest customer for agriculture, forest products and seafood products, with sales of about $13.4 billion in 2024.","Canada’s newly announced strategic partnership with China, including a reduction of surtaxes on Chinese‑made electric vehicles (EVs), is drawing criticism from labour groups which warn the move could put thousands of Canadian manufacturing and auto jobs at risk.

According to the Office of the Prime Minister, the government is responding to “a more divided and uncertain world” by “building a stronger, more independent, and more resilient economy” and “working with urgency and determination to diversify our trade partnerships and catalyse massive new levels of investment.”

Energy, clean tech and EVs

A central feature of the agreement is expanded collaboration in energy, clean technology and climate competitiveness. Both countries are described as energy “superpowers” focused on “expanding two-way energy cooperation – reducing emissions and scaling up investments in batteries, solar, wind, and energy storage.”

To support this and build up the domestic manufacturing sector, Canada will allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) into the Canadian market at the most‑favoured‑nation tariff rate of 6.1%. This volume corresponds to import levels in 2023–2024 and represents less than 3 per cent of new vehicles sold in Canada.

The Office of the Prime Minister says the arrangement is expected, within three years, to drive “considerable new Chinese joint-venture investment in Canada with trusted partners” to protect and create new auto manufacturing careers and “ensure a robust build-out of Canada’s EV supply chain.” Within five years, more than 50 per cent of these vehicles are anticipated to be priced below $35,000, potentially accelerating EV adoption and demand for skills in production, battery technology, infrastructure and after‑sales service.

Workers ‘more vulnerable’: CLC

However, the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) said the deal “represents a sharp and concerning shift in Canada’s trade and industrial strategy,” and contends that “no sector truly wins, and workers in every industry are left more vulnerable.”

According to the the group, the agreement “drastically reduces Canada’s surtax on Chinese‑made electric vehicles (EVs), creating a pathway for tens of thousands of inexpensive, state‑subsidized vehicles to flood our auto market.” The organisation says this could undermine Canada’s domestic auto industry, jeopardize jobs, suppress future investment and “erode the independent supply chain that sustains thousands of Canadian workers.”

Meanwhile, Unifor issued its own statement, warning that opening the door to China‑owned EV imports “poses extreme risk to Canadian auto jobs and the future of our entire auto sector.”

“This is a self‑inflicted wound to an already injured Canadian auto industry,” said Unifor National President Lana Payne. “Providing a foothold to cheap Chinese EVs, backed by massive state subsidies, overproduction and designed to expand market share through exports, puts Canadian auto jobs at risk while rewarding labour violations and unfair trade practices.”

Unifor said it has “long warned about the risks of letting Chinese EVs flood the North American market,” arguing that if such imports are left unchecked they will cost Canadian jobs, stall domestic investment and increase imports from low‑cost jurisdictions. The union noted that there is “virtually no Canadian content in Chinese vehicles,” and warned that “our independent auto parts supply chain would also be hard hit.”

Previously, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said that by lowering tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, “this lopsided deal risks closing the door on Canadian automakers to the American market, our largest export destination, which would hurt our economy and lead to job losses,” according to the National Post.

According to two legal experts, as Canada pushes toward an ambitious 100-per-cent zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) sales mandate by 2035, a vital question is emerging - are we truly prepared for the labour market shock this transition may bring?

Auto leverage for farm and fish gains

The CLC similarly questioned the government’s willingness to exchange leverage on industrial and auto tariffs for short‑term agricultural gains. It said “the Government’s willingness to trade hard‑earned leverage on issues like auto tariffs and North American cooperation for temporary tariff reductions on canola and some seafood products is deeply troubling,” calling the relief for agriculture and fisheries “time‑limited, uncertain beyond this year, and insufficient compensation for exposing strategic industries to global competition fueled by massive state intervention.”

This target comes against a backdrop in which China is already Canada’s second‑largest single‑country trading partner, with two‑way merchandise trade totalling $118.9 billion in 2024. Canadian merchandise exports to China reached $30 billion, while imports were $88.9 billion. China is also Canada’s second‑largest customer for agriculture, forest products and seafood products, with sales of about $13.4 billion in 2024.",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/chrr/jimw_639044334202413092.png,N,,2026-01-19 16:59:01.654847

With a commitment of C$10 million, BMI has reaffirmed its dedication toward the development of the Espanola biocarbon project.
The Espanola project is expected to produce up to 50,000 metric tons of biocarbon per year, representing five times the production capacity of the partners' Thorold Renewable Energy Facility.
""BMI acquired the Espanola site to bring it back to life and return it to productive industrial use,"" said Paul Veldman, CEO of The BMI Group.
This progression is expected to be illustrative of how CHAR Tech and BMI intend to continue to move a growing pipeline of projects forward.","CHAR Technologies Ltd. on Jan. 14 announced that the Espanola project engineering and design study continues to advance with The BMI Group. With a commitment of C$10 million, BMI has reaffirmed its dedication toward the development of the Espanola biocarbon project.

The project will be located at Bioveld North, the former pulp and paper mill site in Espanola, Ontario, which BMI recently acquired with a focus on putting wood back to work in Northern Ontario.

The Espanola project is expected to produce up to 50,000 metric tons of biocarbon per year, representing five times the production capacity of the partners' Thorold Renewable Energy Facility.

The project's final scope and BMI's final capital allocation will be determined through completion of the engineering and design study.

The proposed facility would convert locally sourced wood waste and forestry residuals into low-carbon biocarbon and synthetic gas, with the potential to valorize the gas, including either direct use on site by the broader Bioveld North facility, or upgrading the synthetic gas to renewable natural gas (RNG) in a later phase.

The engineering and design study is expected to be completed in calendar Q1 of 2026, and will define the technical scope, assess and secure available feedstock supply, and confirm the integration requirements of CHAR Tech's high-temperature pyrolysis platform into the Espanola site's existing industrial infrastructure, including utilities, biomass handling, logistics, and production scaling.

Northern Ontario's substantial forestry residual supply, combined with the site's existing infrastructure, provides a clear pathway to rapid redevelopment at scale.

""The Espanola site, with significant access to biomass materials, wastes and residuals, gives us the opportunity to scale our technology well beyond what was possible at Thorold,"" said Andrew White, CEO of CHAR Tech. ""This study is about defining the details needed to move from development into construction on a larger, more integrated facility located within one of Canada's most significant forestry regions.""

""BMI acquired the Espanola site to bring it back to life and return it to productive industrial use,"" said Paul Veldman, CEO of The BMI Group. ""Partnering with CHAR Tech allows us to move quickly into detailed planning and construction. This project is a cornerstone of our vision to put wood back to work through innovation, full-fiber utilization, and clean-energy production. Espanola is a long-term asset with the potential to create durable jobs, strengthen forestry supply chains, and anchor a new generation of low-carbon industry in the North.""

The project reflects BMI's strategy of pairing proven clean technologies with irreplaceable legacy industrial infrastructure to enable scalable, full-fiber utilization. This progression is expected to be illustrative of how CHAR Tech and BMI intend to continue to move a growing pipeline of projects forward.

The Espanola redevelopment is intended to re-establish the site as a major industrial employer and clean energy anchor in Northern Ontario, demonstrating how existing industrial assets can be repurposed to support sustainable forestry, create high-value jobs, and put wood back to work for the next century of Northern growth.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Char_Tech_Jan26_7d00bbec60.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 11:59:47.542100

Investment in clean technologies has overtaken investment in fossil fuels and clean energy is reshaping demand fundamentals.
Electric vehicles are displacing millions of barrels of oil demand per day - with that figure set to multiply by 2030.
Given that road transport accounts for around half of global oil demand, electrifying this segment has significant impacts in the long-term role and value of oil.
Within this evolving context, several trends for 2026 are plausible: Oil demand plateau becomes mainstream: financial markets will increasingly treat oil demand growth as limited or declining, not simply cyclical.","In the past weeks, markets have delivered a clear signal: even as geopolitical tensions have flared, global oil prices have remained anchored near the low-$60s per barrel. Brief price increases over Iran have reflected geopolitical risk, but they faded quickly.

That muted reaction speaks not to the irrelevance of geopolitics but to a deeper shift in the global energy landscape that will define 2026: the transition from fossil-fuel dominance toward clean electrification and resilient energy systems.

To many market observers this might look counterintuitive. Historically, supply disruptions - whether from conflict, sanctions, or domestic instability - immediately tightened global oil markets. But today, diversified supplies and weakening demand growth are dampening price sensitivity. The disruption isn’t gone, it’s just less determinative than it used to be.

Venezuela, for the record, is a red herring in this specific debate. Despite renewed attention on its oil sector – crude quality, production constraints, infrastructure decay and sanctions mean Venezuelan oil is not a market-shifting supply source. And by the time meaningful volumes could return, the market itself will have changed. Demand growth for heavy, high-sulphur crude is structurally weaker in a world moving toward electrification.

Investment in clean technologies has overtaken investment in fossil fuels and clean energy is reshaping demand fundamentals.

Clean electrification makes economies more competitive because it delivers cheaper, more stable, more efficient, cleaner and more innovative energy systems while reducing geopolitical risk. According to recent analysis, clean energy - defined broadly to include renewables, electrification technologies, efficiency measures and storage - have the potential to replace three-quarters of existing fossil fuel demand globally.

This reflects rapid deployment and sharply falling costs for renewables and electrification, especially in transport and power. Electric vehicles are displacing millions of barrels of oil demand per day - with that figure set to multiply by 2030. China sold 11 million EVs in 2024, which led to the displacement of 0.43 million barrels per day of gasoline in 2024 (this is 12% of Chinese annual gasoline consumption) and this displacement could quadruple by 2040.

It also aligns with the latest IEA World Energy Outlook cycle, which shows that oil demand peaks at around 102 million barrels per day around 2030 before entering gradual decline under current policy trajectories as well as more ambitious scenarios.

Strategic models increasingly project that electricity - mostly clean - will become the dominant energy carrier in the decades ahead.

Given that road transport accounts for around half of global oil demand, electrifying this segment has significant impacts in the long-term role and value of oil.

This structural shift has profound implications for energy security. For decades, energy policy was synonymous with oil geopolitics. Today, it’s increasingly about electricity resilience, grid flexibility, supply chain robustness and critical minerals security. Governments and businesses alike are wrestling with how to tap domestic clean resources, secure supply chains for clean energy supply technologies, batteries and grid equipment, and manage system risks caused not by single events but by cascading and compound shocks - extreme weather, cyber threats and infrastructure stress.

These trends also shape the politics of climate engagement. At COP30 in Brazil last year, leaders acknowledged the urgency of accelerating clean energy deployment, even in the absence of a globally binding fossil fuel phase-out timeline. Consensus is growing on the need to manage transition pathways, especially given the economic impact in some countries.

Looking ahead, 2026 offers a packed calendar of political and business momentum that could cement this transition:

International Conference on the Just Transition Away from Fossil Fuels hosted by Colombia and Netherlands: This gathering aims to accelerate just and practical pathways for emissions reduction and cleaner energy deployment. If outcomes align with evidence on electrification and demand peaking, it could bridge policy gaps between ambition and implementation.

COP31 (Turkey/Australia): As host and partner, these governments have signalled an intent to advance implementation agendas that prioritize energy systems transformation - grids, electrification and industrial decarbonization - rather than headline emission targets alone. The focus is shifting toward real-world policies that enable transformation at scale.

Other global dialogues are increasingly shaping the direction of economic and energy policy - including the G7, G20, BRICS, APEC and related forums. Taken together, these platforms reflect a shifting centre of gravity in global decision-making, with growing influence from the Global South on questions of development, energy security, industrial strategy and transition pathways.

Within this evolving context, several trends for 2026 are plausible:

Oil demand plateau becomes mainstream: financial markets will increasingly treat oil demand growth as limited or declining, not simply cyclical. This will tighten capital for high-cost fossil projects and elevate electricity and storage sectors as primary investment destinations.

Electrification as a driver of competitiveness drives policy action: governments will shift rhetoric and policy incentives toward end-use electrification - buildings, industry, transport - recognizing that electricity offers greater energy security and long-term economic competitiveness.

Energy security debates further reframe: security discussions will continue to centre less on crude supply routes and more on grid resilience, semiconductor and battery supply chains, and critical mineral partnerships, with discussions potentially broadening into the security implications of winding down of fossil fuels.

These shifts don’t negate the risks ahead. Gas retains a longer runway in parts of the system, coal demand remains in some regions, and fossil infrastructure persists. But the signal in prices combined with the momentum in clean deployment reveals a deeper reality: energy transitions are no longer aspirational - they are structural and investment-driven.

For business leaders and policymakers alike, the imperative in 2026 will be clear: align strategy with the realities of clean electrified economies - not because of ideology, but because economics, resilience and security demand it.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/696df644b3a2acf77a23b275/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2026-01-19 11:59:52.203219

Successful state leaders know that energy policy is economic policy, and clean energy must be central to addressing economic challenges and opportunities, even as federal progress stalls.

Take Virginia, where Governor Abigail Spanberger was sworn in last Saturday. She won in a landslide victory with a commitment to lower energy costs, modernize the electricity grid and expand clean energy and transportation programs. These are investments that can strengthen reliability and affordability for households and businesses alike.

As Virginia’s General Assembly convenes this month, here are three strategies that lawmakers can pursue to turn her commitments into action:

Build more clean energy, fast

Demand for electricity is surging, driven by electrification, manufacturing and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Solar and wind have quickly become the cheapest and easiest energy sources to deploy. Without action to remove barriers to clean energy deployment, energy costs will continue to rise.

Virginia policymakers should reinforce the state’s clean energy goals through the Virginia Clean Economy Act, streamline permitting processes to quickly get affordable energy projects online, and invest in battery storage to keep power flowing when and where it’s needed.

Other states are also moving in this direction. Massachusetts is weighing legislation to boost distributed energy resources, while Michigan is making it easier to build transmission along existing infrastructure such as highways or pipelines.

Get more out of the system we have

America’s aging grid is a bottleneck, requiring massive investment. Grid-enhancing technologies can unlock hidden capacity and improve resilience against extreme weather. While they don’t eliminate the long-term need for new transmission lines, policymakers should prioritize these types of high-value, no-regrets investments that save costs in the long run.

Virginia could build upon its existing virtual power plant program, linking solar panels, batteries and smart thermostats to boost capacity and reliability while keeping costs down. Virginia leads in these types of forward-thinking initiatives with fellow states across the South, including North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia.

Remove barriers to clean transportation

Businesses and consumers recognize the benefits of electric vehicles, most notably lower fuel and maintenance costs. Yet limited access to charging infrastructure remains a major barrier, especially in rural areas. Virginia can lead by expanding charging access, giving businesses and consumers the freedom to choose cost-saving, low-maintenance vehicles that meet their needs.

The benefits will ripple outward, delivering cleaner air, reducing health care costs, and creating thousands of new jobs.

In 2024, the clean vehicle sector supported 400,000 jobs nationwide, including 8,000 in Virginia. With federal support waning, states must keep driving this economic engine forward. Many states are doing just that already with the Affordable Clean Cars Coalition, a group of 13 states committed to making electric vehicles more affordable and practical to drive.

The path forward for states in 2026 is clear: treating affordability as an energy challenge – and acting accordingly – is the best way to deliver lower bills, strengthen local economies and secure energy system for all.

By mid 2027, AM Green expects to begin producing 0.5 mtpa of green ammonia ahead of reaching full production.

At full capacity, the project will comprise 1.95GW of alkaline electrolysers, 7.5GW of renewables, and 2GW of pumped storage. It has lined up John Cockerill electrolysers, and “round-the-clock” renewable energy power purchase agreements.

Chief Minister of the state of Andhra Pradesh, Nara Chandrababu Naidu, said the first equipment installations at the site moved the state closer to becoming a “net exporter of green energy.”

AM Green has inked a firm to supply 500,000 tonnes of Kakinada-made green ammonia to German energy firm Uniper, with first deliveries expected by 2028. The firm is also exploring shipping the green molecules to chemicals major BASF, as well as power firm RWE.

These deals could be the first examples of large-scale green hydrogen trade between Europe and India.

AM Green said the project was creating “real economic impact” by reviving legacy industrial infrastructure, creating jobs, and building a new “clean energy ecosystem in the region.”

India has increasingly been positioning itself as a major green hydrogen supplier for regions like Europe, by leaning on its strong renewables potential.","https://www.h2-view.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.h2-view.com/wp-content/files/1768709742251-e1768813868462.jpeg",N,,2026-01-19 13:58:58.817950

The partners said the on-campus facility will be used to co-develop and demonstrate intelligent and agentic AI manufacturing technologies, run joint workshops focused on AI, cybersecurity, and digital twins, and deploy hands-on demonstration “pods” inside the IntelliMake lab.

The collaboration is positioned as a response to widening readiness gaps as AI adoption accelerates. Citing Kyndryl’s 2025 Readiness Report, the company said most leaders expect AI to reshape jobs within a year, but far fewer believe their workforce is prepared—an imbalance the initiative intends to address through practical training and real-world demonstrations. Wayne State and Kyndryl plan to use the lab environment to train teams in agentic AI for manufacturing and to replicate customer challenges on a mock assembly line, with the goal of advancing from theoretical prototypes to deployable solutions.

In its initial phase, IntelliMake will pair advanced computing with modular orchestration to show how intelligent agents can identify disruptions, adapt to changes, and recover operations. The autonomous manufacturing and assembly line is intended to reduce scrap and rework, improve quality outcomes, and provide workers with more responsive tools and real-time operational insights. Kyndryl said it will support system orchestration by integrating technologies, including Kyndryl Bridge, to monitor and manage the end-to-end infrastructure powering the lab’s simulated production environment.

The partners framed the hub as part of a broader ambition to position Detroit and Michigan as leaders in smart manufacturing, citing a projected $10 trillion opportunity driven by AI agents, robotics, and digital twins that enable factories to self-optimize and reconfigure dynamically. Wayne State said the initiative leverages its location in a major manufacturing region and its industry relationships to address manufacturing modernization and workforce development challenges, while aligning university research with scalable industrial applications.

With the advent of AI and its power needs, DeWitte said the U.S. energy system as it stands has ""absolutely"" not been able to keep up.
OKLO, he said, was founded on the idea that nuclear fission can deliver massive amounts of reliable, affordable energy, noting nuclear power has some of the lowest fuel costs per megawatt-hour of any source.
When asked whether U.S. energy woes are a regulatory or market failure, DeWitte said the issue is in red tape versus demand.
""Then you're just having those countries build power plants to power it.","NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!

The U.S. is running headlong into a power crunch driven by the explosive growth of artificial intelligence — and the nation’s energy grid is not ready for it, an executive behind a major new nuclear partnership warned recently.

Jacob DeWitte is CEO of OKLO, a California-based advanced nuclear company focused on helping large energy users add grid power through private investment rather than traditional utilities. He joined Meta executive Joel Kaplan and Energy Secretary Chris Wright for an announcement in Washington.

The Meta partnership will go a long way to add much-needed power to a key regional component of the national grid, DeWitte said, citing OKLO’s plans to develop a 1.2 GW installation in Pike County, Ohio, near the Hocking Hills.

""I think one of the really exciting things about today is announcing the fact we're going to be building a lot more power generation capabilities,"" he said, quipping that southeastern Ohio used to be an ""industrial cathedral"" and now can see new commercial rebirth for the digital and AI age.

WE'RE ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE AISLE. BUT WE KNOW AMERICA MUST WIN THE AI RACE, OR ELSE

""Smaller [nuclear] plants can be built more quickly and come online faster – then you shorten the learning curve. You reduce the cost both in time and money of iteration cycles to drive technological progress and bring these technologies that have huge promise forward in terms of cost reduction… energy dominance and energy reliability and energy abundance,"" he said.

Wright and President Donald Trump have helped companies like OKLO and Meta unleash this new energy potential, to not only increase power capacity and amend structural issues but also greatly reduce the regulatory burdens private companies tend to face from Washington, DeWitte added.

With the advent of AI and its power needs, DeWitte said the U.S. energy system as it stands has ""absolutely"" not been able to keep up.

MORNING GLORY: A PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP-BRANDED ENERGY DRINK?

DeWitte warned that the U.S. needs to build out the power grid and invest in new installations like the Pike site:

""We are going to run out of power capacity in this country in the next several years, especially in critical industrial markets like sort of the Midwest and Northeast. The PJM interconnection [which supports the Mid-Atlantic region] is going to be undersupplied with power generation in just a matter of a few years.""

""The steps taken today are going to help alleviate that, but there's going be a lot more that's needed.""

TRUMP SAYS EVERY AI PLANT BEING BUILT IN US WILL BE SELF-SUSTAINING WITH THEIR OWN ELECTRICITY

DeWitte also addressed what he described as a common misconception surrounding the rise of data centers, which have sparked NIMBY backlash in parts of the country.

""I think sometimes people conflate [that] building these data centers [will] drive prices up – that's a scarcity mindset. We're in a world of an abundance mindset, right?"" he said.

TRUMP ADMIN'S ENERGY AGENDA HAILED FOR CRUCIAL 'WINS' AS GREEN ACTIVISTS LASH OUT

He said Meta is committing to a total of 6.6GW of new power, calling it a ""huge amount of capacity"" to fuel the needs of decades to come, and that nuclear is a very reliable energy source.

DeWitte said one of the biggest structural choke points in bringing new energy online, and why the nation is running out of power, leading to price inflation, is the regulatory environment that has stymied growth for many years.

That dynamic, he said, has been ""fundamentally anti-energy.""

BURGUM CALLS CALIFORNIA A ‘NATIONAL SECURITY RISK’ AS ENERGY CHIEF WARNS BLUE STATES ARE SKEWING COST AVERAGES

But, DeWitte said, that dynamic is changing: ""The unfortunate thing is we have to undo decades of... damage [from] not doing things to then overcome that inertia.""

""Look at the states that have the worst energy… They're largely states that have had the heaviest-handed anti-energy policies, and they're the ones that are now facing some of the biggest challenges on that point, and they are also responding, which is encouraging.""

OKLO, he said, was founded on the idea that nuclear fission can deliver massive amounts of reliable, affordable energy, noting nuclear power has some of the lowest fuel costs per megawatt-hour of any source.

""Our view of that, though, is changing a couple of things, including the business model, [and the] deployment model, including how we think about size and technology. We see opportunities to go invest in and build significant generating capacity in areas that need it and have significant development opportunities around it,"" he said, noting that brings the conversation full circle regarding its investment in the Ohio site.

When asked whether U.S. energy woes are a regulatory or market failure, DeWitte said the issue is in red tape versus demand.

The environmental commodity markets have played the role of scaffolding by providing the framework and support on which the energy transition can be built.
The levers of transition Emissions Trading Systems (ETS) that put a price on emissions were first launched in 2005.
But these levers only move at scale when markets make them investable; for example, when carbon emissions have been properly priced.
These regulations and increased renewable energy also translate into growing demand for certificates, and that demand makes the transition investable.","Despite strong global momentum to accelerate decarbonisation, fossil fuels still have a strong hold of the energy use across most sectors. The IEA reports that industrial energy consumption is still dominated by fossil fuels, in particular coal; and transportation relies on oil products for nearly 91 percent of its energy. As of the first half of 2025 however, the global energy supply shows a more positive picture as renewable energy overtook coal as the leading source of energy for the first time in history. But that was no miracle; that is market logic in action. The environmental commodity markets have played the role of scaffolding by providing the framework and support on which the energy transition can be built.

To explain the concept of environmental commodity with a simple analogy: If a homeowner wants to lower his or her carbon footprint, they might install some solar panels. But presuming they live in a block of flats, they might ask a friend to put solar panels on their roof instead. The flat owner helps the friend to finance that and in return can claim that they have neutralised the carbon output of their flat. What those homeowners are doing is creating a marketplace for decarbonisation opportunities, which is exactly what is happening at a macro-level between energy producers, corporates and major industry. It allows people who want to make moves to decarbonise, but who might be constrained. It allows them to invest in the move to decarbonise elsewhere. Similarly, it also enables people who have the opportunity, but not the finance, to get their projects off the ground.

The levers of transition

Emissions Trading Systems (ETS) that put a price on emissions were first launched in 2005. In addition, renewable energy certificates (GOs, IRECs, RECs) that link clean energy generation with consumer demand and fuel mandates (LCFS, REDIII) that reward low-carbon alternatives have gained their importance as tools to put a price on emissions and address environmental impact. These markets exist not to virtue-signal but to account for the cost of emissions and make decarbonisation bankable. Just as in other markets, traders, like us at STX Group, come in to facilitate pricing structures and climate solutions that simplify sales and manage risk for both the buyer and the producer. This market mechanism brings more investment to the market and is therefore an essential part of the commodities markets.

Carbon is finally being priced appropriately — and investment is following

The energy transition is ultimately executed through three levers: efficiency, switching towards renewable fuels and feedstocks, and carbon capture. But these levers only move at scale when markets make them investable; for example, when carbon emissions have been properly priced. The good news is, carbon is being appropriately priced and, as a result, environmental commodity markets have been growing rapidly over the last 20 years. New regulations are also taking effect, especially in Europe, across multiple industries. In shipping, FuelEU Maritime is reshaping fuel demand. In aviation, ReFuelEU mandates are driving uptake of sustainable fuels. RED III is pushing EU member states to increase renewables in power and heat. CBAM is levelling the playing field between domestic and foreign producers in the EU. All these regulations put more pressure on European refineries to ramp up their production of clean energy products. These regulations and increased renewable energy also translate into growing demand for certificates, and that demand makes the transition investable. The future growth of the ‘sustainable economy’ is driven largely by the widening net of regulatory compliance but also has become a lifeline for energy companies operating on markets rapidly shifting towards renewables.

While the pace of change to decarbonise the global economy is arguably still slow, we cannot ignore the emissions that have been capped and addressed because of market schemes like the ETS and a large variety of environmental commodities. To give a sense of the scale, the global EAC market has grown to over 2,400 TWh annually since its formalisation in the early 2000s, representing a size equal to more than 60 percent of the total electricity demand of the European Union. It now covers approximately 40 percent of the EU’s total GHG emissions and generates €38bn in revenues in 2024.

By my latest count, more than 70 countries now operate carbon pricing systems. Clean fuel mandates and schemes are spreading across North America and Asia. In Europe, numerous clean energy policies and regulations are making carbon a balance-sheet cost for major heavy industries including aviation, shipping and manufacturing. There are plenty more schemes similar to the existing regulation that we expect to see make a big impact in the coming years, such as sustainable aviation fuel certificates (SAFc), white certificates to drive energy efficiency and biofuel mandates. One thing is clear: emissions now carry a price, and that price is rising.

I strongly believe that market mechanisms are the most efficient way to align political ambition, corporate obligation and consumer demand to decarbonise, at an affordable cost. Without them, the transition risks becoming slower, costlier and more divisive.",https://www.worldfinance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/marketdriver-600x450.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 13:59:04.838463

The plan subsequently aims to expedite the construction of new power plants, especially natural gas-powered ones, to supply power directly to the data center sector.
This has led to more novel natural gas solutions emerging from the woodwork, such as Boom Supersonic and ProEnergy’s plans to repurpose airline jet engines to power data centers behind the meter.
Overall, residential bills across the 13 states within the network are expected to grow significantly next year, with data centers the main culprit.
""This is not a yes/no to data centers,"" PJM board chair and interim president and CEO David Mills said in a statement.","The emergency auction would be unprecedented, but it isn't surprising given the skyrocketing capacity-addition projections across the region. In its latest annual capacity auction, which closed in July, wholesale electric capacity grew 22 percent compared to last year. The Trump administration, alongside the governors, argued that the issues are compounded by the fact that large amounts of firm capacity are slated for retirement by 2030, which it argues would put increased pressure on the grid to meet the growing demand.

Therefore, to accommodate this growth, utilities across the PJM grid have announced massive increases in generation. However, due to the oft-arduous approval process and construction lag times, there has been a growing call for a more streamlined service for the data center market. The plan subsequently aims to expedite the construction of new power plants, especially natural gas-powered ones, to supply power directly to the data center sector. At the start of last year, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) found that utilities across Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia plan to build more than 20GW of natural gas power plants by 2040 to meet energy demand from the data center sector.

""Under President Trump's leadership, the administration is leading an unprecedented bipartisan effort urging PJM to fix the energy subtraction failures of the past, prevent price increases, and reduce the risk of blackouts,"" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said.

However, concerns remain over the gas turbine supply chain, with its heavily constrained nature and a stuffed order book likely a bottleneck in the drive to bring more generation online. This has led to more novel natural gas solutions emerging from the woodwork, such as Boom Supersonic and ProEnergy’s plans to repurpose airline jet engines to power data centers behind the meter.

In addition, with the repeal of many tax credits for new renewable projects, there will be increased pressure on the natural gas supply chain to meet demand.

While the plan may lead to some more generation coming online faster than expected, it is still beholden to global supply chains and may not have an immediate impact. As a result, Advanced Energy United, which represents energy companies and corporate buyers across clean-energy sectors, said the approach doesn't address core challenges such as making PJM's grid-connection process more efficient.

The clearer aim of the initiative, it seems, especially in the short term, is to assuage growing political angst over who is responsible for the costs of the new generation needed for the growth of AI.

We have already seen large bill increases in data center hubs such as Columbus, Ohio. In the city, the average residential bill is set to increase by $27 a month. Overall, residential bills across the 13 states within the network are expected to grow significantly next year, with data centers the main culprit.

In response to cost increases, legislators across several of the 13 states have seen new ratepayer rules approved by their political and regulatory bodies, which have set guidelines for who is responsible for the costs of constructing new generation and transmission infrastructure. Ohio was one of the first to enforce new rules, with new data center customers on the hook for a minimum of 85 percent of the energy they say they need each month, even if they use less. A few months after the approval, AEP Ohio, the state's largest utility, announced that it had seen its pipeline of large load capacity additions shrink as a result. The state utility said in a statement that it was the direct result of the new rules, which had culled many speculative and zombie projects.

The new auction resembles some of the aspects of the new ratepayer class approved in places like Ohio, and proposed in Virginia and Pennsylvania. Subsequently, it could be the first step towards a universal requirement that data center developers play an integral role in financing the new capacity additions needed to power the planned facilities. President Trump has not been afraid to dictate the pace of investment within the tech market, and with so many within the sector avowed allies of the President, this could make them more amenable to breaking out their checkbooks to pay for the new generation.

As of yet, it is unclear whether the new generation capacity would feed data centers via a private wire or through the grid, but it is increasingly clear that something needs to be done about the spiraling costs across the region.

An interesting wrinkle of the announcement was the fact that the RTO itself was not invited to participate, which raises serious questions about the support of the plan. However, with bipartisan backing, it seems likely that PJM will have to oblige and hold the auction as planned to avoid the wrath of an increasingly assertive President.

Following the announcement, PJM released a statement outlining a set of board-approved actions aimed at accommodating data centers and other large new electricity users.

The measures include the immediate launch of efforts to secure additional power supplies. PJM also said it will enhance load forecasting, expand the role of states, and explore options that would allow large customers to supply their own generation or participate in a connect-and-manage approach. Additional steps include establishing a fast-track interconnection process for state-backed generation projects and beginning a backstop procurement to address near-term reliability risks.

""This is not a yes/no to data centers,"" PJM board chair and interim president and CEO David Mills said in a statement. ""This is, 'How can we do this while keeping the lights on and recognizing the impact on consumers at the same time?'""

While the plan’s ability to materially lower prices or accelerate near-term capacity additions remains uncertain, it has already prompted a more proactive response from grid operators, utilities, regulators, and data center developers grappling with the pace and cost of AI-driven load growth.

The reaction to the news has been mixed. Amazon responded to the news with a positive spin. In a statement, the company said: “We share the goal of ensuring affordable, reliable energy for American families and our economy, and we applaud the bipartisanship emerging to tackle America's outdated grid challenges. Amazon is paying our full energy costs and is committed to ensuring our data centers don’t increase consumers’ electricity bills, and we've been clear that every major energy user should do the same.”

In contrast, environmental groups, such as Earth Justice, argued that the move could have drastic impacts on carbon emission levels. “If the Department of Energy were serious about affordability, it would be greenlighting clean energy, not taking extraordinary, unlawful measures to stop the quickest and cheapest solution we have. The auction proposed today might help protect consumers - but only if it’s designed and implemented right. If the auction is badly designed, it could lock in dirty, expensive infrastructure and harm already overburdened communities–even where states, citizens, and tech companies all want clean energy,” said Nick Lawton, Earthjustice attorney.",https://media.datacenterdynamics.com/media/images/IMG_0064_1_1.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 11:05:47.448190

Geopolitical twists and turns are straining long-established relationships and upending deeply held assumptions. The World Uncertainty Index, devised by economists from the IMF and Stanford University, has hit unprecedented levels in recent months.

But in this time of flux, there are still some important trends that we can identify with some confidence. Here are seven that can help us keep our bearings:

Oil and gas will still be widely used for many years to come, but the use of electricity is growing twice as a fast as overall energy demand. It’s the key energy input to the most dynamic parts of the global economy – such as AI, data centres and high-tech manufacturing – and is increasing its share of major sectors like road transport and heating through technologies such as EVs and heat pumps. Already today, more than half of the investment going into the global energy sector each year is going to electricity.

Despite some headwinds, in many countries around the world, renewables are meeting much if not all of the rising demand for electricity, often because they are the most competitive option. Solar is leading the way, as the countries that are increasingly driving energy demand, such as India, have a very high-quality solar resource, but other technologies are in play, too, including new ones coming through such as next-generation geothermal energy.

After a series of setbacks in the 2010s, nuclear is on the rise again, generating more electricity than ever before last year. Today, more than 70 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity is under construction, one of the highest levels in the past 30 years. Soaring electricity demand from data centres means tech companies are also turning to nuclear, attracted by its promise of low-emissions, round-the-clock power supply.

Traditional hazards affecting the security of oil and gas supplies are now accompanied by vulnerabilities in other areas, including electricity security, as highlighted by the recent major blackouts in Chile and Spain, and critical minerals. A single country, China, is the dominant refiner for 19 out of 20 energy-related strategic minerals, with an average market share of around 70%. More than half of these strategic minerals are subject to some form of export controls. Rising energy security risks from climate change are now also a certainty, intensifying the need to make energy systems more resilient to extreme weather events, as well as to cyberattacks and other malicious activity targeting critical infrastructure.

As energy is elevated to a matter of economic and national security, so governments are increasingly intervening to shape outcomes, rather than leaving them to the market. This is visible in energy technology supply chains, especially for critical minerals, as countries seek to counter the risks associated with China’s high market share. Trade in oil and gas is also increasingly subject to political considerations and government-to-government negotiation – or to sanctions.

Oil prices have already come under pressure because of relatively abundant supply, and the same will soon be true in natural gas markets, as the wave of new LNG export projects start operations. There is also ample manufacturing capacity for batteries, solar panels and other technologies. These trends can benefit fuel and technology importers, but they should not get too comfortable: this period of plenty and potentially lower prices could lead to reduced investments in energy, with implications for subsequent years.

The centre of gravity in the world’s energy markets is shifting as a group of emerging economies, led by India and Southeast Asia and joined by countries in the Middle East, Latin America and Africa increasingly shape energy market dynamics. They are taking up the baton from China, which accounted for more than half of global demand growth for oil, gas and electricity since 2010. That said, no other country on its own will come close to replicating China’s extraordinary energy trajectory of recent decades.

Amid today’s turmoil, focusing only on uncertainties can lead to indecision and paralysis. A wait-and-see approach on energy by governments, companies and investors risks storing up trouble for the future, given the world’s thirst for energy and the continuous need for investment. There are still some certainties that decision-makers can rely on: let’s not lose sight of them as we plan for the future.",https://iea.org/assets/front/images/iea_open_graph.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 12:00:09.290671

HaloCell Energy has established itself as a leader in Australian perovskite development, launching Australian-made perovskite modules optimised for low-light conditions and partnering with the University of Queensland to advance record-breaking tandem heterojunction perovskite solar cells.

The company’s printed modules target applications where traditional silicon panels face limitations, including aerial systems, space-based installations and indoor sensor networks.

Paul Moonie, CEO of HaloCell Energy, highlighted the partnership’s commercial significance.

“At HaloCell, we’re creating the next generation of solar solutions – lightweight, printable and tuned for real-world conditions,” Moonie said.

“To gain scale, we need access to fit-for-purpose materials at the right cost. That’s why this partnership with Lava Blue is so important.”

The agreement encompasses the development and supply of scalable perovskite precursors, the evaluation of potential offtake arrangements and joint project opportunities and engagement across the broader perovskite value chain, both domestically and internationally.

This collaboration builds on Lava Blue’s Australian Research Council-funded research into refining high-purity materials from mine waste for clean technology applications.

Lava Blue operates the Centre for Predictive Research into Specialty Materials in Brisbane, featuring demonstration-scale processing capabilities for producing 4N and 5N high-purity alumina.

The company’s technology platform addresses growing demand for speciality materials, with global high-purity alumina requirements forecast to exceed 240,000 tonnes annually by 2030, while 75% of the current supply remains concentrated in China.

Perovskite solar cells offer advantages including high efficiency, potential for low-cost manufacturing, and strong performance in low-light conditions, making them suitable for specialised applications where conventional silicon photovoltaics face constraints.

However, commercial deployment has been limited by material costs and supply chain challenges that this partnership aims to address.

The memorandum of understanding establishes a foundation for deeper collaboration as perovskite markets evolve, with both companies committed to intellectual property protection and science-based development approaches.

McCann noted the partnership’s broader significance for Australian industrial positioning: “This partnership is a signal. It shows that Australia can be more than a raw materials exporter – we can be a source of specialised, value-added inputs essential to the energy systems of the future.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/685b2d8c55474a37bb8500cf_c284c611.png,N,,2026-01-19 11:02:51.080567

Moreover, during daytime hours, solar PV has matched the rise in US electricity demand, while the technology also met some of the electricity demand growth during the evening hours, helped by energy storage.
According to Ember, the rise of batteries in the US is changing solar PV from cheap daytime electricity to dispatchable all-day electricity.
Dave Jones, chief analyst at Ember, said: “Solar growth was essential in helping to meet fast-rising electricity demand in 2025.","The growth of solar generation was the highest in regions where electricity demand grew the most, such as Texas, the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic. Solar growth met 81%, 81% and 33% of electricity demand growth, respectively, in these three regions.

Other states or regions also saw a growth in solar PV, such as is the case of Florida, where solar growth exceeded demand growth “by a large margin” and contributed to a fall in fossil fuel generation. This is in contrast with the rest of the US, where the majority of new solar generation met increased electricity demand rather than displacing existing generation.

However, the continued growth of solar PV in the US remains limited to a few states, with 37 states having less than 10% of their electricity from solar PV in the last 12 months.

California remains the leading state in terms of the highest solar share with 37%, followed by Nevada with 34%. Both states, along with Arkansas, Arizona, Maine and New Mexico, have seen their solar share rise by more than five percentage points in the 24 months to October 2025. New Mexico has had the fastest increase, rising ten percentage points from 7% to 17% during that period.

Moreover, during daytime hours, solar PV has matched the rise in US electricity demand, while the technology also met some of the electricity demand growth during the evening hours, helped by energy storage.

According to Ember, the rise of batteries in the US is changing solar PV from cheap daytime electricity to dispatchable all-day electricity. A clear example of this is California, where in the last six years, the state’s utility-scale solar PV and battery generation grew by 58%, despite electricity generation only rising by 8% during the sunniest hour of the day.

Dave Jones, chief analyst at Ember, said: “Solar growth was essential in helping to meet fast-rising electricity demand in 2025. It generated where it was needed and – with the surge in batteries – increasingly when it was needed. Solar has the potential to meet all the rise in electricity demand and much more. With electricity demand surging, the case to build solar has never been stronger.”

Furthermore, utility-scale solar PV remains the fastest-growing source of electricity generation in the US, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). It forecasts up to 70GW of new solar additions between 2026 and 2027, which represents a 49% increase in US solar operational capacity compared with the end of 2025.

Most of that utility-scale capacity addition in the coming two years will come online in Texas. Battery storage will also see a fast increase in operational capacity in the coming years with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market rising from 15GW in 2025 to 37GW by the end of 2027.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Andreas-Gucklhorn.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 09:59:43.555918

""I believe our residents will appreciate having this option at their fingertips.""

A Public‑Benefit Model with Local Control

PACE financing in California is facilitated through the California Statewide Communities Development Agency (CSCDA) , a joint‑powers public benefit entity that enables member governments to opt in voluntarily to their Open PACE Program.

A Program Built on Strong Consumer Protections

Once the subject of debate, PACE in California has operated under the strict regulatory oversight of the California Department of Financial Protection & Innovation (DFPI), the state's consumer watchdog agency, for the past six years. Today, PACE is widely recognized as offering some of the strongest consumer protections in the home‑improvement financing industry nationwide.

Major Environmental and Economic Impact

Since launching in California ten years ago (under its previous name, PACE Funding Group), Home Run Financing has delivered more than $641 million in PACE financing for almost 20,700 home‑improvement projects statewide.

These upgrades have generated significant environmental benefits, including:

261,300 metric tons of lifetime greenhouse gas reductions, equivalent to removing 60,950 cars from the road for a year or powering more than 35,000 homes for a year.

301 million gallons of water saved, enough to fill more than 14,600 backyard pools or avoid 11.9 million five‑minute showers.

HRF PACE‑financed projects have also created more than 5,000 good‑paying jobs across California, supporting a network of more than 2,000 contractors who rely on PACE to help homeowners access essential upgrades.

""PACE has proven itself again and again as one of California's most effective tools for empowering homeowners, strengthening communities, and accelerating our transition to a cleaner, safer future,"" said Bob Giles, CEO of Home Run Financing. ""The renewed demand we're seeing from cities and counties across the state shows just how essential this program has become. PACE is strong in California, and it's only getting stronger.""

PACE: A Proven Tool for California's Future

With climate change accelerating and the need for resilient infrastructure growing, PACE remains one of the most flexible and impactful financing tools available to California homeowners and local governments.

""PACE is working exactly as intended,"" Giles added. ""It's helping families afford improvements that make their homes safer, greener, and more efficient. It's supporting local jobs. And it's giving communities the power to choose the solutions that fit their needs. That's why PACE continues to thrive in California.""

MASON COUNTY, W.Va. – Governor Patrick Morrisey today announced that Frontieras North America has closed on 183 acres in Mason County, where the company will build a flagship $850 million advanced coal reformation facility that is expected to create more than 2,000 construction jobs and over 200 full-time positions once operational.

“We are excited to welcome Frontieras North America and its state-of-the-art project to Mason County. This investment demonstrates that West Virginia’s workforce and business climate can attract world-class companies and investments,” said Governor Morrisey. “Frontieras is completely aligned with our 50 by 50 energy plan and our red tape-cutting strategy. This terrific announcement for West Virginia will create so many high-paying jobs and economic growth.”

The Mason County facility will be the first commercial-scale deployment of Frontieras’ patented FASForm™ process, which converts coal into fuels, fertilizers, and industrial carbon products with zero waste. The site offers more than a mile of Ohio River frontage for barge transport, Class I rail access via CSX, and close proximity to Appalachian coal reserves and a skilled regional workforce.

“West Virginia gave us every reason to build here—natural resources, world-class logistics, and a government that understands the importance of industrial growth,” said Matthew McKean, CEO and Co-Founder of Frontieras North America.

When that happens, Hood River, and subsequently the Columbia River, get less cold mountain runoff that might otherwise cool their waters.","Oregon Public Broadcasting first published this article.

The Dalles is trying to expand its water reservoir — and it’s turning to Congress in a quest to acquire part of the Mount Hood National Forest to do so.

That’s prompting concerns from environmental groups and local residents. They’re worried both about the ecological cost to fish and wildlife, and about whether the extra water will really go to local homes and businesses — or if The Dalles wants to draw water from the Mount Hood forest to slake the tech industry’s growing thirst for data centers.

“The notion that this water is somehow for drinking water for residents of the city, it’s just a fallacy,” said John DeVoe, senior advisor at WaterWatch of Oregon, an environmental nonprofit. “Obviously, the great driver of demand for water in The Dalles is Google.”

The city’s elected officials have repeatedly denied that they are seeking more water to serve Google. They say they need to expand The Dalles’ reservoir because the city in north-central Oregon is growing.

But The Dalles’ population hasn’t grown much this past decade. It has added about 1,700 people over the last 15 years, bringing its population up to about 16,200 people, according to Portland State University estimates.

What has grown: Google’s size and water use.

Google built its first data center in The Dalles in 2006. In 2012, the tech giant used 12% of The Dalles water supply. By 2024, a third of The Dalles’ water went to Google’s three local data center sites. The multitrillion-dollar tech company just built a data center building in 2025, and plans to complete another one this year.

Officials with Google say they are not behind the push to transfer federal land to The Dalles so the city can expand its reservoir. And The Dalles city officials insist the city isn’t expanding its reservoir to meet Google’s growing need for water.

“Google is really not a factor in this at all,” said The Dalles Mayor Richard Mays. “We were planning on doing this without Google.”

Yet The Dalles’ 2024 master water plan projects the city will need at least a million gallons per day specifically for an unnamed industrial user. That’s the same amount Google is using in The Dalles.

The Dalles’ request to use more water from the Hood River Basin comes as tech companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft increasingly draw scrutiny for consuming massive amounts of water to cool servers in their data centers.

Data centers are a backbone of the technology that underpins much of modern life. They host websites, business applications, social media platforms and streaming media. While these centers have existed for decades, companies are rapidly constructing more to accommodate the nation’s growing demand for artificial intelligence.

Data centers have proliferated in rural areas like The Dalles, where land is vast and cheap. These systems come with some economic benefits: Google has invested almost $29 million into updating The Dalles’ water system, albeit in exchange for tax breaks.

Google’s property taxes for its data centers are discounted by 92% through its agreements with The Dalles and Wasco County. In 2025, it paid $7.3 million in property taxes, including a community service fee.

Tech companies like Google can bring promises of jobs and expanded industry in areas that feel forgotten by modern urbanization. Google employs about 200 people in The Dalles.

But the benefits data centers might bring to rural areas can come at a cost to the environment, the electrical grid, and water resources. It’s up to local leaders of small cities and counties to decide which they value most: an economic boost and funds for public services like health departments and water infrastructure, or natural resources that people and wildlife need to live.

The Dalles seeks a piece of Mount Hood National Forest

The Dalles gets almost 85% of its water from the Dog River, a low-flowing river that drains down the eastern Mount Hood foothills. The city has a pipeline that diverts water from the river into a stream that empties into the city’s reservoir.

The forests surrounding The Dalles’ reservoir are owned and managed by the U.S. Forest Service. If the city pursues a project that could affect that land — like by expanding the reservoir — it needs to get a federal permit. As part of that process, federal agencies would analyze whether the project could harm the environment and sensitive species. That analysis would likely take multiple years.

“When it’s owned by someone else other than us, we can’t control it,” Mays said. “We have to go through all sorts of red tape and special use permits with the Forest Service in order to be able to expand that reservoir.”

To cut through that red tape, including environmental reviews, The Dalles hopes to acquire the federal land immediately surrounding its reservoir, so it can raise its dam — necessary to expand the reservoir so it can hold more water — by roughly 2040.

The city is trying to acquire the federal land through a bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Cliff Bentz, a Republican representing most of Eastern and Southern Oregon. If the bill makes it through Congress, The Dalles will take ownership of the land. That will allow it to raise its dam and to expand its reservoir’s capacity from 900 acre-feet to about 3,000 acre-feet, more than triple its current size, without Forest Service oversight. For context, an Olympic-size swimming pool holds about 2 acre-feet of water. The city expects raising the dam and expanding the reservoir to cost about $70 million.

Bentz said he does not know if The Dalles’ reservoir expansion is needed specifically to fulfill Google’s water needs.

“Did I ask them how they were going to use the water and who was going to get it? No,” Bentz told OPB. “The focus here is on how can we do things more efficiently at the governmental level to make it more likely that we can offer services and utilities to business so that we can get better jobs for higher pay to people.”

Bentz’s bill has passed through the House, and is now in the hands of a Senate committee on which U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, sits.

In a statement to OPB, Wyden remained noncommittal.

“I am listening to the interests and concerns of all parties as the Senate considers the bill,” Wyden said in a statement to OPB.

In addition to its reservoir, The Dalles gets water from groundwater wells. Those wells pull from an aquifer, an underground layer of porous rock and water. Other people and businesses with their own wells in the area, including ranchers, farmers and residents, also draw water from the same source.

Because aquifers have a limited amount of water at any given time, Oregon law limits how much people can pull by allocating water rights.

When Google purchased a defunct aluminum smelter in The Dalles, it also acquired the right to pump massive amounts of water from underground — up to 3.88 million gallons a day. That’s almost as much water as the entire city averaged per day in 2024.

The corporation transferred those water rights to the city in 2021, Bentz noted, allowing The Dalles to pump more water from underground.

But groundwater is limited — there is only so much available before it’s replenished by rain or snowmelt. Oregon is one of many states that have allocated more water rights than the earth can provide at once, causing groundwater wells for residents, farmers and other businesses to run dry — particularly in Eastern and Central Oregon.

When the smelter was in operation, it pumped so much water that it strained groundwater resources, which helped put The Dalles on state regulators’ map of “critical groundwater areas.” It wasn’t until the early 2000s, when the water-intensive smelter closed, that groundwater levels began to stabilize.

Now, The Dalles has the right to pump the same amount of water, potentially straining The Dalles’ groundwater resources again. And it can provide a large portion of that water to Google.

In an interview with OPB, Google representatives said the company has made up for its heavy water consumption by investing in watershed projects, including planting trees in burned areas and rebuilding a canal.

“We’ve made a lot of investments in the watershed in Oregon that we think ultimately has improved that watershed significantly to the benefit of the entire community,” said Ben Townsend, global head of infrastructure strategy and sustainability at Google.

In the end, Townsend said, Google is all about transparency.

“We want to tell a community why we’re using water,” Townsend said. “They deserve to know. We want to tell a community how much water we’re using.”

Google’s track record in The Dalles tells a different story. In 2021, the company tried to prevent the public from knowing how much water it was using in the city, arguing its water use was a “trade secret,” according to reporting by The Oregonian/OregonLive. The newspaper sued The Dalles for public records, arguing that information must be made public. The Dalles eventually settled with The Oregonian/OregonLive and released the records.

Google paid the city’s attorneys fees in that lawsuit.

OPB pressed Townsend about the lawsuit and how it relates to his goal of transparency. He said the company was trying to protect “physical security of assets that are critical to operations.”

“It’s a little hurtful to hear it implied that there is any attempt by myself or others on the team to obfuscate or hide what would be meaningful environmental footprint data to the community,” Townsend said, adding later, “It hurt my feelings a little bit.”

Diverting river water from Mount Hood

Environmental groups worry that enlarging The Dalles’ reservoir would divert too much water from the Dog River and ultimately harm fish and wildlife.

The Dog River is filled with snowmelt. It flows into the Hood River and, from there, into the Columbia River. As climate change increases global temperatures, river systems like these need all the cool mountain water they can get.

The Dog River has run dry before. When that happens, Hood River, and subsequently the Columbia River, get less cold mountain runoff that might otherwise cool their waters.

Warm water holds less oxygen, making it difficult for fish and other aquatic life to breathe. Harmful bacteria and other microbes also thrive in warmer temperatures, potentially leading to algal and bacterial blooms, and degrading overall water quality.

The Hood River Basin is already stressed by drought. It’s historically been an important cold-water refuge for migrating salmon, providing the cool water they need to move between freshwater rivers and the ocean. The coho salmon, Chinook salmon and steelhead that swim through this basin are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.

“Every unit of water you take out of the system over time eventually results in probably higher water temperatures, less spawning and rearing habitat for fish,” said DeVoe, the advisor with WaterWatch of Oregon. “Many of these rivers just have nothing left to give.”

The Dalles is limited by how much water it can pull from the Dog River between August and November, when streamflows are usually lowest and most threatening to fish survival. The city needs to leave a minimum flow of 0.5 cubic feet per second — usually about 3 to 6 inches of water.

That’s generally too low for salmon and steelhead to survive. But city leaders say even when the river is too low for these species to reach some areas, it is deep enough for them to survive farther downstream.

“Dog River’s never going to be dry because you have contributing factors and tributary spring springs that are flowing into Dog River downstream from our diversion point,” said The Dalles public works director Dale McCabe.

It’ll be difficult to determine what environmental harms might come from expanding The Dalles’ reservoir. If the federal land around the reservoir is transferred to the city, The Dalles won’t need to undergo a federal environmental assessment.

“There may never be a proper analysis because it won’t be required, and that in itself is concerning,” said Jade Hagan, a spokesperson for Bark, a grassroots environmental group focused on Mount Hood.

Google’s long history in The Dalles

Around 2012, The Dalles started rebuilding its pipeline that diverts water from Dog River, a $14 million project. The old pipe was nearly a century old, made of wood, and leaked.

The new pipe would be made of plastic. It would also be much larger, with enough capacity to draw twice as much water from the river.

Multiple people and environmental groups, as well as the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, voiced concerns that the larger pipe wouldn’t leave enough water in the river for fish.

“The upstream reaches of the Dog River are entirely dewatered by the City of The Dalles on federal lands administered by your agency,” the tribes wrote to the Forest Service in 2016. “This is despite the trust responsibility the federal government has to the Tribes to maintain fish and wildlife populations.”

After a yearslong environmental assessment, the U.S. Forest Service assured those groups in 2020 that the city of The Dalles didn’t have immediate plans to take more water from the Dog River for at least another decade, because the city’s reservoir was at capacity. The Dalles public works staff told federal regulators that its current water capacity met the city’s needs.

“Therefore, the Forest Service considers any such plans to increase the reservoir’s capacity as an unforeseeable action at this time,” the agency told critics in 2020.

A year later, in 2021, Google announced its plans to build two new data centers.

That’s when Google, through a subsidiary called Design LLC, offered a deal to the city: it would spend $28.5 million to cover the cost of some water infrastructure, including two new groundwater wells, two storage tanks, and multiple pump stations. In exchange, The Dalles would provide Google deep tax cuts for the data centers’ first 15 years, and it would commit to providing a certain amount of water to the company annually.

Suddenly, The Dalles needed more water.

The Dalles public works staff solicited multiple studies and reports illustrating the city’s current water capacity and what it needed to “meet future demands,” according to staff reports presented to councilors.

Subsequent studies and water reports don’t explicitly name Google as a primary water consumer, though the city’s 2024 water master plan specifically mentions a “large industrial user” in projecting how much water The Dalles will need in the future.

That large industrial user, it says, needs about 1 million gallons a day, the same amount that Google currently consumes in The Dalles.

In addition to expanding the reservoir into federal land, the city’s water plan recommends a series of infrastructure improvements to meet future water demands, including replacing and expanding the city’s water treatment plant, and increasing aquifer storage. Altogether, these improvements are expected to cost about $260 million over the next 20 years — including the $70 million that would pay for the reservoir expansion

Revenues from Google, including property taxes, should cover almost a quarter of those upgrades. The rest will come from loans and higher water rates for customers. Those rates are expected to increase by 7% by 2036.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-95/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5febrijkhrdedk4cll65mkfrca-1024x6531768830356.jpeg?h=d3eda8cf&itok=9GJWKDbA,N,,2026-01-19 12:00:57.006436

This appropriation marks Congress’s largest federal investment in the Coastal Texas Project since the project’s authorization in 2022, a milestone effort led by U.S. Rep. Randy Weber (TX-14). Funding is finalized once the bill is signed by President Donald J. Trump.

The upper Texas coast is home to more than 7 million people supporting one of the nation’s largest oil, gas, and petrochemical manufacturing hubs and strategic petroleum reserves.

The region is critical to U.S. energy dominance, producing:

32% of the nation’s total refining capacity

60% of the nation’s aviation fuel

42% of the nation’s specialty chemical feedstock

80% of the nation’s military-grade fuel

“This significant federal investment in the Coastal Texas Project is critical to protecting not just our coastline, but the economic engine that powers the nation,” said Commissioner Dawn Buckingham, M.D., Texas General Land Office (GLO). “Texas is home to the largest concentration of oil and gas infrastructure in the United States, and safeguarding our coast from catastrophic storms protects every American. “Thank you to Congressman Randy Weber (TX-14) and the United States Congress for investing in Texas. This is a big step toward safeguarding our country’s economic security.”

This critical funding accelerates pre-construction, engineering, and design while driving federal coordination among the Gulf Coast Protection District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Texas General Land Office (GLO), and regional partners—pushing the nation’s largest coastal protection effort closer to reality.

“This appropriation represents a significant federal commitment to a project that protects infrastructure vital to the entire country and global supply chain. It signals to us that Congress has a strong interest in partnering with the State of Texas to advance a nationally important coastal protection effort,” said Coalter Baker, Executive Director of the Gulf Coast Protection District, the project’s lead non-Federal sponsor. “We appreciate U.S. Rep. Randy Weber’s leadership in this funding milestone and recognize it will take a whole of government effort to continue to advance this project.”

Coastal Texas Project, established by Congress in 2022, carries a total authorized cost of $35 billion, shared between the federal government (65%) and the non-Federal sponsor (35%). To date, the State of Texas has appropriated $950 million to the Gulf Coast Protection District for use toward its projects.

The grid operator also called for the creation of an accelerated interconnection track for state-sponsored generation projects.
Rapid expansion of data centers to fuel things like artificial intelligence has stretched the resources of PJM and other regional U.S. electric grids.

PJM said it is reviewing the principles set forth by the White House and governors.","WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The White House on Friday urged the largest U.S. electric grid to conduct an emergency power auction to protect against rolling blackouts as energy demand from data centers grows faster than the country can build new generation plants.

The Trump administration initiative calls on PJM Interconnection, which serves 67 million customers in 13 states and Washington, D.C., to conduct an emergency procurement auction to address escalating electricity prices and growing reliability risks across the mid-Atlantic region of the United States.

PJM later on Friday unveiled its own plan, which called for big data centers to voluntarily bring their own new generation or face the potential of having their power supply curtailed during peak demand periods. The grid operator also called for the creation of an accelerated interconnection track for state-sponsored generation projects.

At a White House event, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum joined several state governors to discuss initiatives to speed the construction of more than $15 billion in new power generation on PJM, which has been criticized for being too slow to build a cushion against rotating blackouts as demand rises.

Rapid expansion of data centers to fuel things like artificial intelligence has stretched the resources of PJM and other regional U.S. electric grids. President Donald Trump is seeking to combat consumer price inflation that risks undermining support for Republicans ahead of November's midterm elections.

The White House is seeking caps on the amount existing power plants can charge in the PJM capacity market. A recent PJM capacity market auction set record-high prices for power generators that were more than 800% higher than the previous year, increasing electricity prices for homes and businesses.

The agreement would also require data centers to pay for the new generation built on their behalf – whether they show up and use the power or not - rather than buying up existing power. The concept is called BYOG, or ""bring your own generation.""

PJM said it is reviewing the principles set forth by the White House and governors. PJM was not invited to the event, a PJM spokesperson told Reuters.

PJM has forecast that the grid's peak usage in the summer will climb by about 70 gigawatts to 220 gigawatts over the next 15 years. The record summer peak for PJM was 165 gigawatts in 2006.

Since 2023, PJM says it has processed more than 170 gigawatts of new generation requests. Nearly 60 gigawatts of projects have completed PJM's study process and have either signed or been offered generation interconnection agreements.

RISING POWER BILLS HAVE LED TO BACKLASH

Rising power bills in PJM's region have led to a political backlash over the last year and threats by some governors to abandon the regional grid. Last summer, nine state governors wrote an open letter to the PJM board of managers criticizing the grid operator for not doing enough to address an escalating electricity affordability crisis.

""Unfortunately, what we have seen in our region is that PJM has been too damn slow to let new generation onto the grid at a time where energy demand is going up,"" Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said at the White House event on Friday.

Burgum said PJM has been lucky so far in avoiding widespread blackouts.

Dominion Energy Inc. can restart construction of a wind project off the coast of Virginia while it continues a legal fight over the Trump administration’s order to stop the US$11 billion development, a federal judge ruled.

United States District Judge Jamar Walker in Norfolk, Virginia, issued a preliminary injunction Friday. It blocks the government from enforcing its stop-work order after Dominion claimed it was suffering irreparable harm and losing millions of dollars every day the project sits idle. Walker is the third federal judge this week to allow a halted wind development to resume construction.

The Virginia unit of Dominion Energy is among several companies suing the U.S. Department of the Interior over a Dec. 22 order suspending five East Coast wind projects for 90 days over unspecified national security concerns. But the developers sued, with some winning temporary reprieves. Earlier this week, a federal judge ruled Norway’s Orsted A/S can resume development of its project off Rhode Island while its lawsuit proceeds and a different judge issued a similar ruling for Equinor ASA’s Empire Wind project near New York.

The Virginia judge echoed concerns expressed in the other cases. Walker, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, said the government had failed to demonstrate that the “national security risk is so imminent” that the Dominion project should be halted. He added that department’s order was likely arbitrary and capricious and that further delays would cause irreparable harm to the company.

The White House didn’t immediately comment on the decision.

Dominion shares rose 0.6 per cent after the ruling to touch an intraday high of US$61.50.

President Donald Trump has sought to aggressively thwart the growth of the industry as he rolls back Biden-era climate policies and champions fossil fuels. This latest move also comes after Trump froze permitting for all wind projects on federal land and oceans on his first day back in office, though a federal judge ruled that his decree was illegal.

The U.S. offshore wind industry has faced other difficulties, including soaring inflation and supply chain snarls in recent years. And even after some of those problems subsided, developers have since been hit by rising costs from Trump’s tariffs. All told, that’s led to project cancellations, delays and writedowns.

Dominion said in court papers that it is losing about US$5 million a day on vessel contracts alone because of the construction halt, with more costs from idled workers and contractual penalties. The company says more than two-thirds of the expected US$11.2 billion total cost has already been spent on the Virginia project, which was expected to be completed this year and provide power for 660,000 homes.

Alternative investment firm Stonepeak Partners acquired a 50 per cent stake in the wind project in 2024 and has agreed to fund 50 per cent of project costs up to US$11.3 billion, with additional sharing of costs in excess of that amount. According to analysts at Jefferies Financial Group Inc., Dominion and Stonepeak are sharing about US$225 million in monthly costs associated with the stop-work order.

Dominion said in a statement last month that the project is “essential for American national security and meeting Virginia’s dramatically growing energy needs.” That includes electricity for the “world’s largest concentration of data centres” and many federal government and military facilities, including the Pentagon, attorneys for the company wrote in court records.

In a court filing, the operator of the 13-state power grid that includes Virginia said the Dominion project is important to meeting the rapidly increasing electricity demand and that further delay will cause “irreparable harm” to the 67 million people who live in the region.

The U.S. government has argued the move to pause construction was valid because it was done for national security reasons. The stop-work order adequately explained that the Department of Defense provided new classified information about advances in “adversary technologies” that “could raise national security issues with offshore wind projects,” government lawyers said in a December court filing.

Attorneys for Dominion contend in court papers the agency’s reasons for the pause weren’t “plausible” because national security considerations were already addressed during the permitting process. They also claimed the government infringed on Dominion’s constitutional due process rights by failing to give notice and an opportunity for a hearing before issuing the order.

There’s a lot of reasons to buy a new car, but what are some of the indicators that it is time to change over to an electric vehicle (EV) rather than buying a traditional gas-fueled car? Turns out, there are plenty of clues, most of which include how much money you are spending at the shop and how many miles you are racking up on the road.

Here are five key signs switching to an EV will save you money.

Amount of Driving

When considering whether or not to switch to an EV, the first thing to consider is how much you drive, according to Justin Fischer, EV automotive analyst and expert at CarEdge.

“The more you drive, the more you can save with an EV,” Fischer said. “This is especially true for urban commuters, who stand to benefit from greater fuel savings in stop-and-go traffic. For drivers who either spend excessive time in traffic, or drive at least 10,000 miles per year, an EV will save you much more money, making it more likely that the math will work out in your favor.”

Charging Locations

Fischer highlighted that another key consideration is where you’ll be charging your electric vehicle.

“If you’ll be able to charge at home or work, it’s very likely that you’ll save money with an EV,” Fischer explained, adding that public fast charging is expensive, with prices ranging from 35 cents per kiloWatt-hour (kWh) to north of 65 cents per kWh. “Per mile driven, public charging is often more expensive than gas, depending on your local gas prices.”

Maintenance Costs

If your car is prone to needing repairs and costly maintenance, an EV’s maintenance costs provide even more savings, according to Joe Giranda, director of sales and marketing at CFR Classic.

“Over three years, an owner could save between $500 to $700 by not having to pay for oil changes, transmission servicing and exhaust repairs,” Giranda explained. “EVs stay longer on the road with fewer maintenance requirements, fewer moving parts, and the absence of a combustion engine.”

Societal Benefits

Government incentives and rebates can lower the upfront cost of EVs pointed out Rei Vardi, CEO and founder of Eon, sustainability-focused platform for EV car-sharing and rental space

“Consumers are also increasingly motivated by sustainability, and driving electric is one of the most impactful choices for reducing personal carbon emissions,” Vardi added.

Flexible Usage

Even with shifting incentives and rising costs, Vardi noted that many drivers are realizing that owning a car outright isn’t the only way to drive electric.

“Renting (or subscribing, through a service like Eon) removes the long-term financial risk of battery depreciation, tariffs or maintenance surprises,” Vardi explained. “People can experience all the benefits and cost-savings of EV driving without locking themselves into a purchase during an uncertain market. Flexibility is becoming its own form of savings.”",https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/all-electric-vehicle-charging-station-shutterstock_548313280.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 12:59:02.552714

The legislation, which passed the House of Representatives the previous week by a vote of 397 to 28, provides $38.6 billion in targeted discretionary spending, including $8.8 billion for the EPA. It now heads to the President’s desk to be signed into law.

The bill retains level funding for EPA’s major drinking water infrastructure programs, rejecting the 90 percent cuts to the State Revolving Fund programs proposed by President Trump last year. The final compromise bill wraps FY26 funding for EPA and its water infrastructure programs up in a package with appropriations for the Army Corps of Engineers and several other departments. EPA’s overall funding for FY26 is $320 million below FY25, but $4.7 billion above what President Trump sought for the agency. EPA’s core water infrastructure programs are maintained at FY25 levels, including:

The Drinking Water SRF, at $1.126 billion;

The Clean Water SRF, at $1.639 billion;

The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) loan program, at $64.6 million, plus an additional $7.6 million to support EPA’s administration of the program;

The Midsize and Large Drinking Water System Infrastructure Resilience and Sustainability program, at $2.25 million; and

Reducing Lead in Drinking Water grants, at $22 million.

Of the $2.76 billion in SRF funds appropriated through the measure, just over $1.6 billion would be distributed to 1,163 individual project earmarks requested by members of Congress.

Lawmakers’ compromise on EPA and water infrastructure funding comes after months of pushback by AMWA to Trump Administration proposals to slash key programs, like the SRFs and WIFIA. Over the past few months, AMWA collaborated with other stakeholders on outreach to Congress to urge strong funding for these critical programs.

In addition to the regular FY26 SRF funding included in the bill, EPA will also receive the last installment of supplemental water infrastructure funding provided by the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This includes an additional $2.34 billion, evenly divided between the Drinking Water and Clean Water SRFs, plus another $2.875 billion through the DWSRF for lead service line replacement efforts.

Following passage of the EPA spending bill, Congress still needs to finalize several other spending packages to avoid a partial government shutdown on January 30.

We have also considered how this policy will align with the recently published Welsh Government strategic Carbon Capture and Storage policy.

The hydrogen policy we publish today highlights the strategic importance of hydrogen infrastructure to decarbonisation and sustainable economic growth in Wales. The policy aligns with UK Government hydrogen business models and support mechanisms, providing the best opportunity for Welsh developers to successfully access Hydrogen Allocation Rounds, while also reflecting a clear commitment to our well-being objectives.

Designing our hydrogen policy

Our vision for the future of industry and energy generation is one in which sustainable industries are retained in Wales, and continue to generate high-quality jobs and careers, and other benefits for the communities in which they operate. Wales is proud of its industrial base, and we must encourage the investment necessary to support a transition to a decarbonised, sustainable future.

Guided by the advice and views of the Climate Change Committee, Net Zero Industry Wales, UK Government regulatory groups, and our industrial, academic and public stakeholders, we are taking bold steps to support industry in decarbonising, as set out in Net Zero Wales, our strategic plan to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

The Welsh Government recognises the importance of hydrogen for decarbonisation, particularly for sectors that are hard to electrify, such as heavy industry and certain transport applications. We also recognise the significant economic opportunities the technology can deliver for industry, business and citizens in Wales. Hydrogen projects will create jobs and careers during construction, operation and maintenance, as well as safeguarding jobs in other sectors and providing wider supply chain opportunities.

Consultation Details and Outcomes

The consultation received sixty-two responses representing a broad cross-section from industry, academia, government bodies, trade organisations and individuals, and I would like to thank those who responded.

Many respondents used the consultation to stress how important hydrogen is for decarbonising industry and energy, in particular for sectors that are challenging to electrify. Most respondents supported aligning the policy with the UK Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard, and the requirement for hydrogen to make a clear and sustainable contribution to decarbonisation and building a stronger, greener economy that avoids de-industrialisation.

Some responses questioned how the energy hierarchy within Planning Policy Wales would apply to the specific nature of hydrogen developments. The role of the hierarchy is to guide energy investment towards reduced energy use, efficiency gains and renewable energy. Hydrogen has a strategic role in achieving these aims, and we are committed to producing additional guidance that will clarify how hydrogen aligns with the energy hierarchy.

Final Strategic Policy for Hydrogen

The published policy encourages investment in the production and deployment of hydrogen where:

The hydrogen production process meets the requirements of the UK Government Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard (LCHS).

Where hydrogen makes a clear, measurable and sustained contribution to meeting decarbonisation targets and objectives.

Where hydrogen production does not contribute to unsustainable levels of fossil fuel use or impede our transition to net-zero.

Where hydrogen contributes to growing a sustainable economy.

The consideration of a development’s emissions intensity, rather than prescribing favoured technologies, provides developers with the broadest possible scope to devise innovative approaches to sector and site-specific challenges. The policy also provides additional clarity and a solid foundation from which we will continue to work with the UK Government, regulators and developers to help deliver both Welsh and UK net-zero ambitions.

Our finalised strategic policy position for hydrogen will sit alongside our evolving policy framework, designed to avoid the extraction and use of fossil fuels, provide alternatives for fuel switching, and managing those emissions that cannot be avoided.",https://www.gov.wales//themes/custom/govwales/images/content/og-global-1200.png,N,,2026-01-19 12:00:00.496694

But the Policy Commission on Gigafactories will recommend that the government ease the 2030 interim target to 50-60% from 80% and reduce fines for carmakers in case of non-compliance.

The UK’s Policy Commission on Gigafactories will say in a Wednesday report that the UK needs to recalibrate the interim EV goals to 2030, Lord John Hutton, who launched the commission last year, told the Financial Times.

The Commission, launched in the middle of 2025, aimed to produce recommendations on how the UK can scale up its battery manufacturing capacity – a critical requirement to achieving net zero, generating economic growth, and securing high-quality green jobs.

Currently, the UK’s zero emission vehicle mandate is 80% of new cars sold in 2030 to be electric vehicles. This share should rise to 100% by 2035.

The UK doesn’t plan to revisit the 2035 end-date for sale of new gasoline and diesel passenger cars.

But the Policy Commission on Gigafactories will recommend that the government ease the 2030 interim target to 50-60% from 80% and reduce fines for carmakers in case of non-compliance. This, the commission reckons, will encourage investment in the UK’s battery supply chain.

“There is growing consensus in industry that there’s a need for a course redirection here. It’s not scrap everything, but recalibrate,” Lord Hutton, a former Labour Defence Secretary, told FT.

“Regulatory interventions have to be evidence based, not ideologically based,” Lord Hutton added.

Auto makers in the UK and Europe have been suffering in recent years from the U.S. tariffs, the Chinese curbs on rare earth exports, falling demand, and competition from the cheaper vehicles made in China.

At the end of last year, intense lobbying from Germany and Italy, and the auto industry, resulted in the European Commission proposing the easing of the de facto EU ban on new sales of combustion-engine cars from 2035.

These were also the regions with the largest growth in electricity demand.
According to the energy think tank, this means that solar met rising demand, but did not displace existing generation.
Ember’s Chief Analyst, Dave Jones, believes that solar has the potential to meet all the rise in electricity demand.
Solar growth already met 61% of electricity demand growth in 2025 and there’s nothing to stop it meeting 100%.","The US witnessed a 135 TWh rise in electricity demand in 2025, a 3.1% year-on-year (YoY) increase, of which 61% was met by solar energy generation, covering all the rise in daytime electricity demand between 10:00 and 18:00 ET, says Ember in a new report.

Weather did not play a role here, since the country’s insolation remained unchanged in 2025 compared to 2024, it adds.

Thanks to battery storage, solar also met some of the rising electricity demand in the evening hours from 18:00 to 10:00 ET, the report says, analyzing year-end data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

“The rise of batteries in the US is changing solar from cheap daytime electricity to dispatchable all-day electricity,” notes Ember. “In the last six years, California’s utility solar and battery generation has risen by 58%, yet generation at the sunniest hour of the day has risen by just 8%.”

Most of the solar power is still concentrated in a small number of US states. In the past year, 37 states got less than 10% of their electricity from solar, even though solar is growing fast in some places.

Solar electricity generation in the US rose by 83 TWh or 27% in 2025, with the largest increases in Texas, the Midwest, and the Mid-Atlantic, meeting 81%, 81%, and 33% of electricity demand growth in these regions, respectively. These were also the regions with the largest growth in electricity demand. According to the energy think tank, this means that solar met rising demand, but did not displace existing generation.

Ember points out that the US has yet to see a ‘duck curve’ problem, which means that non-solar power demand is higher during the day than at night, so solar has not yet caused major oversupply during daylight hours. Even at the sunniest hour, solar provided only 20% of US electricity generation on average across the year, the report reads.

Ember’s Chief Analyst, Dave Jones, believes that solar has the potential to meet all the rise in electricity demand.

“Solar in the US is only just beginning. Solar can meet fast-growing electricity demand. Solar growth already met 61% of electricity demand growth in 2025 and there’s nothing to stop it meeting 100%. With the prospect of solar becoming so cheap, solar can also play an important role in reducing coal and gas use rapidly and economically,” according to the report.",https://media.assettype.com/taiyangnews%2F2026-01-19%2Fc8rwvt0o%2FPresentation2.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2026-01-19 09:59:59.316129

Meanwhile, Tesla can still exit if the material doesn’t meet technical specs by February 9, keeping pressure on Vidalia’s ramp-up and the project’s funding story.

Why should I care?

For markets: Execution risk beats the reshoring story.

US-made battery inputs sound great, but quality and timing are what move stocks. Syrah fell even as a broader mining sub-index rose, a sign investors see this as company-specific risk rather than a commodity swing. Tesla is also Vidalia’s credibility anchor, so every delay supports hope of future revenue but extends uncertainty over volumes, margins, and financing.

The bigger picture: Building non-China battery supply chains takes time.

China still dominates anode processing, so Vidalia is meant to be a rare large-scale alternative. That also means it has to prove it can hit top automaker specs reliably and at scale – which is harder than signing an offtake agreement.

But while demand for AI systems continues, investment confidence is beginning to rebalance.
By contrast, 54% of respondents consider energy providers to be a stronger opportunity and 37% say energy infrastructure offers a better outlook than the big tech sector.
Energy demand takes centre stage As AI systems scale up, they bring increased attention to power consumption.
Data centres operate around the clock and require continuous cooling and server performance, making electricity providers and grid operators key players in the AI investment story.","Artificial intelligence remains central to investment portfolios, but the momentum that drove tech giants throughout 2025 is beginning to spread across a wider ecosystem.

Financial institutions are beginning to rethink where AI growth offers the best return – and the spotlight is now falling on energy providers, grid infrastructure and long-term power planning.

The shift in strategy is outlined in BlackRock’s latest Investment Directions report, which involved interviewing more than 700 of its EMEA clients.

Investors cool on big tech in 2026

AI captured a flood of investment in 2025 as companies like Meta, Microsoft, Google and OpenAI ramped up development of language models (LLMs), cloud infrastructure and foundation model platforms.

But while demand for AI systems continues, investment confidence is beginning to rebalance.

""It's increasingly important to risk-manage megacap and AI exposure while also capturing differentiated upside opportunities,"" says Ibrahim Kanan, BlackRock's Head of Core US Equity.

Just a fifth of those polled by BlackRock say large US technology firms remain a compelling investment for the coming year. By contrast, 54% of respondents consider energy providers to be a stronger opportunity and 37% say energy infrastructure offers a better outlook than the big tech sector.

The data suggests investors are reacting to how AI systems are being built and scaled, with the cost of developing infrastructure remaining high. Consulting leader Gartner estimates that capital expenditure on AI hit US$1.5tn in 2025 – a worrying figure for investors concerned about concentration risk and uncertain returns, particularly when higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive.

There is also growing scrutiny of data centre profitability. Power bills keep rising and with that comes further pressure to identify sustainable, long-term value. BlackRock’s clients are looking beyond platforms and model providers to the utilities and infrastructure firms that supply the backbone of AI deployment.

Energy demand takes centre stage

As AI systems scale up, they bring increased attention to power consumption. Data centres operate around the clock and require continuous cooling and server performance, making electricity providers and grid operators key players in the AI investment story.

BlackRock asserts that this is far from a passing trend. Its research suggests AI has become a “structural component of global power consumption” rather than a short-term spike.

Energy providers are, therefore, in a favourable position. These firms not only provide a path to reduce the carbon footprint of AI growth but also offer a hedge against price volatility and long-term emissions risk.

Large technology companies and infrastructure developers are signing clean energy deals to secure future supplies and to manage emissions targets. These agreements stretch years ahead and underline how energy access becomes a core part of AI planning.

Investors see the same opportunity. As data centre demand expands, it puts pressure on national grids, transmission systems and storage capacity. Building new capacity now takes precedence over backing another large-language model.

Infrastructure builds underpin AI expansion

The focus for 2026 has already shifted to physical infrastructure.

Without investment in the grid, AI’s growth risks hitting a ceiling. Energy storage systems, transmission upgrades and modernised distribution networks are seen as vital to maintain expansion. In many areas, delays in permitting and planning slow the rollout of data centre infrastructure.

BlackRock, Microsoft and NVIDIA have jointly committed to a US$100bn programme to boost both AI data centres and surrounding energy networks, indicating industry recognition of the need to fix bottlenecks before power supply becomes a limiting factor.

However, this phase also brings short-term costs. Building new data centres and transmission networks involves high-emissions materials including steel and cement, as well as energy-intensive manufacturing. That raises further questions about the timing gap between upfront investment and eventual productivity gains.

Despite the concerns, interest in AI remains high. Just 7% of BlackRock’s respondents believe AI is a bubble, indicating that investors continue to believe in its long-term promise.

What's changing is how that promise is funded. Whereas early-stage AI development attracted money towards platform builders and model designers, 2026 marks a pivot towards companies that supply and sustain the ecosystem AI requires to function at scale. Grid stability, clean energy and private infrastructure projects are attracting the capital that once went into software.

Private markets are expected to take on a bigger role, funding efficiency upgrades and grid improvements that fall outside traditional equity investments.

Ultimately, BlackRock’s research indicates a shift in understanding, rather than a loss of faith in AI. Investors are approaching it as a wide-reaching investment theme that extends to the machines, cables and kilowatts powering digital transformation.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/535339b19a5aed53c5a2d4fb45e68356:07dd00fdf67275043609935075a7c749/gettyimages-1446334594.jpg.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 07:58:33.446776

The three main dispatchable sources of electricity generation (natural gas, coal, and nuclear) accounted for 75% of total generation in 2025, but we expect the share of generation from these sources will fall to about 72% in 2027. Analysts expect the combined share of generation from solar power and wind power to rise from about 18% in 2025 to about 21% in 2027

Jan 16 – Abu Dhabi National Energy Company (TAQA), along with Emirates Water and Electricity Company (EWEC), Masdar, EDF power solutions, and Jinko Power have announced the issuance of long-term Green Bonds to refinance Al Dhafra Solar Photovoltaic Independent Power Plant. The value of the bond is $870.75 million (AED 3.2 billion), this issuance has a coupon of 5.794% maturing in June 2053.

Jan 14 – ABB has launched ReliaHome Flex a modular energy management system that gives homeowners and builders control over their energy use. Electricity already accounts for 44% of US residential energy use and this share is forecast to rise by up to 22% by 2050.

Jan 12 – Sinopec, one of China’s largest LNG importers, and China National Aviation Fuel Group (CNAF) have embarked on a restructuring process to prepare a merger. The plan has been approved by the Chinese State Council and would marginally support Chinese LNG demand through higher jet fuel and SAF-linked gas use, while strengthening state control on long-term LNG contracting.

Jan 9 – Record levels of solar power generation in Germany – and falling industrial production – have helped reduce CO2 emission by 1.5%, or 9 million tons in 2025, compared to the previous year. However, emissions from transport and buildings increased, amid tepid progress in the transition to electric vehicles and heat pumps.

Jan 7 –The Kenyan, Norwegian and US governments will co-host the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) second summit on Clean Cooking in Africa. The first such IEA summit took place in Paris in May 2024, mobilising $2.2 billion in financial pledges from governments and the private sector.

Dec 18 – AMAGGI, a Brazilian agribusiness group, has contracted Wärtsilä to supply engines for two new pusher tugs. The ships are under construction at the Beconal shipyard in Manaus, with Wärtsilä’s equipment due to be delivered commencing in August 2026.

Dec 16 – US Government analysts have increased retail energy price forecasts, especially for natural gas and propane due to steep rise in Henry Hub prices. When the Energy Information Administration’s October STEO forecast was formed, the Henry Hub gas spot price was near $3.00 per MMBtu – by late November, the price has jumped to more than $4.00 per MMBtu.

Dec 15 – Eight mtu generators have been ordered by the Spanish shipping company Balearia to supply emergency power for two ferries. From 2027, the ships will cover the 18 nautical miles between Tarifa in Spain and Tangier in Morocco using electric power, with the mtu gensets capable to supply 11,000 kW total output as backup.

Dec 9 – Ampacimon and DroneVolt have completed certification for 765 kV transmission lines after a live-line test of their dynamic line rating (DLR) system. In-fight certification tests, carried out with a drone, confirmed the system can run safely and reliably at ultra-high-voltage levels

But environmentalists said the programme will have limited climate benefits because it includes many plug-in hybrids.

Households with a taxable income below 80,000 euros can benefit from the new programme, with additional allowances for households with children. Low-income families with several children can receive up to 6,000 euros when they buy a fully battery-electric car.

The country’s coalition government of chancellor Friedrich Merz’s conservative CDU/CSU alliance and the Social Democrats (SPD) had earlier agreed to spend three billion euros on supporting electric mobility adoption among low- and middle-income groups. SPD environment minister Carsten Schneider said he expected that around 800,000 car purchases would benefit from the scheme over a period of three to four years.

Following the abrupt end of an earlier purchasing subsidy in late 2023, sales of electric cars initially collapsed, but have since recovered. Following the 2024 dip, registrations of fully electric cars rose by more than 40 percent in the past year. But sales lag well behind earlier government plans to bring the number of EVs on the road to 15 million by 2030. The number of fully electric cars has just crossed 2 million.

The high average price of new electric vehicles remains a major obstacle to their mass adoption because it often limits purchases to drivers with higher incomes.

NGO Transport & Environment said the new programme “doesn’t fit the population or the climate”. It criticised that income thresholds were much too high and that the programme didn’t include used cars, given that few low-income households ever buy new models.

The NGO added that it didn’t make sense to promote plug-in hybrids because they emit almost as much CO2 as conventional cars in real-world operation. Greenpeace also said that “promoting bulky SUVs and climate-damaging plug-in hybrids is misguided, both socially and in terms of climate policy.”

Environment minister Schneider said during a press conference that support for plug-in hybrids “would not have been the first priority” for his ministry, but was a compromise with a view to saving jobs in the car industry.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2026-01-19 07:58:38.760538

Now, it ships Model Ys produced in Berlin to Canada, but more variants such as cheaper Model 3s are mostly built in China.
Other brands that exported cars made in China to Canada before the tariffs included ‍Volvo and Polestar, which are both owned by China’s automaking group Geely.
“The beneficiaries are likely ‍to be Chinese automakers and the Canadian ‍customers looking for an entry-level vehicle,” Fiorani said.
The former Biden administration quadrupled tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100% in 2024 too, all but blocking such exports to the United States.","BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Jan 19 (Reuters) – Tesla is poised to be one of the first automakers to benefit from Canada’s move to remove 100% tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, thanks to its early efforts to ship cars from its Shanghai plant there and its established Canadian sales network, experts say.

Under the deal announced last Friday, Canada ‍will allow up to 49,000 vehicles to be imported annually from China with a tariff of 6.1% on most-favoured nation terms. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the quota could rise to reach 70,000 vehicles within five years.

However, under one clause in the agreement, half of the quota will be reserved for vehicles under 35,000 CAD ($25,189). Tesla model prices are all above that number.

While many Chinese automakers will be keen to seize the opportunity as they expand exports, Tesla has an advantage as it in 2023 already equipped its Shanghai plant, ‌its biggest and most cost-efficient factory globally, to build and export a Canada-specific version of ‌its Model Y.

The U.S. automaker had that same year started shipping the car from Shanghai to Canada, boosting Canadian imports of automobiles from China to its largest port, Vancouver, by 460% year over year to 44,356 in 2023.

But it was forced to stop in 2024 and switched to shipping from its U.S. and Berlin factories after Ottawa imposed 100% tariffs, citing a wish to ​counter what they called China’s intentional state-directed policy of overcapacity.

Now, it ships Model Ys produced in Berlin to Canada, but more variants such as cheaper Model 3s are mostly built in China.

“This new agreement could allow resumption of those exports rather ‍quickly,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president of research firm AutoForecast Solutions.

Tesla has ​an existing network of 39 stores in Canada, whereas Chinese rivals such as BYD and ​Nio do not yet have a sales presence there, and it can also likely move faster with marketing plans as it ‍only has four core models, far fewer than its Chinese competitors.

“Tesla indeed has an advantage with its offering of a few models, versions and simple production lines so that it can be flexible to sell cars produced in any country in any markets to achieve the best cost efficiency,” said Yale Zhang, managing director at Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request for comment.

Other brands that exported cars made in China to Canada before the tariffs included ‍Volvo and Polestar, which are both owned by China’s automaking group Geely.

Volvo and Polestar also did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHINESE EV BRANDS

However, the clause on price will likely give Chinese brands some breathing room.

“The beneficiaries are likely ‍to be Chinese automakers and the Canadian ‍customers looking for an entry-level vehicle,” Fiorani said.

John Zeng, head of market forecast for China ​at London-based consultancy GlobalData, said that the quota also would likely offer Chinese carmakers an ​opportunity to ⁠test the waters in Canada where there’s a large population of Chinese Canadians.

Canada wants ‌to look at joint ventures and investments with Chinese companies within the next three years to build a Canadian electric vehicle with Chinese knowledge, the public broadcaster CBC reported, citing a senior Canadian official.

China’s top EV maker BYD currently has an electric bus assembly plant in Ontario, Canada.

Trump administration officials have criticized Canada’s decision. The former Biden administration quadrupled tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100% in 2024 too, all but blocking such exports to the United States.

In 2025, roughly 75 bills aimed at food dyes were introduced in 37 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
California has had a law regulating food dyes since 2023.
“It’s not very often you see states like California and West Virginia at the forefront of an issue together,” Baker-White said.
“If we’re honest, the American people have lost faith in some of our federal institutions, whether FDA or CDC,” said Burkhammer, the West Virginia lawmaker.","This article first appeared on KFF Health News.

When one of Adam Burkhammer’s foster children struggled with hyperactivity, the West Virginia legislator and his wife decided to alter their diet and remove any foods that contained synthetic dyes.

“We saw a turnaround in his behavior, and our other children,” said Burkhammer, who has adopted or fostered 10 kids with his wife. “There are real impacts on real kids.”

The Republican turned his experience into legislation, sponsoring a bill to ban seven dyes from food sold in the state. It became law in March, making West Virginia the first state to institute such a ban from all food products.

The bill was among a slew of state efforts to regulate synthetic dyes. In 2025, roughly 75 bills aimed at food dyes were introduced in 37 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Chemical dyes and nutrition are just part of the broader “Make America Healthy Again” agenda. Promoted by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., MAHA ideas have made their deepest inroads at the state level, with strong support from Republicans — and in some places, from Democrats. The $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program — created last year as part of the GOP’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act to expand health care access in rural areas — offers incentives to states that implement MAHA policies.

Federal and state officials are seeking a broad swath of health policy changes, including rolling back routine vaccinations and expanding the use of drugs such as ivermectin for treatments beyond their approved use. State lawmakers have introduced dozens of bills targeting vaccines, fluoridated water and PFAS, a group of compounds known as “forever chemicals” that have been linked to cancer and other health problems.

As Republicans spar over IVF, some turn to obscure MAHA-backed alternative

In addition to West Virginia, six other states have targeted food dyes with new laws or executive orders, requiring warning labels on food with certain dyes or banning the sale of such products in schools. California has had a law regulating food dyes since 2023.

Most synthetic dyes used to color food have been around for decades. Some clinical studies have found a link between their use and hyperactivity in children. And in early 2025, in the last days of President Joe Biden’s term, the Food and Drug Administration outlawed the use of a dye known as Red No. 3.

Major food companies including Nestle, Hershey and PepsiCo have gotten on board, pledging to eliminate at least some color additives from food products over the next year or two.

“We anticipate that the momentum we saw in 2025 will continue into 2026, with a particular focus on ingredient safety and transparency,” said John Hewitt, the senior vice president of state affairs for the Consumer Brands Association, a trade group for food manufacturers.

This past summer, the group called on its members to voluntarily eliminate federally certified artificial dyes from their products by the end of 2027.

“The state laws are really what’s motivating companies to get rid of dyes,” said Jensen Jose, regulatory counsel for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit health advocacy group.

Andy Baker-White, the senior director of state health policy for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said the bipartisan support for bills targeting food dyes and ultraprocessed food struck him as unusual. Several red states have proposed legislation modeled on California’s 2023 law, which bans four food additives.

“It’s not very often you see states like California and West Virginia at the forefront of an issue together,” Baker-White said.

State lawmakers embrace RFK Jr.’s health policies

Although Democrats have joined Republicans in some of these efforts, Kennedy continues to drive the agenda. He appeared with Texas officials when the state enacted a package of food-related laws, including one that bars individuals who participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — SNAP or food stamps — from using their benefits to buy candy or sugary drinks. In December, the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved similar waivers sought by six states. Eighteen states will block SNAP purchases of those items in 2026.

There are bound to be more. The Rural Health Transformation Program also offers incentives to states that implemented restrictions on SNAP.

“There are real and concrete effects where the rural health money gives points for changes in SNAP eligibility or the SNAP definitions,” Baker-White said.

In October, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill that sets a legal definition for ultraprocessed foods and will phase them out of schools. It’s a move that may be copied in other states in 2026, while also providing fodder for legal battles. In December, San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu sued major food companies, accusing them of selling “harmful and addictive” products. The lawsuit names specific brands — including cereals, pizzas, sodas and potato chips — linking them to serious health problems.

Kennedy has also blamed ultraprocessed foods for chronic diseases. But even proponents of the efforts to tackle nutrition concerns don’t agree on which foods to target. MAHA adherents on the right haven’t focused on sugar and sodium as much as policymakers on the left. The parties have also butted heads over some Republicans’ championing of raw milk, which can spread harmful germs, and the consumption of saturated fat, which contributes to heart disease.

Policymakers expect other flash points. Moves by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that are making vaccine access more difficult have led blue states to find ways to set their own standards apart from federal recommendations, with 15 Democratic governors announcing a new public health alliance in October. Meanwhile, more red states may eliminate vaccine mandates for employees; Idaho made them illegal. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is pushing to eliminate school vaccine mandates.

Even as Kennedy advocates eliminating artificial dyes, the Environmental Protection Agency has loosened restrictions on chemicals and pesticides, leading MAHA activists to circulate an online petition calling on President Donald Trump to fire EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

The concerns focus on draft legislation UC84, which would change the rules for connecting renewable energy projects to the power grid. The Polish Photovoltaic and Energy Storage Association (known as Polskie Stowarzyszenie Fotowoltaiki i Magazynowania Energii or PSFiME) argues that the proposal introduces upfront financial requirements. While financial requirements are typical in battery energy storage projects, the approach is considered to be incompatible with standard project development and financing models given a non-refundable model.

In an interview with Onet.pl, PSFiME president Ewa Magiera said the draft law would shift the entire financial burden of grid capacity planning onto investors.

“The proposed mechanism carries financial risk for applicants seeking grid connection, which can only be limited by obtaining confidential information about the state of the grid from system operator employees,” she said.

Under UC84, developers would be required to pay an advance of $16.5( PLN 60) per kilowatt toward grid connection fees. The draft also introduces a new financial security of $8.75/kW for the first 100 MW of capacity and $16.5/kW above that threshold. In addition, and the most controversial, is the application of a non-refundable application fee of PLN 1/kW, capped at $27,520 (PLN 100,000).

Magiera said the scale of the changes would require immediate capital commitments well before projects reach construction readiness. “The scale of these changes means the need to engage capital of between PLN 8.9 billion and PLN 13.3 billion [$USD 2.46 billion USD $3.67 billion] immediately,” she said, adding that developers have already paid significant connection advances.

“In practice, only entities with easy access to large-scale financing, state-owned companies and large foreign corporations, will be able to meet these requirements,” said Magiera.

According to data from Poland’s transmission system operator, more than 145 GW of projects, excluding offshore wind, currently hold grid connection conditions, with around 70% controlled by private renewable energy investors.

“Project UC84 ignores how renewable investments are actually developed in Europe,” Magiera said. “No one reserves billions of zloty ‘just in case’ at the very start of the process.”

Consequently, battery waste is also projected to exceed 128 GWh (59 GWh from EVs) by 2030. However, the amount of EV batteries being recycled is unclear, with reports suggesting that less than 1% of spent EVs are formally recycled.

One thing is certain: without a strong framework for a circular economy for batteries, there will be a huge quantity of waste to handle, along with a loss of resources. The very transition meant to decarbonise transport could generate new environmental vulnerabilities.

India’s Recycling Readiness

The country's installed recycling capacity may be more than 50,000 tonnes annually, but utilised capacity remains 20 to 25% of capacity. While there is much policy focus on EV adoption, the Battery Waste Management Rules, 2022 (BWMR), solely guide the end-of-life management of waste batteries. The BWMR (2022) introduced the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) mechanism, mandating producers to ensure recycling or refurbishing.

However, informal recycling operations still dominate the industry. Refurbishing does not have clear enough guidelines, and certifications are also pending, but much of the volumes of end of life batteries may be heading towards refurbishing. The International Energy Agency’s Global EV Outlook 2025 warns that emerging economies like India risk linear transitions, meaning adoption may outpace circular readiness unless it is backed by an integrated fiscal and industrial strategy.

The Ministry of Mines recently released a landmark scheme that aims to subsidise battery material recovery from secondary sources and support recycling. The scheme’s implementation and results will be visible over the next couple of years.

Bottlenecks For Recycling

India’s recycling landscape mostly consists of pre-processors, who extract black mass (an intermediate material achieved post mechanical separation of battery materials) instead of full recycling capabilities, i.e. producers of recovered materials, for use in manufacturing. Domestic expertise in advanced recycling and refining remains nascent.

Recycling needs proper channels to direct waste and efficient collection systems. Even though the BWMR mandates collection, there are no dedicated take-back outlets, and OEMS/ small battery sellers must arrange collection individually. India’s dealership and service networks remain fragmented, and only a small percentage of used EVs re-enter formal recycling streams.

Economic factors often impact recycling. Lithium and cobalt imports are still preferred due to the unavailability of large-scale refined output of recyclers, as only a handful of recyclers have refining capabilities, and even fewer are able to do it at scale.

Due to recycling’s high processing cost (especially with hydrometallurgy), it is not always ideal for recyclers to produce refined materials, as the price of the refined materials is market dependent and margins are not guaranteed if processing costs are too high. While import duties on virgin lithium/cobalt incentivise recycling, inadequate scale hampers viability.

In China, for example, recyclers often lose money but absorb the cost for strategic resource security. In India, without subsidies or assured off-take of recovered materials, business models struggle. Hence, some forms of fiscal equalisation measures are needed in the industry.

How Budget 2026 Can Help

India can draw valuable lessons from mature markets like the EU’s Battery Regulation 2023, which mandates a digital battery passport that tracks lifecycle data and sets recovery benchmarks for critical minerals, minimum levels of recycled content in new materials. In China, there is an integrated government-industry data platform that ensures that automakers are partnered with approved recyclers before even selling their cars. Recycling firms receive performance-linked subsidies. The United States has a funding centre for R&D and incentivises domestic recyclers.

India’s Union Budget could also explore tax credits for manufacturers meeting recycling targets or using recycled materials, green infra bonds to finance recycling clusters. They could also consider output subsidies for recovered material.

Other policy and governance mechanisms could help as well, such as a Centre of Excellence for Battery Recycling, which would be a great potential government action that can localise advanced recycling tech.

Recycling Infra Must Also Accelerate

India’s electric mobility is at a crossroads. The EV adoption has accelerated, and so must recycling infrastructure. With a corrective policy, India stands to gain environmentally and economically with an aligned recycling policy.

Budget 2026 offers a decisive window. By integrating the Ministry of Mines’ recycling incentives, expanding fiscal tools, and fostering R&D collaboration, India can build a true circular battery economy, one that safeguards both sustainability and sovereignty.

Jobs are rising fast in solar installation, grid construction, EV manufacturing, battery production and heat pump deployment.

In China, close to 40% of all vehicle manufacturing jobs are now linked to electric vehicles and batteries.

The shift is also rippling across heavy industry, with clean power and electrification reshaping steel, chemicals and cement.

Emerging economies are capturing the biggest gains as clean energy supply chains scale at speed.

India, Indonesia and the Middle East are seeing some of the fastest energy job growth globally.

Advanced economies are still adding workers but at a far slower rate.

The IEA says skills shortages are now one of the biggest risks to maintaining momentum.

Electricians, engineers and technicians are already in short supply across multiple markets. Without rapid training and reskilling, labour constraints could slow grid buildout and clean energy deployment.

Under current policies, energy employment is set to keep rising into the 2030s.

Below is an overview of several key changes.

Changes Impacting an Entity's Repeat Violator Status

One line item in TCEQ's penalty calculation worksheet is a multiplier for ""repeat violators."" Previously, this multiplier was reserved for entities with prior major violations of the same nature and same environmental media that occurred during the five-year compliance period. The new rule now includes minor and moderate violations.

The new points-based system for determining repeat violator status issues ""repeat violation points"" for each violation of the same nature and same environmental media documented in any final enforcement orders, court judgments, or criminal convictions that occurred at least three times during the five-year compliance history period. Further, each unauthorized discharge will be counted separately, thereby reducing the potential benefit of merging separate violations into a single enforcement action.

The agency received public comment from environmental groups on this change. Commenters noted that while the agency is considering minor and moderate violations, as required by the Sunset Bill, the requirement for a facility to have three enforcement orders to be considered a repeat violator undercuts the agency's directive to take into account repeat violations. During the January 14, 2026 hearing, the Commissioners expressed in response that the rule changes required ""threading the needle"" and they were proud of all of the hard work put in by agency staff.

More Predictable Compliance Period

The TCEQ has adopted a more practical way to calculate the relevant five-year compliance period it uses in calculating penalties during enforcement. A facility's compliance period looks back across a five-year period. This hasn't changed. However, while the prior rule considered the five years prior to the date the agency mailed an enforcement settlement offer or petition to the entity (which could be years after the initial investigation), the revised rule will change the relevant compliance period to five years prior to the date of an initial enforcement screening. This change has several effects.

First, the date of the initial enforcement screening more accurately reflects a facility's compliance at that point in time. The back and forth that may occur with the agency before a settlement offer is mailed can span months or years. Changing this trigger date better supports the agency's goal of having a facility come into compliance as a result of its enforcement efforts and facilities will not face a protracted compliance period due to factors beyond its control.

Additionally, regulated entities who respond to enforcement by implementing changes at the facility to come into compliance will be able to move toward a cleaner compliance history on a shorter timeframe. Already facing a five year look back, entities need to maintain compliance for years before accomplishing a clean record. The more predictable and earlier trigger date will allow the entities that have implemented lasting changes to develop a cleaner record, sooner.

With these rule changes, the TCEQ will also increase its frequency of reviewing compliance histories, with review to take place twice a year, rather than annually. This can give regulated entities a six-month advantage to accomplishing a clean compliance history.

Closing Thoughts and Evaluating Impacts to Your Facility

Companies with operations in Texas should review the final rule, once published; alert their compliance and environmental personnel of this rule change; access their compliance history through the agency's new Advance Review of Compliance History (""ARCH"") database; and plan for potential financial impacts the changes may have on penalty calculations.

While the above summary touches on several key changes, the amendments include additional changes that impact regulated entities. We welcome the opportunity to discuss these changes in more detail, should this notice raise any questions.

The recent decision by Ford Motor Co. and South Korea’s SK Innovation Co. to dissolve their American battery manufacturing partnership signals a significant shift in the automotive supply chain landscape. Instead of jointly operating their U.S. facilities, each company will now independently own and run specific plants, marking a strategic separation of their previously shared battery production efforts.

The New Operational Landscape for Battery Plants

Under the new arrangement, SK Innovation will take charge of the BlueOval SK plant in Tennessee, a facility central to the battery cell production for electric vehicles. Meanwhile, Ford will independently manage the factory situated in Kentucky, maintaining its stake in battery manufacturing but under solitary control rather than partnership.

Why This Matters — From Manufacturing to Logistics

This reorganization isn’t just about ownership; it reverberates through the wider supply chain and logistics sectors. With each party steering their operations solo, decisions on shipment routes, inventory management, and supplier relationships might adapt to best suit individual priorities. This could lead to increased efficiency on one hand, but also possibly more complexity when coordinating alongside other supply chain components.

Implications for Supply Chain and Freight Management

Battery production plants are high-stakes operations involving substantial freight and logistics management. Moving raw materials into the factories, dispatching finished battery packs, and synchronizing delivery schedules with automotive assembly plants requires a finely tuned logistical framework. With Ford and SK Innovation opting to control separate plants outright, the coordination of freight transport and distribution logistics will likely undergo adjustments tailored to each company’s objectives.

From a logistics perspective, this separation presents both challenges and opportunities:

Streamlined Decision-Making: Each company can optimize supply routes and inventory handling without negotiating joint decisions.

Customized Freight Solutions: Tailored transport agreements can enhance delivery reliability and cost management.

Potential for Redundancy: Redundant logistics efforts may arise if coordination between plants and supply chain nodes diminishes.

Plant Location Control Main Focus Impact on Logistics Tennessee (BlueOval SK plant) SK Innovation Battery cell production Focused freight routes and inbound materials tailored to SK’s supply chain Kentucky plant Ford Motor Co. Battery manufacturing Independent logistics planning aligned with Ford’s vehicle assembly supply chains

How This Affects the Electric Vehicle Market

Electric vehicles depend heavily on reliable and efficient battery production. By splitting their venture, both Ford and SK Innovation are positioning themselves to focus on slightly different strategic priorities. This could accelerate their respective abilities to innovate and customize battery technologies tailored explicitly for their customers or partners. However, the fragmented manufacturing may introduce variations in delivery schedules for battery packs and components, which logistics managers in vehicle assembly plants and distribution networks will need to accommodate.

The Road Ahead for Logistics in Electric Vehicle Production

Green energy-focused logistics specialists will find that adapting to these changes is crucial. The evolution of supply chains around battery manufacturing necessitates flexible freight solutions, from handling bulk raw materials to shipping finished goods. The reorganization influences not only local transport but international freight forwarding, especially where components cross borders en route to assembly.

Hundreds of thousands of pounds is to be made available to homeowners who rent their properties to construction workers on the new Sizewell C nuclear plant.

The Government's £12m Housing Grant Scheme was launched to increase the amount of accommodation available to contractors working on the site, near Leiston in Suffolk.

Anyone who owns a property, or has a spare room, annexe, or garage which could be converted to a ""lettable standard"" can apply for funding.

A Freedom of Information request revealed between November 2024 and November 2025, East Suffolk Council - which is delivering the scheme - paid £157,567 in grants and committed to paying grants worth £405,850.

'Mitigating'

The data showed 32 grants had already been paid with 19 new bed spaces ""delivered"".

Inspections take place before the grants are handed over, and again when work is finished - with six completed so far.

""The fund's purpose is to help maintain balance and stability in the local housing market by mitigating the impacts associated with Sizewell C's development,"" a council spokesperson said.

""The grants not only increase housing availability and support the local economy but also improve the energy performance of homes.

""The initiative ensures our communities benefit from the Sizewell C project while improving and maintaining high standards of housing and sustainability.""

Applicants can choose between three different grants: the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) grant, the minor works grant, and the renovation grant.

The EPC grant pays up to £2,500 to certain homeowners to help them improve their property's energy efficiency, while the minor works grant pays up to £3,000 per room.

The renovation grant is worth up to £7,000 per bed space and is designed to help convert properties into licensable standard houses in multiple occupation. (HMOs)

The money is handed over once all works have been completed and properties must remain available to workers for a minimum of five to 10 years, depending on the grant.

Sizewell C - a new £38bn two-reactor nuclear power station - is expected to be operational in the mid to late 2030s.

It will generate 3.2 gigawatts of electricity and will reportedly power the equivalent of about six million homes and generate electricity for 60 years.

At the construction's height, the project will require the expertise and labour of 7,900 workers, with about 4,000 coming from the local area.

More than 500 of them can use on-site accommodation at the former Pontins site in Pakefield, which Sizewell C took over last year, while the rest will be using private accommodation.

'Just a nightmare'

Michael Sinclair, from Leiston, is one of the many property owners trying to make the most of the influx of workers.

The 43-year-old, who owns and rents out properties, has just purchased an empty three-bedroom semi-detached house in the town for £235,000.

Providing his applications for £38,000 of grants are approved, he plans to convert it into a four-bedroom home for Sizewell workers.

He then hopes to charge as much as £3,500-a-month for the rental of the entire home and bills – whether there is one worker living in it, or four.

""I live in Leiston and everything's sort of been chucked at us with Sizewell C and it's just a nightmare, this place,"" he said.

""So, I just think I might as well capitalise on it and make the most of it, rather than dwell on it. The grants are there, so it just seems silly not to do it.""

Last year residents told the BBC they feared being priced out of Leiston after the rent on some homes doubled to month than £3,000 a month.

Some people in the town claimed landlords were ""cashing in"" on the increased demand for accommodation.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b7b2/live/20a04af0-3cad-11f0-af00-f94ff1cabcc0.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 04:00:03.259371

Thermal electricity, generated mostly by coal-fired capacity with a small amount from natural gas, fell 1% in 2025 to 6.29 trillion kilowatt-hours (kWh), according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

It fell more sharply in December, down by 3.2%, from a year earlier, the data showed.

The data reflects output from industrial enterprises with annual revenue of more than 20 million yuan ($2.87 million).

The National Energy Administration announced on Saturday that China's electricity consumption had climbed 5% to a record high, surpassing 10 trillion kWh for the first time.

That was more than the combined consumption of the European Union, Russia, India and Japan in 2024, driven by rapid consumption growth in internet and related services and EV manufacturing.

The NEA statistics offer a fuller picture of power use than the NBS data, which omits some smaller-scale renewables generation, particularly from solar. The NBS statistics showed power generation reached 9.72 trillion kWh last year, up 2.2% compared with 2024.

Tesla equipped its Shanghai plant to export to Canada in 2023

China auto exports stopped after Canada imposed a 100% tariff

China-made cars now face only a 6.1% tariff after US-Canada deal

BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab is poised to be one of the first automakers to benefit from Canada's move to remove 100% tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, thanks to its early efforts to ship cars from its Shanghai plant there and its established Canadian sales network, experts say.

Under the deal announced last Friday, Canada will allow up to 49,000 vehicles to be imported annually from China with a tariff of 6.1% on most-favoured nation terms. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the quota could rise to reach 70,000 vehicles within five years.

Stay up to date with the latest news, trends and innovations that are driving the global automotive industry with the Reuters Auto File newsletter. Sign up here.

However, under one clause in the agreement, half of the quota will be reserved for vehicles under 35,000 CAD ($25,189). Tesla model prices are all above that number.

While many Chinese automakers will be keen to seize the opportunity as they expand exports, Tesla has an advantage as it in 2023 already equipped its Shanghai plant, its biggest and most cost-efficient factory globally, to build and export a Canada-specific version of its Model Y.

The U.S. automaker had that same year started shipping the car from Shanghai to Canada, boosting Canadian imports of automobiles from China to its largest port, Vancouver, by 460% year over year to 44,356 in 2023.

But it was forced to stop in 2024 and switched to shipping from its U.S. and Berlin factories after Ottawa imposed 100% tariffs, citing a wish to counter what they called China's intentional state-directed policy of overcapacity.

Now, it ships Model Ys produced in Berlin to Canada, but more variants such as cheaper Model 3s are mostly built in China.

""This new agreement could allow resumption of those exports rather quickly,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of research firm AutoForecast Solutions.

Tesla has an existing network of 39 stores in Canada, whereas Chinese rivals such as BYD (002594.SZ), opens new tab and Nio (9866.HK), opens new tab do not yet have a sales presence there, and it can also likely move faster with marketing plans as it only has four core models, far fewer than its Chinese competitors.

""Tesla indeed has an advantage with its offering of a few models, versions and simple production lines so that it can be flexible to sell cars produced in any country in any markets to achieve the best cost efficiency,"" said Yale Zhang, managing director at Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.

Other brands that exported cars made in China to Canada before the tariffs included Volvo (VOLVb.ST), opens new tab and Polestar, which are both owned by China's automaking group Geely (GEELY.UL).

Volvo and Polestar also did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHINESE EV BRANDS

However, the clause on price will likely give Chinese brands some breathing room.

""The beneficiaries are likely to be Chinese automakers and the Canadian customers looking for an entry-level vehicle,"" Fiorani said.

John Zeng, head of market forecast for China at London-based consultancy GlobalData, said that the quota also would likely offer Chinese carmakers an opportunity to test the waters in Canada where there's a large population of Chinese Canadians.

Canada wants to look at joint ventures and investments with Chinese companies within the next three years to build a Canadian electric vehicle with Chinese knowledge, the public broadcaster CBC reported, citing a senior Canadian official.

China's top EV maker BYD currently has an electric bus assembly plant in Ontario, Canada.

Trump administration officials have criticized Canada's decision. The former Biden administration quadrupled tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100% in 2024 too, all but blocking such exports to the United States.

In 2024, former President Joe Biden set a 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars.","Canada's recent agreement to cut tariffs on electric vehicles, for concessions on Canadian farm products, is set to significantly boost Chinese automakers' global expansion. This offers easier entry into the North American market for Beijing's rapidly growing automotive sector.

Chinese manufacturers have been making global inroads with their high-tech, stylish, and affordable EVs. Experts suggest this Canadian access could accelerate their drive to dominate the global market, as their domestic market weakens, threatening other auto manufacturers, particularly American companies.

Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, observed: ""This is telling us that Chinese automakers continue to be really popular, and are doing better and better, and not just something that’s sold in global markets that are more marginal or less important to U.S. automakers.""

What makes Chinese vehicles stand out?

Chinese-made vehicles are high-quality, stylish and inexpensive, experts say.

“It’s clear that the vehicles made by Chinese brands come at a very competitive cost, but are also technologically quite desirable,” Mazzocco said. “They tend to be connected vehicles, so they have a lot of additional software capabilities that consumers seem to like. But the price point and the competitiveness are really big selling points.”

These vehicles can cost as little as $10,000 to $20,000; in the U.S., new vehicles are running close to $50,000 on average, and EVs even more so.

Chinese companies also have unique advantages as far as auto manufacturing and production, efficiency and making vehicles lighter, which helps extend an electrified vehicle's driving range.

“They’ve found a way to make small and mid-sized cars — cars that people want — at a reasonable price,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. ""These are the segments where GM and Ford and almost everybody else have abandoned.”

Many automakers have discontinued smaller vehicles in favor of higher-margin, large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that are far more profitable.

Why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?

Much of the global auto market is electrifying, an ideal opportunity for advanced Chinese automakers to capitalize on. China saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles in 2025, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week, and Europe saw a 33% increase.

Meanwhile, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year. As the rest of the world advances, U.S. automakers have weakened their once-ambitious, multibillion dollar electrification plans, instead opting for more efficient hybrid electric and gasoline vehicles amid the Trump administration's shift away from EV-friendly policy.

That shift threatens U.S. automakers’ competitive edge in the coming years. As is, Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker last year, delivering only 1.64 million vehicles in 2025 to Chinese rival BYD’s 2.26 million.

Trump administration policy slashing emissions rules at a time when Chinese companies are advancing quickly has experts worried for the future of American car manufacturers.

Chinese automakers will have to meet standards required for the Canadian auto market for the latest trade arrangement to be successful — standards that are similar to those in the U.S. — which is likely to incentivize Chinese auto manufacturing investment in Canada.

They'll also have to establish which segment of the market they are targeting there: Higher-end vehicles, or less-expensive ones that sell at higher volumes.

Regardless, “It brings it home to what is needed to compete globally,” said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at AlixPartners. The firm predicts Chinese brands will account for 30% of the global market by 2030.

“They’ve already started in Europe. They started in South America. Now Mexico and Canada,"" Wakefield said. American carmakers ""don’t want to end up as a Brazil with your ethanol-based cars that aren’t sellable anywhere else in the world and ... like Britain or Australia that used to matter in the auto world, and no longer really matter.”

Why have others sought to regulate Chinese EV-makers’ expansion?

Countries have attempted to regulate Chinese EVs from entering their markets for several reasons.

“China has become this overwhelming machine making inexpensive vehicles. And the fear is that if you give them an inch, they’re going to take a mile,” Fiorani said. “The other issue is technology. These vehicles are data centers... and the idea that a state-owned company in China could have access to where a high portion of drivers are going gives them leverage for all kinds of outlets.”

In remarks at the Toledo Assembly Complex in Toledo, Ohio on Friday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Chinese Communist Party invests in its auto industry to “control this industry.”

“Why? They want to take over the auto industry. They want to take away these jobs,” Duffy said. As far as the Canadian trade deal, he added: “They will live to regret the day they partner with China and bring in their vehicles.”

The European Union hiked tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, though the two have been resolving that at the start of this year.

In 2024, former President Joe Biden set a 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars. Canada matched that import tax on the vehicles until this week. And even with an annual import cap, Canada cutting its tariffs this week means those companies are another step closer to U.S. soil. The Mexican auto market has welcomed Chinese EVs, with massive growth last year.

“The advance of Chinese manufacturers is inevitable. It will happen eventually. Everybody is negotiating to put up the roadblocks to figure out: What data is being processed, how much market share you’re going to allow Chinese manufacturers to have?"" Fiorani added.

""There are a lot of guardrails that have to be put up, but eventually they’re going to make their way into all Western markets.”",https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/16/21/China-Canada-Electric_Vehicles_17882.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2026-01-19 02:57:56.181932

And twice, Indiana took aerial photographs of sellout crowds clad in red — when the Buckeyes came to town.
There’s no question about it.’” Investing in success Perhaps the greatest impediment to success was the perception Indiana wasn’t fully invested in football.
According to the Knight-Newhouse database, Indiana’s football budget has increased from $24 million in 2021 to more than $61 million last year.
Now they’re one win away from a title nobody saw coming, except perhaps Dolson and Cignetti.","Long before Angelo Pizzo penned the scripts for two of America’s most iconic sports movies, he and his father would make the one-block walk from their home to Indiana’s football stadium.

The strolls home usually seemed to take a bit longer because even then, in 1955, losses were the norm. Eventually, the man who introduced the world to such motivational flicks as “Hoosiers” and “Rudy” accepted the reality Indiana’s program may be permanently stuck in mediocrity — or worse.

Pizzo found himself in good company in these parts.

Seventy-one years later, he — like so many other long-suffering Indiana fans — has a new perspective. Suddenly, the Bloomington native is bursting with excitement, enthusiasm, even a sense of disbelief as the Hoosiers have gone 26-2 over the past two seasons and he’s now heading to Miami to watch his beloved alma mater try to pull off a “Hoosiers”-like ending by beating the 10th-ranked Hurricanes on their home field for the program’s first national championship.

“One of my first memories, talk about being in my DNA, was we always lost,” Pizzo told The Associated Press this week. “That’s kind of like, except for a couple blips along the way — certainly the (1968) Rose Bowl team, I was in school there and the boys Jade Butcher, John Isenbarger, Harry Gonso were all good friends of mine — so that was a great adventure. I thought we’d turned the corner and then it went back down. It returned to what was normal and we went back to losing.”

Storybook turnaround

Curt Cignetti promised to change Indiana’s image from the moment he took the job five days after the end of the 2023 season. The no-nonsense 62-year-old coach neither minced words nor wasted them when asked at his first news conference why people should believe he’d end all this losing.

“I win. Google me,” he famously boasted that day.

It was a brash, bold statement from someone tasked with fixing a program that hadn’t won a bowl game since 1991, an outright conference title since 1945 and carried the banner of losingest major college team in the country.

Rather than tamp down the expectations, though, Cignetti doubled down at a basketball game.

“Purdue sucks, but so does Ohio State and Michigan,” Cignetti said to roaring cheers.

Pizzo and other fans were understandably skeptical.

For decades, they’d seen hopeful coaches come promising big turnarounds only to depart when they failed to achieve such lofty goals in front of half-filled stadiums.

How bad was it?

When coach John Pont had the Hoosiers fighting for Big Ten crowns in the 1960s, fans enjoyed chanting “Punt, John, Punt.” In 1976, then-coach Lee Corso called timeout in the second quarter to snap a photo of the scoreboard with Indiana leading Ohio State 7-6. They lost 47-7.

In the 1990s and 2000s, some tailgaters never made it inside the stadium, which prompted coaches to rally students to show up. And twice, Indiana took aerial photographs of sellout crowds clad in red — when the Buckeyes came to town.

On the field, it was equally abysmal.

In addition to the 713 all-time losses Cignetti inherited, the Hoosiers also had lost five of its previous six against dreaded rival Purdue and was 9-18 since 1997 against the Boilermakers. Plus, they had only one win over the Wolverines since 1988 and none over the Buckeyes since 1989 — the longest active skid against one team in the Football Bowl Subdivision.

Athletic director Scott Dolson had a different vision for the program, one Cignetti shared.

“I remember even during our first conversation, I said to him, ‘Curt, do you really believe you can win here?’” Dolson told the AP. “He just said, ‘Scott, if I have average resources, I’m 100% sure I will win here. There’s no question about it.’”

Investing in success

Perhaps the greatest impediment to success was the perception Indiana wasn’t fully invested in football. Salaries for head coaches consistently lagged near the bottom of the Big Ten and each new coach seemed to be fighting to get their assistants paid, too.

The change began when former athletic director Fred Glass started upgrading facilities. But when NIL money and the transfer portal changed the college football world, Indiana didn’t adapt quickly and the delay led, in part, to the firing of coach Tom Allen in 2023.

According to the Knight-Newhouse database, Indiana’s football budget has increased from $24 million in 2021 to more than $61 million last year.

Allen, who grew up in Indiana and whose father was a longtime high school coach in the state, landed at Penn State as defensive coordinator in 2024 and then took the same job at Clemson last season. Today, he’s impressed with the results — and the commitments.

“Just really, really happy for those guys and just really, really happy they’ve chosen to invest in football,” Allen said in December. “That’s something they know they needed to do. They had not done that in the past to the level necessary, and it’s been awesome to see them recognize that and invest and be able to be rewarded for that.”

Honestly, though, Indiana didn’t have a choice.

Schools need football revenue to make athletic departments function. So empty seats, even at a basketball, can be costly.

But winning has helped Indiana strike gold.

School attendance and admission applications are both up. So are donations, which includes a significant contribution from billionaire Mark Cuban, an alum. In addition to shedding the label of America’s losingest team in November, it also surpassed Penn State in October for the nation’s largest living alumni base. And over the past two seasons, Memorial Stadium has drawn eight of the largest 10 crowds in school history.

So Dolson isn’t about to let Cignetti — or his key staff members — get away if he can help it.

Cignetti has earned contract extensions each of the past two seasons, pushing his average annual salary to $11.6 million, No. 3 in the nation. Bryant Haines and Mike Shanahan also have received contract extensions pushing their salaries to upwards of $3 million per year.

Indiana fans will tell you they’re worth every penny. Yet Dolson believes it’s not just about cash.

“He didn’t come in with demands, like saying ‘Hey, I’d only come here if I get this, that and the other.’ We laid out, ‘This is what our commitments are, this is what our plan is,’” Dolson said of Cignetti. “One of the misnomers out there is that it’s not just a spending contest. It’s more of having a comprehensive strategic plan for football and that’s what we really put together.”

Cignature style

Sure, Cignetti came to Indiana with a resume and a track record. He also brought most of his previous coaches and about two dozen James Madison players, too.

Why? They believed in the man and his principles.

“Coach Cig just does such a great job of bringing out the best in his players, and obviously his coaches as well,” said All-American linebacker Aiden Fisher, one of the followers from JMU. “But there’s something about coach Cig that just makes you want to play your heart out for him and he does a great job getting the best out of everybody.”

It explains how he’s taken self-proclaimed “misfit” recruits on the wildest journey of their lives.

Cignetti seemed to be built for this job.

He grew up learning the craft from his father, Frank Sr., a Hall of Fame coach at the Division II level. He spent more than two decades evaluating and developing players before he joined Nick Saban’s staff at Alabama in 2007, where he served as the recruiting coordinator for Saban’s first title team.

Somewhere along the way, though, Cignetti developed his own style — the short, punchy phrases, the quick quips and the unchanging facial expression that have created their own internet memes.

But Dolson was interested in Cignetti for other reasons.

He liked the notion of who Cignetti could bring with him and Dolson detected some similarities between Cignetti and another title-winning coach at Indiana, the late Bob Knight.

“Certainly, different personalities, but similarities in terms of their commitment to their blueprint, their plan, the focus on details and just the mental approach to competitive success,” Dolson said. “I feel like there’s an elite approach to that. I definitely see the way coach Cig runs things, the way he coaches, there are a lot of similarities.”

Movie time

Pizzo’s phone started ringing repeatedly almost from the moment Cignetti responded to a post-Rose Bowl game question about Indiana’s remarkable ascension.

“It would make a hell of a movie,” he cracked.

Perhaps no filmmaker understands the Cinderella story better than Pizzo, who introduced the world to his home state’s 1954 Milan Miracle team and captivated the nation by turning a previously little-known walk-on at Notre Dame into a recognizable star.

But Pizzo has no plans to make “Hoosiers 2.” He thinks the story of Indiana’s two-year football run needs to marinate for a decade or two, like his other two box office hits.

Besides, Pizzo has turned into a full-throttle believer, even suggesting the final chapter of this incredible run may not come Monday night.

“Last season was the season of a lifetime, to get into the College Football Playoff. But I thought we had hit our ceiling because we were going up against teams like Ohio State and Notre Dame that had more four- and five-star talent and NFL players than we did,” he said. “I’m not going to even think about Miami. I think we should win, but again, you know, it’s just too good to be true.”

Yes, the Hoosiers have exorcised their demons.

They’ve won two straight against the Boilermakers. They’ve beaten Michigan and Ohio State. They’ve won the Big Ten title and the Rose Bowl. They have a Heisman Trophy winner, quarterback Fernando Mendoza.

Now they’re one win away from a title nobody saw coming, except perhaps Dolson and Cignetti.

“Everything he said in his interview, everything he articulated in his blueprint is the same as you see today,” Dolson said. “In fact, everything he said during the interview has come true.”",https://wpcdn.us-east-1.vip.tn-cloud.net/www.wxxv25.com/content/uploads/2026/01/u/y/indiana.png,N,,2026-01-19 02:58:22.682677

China now generates more electricity each year than the United States and the European Union combined.
The United States is far behind this competition.
Electrification demands engagement with the messy world of building power plants and manufacturing at scale, which are China’s strengths.","President Trump has an unconcealed hunger for natural resources from abroad and the power they could grant him. He declared that the United States intervened in Venezuela to “take the oil,” betting that investors would put up at least $100 billion to revive a decrepit industry. His gamble is that countries will still want to buy oil from America to power their cars, trucks, ships and planes for decades to come.

Though China is the world’s largest oil importer, its leader, Xi Jinping, is less brash about coveting foreign resources. The country’s leadership is pushing intensively at substituting electricity for oil.

Chinese technology companies are paving the way for a world that will be powered by electric motors rather than gas-guzzling engines. It is a decisively 21st-century approach not just to solve its own energy problems, but also to sell batteries and other electric products to everyone else. Canada is its newest buyer of EVs; in a rebuke of Mr. Trump, its prime minister, Mark Carney, lowered tariffs on the cars as part of a new trade deal.

Though Americans have been slow to embrace electric vehicles, Chinese households have learned to love them. In 2025, 54 percent of new cars sold in China were either battery-powered or plug-in hybrids. That is a big reason that the country’s oil consumption is on track to peak in 2027, according to forecasts from the International Energy Agency. And Chinese E.V makers are setting records — whether it’s BYD’s sales (besting Tesla by battery-powered vehicles sold for the first time last year) or Xiaomi’s speed (its cars are setting records at major racetracks like Nürburgring in Germany).

These vehicles are powered not by oil but by domestically generated electrical power that comes from coal, nuclear, hydropower, solar and wind.

In 2000, China produced only one-third of the amount of electrical power that the United States did; by 2024, it produced nearly two and a half times U.S. levels. China’s surging energy investments went substantially into building new plants for burning coal, which the country possesses in abundance. But over the past decade, it has also moved fast on building cleaner energy sources, especially wind and solar.

China now generates more electricity each year than the United States and the European Union combined. It has close to 40 new nuclear power reactors under construction, compared with zero in America. Last year, Beijing announced work on a new hydropower dam in Tibet that will have triple the capacity of China’s Three Gorges Dam, currently the world’s largest power station.

China isn’t just building gigantic amounts of power; its businesses are reshaping technological foundations to electrify the world.

China spent decades trying to build world-leading automotive champions; the results were not impressive until E.V.s arrived. Their adoption allowed Chinese automakers to stop trying to beat the Germans at building better combustion engines and leverage their greater expertise in electronics instead. If an E.V. is a smartphone with tires, then it makes sense that the country that makes most of the world’s electronics would also make nearly half of its cars.

Several technologies had to mature before they could be electrified. The lithium-ion battery was invented by American and Japanese scientists before Chinese companies took over most of this industry in the 2010s. The United States also used to dominate the production of rare-earth magnets, the crucial product in electric motors; China makes more than 90 percent of these magnets today. In addition to batteries and magnets, the writer Noah Smith identifies power electronics and embedded chips as the main drivers of the new electric age.

The oil-burning products that can now instead be powered by batteries and electric motors include not only cars, but also bikes, buses and even some boats. Heavy industry and temperature control for buildings are being electrified, too. And a future in which many noisy, gas-powered household tools can be electrically powered is in reach: Even the foul and loud lawn mower and leaf blower are gradually being replaced by a more gentle thrum.

Some products may never be electrified. Battery packs will probably not power a long-haul flight or container ship (though cleaner fuels are possible). But the opportunity to electrify almost everything else will grow over the next decade, and China is leading the charge.

The southern city of Shenzhen, which has been producing Apple products for two decades now, is leveraging its expertise in electronics — as well as more advanced batteries, magnets and chips — to remake whole categories of transportation and household and industrial products into the image of the smartphone. As the world moves on from combustion engines and into batteries, it will be looking away from oil producers and toward factories in Shenzhen.

The United States is far behind this competition. On the one hand, Elon Musk has done more than anyone else to raise the status of electric vehicles and create their associated technological improvements. But the broader U.S. industrial base has mostly shed its capabilities in batteries and rare-earth magnets, in part out of a deliberate effort to move these factories to China. American companies building drones or other products of the new electric age are also far behind their Chinese competitors.

Electrification demands engagement with the messy world of building power plants and manufacturing at scale, which are China’s strengths. But Silicon Valley has instead preferred to work in the realm of highly profitable digital businesses. Technologists like Sam D’Amico (who is making a high-powered electric-induction stove) and Ryan McEntush (a venture capital investor) have lately sounded the alarm at how comprehensively ahead Chinese capabilities have become.

The United States could compete on building better drones and electric vehicles if its businesses had greater access to electrical power and a vital industrial base. But it is governed by a president who is enthusiastic about powering the future with fossil fuels and has a personal pique against wind turbines, calling them the “SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” His administration is slow-walking approval of and canceling new solar and wind projects while favoring coal and gas — which makes it more difficult to electrify. No product is more important than batteries in electrification, yet an infamous ICE raid targeted a Korean company that was constructing a battery factory in Georgia. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump’s tariffs have hamstrung American manufacturing, which has lost around 70,000 jobs since April.

America had better shape up before losing out to an electric age ushered in by Beijing. Otherwise, it will be stuck with outmoded products at home while China conquers markets through better technology.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/opinion/16wang/16wang-facebookJumbo-v4.png,N,,2026-01-19 01:59:30.182358

The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission on Thursday, Jan. 15, unanimously approved a site permit for the Duluth-based utility's $163.5 million, 85-megawatt solar project adjacent to its Boswell Energy Center in Cohasset. The project will also include a new substation and a nearly 3-mile, 230-kilovolt transmission line linking it to the existing substation at Boswell.

Solar panels are expected to cover about 500 acres of land, approximately half of which is owned by Minnesota Power, with the other half leased from other property owners.

""We're excited to get the permits and get the authorization to get to work on that when the snow melts,"" said Julie Pierce, vice president of strategy and planning at Minnesota Power.

Carrie Ryan, enterprise project manager, said work on the project will begin this spring, with the array coming online in fall 2027.

The company's larger, 800-acre, 119-megawatt project in Royalton, which is also permitted, has a similar construction timeline.

When complete, the two solar projects will be the company's largest, surpassing its 15-megawatt Sylvan solar project near Brainerd, which came online in 2023.

The Boswell and Royalton projects represent more than two-thirds of the 300 megawatts of solar Minnesota Power announced in 2022 as part of an agreement with clean energy organizations weighing in on the company's required integrated resource plan, which outlines the next 15 years of expected energy sources and demands.

The nearly 100 remaining megawatts will come through ""an exciting distributed solar energy standard that we are working on meeting,"" Pierce said. The specifics are still being worked out, company officials said.

Between 50% and 60% of the company's energy now comes from renewable sources. State law requires utilities produce all electricity with carbon-free sources by 2040.

Boswell is home to Minnesota Power's last two coal-fired power plants, which are scheduled to retire by 2030 and 2035, and are significant sources of tax revenue to Cohasset and Itasca County.

About Sichuan Mondes Green Technology Co., Ltd. Sichuan Mondes Green Technology Co., Ltd. is a specialized manufacturer and technology solutions provider focused on the renewable energy sector.","CHENGDU, SICHUAN, CHINA, January 19, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — While headlines consistently celebrate the soaring installations of solar panels and the majestic rise of wind turbines, a quieter, equally critical revolution is unfolding within the renewable energy sector. This revolution is not about generation, but about integration and stability—a challenge being met by specialized manufacturers of essential infrastructure. Among these pivotal players, companies like Sichuan Mondes Green Technology Co., Ltd. are emerging as unsung architects of the energy transition, providing the vital components, such as advanced Gas Storage Tanks and Biogas Storage Tanks, that enable the practical and efficient use of renewable gases.

The global energy landscape is undergoing a profound transformation. As nations strive to meet ambitious decarbonization targets, the focus has expanded beyond mere electricity generation to encompass the entire energy ecosystem. The intermittent nature of sources like wind and solar has laid bare the urgent need for reliable storage and flexible grid solutions. In this context, renewable gases—biomethane from organic waste and the promising frontier of green hydrogen—have ascended to strategic importance. They represent not just clean fuel, but a form of long-duration energy storage, capable of powering industries, heating homes, and generating electricity when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow.

However, the potential of these renewable gases is intrinsically linked to a fundamental engineering challenge: safe, large-scale, and cost-effective storage. This is the niche where specialized manufacturing expertise becomes indispensable. The storage of biogas, a corrosive mixture of methane, carbon dioxide, and trace elements like hydrogen sulfide, demands robust solutions. Modern Biogas Storage Tanks are feats of material science and design, often utilizing high-strength, flexible geomembranes or specially coated steels that resist corrosion and maintain integrity over decades. These are not passive containers; they are active, managed systems crucial for stabilizing the anaerobic digestion process, balancing supply with demand, and ensuring a continuous flow of energy.

The economic and operational viability of any biogas project hinges on this critical component. A well-engineered storage system acts as a buffer, allowing for the efficient scheduling of electricity generation and enabling the upgrading of raw biogas to pure biomethane for injection into gas grids or use as vehicle fuel. By maximizing uptime and output, manufacturers of this infrastructure directly contribute to improving the return on investment for project developers, making renewable energy projects more bankable and scalable. Their work underpins the business case for converting agricultural waste, landfill emissions, and sewage into valuable, clean energy.

The innovation driving this sector extends beyond corrosion resistance. Leading manufacturers are integrating smart monitoring technologies directly into their storage solutions. Sensors that provide real-time data on gas volume, pressure, and composition allow for unprecedented control and optimization of the entire gas production and utilization chain. This digital layer transforms a simple storage tank into an intelligent node within a smarter energy network, enhancing safety, predictive maintenance, and overall system efficiency. Furthermore, the development of flexible, double-membrane gas holders offers significant advantages in weight, installation speed, and cost over traditional rigid steel tanks, particularly for large-scale applications.

The market dynamics for these specialized solutions reflect a truly global energy transition. While Europe and North America lead in technological adoption and strict emissions standards, the vast potential for biogas development in Asia, South America, and Africa presents a significant growth frontier. Here, the ability to provide adaptable, durable, and locally serviceable storage technology is key to unlocking sustainable waste management and energy access. Manufacturers capable of operating on this global stage are not just exporting products; they are facilitating knowledge transfer and enabling climate action in diverse economic and geographical contexts.

Looking ahead, the strategic role of these manufacturers is set to expand into the nascent hydrogen economy. The techniques, safety protocols, and material sciences honed in the production of Biogas Storage Tanks provide a formidable foundation for addressing the unique challenges of storing lightweight, high-energy-density hydrogen. Companies with deep expertise in gas containment are therefore naturally positioned to be key enablers in the next wave of the clean energy revolution, bridging today’s biogas solutions with tomorrow’s hydrogen infrastructure.

In essence, the journey to a resilient, fully renewable energy system is a complex puzzle. While flashy technologies capture the public imagination, it is the robust, reliably manufactured components—the tanks, the seals, the sensors—that securely hold the pieces together.

The transition to electric mobility has exposed significant weaknesses in global supply chains, particularly for specialized battery materials that require precise technical specifications and reliable sourcing partnerships. Furthermore, the importance of critical minerals energy security has become increasingly evident as manufacturers struggle with dependency on concentrated supply sources. Manufacturing facilities capable of producing automotive-grade graphite outside China remain scarce, creating strategic bottlenecks that can disrupt entire production schedules. Understanding these supply chain dynamics reveals broader patterns of dependency and risk management challenges facing the electric vehicle industry.

Tesla's ongoing supply agreement modifications with Syrah Resources demonstrate how technical compliance issues can cascade through complex manufacturing networks. The extended timeline for resolving quality specifications highlights the intricate nature of battery material production and the narrow margins for error in automotive applications.

Understanding Graphite's Strategic Role in Battery Performance

Natural graphite serves as the primary component in lithium-ion battery anodes, comprising approximately 95% of the anode material by weight. The material's crystalline structure allows lithium ions to intercalate during charging cycles, making it essential for energy storage capacity and charging performance. In addition, establishing a battery-grade lithium refinery alongside graphite processing capabilities represents a crucial step towards supply chain independence. Battery-grade graphite requires exceptional purity levels and specific particle size distributions that differ significantly from industrial applications.

Technical Requirements for Automotive Applications

Electric vehicle batteries demand graphite materials that meet stringent specifications for:

• Purity levels exceeding 99.95% carbon content

• Particle size consistency within narrow tolerances for optimal ion flow

• Surface area optimization to maximize lithium intercalation capacity

• Chemical stability under repeated charge-discharge cycles

• Low impurity content to prevent battery degradation

The processing requirements for achieving these specifications involve multiple purification stages, including flotation, acid leaching, and high-temperature treatment. Each step must maintain precise control parameters to ensure the final product meets automotive certification standards.

Supply Chain Concentration Risks

China currently dominates global graphite processing capabilities, controlling an estimated 70% of natural graphite production and over 80% of spherical graphite manufacturing for battery applications. This concentration creates strategic vulnerabilities for Western automakers seeking supply chain resilience.

The Syrah Tesla graphite supply deal represents a critical attempt to establish non-Chinese sourcing alternatives. Consequently, developing a comprehensive critical minerals strategy becomes essential for securing long-term supply chains. Syrah's 8,000 metric ton annual commitment under their 2021 agreement would provide Tesla with a dedicated supply stream from the Vidalia facility in Louisiana, the only vertically integrated large-scale anode material producer outside China.

Analyzing Production Challenges at Vidalia Operations

Vertical Integration Complexities

The Vidalia facility attempts to control the entire value chain from raw graphite processing to finished anode material production. This vertical integration approach offers supply security advantages but introduces operational complexities across multiple processing stages.

The facility must coordinate:

• Raw material quality control from Madagascar mining operations

• Multi-stage purification processes

• Spherical graphite shaping and coating

• Final anode material certification and packaging

Each processing step requires specialised equipment, technical expertise, and quality assurance protocols that can create bottlenecks when scaling to commercial volumes.

Timeline of Compliance Challenges

The extended deadline negotiations reveal the technical difficulties in meeting automotive specifications:

Timeline Milestone Status July 2025 Initial default notice issued Quality compliance failure identified September 2025 First cure deadline Extension granted November 2025 Second deadline Further extension required January 2026 Third deadline Additional extension to March 16 February 2026 Tesla termination threshold Critical compliance checkpoint

The repeated extensions indicate ongoing technical challenges rather than simple production delays. Tesla's February 9, 2026 termination threshold for technical specification compliance suggests the automaker maintains strict quality standards that cannot be compromised for supply security.

Quality Assurance Protocols

Automotive-grade anode material testing involves comprehensive evaluation of:

• Electrochemical performance under simulated battery conditions

• Particle morphology using scanning electron microscopy

• Chemical composition through elemental analysis

• Physical properties including tap density and surface area

• Contamination screening for metallic impurities

The collaborative approach mentioned in Syrah's statements suggests both companies are working to identify and resolve specific quality parameters that fall outside Tesla's specifications.

Supply Chain Risk Assessment Framework

Financial Implications of Supply Disruption

Syrah Resources' share price declined 6.6% to A$0.285 following the deadline extension announcement, reaching levels not seen since December 2025. This market reaction reflects investor concerns about the company's ability to execute its strategic positioning as a non-Chinese graphite supplier.

The Tesla supply agreement represents a cornerstone of Syrah's business strategy, providing revenue certainty for their Vidalia operations over the four-year contract period. Loss of this agreement would require the company to identify alternative customers or modify their production approach significantly.

Alternative Sourcing Challenges

Tesla's position during these negotiations demonstrates the limited alternatives available for non-Chinese graphite sourcing. The company has extended deadlines multiple times rather than terminating the agreement, suggesting:

• Limited qualified suppliers capable of meeting technical requirements

• Long qualification timelines for alternative sources

• Strategic importance of establishing non-Chinese supply chains

• Investment protection in supplier development initiatives

Alternative sourcing typically requires 18-24 months for full qualification and certification processes, making immediate substitution difficult for automotive applications. For instance, the development of a European CRM facility demonstrates similar challenges faced by Western manufacturers in establishing independent supply chains.

Department of Energy Oversight

The requirement for U.S. Department of Energy approval for deadline extensions indicates government interest in maintaining domestic graphite processing capabilities. This oversight suggests the agreement may receive support through critical minerals initiatives or supply chain resilience programs.

The DOE's involvement reflects broader national security considerations regarding battery material supply chains and efforts to reduce dependence on Chinese processing capabilities.

Global Market Dynamics and Regulatory Environment

Investment Requirements for Non-Chinese Production

Establishing automotive-grade graphite processing facilities outside China requires substantial capital investment and technical expertise.

""Our Lithium Refinery ushers in energy independence for North America,"" Tesla North America stated, announcing the plant's operational status two years after breaking ground. This refinery is designed to convert spodumene ore directly into battery-grade lithium hydroxide, employing a process that is the first of its kind in North America.

Jason Bevan, Site Manager for Tesla’s Gulf Coast Lithium Refinery, explains that Tesla is using a new technology platform to obtain battery-grade lithium from spodumene ore, describing the process as cleaner, simpler, and cheaper.

Sustainable and Efficient Processes

Tesla sustainably sources spodumene, processing it through conveyance systems, a kiln, and a cooler. The material then undergoes alkaline leeching, purification, and crystallization to yield battery-grade lithium hydroxide.

A refinery employee highlighted the sustainability of the process: ""Our process is more sustainable than traditional methods and eliminates hazardous byproducts and instead produces a co-product named anhydrite used in concrete mixes.""

The refinery ensures access to critical minerals for energy storage, battery manufacturing, and EV growth, according to Tesla.

Impact on Supply Chains and Emissions

This lithium refinery enables Tesla to accelerate its mission by regionalizing supply chains for battery minerals and materials, creating jobs, and reducing emissions from transportation. ""It really allows us to usher in energy independence for North America,"" Tesla adds.

The refinery is a significant step toward reducing America's dependence on China for refined lithium supply. The U.S. has been working to decrease industrial and national security dependence on critical minerals used in battery, defense, military, and automotive technologies.

The Trump Administration previously invested in minority stakes in North American lithium producers and refiners through the Departments of Defense and Energy to secure domestic access to key minerals and create jobs.

Each successful rate case that locks in returns on new investments effectively monetizes pieces of the NiSource product roadmap for shareholders.","The Quiet Utility That’s Becoming a Modern Energy Platform

NiSource Inc. is not the kind of name that trends on social media. It doesn’t sell shiny consumer gadgets or chase speculative AI hype. Instead, it does something far more fundamental: it keeps the lights on and the heat flowing for millions of customers across the American Midwest and Mid-Atlantic. In an era defined by decarbonization mandates, grid instability, and soaring infrastructure costs, NiSource Inc. is trying to turn a traditional regulated utility footprint into a modern energy platform.

As one of the largest fully regulated utility companies in the U.S., NiSource Inc. operates through its portfolio of local brands including Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO), Columbia Gas, and others. The company’s product, in the broadest sense, is reliable, increasingly cleaner energy delivered at regulated rates — but under the hood, this product is being re-architected around renewables, grid automation, and safety-driven gas modernization.

That transformation is now central to how NiSource Inc. positions itself to regulators, investors, and the communities it serves. It’s also starting to show up in the numbers. The company is in the middle of a multi-year capital investment cycle focused on electric grid upgrades, renewable generation build-out, and gas pipe replacement — the kind of slow, compounding infrastructure story that can reshape a regional energy system for decades.

Get all details on NiSource Inc. here

Inside the Flagship: NiSource Inc.

To understand NiSource Inc. as a product, you have to think like an infrastructure strategist rather than a consumer. The company’s core offering breaks into three interlocking pillars: regulated electric service, regulated natural gas distribution, and a long-horizon transition plan that leans into renewables and grid modernization while trying to preserve affordability.

NiSource’s electric operations are centered on NIPSCO in Indiana. Here, the company is executing an aggressive generation transition plan. Over the past several years, NiSource has laid out and begun acting on a strategy to retire coal generation and replace it with a mix of utility-scale solar, wind, and battery storage contracts and projects. Its integrated resource plans forecast a system that is dramatically less carbon intensive this decade, with coal exits paired to a portfolio of renewables that target both reliability and cost predictability.

On the gas side, NiSource’s Columbia Gas utilities span states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, and Maryland. The product here is safe, modern gas delivery infrastructure — and that word ""safe"" is not marketing fluff. After the 2018 Merrimack Valley gas explosions in Massachusetts (a former NiSource territory since divested), safety culture and system modernization have become a defining feature of how the company presents itself and where it allocates capital. Large-scale pipe replacement programs, remote sensing, advanced leak detection technology, and better network segmentation are all part of the ongoing modernization push.

Across both electric and gas, NiSource Inc. is also marketing a quieter layer of innovation: grid and network intelligence. That includes investments in advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), distribution automation, and control systems designed to better manage peak demand, integrate more distributed energy resources, and improve outage response time. Customers experience this as better reliability and more detailed usage information; regulators see it as a platform for future programs like time-of-use rates and demand response.

Underpinning all of this is a long-dated capex story. NiSource has articulated multi-year capital expenditure plans in the multi-billion-dollar range, targeting grid hardening, renewables, and gas system upgrades. Because it is a fully regulated utility, most of these investments are structured to earn regulated returns through rate cases. That dynamic — predictable, regulated returns on a growing asset base — is at the heart of the NiSource Inc. product for investors.

Where NiSource increasingly stands out is in how it pitches its transition. The company positions itself not as a speculative clean-tech play, but as a pragmatic decarbonization utility: retiring coal, ramping renewables, and modernizing gas in a way that tries to keep bills relatively stable and reliability high. In an environment where extreme weather, aging grid assets, and policy pressure collide, that mix of reliability, safety, and decarbonization is NiSource Inc.’s core value proposition.

Market Rivals: NiSource Inc. Aktie vs. The Competition

NiSource Inc. doesn’t compete the way a smartphone maker does, but it absolutely operates in a competitive landscape. Its closest peers are other large, predominantly regulated U.S. utilities with similar transition stories — think companies like CenterPoint Energy and WEC Energy Group, each with their own flavor of the modern utility ""product"".

Compared directly to CenterPoint Energy: CenterPoint Energy offers a hybrid portfolio of electric transmission and distribution, natural gas distribution, and some generation exposure, with service territories in states such as Texas, Indiana, Minnesota, and others. Like NiSource, CenterPoint is leaning into grid modernization and regulated growth. It has articulated a sizable capital plan centered on upgrading electric infrastructure and expanding its gas footprint with safety and reliability programs.

The contrast is in profile and geography. CenterPoint’s exposure to high-growth markets like Texas gives it a growth narrative tied to load expansion, industrial demand, and population inflows. NiSource Inc., by comparison, is more tightly focused on the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic, markets that are slower-growth but heavily industrial and politically attuned to reliability and affordability. Where CenterPoint can frame itself as a growth-and-grid utility tied to booming Sun Belt economies, NiSource positions as a transition-and-modernization platform for more mature markets dealing with aging infrastructure.

On the product side, CenterPoint has pushed outage management, smart grid controls, and advanced metering as differentiated offerings for its territories, sometimes backed by more aggressive use of customer-facing digital tools. NiSource Inc. has moved in the same direction, but its messaging leans more heavily on safety, regulatory collaboration, and multiyear renewables transition plans in Indiana.

Compared directly to WEC Energy Group: WEC Energy Group, headquartered in the Upper Midwest, is one of the closest analogs to NiSource Inc. Its utilities serve customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota, with a portfolio of electric and gas operations and a similarly intense focus on reliability in cold-weather states. WEC has its own large capital plan for grid modernization, renewables additions, and gas modernization, and it markets itself as an efficient, high-quality regulated utility with strong execution.

Where WEC has often enjoyed a premium reputation as an operationally disciplined Midwestern utility, NiSource Inc. historically traded more as a turnaround-plus-transition story — particularly after high-profile gas incidents and subsequent safety overhauls. Compared to WEC Energy Group, NiSource’s ""product"" is now centered on proving that its safety, compliance, and modernization programs can match best-in-class peers while still delivering on decarbonization commitments.

In terms of renewables, WEC Energy Group has used a combination of utility-owned and contracted projects to build its clean energy footprint. NiSource’s NIPSCO strategy is similarly built around a portfolio of owned and contracted solar and wind projects, plus batteries, with a strong emphasis on coal retirement milestones. The difference is that NiSource’s coal exit story is more central to its narrative, because its historical generation mix has been more coal-heavy than some peers. For NiSource Inc., the move to renewables is not a peripheral enhancement — it is the redesign of the core electric product.

How NiSource differentiates in this crowd: While all three utilities talk about modernization, NiSource Inc. puts unusually strong emphasis on three axes: gas safety and modernization, a defined coal retirement roadmap with renewables backfill, and the concept of being a fully regulated portfolio (as opposed to mixing in large merchant or unregulated businesses). Where some peers lean into unregulated clean energy development or transmission plays, NiSource stays close to the regulated-returns model. For risk-averse stakeholders, that is a different kind of competitive proposition.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

In a sector where many players look similar on the surface, NiSource Inc. is trying to carve out a specific edge built around execution, safety, and a defined transition plan. Its competitive strength isn’t in a single breakthrough technology, but in how it combines multiple strategic pieces into a coherent, regulated platform.

1. A clear generation transition story

NiSource’s coal retirement and renewables build-out plan is one of its most important differentiators. Rather than dabbling in clean energy while prolonging legacy coal assets indefinitely, NiSource has mapped out and begun executing on concrete retirement timelines paired with named solar, wind, and storage projects. That clarity matters to regulators, environmental stakeholders, and investors alike.

Because these renewables are predominantly rate-based or supported by long-term contracts, NiSource Inc. can frame them as both climate-responsive and financially disciplined. The product promise here is a decarbonized electric supply that still fits within the traditional regulated utility model — not a speculative merchant-generation bet.

2. Safety-first gas modernization

Many gas utilities are working on pipe replacement and leak reduction, but for NiSource Inc., safety-focused gas modernization is effectively part of its brand. The company has made large-scale capital commitments to replacing aging pipe, improving system design, and deploying advanced inspection technology. Its messaging to regulators and communities centers heavily on preventing incidents, enhancing emergency response, and reducing methane emissions.

That emphasis doesn’t just reduce risk; it also creates a structured, recurring investment program with clear regulatory frameworks. In other words, NiSource has turned safety modernization itself into a long-run product: a predictable pipeline of infrastructure upgrades that improve reliability and safety while earning regulated returns.

3. Fully regulated, long-horizon investment profile

Unlike some peers that blend regulated utilities with unregulated development arms or trading operations, NiSource Inc. positions itself squarely as a fully regulated platform. That means its growth thesis rests on expanding and upgrading its own networks and generation assets, not on competing in merchant markets or volatile wholesale segments.

For customers, that translates into a utility that is oriented around long-term rate stability, incremental modernization, and regulatory oversight. For investors, it means a lower-risk profile with returns driven by rate cases and capital deployment rather than commodity cycles. In a sector where some utilities have stumbled on riskier, non-regulated bets, NiSource’s relatively focused model is part of its competitive edge.

4. Midwest and Mid-Atlantic positioning

NiSource Inc.’s footprint in Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and neighboring states gives it exposure to a region where industrial demand, extreme weather resilience, and political scrutiny over energy affordability are all intense. That can be challenging, but it also creates a strong case for robust investment in the grid and gas infrastructure.

By focusing on reliability, safety, and cost-managed decarbonization, NiSource is aligning its product with exactly what these markets need. Where Sun Belt utilities talk about load growth and electrification, NiSource talks about replacing coal, modernizing gas, and hardening networks against storms and cold snaps — a story that fits the realities of its service areas.

5. Balancing decarbonization with affordability

Behind every utility transition plan is a political question: who pays, and how quickly? NiSource Inc. frames its strategy as one of ""pragmatic decarbonization."" By phasing in renewables, sequencing coal retirements, and structuring gas modernization over many years, the company aims to moderate bill impacts while still reducing emissions and risk.

That balance is its true USP. Rather than selling a vision of instant green transformation or extreme austerity, NiSource is selling time: enough time to replace coal with renewables at scale, modernize gas, and roll out grid intelligence without destabilizing rates. For regulators and customers wary of both climate inaction and bill shocks, that is a powerful proposition.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

NiSource Inc. Aktie (ISIN US65473P1057), trading under the ticker NI on the New York Stock Exchange, reflects this long-horizon, infrastructure-heavy story more than any short-term tech-cycle narrative.

Using real-time financial data as of the latest available trading session, NiSource Inc. Aktie was recently quoted around the mid-$20s per share, based on consolidated data from multiple financial platforms including Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch. Because markets do not trade continuously around the clock, the most reliable reference point is the last closing price, which placed NiSource firmly in the range typical for a mature, yield-focused regulated utility rather than a high-volatility growth stock.

The share price behavior largely mirrors the company’s investment and regulatory cycle. When NiSource Inc. outlines multi-year capital expenditure plans for renewables, grid modernization, and gas infrastructure — accompanied by constructive regulatory outcomes — the stock tends to be viewed as a stable, income-oriented name with a visible growth runway in its rate base. Dividend stability is a key part of that thesis. Investors often treat NiSource Inc. Aktie as an income-generating infrastructure asset with embedded growth, not a speculative trade.

From a valuation perspective, NiSource Inc. typically trades in line with, or at a modest discount to, many of its regulated peers, reflecting both the opportunity of its coal-to-renewables shift and the lingering reputational overhang from past gas incidents. As the company continues to execute on safety upgrades, coal retirements, and regulatory settlements, it has the potential to compress that discount. Each successful rate case that locks in returns on new investments effectively monetizes pieces of the NiSource product roadmap for shareholders.

What really links the physical product to the stock is the growing regulated asset base. Every new solar or wind project added to replace coal, every tranche of pipe replacements finished, and every grid modernization program approved by regulators increases the capital deployed on which NiSource earns a set return. Over time, that expanding base is the primary driver of earnings and dividend capacity for NiSource Inc. Aktie.

In that sense, NiSource Inc. is less about quarter-to-quarter surprises and more about cumulative execution. If it hits its milestones on coal retirement, renewable integration, safety modernization, and grid intelligence, the company strengthens not just its infrastructure product but the underlying economics that support its stock.

For customers, communities, and investors, the story converges on the same point: NiSource Inc. is betting that the future of energy in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic will be built on regulated, modernized, cleaner infrastructure that still keeps reliability and affordability at the center. It is a long game — but in the world of utilities, the long game is the only one that really matters.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405021_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 01:59:37.916778

The Aurora project represents the first component of what 1414 Degrees describes as a “Continuous Energy Hub” designed to serve data centres and other high-demand industrial applications.

The 140MW system is being developed on behalf of SiliconAurora, which holds the Crown Lease over the 15.8-hectare site near Port Augusta, South Australia, and has invested over AU$3.5 million (US$2.34 million) to date in generator studies and regulatory approvals for development of the broader Aurora Renewable Energy Precinct.

The regulatory approvals are valid for 12 months, subject to execution of the Transmission Connection Agreement (TCA), and enable 1414 Degrees to advance toward securing PPAs with customers.

AEMO indicated that the final due diligence assessment of the system’s capability to meet agreed performance standards will commence following the submission of finalised technical models and detailed design information, which will mark the next phase of technical validation for the project.

The GPS approval has been granted for the 140MW battery storage system. The wider Aurora Energy Project will also include a pilot of the company’s SiBox thermal energy storage technology.

1414 Degrees’ thermal energy storage system technology

Thermal energy storage systems, like those developed by 1414 Degrees, represent an alternative to traditional lithium-ion battery storage, using heat as the storage medium rather than electrochemical processes.

The company’s proprietary SiBrick technology harnesses the exceptionally high latent heat capacity of silicon, which melts at 1,414°C, to store renewable energy as thermal energy that can be converted back to electricity or used directly as industrial heat.

This approach offers particular advantages for long-duration energy storage (LDES) applications and industrial processes requiring high-temperature heat, positioning the technology as complementary to conventional battery systems rather than directly competitive.

The SiBox system, 1414 Degrees’ complete thermal energy storage solution, integrates heating elements with SiBrick storage media within an insulated heat store, coupled with an energy recovery system.

This technology can deliver temperatures ranging from 700°C to 1,000°C, making it suitable for high-temperature industrial applications that currently rely on fossil fuels, including cement production, alumina processing and steel manufacturing.

The system’s ability to provide both electricity and industrial heat represents a key differentiator from conventional battery storage technologies, which can only provide electrical output.

1414 Degrees has reached several major milestones in the energy storage landscape. In the third quarter of 2022, the company joined the Long Duration Energy Storage Council, and in 2018, the organisation kicked off a molten silicon storage project in Australia.

The company noted that separate negotiations remain ongoing with the current sole user of the existing transmission line to enable reclassification as a Dedicated Connection Asset, which would allow open access to the National Electricity Market (NEM), which spans Australia’s eastern and southern states.

Executive chairman Dr Kevin Moriarty expressed confidence that an agreement would be reached on this matter, describing it as a necessary step to unlock the project’s full commercial potential.

“In addition to revenue from the BESS, it supports broader development opportunities, including data centre potential previously outlined by the company,” Dr Moriarty added.

The Aurora Precinct’s positioning for potential data centre applications reflects broader market trends, with increasing global investment in AI-driven digital infrastructure creating demand for a reliable, continuous power supply.

The company referenced recent initiatives involving NEXTDC and OpenAI, along with continued expansion by operators such as Firmus, as indicators of growing market opportunity for facilities capable of providing uninterrupted renewable energy.

China's drive to develop controllable nuclear fusion is nearing a historic turning point, with related procurements totaling 10 billion yuan ($1.37 billion) set to be completed this year and early demonstrations of fusion-generated electricity likely to be seen around 2030, industry experts and company executives said on Sunday.

Their comments were made at the Fusion Energy Technology and Industry Conference 2026, which was hosted by the Anhui Province Fusion Industry Federation and Fusion Energy Technology, among others, and which ended on Saturday in Hefei, Anhui pro-vince. The presence of over 1,500 industry participants highlighted the growing convergence of science, manufacturing and capital in the area of fusion development.

Fusion occurs when two nuclei combine to form a new nucleus. Fusion energy seeks to replicate the sun's nuclear reactions to produce carbon-free electricity, effectively creating a safe, controllable ""artificial sun"" on Earth.

If successful, it could provide a near-limitless source of clean energy without carbon emissions while significantly lowering safety risks associated with conventional nuclear power.

A report presented by experts at the conference said that China's fusion energy development is entering a decisive phase, shifting from scientific experimentation to practical energy systems.

It emphasized that the Burning Plasma Experimental Superconducting Tokamak, or BEST, a major fusion device, aims to achieve net fusion power gain and demonstrate electricity generation by around 2030.

Song Yuntao, head of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Plasma Physics, said: ""Fusion is no longer just a physics experiment. It is becoming an energy engineering project. The key question now is how to build it, operate it and make it economically viable.""

Currently, skepticism prevails over whether fusion can be commercialized at scale, particularly given its history of long development timelines.

Xu Qiang, chief analyst for power and environmental sectors at Guotai Haitong Securities, said: ""China's advantage in fusion deve-lopment is that it combines State-led research facilities with growing participation from private companies. That significantly improves the speed of technology iteration and commercialization.""

In addition, China is advancing multiple fusion pathways at the same time, Xu emphasized.

Flagship facilities such as the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak, or EAST, in Hefei, have set world records by sustaining plasma temperatures above 100 million C for more than 1,000 seconds. Meanwhile, BEST is under construction in Hefei, to bridge the gap between laboratory experiments and future power plants, he said.

Rising confidence is reflected in capital flows. Guotai Haitong Securities estimated that fusion-related exchange-traded funds launched in 2025 brought 70 billion yuan of new capital into related sectors, reflecting rising expectations that fusion-related projects could translate into equipment orders in coming years.

Notably, a 2026 procurement plan released by the fusion industry alliance showed that more than 120 procurement projects are scheduled for this year, centered on tasks including the upgrade of EAST and BEST, with total funding approaching 10 billion yuan.

At the conference, Hefei Industry Investment Group unveiled a future fusion energy venture capital fund, with an initial size of 1 billion yuan. The fund will focus on key fusion technologies and core industrial segments, with a maximum lifespan of 15 years.

Jiang Xin, chairman of Hefei Industry Investment Group, said: ""We are clearly prepared to invest with long-term patience. Based on technological progress and industry outcomes, we will launch follow-up funds to meet the phased investment needs of the fusion industry.""",http://image.cns.com.cn/ecns_editor/transform/20260119/tUSl-heywhna5927711.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 01:59:22.338101

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said there have been ""huge strides toward affordability"" through regulation cuts and an increased focus on producing cars in America.

The average age of a vehicle on American roads is 13, which is ""way too old,"" Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said.

""If we have more affordable cars and more people can put a new car in their driveway, those are safer cars,"" Duffy said. ""That's what we want for American families and that's why this affordable push is so critical.""

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin blamed the high cost of new cars on car companies feeling like they had to focus on EVs. The officials said Trump ending what they called the ""EV mandate"" — referring to Biden-era government incentives for companies to create more EVs in order to avoid greenhouse gas emissions — was one of the administration's biggest moves to help the auto industry.

""When government policy is dictating to the manufacturer what kind of a vehicle they have to create, even though Americans don't want it, that comes with a cost,"" Zeldin said. ""When you have to be hiring workers, and you have plants built, and you're spending all that time, energy and money, and you're doing the research, and the development, to come up with a vehicle that Americans do not want to buy, that causes prices to go up.""

Advocates for government incentives to increase EV production say it's an important step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions that enact climate change.

In December, Trump announced he was rolling back the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for cars and trucks set by the Biden administration, which required automakers to increase the miles per gallon for new cars and encouraged electric vehicle production, USA TODAY reported.

""Their decision on CAFE standards, the significance of it to benefit the U.S. market and American consumer to make it realistic and practical to apply common sense,"" Zeldin said.

Earlier in 2025, Trump signed legislation that ended fuel economy penalties for automakers.

Zeldin also cited the EPA push to eliminate the credit automakers received for implementing start-stop, the feature that automatically turns the engine off when a car is idling, as a push for affordability.

Before heading to Detroit, the officials made stops at manufacturing plants in Ohio and appeared at the Toledo Auto Show this week.

The separation of electric vehicle battery ownership is no longer an experimental idea.","Park Taesung, Executive Vice President of the Korea Battery Industry Association

The government is intensifying its policy efforts to raise the national greenhouse gas reduction target (NDC) and expand the adoption of electric vehicles, aiming to accelerate the transition to a carbon-neutral society. However, many in the field assess that the spread of electric vehicles is not meeting expectations.

The primary reason is still the high initial purchase price. With increasing fiscal burdens, it is difficult for the government to endlessly expand electric vehicle subsidies. Now is the time to move away from subsidy-centered policies and seek structural solutions through institutional innovation.

One alternative that is drawing attention is the electric vehicle battery subscription service, with its starting point being the legal separation of battery ownership registration. This means that while consumers own the vehicle, the battery is separately owned and managed by the manufacturer or a specialized business entity, or provided in a subscription or rental format, with this structure legally recognized. It represents a fundamental shift from the traditional automotive management system, which has bundled the battery as an inseparable part of the vehicle.

This transition is necessary because the economic characteristics of batteries are fundamentally different from those of conventional internal combustion engine components. Batteries are high-value assets, accounting for about 40% of a vehicle's manufacturing cost. Even after the vehicle's lifespan ends, they retain 70-80% of their original performance. After use, they can be repurposed for energy storage systems (ESS) or reused and recycled in various industries. They are independent economic goods from which key minerals such as lithium and nickel can be recovered.

Nevertheless, the current automotive management system still treats batteries as components subordinate to the vehicle, like engines or transmissions. Although a battery identification number registration system is in place, it is only for safety history management and does not provide for the legal separation of ownership. These outdated regulations are hindering the emergence of financial products, subscription services, and data-driven innovative businesses based on batteries.

International cases provide clear insights. In particular, China has institutionalized battery-swapping electric vehicles by recognizing batteries not as ""vehicle components"" but as ""assets subject to management.""

Furthermore, China officially operates a variety of battery services (BaaS) within its policy framework, including battery subscriptions, condition diagnostics, and data-driven management. By proactively establishing systems for insurance coverage, residual value assessment, and battery tracking and management, China has fostered a robust battery service ecosystem and market. This clearly demonstrates that the separation of battery ownership is not a technological issue, but a matter of policy choice.

In contrast, in Korea, the Automotive Management Act, circular economy policies, and insurance and financial systems operate in a fragmented manner. Attempting to separate battery ownership simultaneously raises issues across multiple ministries, such as accident liability, performance degradation management, restructuring of automotive finance, and adjustments to electric vehicle subsidies. Due to the lack of a control tower and a clear roadmap, institutional reform has been slow despite widespread recognition of its necessity.

Now, decisive action is needed for innovative growth and the transition to a circular economy. Through amendments to the Automotive Management Act, a legal basis should be established for the separate registration, transfer, and collateralization of battery ownership, with clear delineation of responsibilities.

In parallel, financial and insurance products specialized for BaaS must be designed, and a history management system for the rational sharing of battery life, safety (SOH), and driving data should be established. Furthermore, promoting the use of electric vehicle battery assets for distributed power generation and the activation of V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid) integration is also a crucial task.

The separation of electric vehicle battery ownership is no longer an experimental idea. It is an urgent policy issue, with automakers such as Hyundai Motor Company, battery manufacturers, and startups all unanimously calling for its introduction.

What's happening?

U.S. district judge Amit Mehta determined that the Trump administration acted unlawfully when it singled out states that voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, as the AP reported.

The $7.6 billion of energy projects included support for hydrogen initiatives, carbon capture, battery plants, and electric grid updates. They were set to take place in 16 states, including California, Massachusetts, and Washington.

""Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024,"" Mehta wrote.

Clean energy advocates supported that claim by noting that similar projects in Texas, among other red states, were left alone.

The Trump administration pushed back on the ruling. Energy Department spokesman Ben Dietderich insisted that officials ""evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars.""

The Environmental Defense Fund was one of the groups that filed the suit, and its general counsel, Vickie Patton, was having none of that explanation.

Patton argued the Department of Energy ""vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration,"" per the AP.

Why is the Trump administration's hostility to many types of clean energy important?

While this ruling serves as another loss to the Trump administration, it's becoming clearer that it will continue to obstruct many types of clean energy projects (it has shown support for select low-carbon endeavors, such as nuclear). But the clean energy sector can boost jobs, reduce dependence on dirty fuels like oil and gas, and cut down on pollution.

As energy bills are on the rise due to AI and data centers, expanding the energy mix will be critical to keeping up with demand. There's also the issue of fairness and political targeting.

Many of these projects are supported by the local community and provide employment opportunities and long-term benefits. As Patton argued, stripping them as retaliation for votes in an election is a petty move that flies in the face of the Constitution.

What's being done about clean energy projects in America?

States, clean energy advocates, and municipalities are continuing to challenge the Trump administration's dubious moves. On Monday, a judge allowed a long-awaited offshore wind project in Rhode Island and Connecticut to go forward despite a similar cancellation bid, per the AP.

The shift towards electrified transportation has exposed critical vulnerabilities in how advanced economies secure essential battery materials. Modern electric vehicle manufacturing faces unprecedented challenges as automakers navigate increasingly complex supply chains for critical battery materials. The Syrah Resources Tesla graphite supply deal illustrates these broader systemic challenges, as Tesla's pursuit of non-Chinese graphite processing capabilities has encountered repeated technical delays.

Furthermore, this transition from fossil fuel dependence to electrified transportation has highlighted fundamental weaknesses in sourcing, processing, and securing access to essential minerals. Among these materials, graphite represents a particularly acute bottleneck, with processing capabilities concentrated in regions that may not align with strategic interests of major automotive markets. This case study reveals critical insights about supply chain diversification, technical specification challenges, and the intersection of industrial policy with private sector risk management.

Understanding Graphite's Critical Role in Battery Manufacturing

Natural graphite serves as the foundation for lithium-ion battery anode production, comprising approximately 90-95% of anode material by weight in most commercial battery designs. This proportion makes graphite the largest single component in battery cells, yet it receives significantly less attention than lithium, cobalt, or nickel in public discussions about critical minerals energy transition strategies.

The transformation from raw graphite flakes to battery-ready active anode material (AAM) requires sophisticated processing capabilities that few facilities outside China currently possess. Consequently, the conversion process involves several critical steps that demonstrate the complexity of establishing alternative supply chains.

The conversion process involves:

Spherical shaping: Raw graphite flakes must be mechanically processed into spherical particles

Purification: Achieving battery-grade purity levels above 99.95% carbon content

Coating application: Surface treatments to improve electrochemical performance

Size classification: Precise particle size distribution control for optimal battery performance

Battery-grade graphite specifications differ substantially from industrial applications. Automotive battery cells require consistent particle sizes typically ranging from 10-25 micrometers, with strict controls on impurity levels, surface area characteristics, and electrochemical properties. The Tesla 4680 battery cells demand particularly stringent specifications due to their larger format and higher energy density requirements.

However, processing yields from raw graphite to finished AAM typically range from 75-85%, meaning substantial material losses occur during qualification. These technical requirements explain why establishing new AAM production capabilities outside established supply chains presents such formidable challenges.

Chinese Market Concentration and Strategic Implications

China's dominance in graphite processing stems from decades of industrial development combined with access to both domestic and imported raw materials. Chinese companies control an estimated 65-70% of global natural graphite production and approximately 90-95% of spherical graphite manufacturing capacity worldwide.

In addition, this concentration creates multiple vulnerability points for Western automotive manufacturers. Supply security risks include trade policy disruptions affecting graphite exports, quality control challenges with distant suppliers, currency fluctuations impacting long-term pricing, and potential export restrictions on strategic materials.

Technical Integration Challenges

Limited visibility into Chinese processing methods

Difficulty customising specifications for specific battery chemistries

Intellectual property concerns around advanced coating technologies

Quality consistency variations between different Chinese suppliers

The Syrah Resources Tesla graphite supply deal represents one of the most significant attempts to establish large-scale AAM production outside Chinese control. Syrah's Vidalia facility integrates raw material from the company's Mozambique mining operations with processing capabilities designed to serve North American automotive markets.

However, the repeated deadline extensions in this partnership illustrate the technical complexity of replicating established Chinese processing capabilities. Tesla issued its first default notice in July 2025, citing failures to deliver conforming AAM samples. Subsequent deadline extensions to November 2025, January 2026, and now March 2026 demonstrate the challenges involved in achieving automotive-grade specifications.

Technical Specification Challenges and Quality Control

The ongoing difficulties between Tesla and Syrah Resources highlight fundamental challenges in AAM production that extend beyond simple manufacturing scale-up. Automotive battery specifications require precise control over multiple technical parameters that affect both performance and safety.

What Are the Key Electrochemical Performance Standards?

Battery-grade graphite must demonstrate consistent performance across multiple test protocols. Furthermore, these standards represent critical benchmarks that distinguish automotive-grade materials from consumer electronics applications.

Coulombic efficiency: First-cycle efficiency typically above 92%

Cycling stability: Capacity retention over 1,000+ charge cycles

Rate capability: Performance at various charging speeds

Thermal stability: Safe operation across temperature ranges

SEI formation: Predictable solid electrolyte interface development

Particle Engineering Requirements

The conversion to spherical graphite requires precise control over multiple technical parameters. For instance, size distribution must maintain narrow particle size ranges for consistent packing, while surface morphology requires smooth surfaces for optimal electrolyte contact.

Tap density: Achieving target volumetric energy density

BET surface area: Controlling reactive surface area for safety

Syrah's challenges in meeting Tesla's specifications likely relate to one or more of these technical parameters. The company does not accept it is in default under the offtake agreement, suggesting disagreement about whether specification failures represent fundamental process deficiencies or addressable quality control issues.

The collaborative approach described in recent statements indicates both parties view the technical challenges as solvable rather than representing fundamental incompatibility. Tesla retains termination rights through February 9, 2026, providing additional pressure for resolution while maintaining the partnership framework.

Financial Structure and Risk Allocation in Battery Supply Agreements

The Tesla-Syrah agreement structure reflects broader trends in how automotive companies approach critical material sourcing. The four-year commitment for 8,000 tonnes annually provides Syrah with demand certainty while giving Tesla access to non-Chinese AAM production capacity.

Offtake Agreement Mechanics

Component Details Risk Allocation Volume Commitment 8,000 tonnes/year (32,000 total) Tesla demand risk Duration Four years from first delivery Long-term price stability Quality Standards Automotive-grade AAM specifications Syrah technical risk Termination Rights Performance-based with cure periods Shared resolution incentive

This structure differs from traditional commodity purchasing through spot markets or short-term contracts. The long-term commitment provides capital investment justification for Syrah while ensuring Tesla access to strategic materials outside Chinese supply chains.

Pricing mechanisms in such agreements typically include escalation clauses tied to inflation, energy costs, or raw material input prices. The specific pricing structure between Tesla and Syrah remains undisclosed, but likely includes provisions for cost adjustments given the volatile nature of battery metals investment markets.

Performance-Based Risk Management

The multiple deadline extensions reveal sophisticated risk management approaches in battery supply agreements. Rather than immediate termination upon specification failures, the partnership structure includes several collaborative elements.

Cure periods: Opportunities to address technical deficiencies

Collaborative resolution: Joint problem-solving rather than adversarial enforcement

Regulatory coordination: DOE approval requirements for modifications

Termination triggers: Clear performance deadlines with exit options

Government Support and Industrial Policy Integration

The Syrah Vidalia project benefits from substantial federal support designed to establish domestic battery material supply chains. The U.S. Department of Energy has provided comprehensive financial backing including loans, grants, and tax credits totalling approximately $487 million across the project lifecycle.

Federal Funding Structure

DOE Loan Program: $102 million in debt financing

Grant Funding: $220 million for facility construction

Tax Credits: $165 million through various federal programmes

This level of government support reflects recognition that battery recycling breakthrough developments and supply chain establishment require coordination between public and private sector investments. The Inflation Reduction Act provides additional policy framework supporting domestic battery manufacturing through production tax credits and supply chain requirements.

Strategic Mineral Classification

Graphite's designation as a critical mineral under various federal frameworks enables this level of support. The classification recognises that supply chain concentration creates national security vulnerabilities, private sector investment alone may be insufficient to establish alternative suppliers, and coordination with allied nations requires compatible supply chain infrastructure.

The DOE involvement in contract modifications between Tesla and Syrah demonstrates how government support creates additional stakeholders in private commercial relationships. Approval requirements for deadline extensions reflect federal interest in ensuring taxpayer-supported projects achieve intended strategic objectives.

Production Scaling and Industrial Benchmarking

Syrah's operational timeline illustrates the complexity of establishing new AAM production capabilities from greenfield development through commercial qualification. However, establishing Australia's strategic minerals reserve requires similar coordination between private sector capabilities and government strategic objectives.

Development Milestones

Phase Timeline Achievement Next Steps Construction 2022-2023 Facility completion Equipment commissioning Initial Production Q4 2023 Unpurified spherical graphite Process optimisation AAM Production Q1 2024 Active anode material output Quality qualification Commercial Validation 2024-2025 Customer specification trials Volume scaling

The facility's current capacity of 11,250 tonnes annually positions it as a significant supplier in North American markets. Furthermore, expansion potential to 45,000 tonnes represents meaningful competition to Chinese imports.

Industry Benchmarking

Established AAM producers typically require 18-24 months for customer qualification cycles, making Syrah's extended timeline, while challenging, not unprecedented in the industry. Processing efficiency targets of 85-90% represent standard expectations for mature operations.

Automotive specifications generally require higher consistency than consumer electronics applications, explaining the extended validation periods compared to other battery market segments. The distinction between automotive and consumer-grade materials creates different market segments with varying price premiums and specification requirements.

Alternative Supply Chain Scenarios and Market Implications

The outcome of the Syrah Resources Tesla graphite supply deal will influence broader industry approaches to battery supply chain diversification. Several scenarios could reshape market dynamics depending on technical resolution success or partnership dissolution.

Success Scenario: Technical Validation Achievement

If Syrah meets Tesla's specifications by the March 2026 deadline, several market impacts become likely. Proof of concept demonstration that non-Chinese AAM production can achieve automotive specifications would provide volume scaling pathways to full 8,000 tonne annual production capacity.

Additional partnerships with other automotive manufacturers may pursue similar agreements, while investment replication could encourage similar projects from competitors. These developments would occur alongside broader US‑China trade impacts on global supply chain strategies.

Risk Scenario: Partnership Dissolution

Partnership termination would create different market dynamics. Tesla would need to accelerate relationships with other graphite suppliers, while Syrah would focus on consumer electronics and energy storage markets.

Consequently, the investment community would reassess non-Chinese supply chain development risks, potentially leading to revision of federal support strategies. These outcomes would influence policy implications for future critical mineral development initiatives.

Competitive Landscape Evolution

Regardless of immediate outcomes, the partnership has already influenced industry development. Other graphite projects have attracted increased investor interest in North American graphite development, while technology advancement continues improving yields and reducing costs.

Strategic partnerships see more automotive companies exploring long-term supply agreements, while geopolitical considerations drive government support for supply chain diversification initiatives.

Investment Framework for Critical Mineral Supply Chains

The Syrah-Tesla partnership provides insights for investors evaluating critical mineral supply chain opportunities across multiple commodities and processing stages. In addition, successful investment requires comprehensive evaluation across multiple technical and market dimensions.

Due Diligence Considerations

Successful investment in battery material supply chains requires evaluation across multiple dimensions. Technical capabilities include processing expertise and yield optimisation potential, quality control systems for automotive specifications, scalability of production processes, and intellectual property considerations.

Market Positioning

Customer validation and automotive qualifications

Geographic diversification benefits

Cost competitiveness versus established suppliers

Long-term contract security and pricing mechanisms

Policy Alignment

Government support availability and sustainability

Regulatory compliance and environmental standards

National security considerations and strategic mineral classification

International cooperation frameworks and trade policy consistency

Financial Structure Analysis

Investment evaluation must consider the extended development timelines characteristic of battery material projects. Capital intensity involves high upfront investments with extended payback periods, while cash flow timing depends on customer qualification completion.

Government support serves as risk mitigation versus market price subsidies, however, exit strategies remain limited during development phases. These factors require careful consideration when evaluating investment opportunities in the sector.

Regulatory Framework Evolution and Market Development

Federal policy development continues shaping market conditions for domestic battery material production through multiple regulatory channels. Recent policy developments create institutional support for supply chain diversification across various frameworks.

Critical Minerals Security Frameworks

Recent policy developments create institutional support for supply chain diversification. The Defense Production Act offers potential applications to graphite processing capacity, while trade policy coordination affects tariff structures on Chinese graphite imports.

Environmental regulations may favour domestic production, while technology transfer enables international cooperation agreements with allied nations. These frameworks indicate sustained government commitment to reducing import dependence for critical battery materials.

Investment Incentive Structures

The Inflation Reduction Act and related legislation create financial incentives for domestic battery supply chain development. Production tax credits provide incentives based on qualifying material output, while investment tax credits support capital expenditure for facility development.

Grant programmes offer direct federal funding for strategic projects, while loan guarantees provide risk sharing for large-scale industrial investments. However, effectiveness depends on successful private sector execution, as demonstrated by the ongoing Syrah Resources Tesla graphite supply deal technical challenges.

Strategic Implications for Industry Evolution

The Syrah Resources Tesla graphite supply deal represents more than a bilateral commercial relationship; it serves as a critical test case for broader supply chain transformation strategies across the battery materials sector.

The extended timeline for technical qualification demonstrates that establishing alternative supply chains requires sustained commitment from both commercial partners and supporting government institutions. Success or failure will influence industry confidence in pursuing similar diversification strategies across other critical materials including lithium hydroxide, battery-grade nickel sulfate, and high-purity cobalt compounds.

Market development beyond Chinese supply chains ultimately depends on achieving cost competitiveness while maintaining quality standards. The Syrah project's outcomes will provide crucial data on whether non-Chinese production can achieve these dual objectives at commercial scale.

Furthermore, the partnership's resolution will establish precedents for similar agreements across the battery materials sector. Successful technical validation would encourage broader industry investment in alternative supply chains, while partnership dissolution might prompt reassessment of diversification strategies and government support mechanisms.

Why is EV adoption important?
""The Chancellor clearly needs to raise revenue, but if she wants to encourage EV adoption, she should think extremely carefully before introducing pay-per-mile charging for EVs.
""Drivers respond to incentives, and anything that puts up running costs for electric vehicles will slow that momentum.","British motorists are facing a significant barrier to switching to electric vehicles, according to The Times.

What's happening?

A recent survey by Autotrader showed that the U.K.'s move to charge EV drivers a per-mile tax has had a cooling effect on adoption.

Nearly half of respondents said they were less likely to make their next car an EV due to the new fee, which comes into effect in April 2028. It would add roughly an additional $325 to owners' expenses each year.

The move runs counter to the British government's stated goal of accelerating EV adoption, leading Autotrader CEO Nathan Coe to call the new tax ""incoherent and inconsistent,"" per The Times.

Part of the issue is that the U.K.'s EV transition has been so successful. Government revenue from taxes on gas sales has dropped; this EV levy could make up 25% of the shortfall.

""All cars contribute to the wear and tear on our roads,"" Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said during the 2025 budget announcement. ""I will ensure that drivers are taxed according to how much they drive and not just by the type of car they own by introducing the EV Excise Duty on electric cars.""

Why is EV adoption important?

Electric vehicles are cheaper to run than gas cars, making the switch a major cost-of-living improvement.

On top of that, they release no tailpipe pollution. That means better local air quality and less pollution going into the atmosphere to exacerbate destructive weather patterns.

What's being done about EV adoption in the U.K.?

""We need more carrot and less stick if we're serious about the electric transition,"" said Ian Plummer, Autotrader's Chief Customer Officer. ""The Chancellor clearly needs to raise revenue, but if she wants to encourage EV adoption, she should think extremely carefully before introducing pay-per-mile charging for EVs.

""Drivers respond to incentives, and anything that puts up running costs for electric vehicles will slow that momentum. We've already seen changes to Vehicle Excise Duty this year, making the cost of driving new EVs more expensive.""

Over time, exports are expected to account for 55% of output, with the remaining 45% sold locally.

Between 2026 and 2028, Changan intends to roll out seven new models as it pushes to become one of Thailand's top three BEV brands by 2030.

Gizmodo also asked xAI if the Colossus data centers are operating at reduced capacity while the permitting issues are being resolved.
We will update if we receive a useful response.","This past summer, activists at the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) announced they were going after Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, for what it claimed were “unpermitted gas turbines that threaten to make air pollution problems even worse,” in the Memphis area, where the xAI “Colossus” data centers are located. It appears the SELC has now prevailed, because the language of a general ruling from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding that type of turbine essentially confirms the activists’ assertion, undermining the Grok parent company’s legal rubric for using the equipment.

In order to serve the computational needs of products like the Grok AI chatbot, Grokipedia, and the Grok image generator, xAI was generating off-grid power for its data center with gas-powered turbines and classifying them as “non-road engines”—temporary generators, ostensibly used for more transitory purposes. That temporary status, it was apparently hoped, would have made them exempt from air quality requirements. The newly updated EPA rules clarify that using such turbines, even temporarily, does not confer any such exemption from clean air rules.

According to the Guardian, the placement of the initial “Colossus 1” turbines—which eventually came to number 35—benefited from a local loophole in environmental laws that says generators don’t require permits as long as they’re in place for 364 days or less. The Guardian’s reporting also notes that xAI now has locally permitted generators at the sites, but that the new EPA rules say the federal government is now in charge of such permitting, not the local authorities.

In a statement published by the NAACP, SELC senior attorney Amanda Garcia said this decision “makes it clear that companies are not—and have never been—allowed to build and operate methane gas turbines without a permit and that there is no loophole that would allow corporations to set up unpermitted power plants,” adding that her organization expects “local health leaders to take swift action to ensure they are following federal law and to better protect neighbors from harmful air pollution.”

This feels like a lifetime ago, but just under a year ago, during Elon Musk’s tenure at DOGE, Musk sought to slash EPA contracts with the stated aim of reducing government waste. The EPA’s administrator, Lee Zeldin, said at the time, “DOGE is making us better,” adding, “They come up with great recommendations, and we can make a decision to act on it.”

xAI’s media contact email address sends a three-word auto-reply in response to all inquiries, including one from Gizmodo about what the turbine situation currently is for the relevant facilities in Tennessee.

“Most distribution infrastructure sits with a handful of major companies.
This matters because distribution is what links the entire hydrogen system together.
The paper ""Dynamics of knowledge production: A relational-event analysis of patent citation hazards in hydrogen technologies"" was published in Sustainable Futures.","A recent study from Edinburgh Business School at Heriot-Watt University found that while hydrogen production, storage and fuel cell technologies are advancing rapidly, the hydrogen distribution infrastructure is developing at half the speed, creating a critical bottleneck that could put billions in clean energy at risk.

The findings, published in the journal Sustainable Futures, are an important milestone in recognising that, while other hydrogen technologies improve and costs fall, distribution expenses could take up a large share of hydrogen system budgets, significantly limiting overall efficiency and growth of the hydrogen sector.

The research team analysed 777,000 patents and 1.3 million citations spanning 182 years of hydrogen technology development, revealing clear differences in progress across the system.

Dr David Dekker, a research fellow at Edinburgh Business School, Heriot-Watt University and the paper’s lead author, said: ""Distribution will become the dominant cost in any hydrogen system. Even as we get better at producing and using hydrogen, getting it where it's needed stays expensive.

“The problem is structural. Distribution requires massive pipeline networks and liquefaction plants that need billions in capital investment. Safety regulations and permitting processes are complex, so progress is slow.

“Most distribution infrastructure sits with a handful of major companies. They tend to share less knowledge than innovators in other hydrogen fields. In capital-intensive sectors where competitive advantage matters, companies are far less likely to publish innovations openly. This slows progress across the entire sector.”

Professor Dimitris Christopoulos who co-authored the findings is director of research for the Edinburgh Business School and Heriot-Watt University’s School of Social Science. He said: ""We cannot have a hydrogen economy without the infrastructure to move it around. Right now, that is the fundamental missing piece.

“The 2015 Paris Agreement requires rapid scaling of clean energy technologies, but infrastructure bottlenecks could undermine major investment programmes. The question now is whether policymakers and industry will act before distribution costs make hydrogen uncompetitive.”

The findings reveal where the hydrogen system is most vulnerable showcasing that pipes, terminals and liquefaction plants needed to move hydrogen safely and affordably are lagging behind. This matters because distribution is what links the entire hydrogen system together. Without it, production stays concentrated near manufacturing sites, meaning the wider economy cannot make use of it and the climate benefits never materialise.

Professor Mercedes Maroto-Valer who leads the UK Industrial Decarbonisation Research and Innovation Centre (IDRIC), said: “As the BBC recently reported on Germany’s green hydrogen industry, hydrogen faces a classic chicken-and-egg problem: industry won’t commit at scale without pipelines, terminals and reliable delivery, but those networks won’t be built at scale without firm industrial demand. What this new Heriot-Watt research adds is hard evidence that distribution innovation moves much more slowly than the rest of the hydrogen system, so without targeted action to de-risk infrastructure, the distribution costs and uncertainty will keep holding the market back.”

Targeted policies, incentives for greater knowledge sharing, creation of open technical standards and publicly backed demonstration projects would all reduce risk for industry and speed up the development of viable distribution solutions.

The paper ""Dynamics of knowledge production: A relational-event analysis of patent citation hazards in hydrogen technologies"" was published in Sustainable Futures.

His political career was marked by moments of environmental foresight, voter mobilization, and infrastructure support. Born in Tacoma, Swift attended Central Washington College before undertaking a career in broadcasting, where he mastered the art of communication and was awarded a regional Emmy for his work. Later, Swift moved into politics and was elected to represent five Washington counties at the congressional level in Washington, D.C.. Swift transitioned into increasingly influential positions, including the Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Administration Committee. Key bills guided by Swift included the Elwha River Restoration Act, National Voter Registration Act, and Amtrak Authorization Act. By 1994, he had helped oversee 177 bills progress into law, and worked across the aisle to achieve results for the state. Leaving Congress, Swift held a series of lobbying positions in Virginia before his death in 2018 at the age of 82.

Media Man

Allan Byron Swift was born in Tacoma on September 12, 1935. One of two sons of a Coca-Cola truck driver, Swift lived on McKinley Hill in the center of town. His mother served as a superintendent of a Sunday school, and it was in Tacoma where Swift met his future wife, Paula Jackson, at the age of 12. He attended Lincoln High School and served as the editor of the student newspaper. His brother, Larry Swift, remarked to The Seattle Times that Al ""became very interested in radio as a young boy"" to the extent that he set up a mock station room at home (""8-Term Washington Congressman ...""). Following high school, Swift attended Whitman College in Walla Walla from 1953 to 1955 and then worked for KUJ, a radio station a short distance east of Tacoma – his first employed position in broadcasting proper. (KUJ continues to operate as of January 2026.) In 1957 he moved to Ellensburg, where he was employed by KXLE and graduated from Central Washington College.

Swift then moved to Bellingham and began a long tenure with KVOS-TV. Employed as director of news and public affairs, he covered a local events for an increasingly wide audience. The Anacortes American reported in 1972, for example, on Swift’s meeting with a local chapter of Soroptimists. Perhaps signaling his later turn to politics, Swift noted that he ""particularly enjoys interviewing political candidates"" and that talking with ""Governor [Dan] Evans made for enlightening conversation"" (""Soroptimists Hear KVOS Broadcaster""). By 1976 Swift had been awarded a regional Emmy for his programming on tide pools, and by 1977 he had joined the office of U.S. Congressman Lloyd Meeds (1927-2005), a Democrat from Washington’s Second Congressional District – a vast area including all of Whatcom, San Juan, Island, and Skagit counties, along with the most populous parts of Snohomish County. Thus began Swift's transformation into one of the state's longest-serving public officials.

Entering Politics

Swift first worked for Meeds as an administrative assistant, gaining experience before his own attempt at election. He was tasked with handling minor party operations and the general public. He was noted for having presented regional energy plans at the Skagit County Courthouse on behalf of the congressman in 1977. Meeds had become the representative for the district following a comfortable election victory in 1964, when he defeated incumbent Republican Alfred Westland (1904-1982). Meeds represented a turn in state politics, particularly after his comments about the 1974 Boldt decision, which affirmed Native American fishing rights. Meeds was derided for asking his constituents to move on from the issue. Following a narrow win in 1976, Meeds made plans to leave politics, opening a path for Swift to fill his seat.

On the campaign trail, Swift moved quickly to secure critical voting bases and appeared in the media with commentary designed to support small businesses, voter representation, and transportation. Speaking to the Anacortes American in June 1978, Swift declared his intent to oppose large oil tankers and a new terminal at Cherry Creek near Blaine, an issue that has been debated as recently as 2023. In September 1978, Swift held a campaign dinner in Mount Vernon, inviting members of the public to join him for an 'authentic Mexican' meal prepared by Greg and Mary Espinoza. Swift used events such as these to solidify his base, meet people, and capitalize on his communication skills. By late September, Swift had secured the Democratic nomination. His opponent was Republican John Nance Garner III. David Horsey (b. 1951), a reporter for The Eatonville Dispatch, covered part of the race, noting Swift’s ""smooth style"" and ""aggressive, effective campaign"" (""Campaign ’78: A Battle of Images""). Newspaper advertisements touted Swift’s record, including statements about the 1974 Boldt decision and his desire to 'restore equity' to fishing as well as financial policy.

Swift’s campaign was buoyed by Democrat support in November when Senator Henry Jackson (1912-1983) visited Anacortes and endorsed him. Primarily, Jackson spoke to the city’s concern for its industries, which faced increasingly tight restrictions on the disposal of contaminants and air quality. Swift won the election comfortably against Garner with a platform based on moderate, reasonable politics. By January 1979 he was in Washington, D.C., to begin the first of his eight terms of service to the district.

Busy in Both Washingtons

In the nation's capital, Swift took a no-nonsense approach to the environment. He introduced his first bill to the House of Representatives in 1979: House Bill 2821, which called on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to construct further flood control along the Skagit River. While the bill didn’t pass, it coincided with Swift doubling down on construction concerns and other infrastructure related to water, power, and transportation. He is noted for having publicly supported the Northwest Power Act, which provided a regional model for collaborative management of hydroelectric infrastructure. Also in 1979, Swift went toe to toe with representatives from Texaco and the Shell Oil Company over a potential project in the Cherry Point area. Swift insisted that a pipeline be built to replace regular tanker trips, citing the reduction of potential harm to the environment, and greater efficiency with the ultimate goal of saving taxpayer funds. Ultimately, environmentalist resistance killed the Cherry Point project entirely, but Swift continued to explore energy issues, charged by the economic 'stagflation' of the 1970s.

Before the end of 1980, Swift had introduced three bills regarding power and infrastructure in the state, and spoken publicly about increasing demands for future development. His first successful bill, however, didn't come until 1983 with the passing of HR 3376, which explicitly recognized land held in trust for the Makah Tribe. It followed a series of remediation efforts over the status of fishing in the state, and crucially preserved the rights gained in the Boldt case almost a decade before. Swift would provide emergency consultations for other fishermen as the industry continued to suffer economic hardships across the decade.

By 1985, Swift had won re-election comfortably three times and continued to meet community members as issues changed in the state. Healthcare became an increasingly important topic, and Swift spent much of 1985 discussing elder care, Medicare, and hospital management. In March 1985, he returned to Bellingham to host a forum on the issue and address the concerns of senior citizens. Now established with the day-to-day operations of a sitting congressman, Swift navigated Ronald Reagan's presidency and a changing world. He started that year on his second bill, which would be passed and signed into law. HR 4393, known as the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, repealed two previous acts regarding voting rights and set the precedent for a later piece of legislation. In essence, the act further developed the rights of U.S. citizens to participate in elections from outside the country. Post offices were instructed to provide materials for this purpose free of charge, including write-in ballots, campaign materials, and absentee-ballot applications. This less-than-controversial bill passed both the House and Senate without amendment and was signed into law in August 1986, before the campaign cycle began again.

Main Bills

Once again winning re-election, Swift looked to increasingly complex issues for legislative challenges. He had by 1986 secured positions on several committees, including the Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Administration Committee. Both gave Swift a broad understanding of D.C. politics and how to leverage bipartisan support for infrastructure. These experiences would allow Swift to become a ""workhorse"" congressman, sponsoring and cosponsoring a series of important bills (""Former U.S. Rep. Al Swift ..."").

The Rail Safety Enforcement and Review Act demonstrated some of Swift’s political tact. Passed by the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and then the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, the bill included a series of stipulations relating to rail regulations. Specifically, the bill required the Secretary of Transportation to further tighten safety protocols for maintenance workers and issue equipment for working on bridges. Power brakes on locomotives, radios, hazardous materials, and penalties had all been attended to in the wording of the bill. A pilot program was established to assign litigators to regional offices, with several previous laws being revised in the process.

There were ample reasons to improve rail safety. A 1989 incident in San Bernardino, California, in which a Southern Pacific Railroad freighter demolished several houses and killed four people, had heightened concern just a few years before. In 1987, an Amtrak passenger train accident in Maryland resulted in 16 deaths. The Rail Safety bill passed into law by the end of 1992, without much opposition. Simultaneously, Swift helped pass the Amtrak Authorization and Development Act, which focused much less on safety regulations and more on the ability of the company to finance expanding operations. Also in 1992, Swift helped restore Amtrak service between Seattle and Vancouver, B.C. This service is still in use as of 2026, having been halted for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and returning as travel restrictions were lifted.

Dam Buster

Swift’s experience with environmental and power-related issues would come to bear on HR 4844, the Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act. Designed to end the legal debate over the Elwha and Glines Canyon dams on the Olympic Peninsula, it provided a framework for dam removal and established a precedent for tribes, fishing interests, and states working around endangered species and aging hydropower. Specifically, after consultation with the city of Port Angeles, the Jamestown S’Klallam Tribe, Bonneville Power Administration, and other stakeholders, the bill instructed the Secretary of the Interior to acquire both dams. Further, it provided replacement power from the BPA grid and money for a tribal cultural facility.

Debates over the structures had started as early as 1937, following their construction by Canadian entrepreneur Thomas Aldwell (1868-1954) from 1910 to 1927. The wide variety of opinions and stakeholders, however, had halted a majority of removal attempts until the dams came up for relicensing in 1973. The Lower Jamestown S’Klallam, the National Park Service, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration intervened in the application process and began a formal legal process to initiate removal. Swift worked with these groups, the town of Port Angeles, the dam owners, and the public to secure an agreement and pass it into law in October 1992. Successive congressional sessions would deliberate over where the funding to acquire the dams would come from, resulting in a delay of two decades between the act and final removal. The project continues to mark a significant moment in the management of large-scale infrastructure not only in Washington but also in the wider Pacific Northwest. The act, little appreciated before the final removal of the dams in 2010 and 2014, has since been the blueprint for removals such as the Klamath River project in Oregon and Northern California.

Upon passage of the bill, Swift wrote a private letter to President George H. W. Bush (1924-2018) requesting ""the pen you use to sign HR 4844, the Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act"" (""Letter to President ...""). Internal documents from Swift’s office, now housed at the Center for Pacific Northwest Studies in Bellingham, detail Swift's deep sense of satisfaction following the vote.

More Victories

Swift also helped pass the 'Motor Voter' bill during this period, which became effective in May 1993. Building on his previous bill regarding overseas voting, HR 2 streamlined the methods by which U.S. citizens could be registered to vote. At a federal level, this meant that anyone who submitted an application for a driver's license was automatically registered to vote unless they decided to opt out. Furthermore, the act protected voters from being removed from the registry for changes of address, unless there was no change notice provided. Again, Swift had demonstrated his ability to work within the fine grain of regulation for the benefit of all, and not simply those who shared his party affiliation. It is unsurprising then that the bill was cosponsored by more than 73 members of Congress. It would mark the last piece of major legislation authored by Swift, although he continued to support other efforts.

Later in 1993, he cosponsored legislation introduced by Republican congresswoman Nancy Johnson (b. 1935) to extend Medicare policies, and another bill introduced by Republican Elton Gallegly (b. 1944) to permit penalty-free withdrawals on retirement funds for emergency expenses. But the eight terms of service that Swift had conducted for Washington and the nation were coming to an end. In 1992, Swift had announced that he wanted just one more term before retiring from his post. He had led a successful office for over a decade, passing major bills and working closely with allies such as Democrat Norm Dicks (b. 1940), who represented Washington's Sixth District for 36 years.

Republicans Jack Metcalf (1927-2007) and Tim Erwin, and Democrat Harriet Spanel (1939-2016) competed for the soon-to-be vacant seat. Metcalf prevailed easily, ending the longstanding Democratic representation in the Second District.

Lobbying and Retirement

Having regularly moved between Washington state and Washington, D.C., Swift settled in Virginia following his retirement from Congress. He continued to apply his knowledge of railroad legislation and management, serving as vice president of government affairs for Burlington Northern Railroad. Serving only a year before the company merged with Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe, Swift briefly started his own consultancy before joining as a partner at Colling, Swift & Hynes. The Virginia-based lobbying group employed several public figures, including Robert Hynes (1936-2023), a former legislative vice president at NBC, and lobbyist Pablo Colling.

Swift worked with companies such as Eastman Kodak to advance interests in the halls of power and continued to engage with national politics in a variety of capacities. In 2006, he appeared before a Senate committee to provide testimony on lobbying regulations alongside Senator Barack Obama (b. 1961) and Senator John McCain (1936-2018), among other notable figures. The debate over lobbying featured a variety of opinions and discussed alternative regulations, notably whether or not meals should be regulated. By 2007, the firm's client list had grown to include the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Media General Inc., the Newark Group, and Quest Diagnostics.

The remainder of Swift’s working career was spent in this way. He continued to review regulations, government materials, and other legislative documents. In one of his final visits to Washington state, and last public comments, Swift toured the site of the removed Elwha and Glines Canyon dams on the Olympic Peninsula. Overlooking the watershed by air and on foot, he told Cascadia Weekly that he was ""very impressed with the work and that salmon have already returned to their former habitat above the dams"" (""The Week That Was"").

By 2018, Swift had retreated from public service entirely following a diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. He died on April 20, 2018. The Seattle Times published an obituary and editorial, noting Swift’s fondness for jazz and cigars, and his dedication to public service.",https://www.historylink.org/Content/Media/Photos/Small/AlSwift-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 20:58:35.151554

Stephen Moore is a former Trump senior economic adviser and the cofounder of Unleash Prosperity.","The Trump administration took a well-deserved victory lap last week for repealing more than 100 Biden-era rules for every new regulation. This will save U.S. businesses potentially hundreds of billions of dollars of unnecessary costs. Gone are discriminatory racial preferences, Green New Deal mandates and electric vehicle mandates — to name a few.

President Donald Trump has solidly established himself as the “deregulation president.”

That’s why it’s an ongoing mystery why the Trump Treasury Department and IRS have refused to repeal one of former President Joe Biden’s most onerous rules of all: targeting business partnerships for $50 billion of new tax liabilities. Business partnerships are a common legal form of American business arrangements.

This giant stealth tax increase was never voted on or approved by Congress. It appears to be a blatant violation of the constitutional requirement that all tax bills start in the House of Representatives. The House never even saw this tax hike coming. Talk about a “danger to democracy.”

The U.S. has more than 4 million partnerships — employing more than 10 million people — that could be affected.

Many small family businesses use partnership arrangements routinely.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Heritage Foundation, Americans for Tax Reform, the National Taxpayers Union and the Job Creators Network have all urged the GOP to rescind the Biden backdoor tax increase.

Back in September, The Wall Street Journal pummeled the Biden rules as an “extralegal” plot to go around Congress and squeeze higher business taxes out of employers. The WSJ noted that the tax hike was finalized just days before Trump took office as part of the quest for more revenue to pay for trillions of dollars of budget-busting programs.

These partnership rules are “functioning like the administrative state’s own version of a deep state rebellion,” writes my friend and Unleash Prosperity colleague Steve Forbes. They are nothing more than a tool for “punishing Main Street.”

He’s right. The regulations created a new IRS auditing SWAT team with agents whose sole purpose is to harass partnerships in a guilty-until-proven-innocent “compliance” process. Several companies are facing multibillion-dollar retroactive tax assessments that go back four to five years. These are deductions on activities that were previously untaxed under the IRS code. So much for the rule of law.

The Trump administration has supercharged the U.S. economy for 2026 in no small part by repealing these kinds of Biden-era antibusiness taxing and regulating policies.

Former Trump chief economist Larry Kudlow is predicting 4% to 5% growth for the year ahead. Reaching that ambitious target would be an amazing feat made all the easier to achieve if the Trump IRS would repeal the most conspicuous remaining antibusiness Biden policy: the $50 billion sucker-punch assault on legal business partnerships.

The Tesla Lithium Refinery just outside of Corpus Christi, Texas, is another step toward the U.S. goal of having domestic refined lithium resources to counter China’s market dominance.

“Our Lithium Refinery ushers in energy independence for North America,” Tesla North America said in the caption of a video announcing that the plant is operational, just two years after breaking ground.

The refinery converts spodumene ore directly into battery-grade lithium hydroxide, in a first-of-its-kind process in North America.

Tesla uses a new technology platform that allows a cleaner, simpler, and cheaper process to obtain battery-grade lithium from the raw material, spodumene ore, says Jason Bevan, Site Manager for Tesla’s Gulf Coast Lithium Refinery.

Tesla says it sustainably sources spodumene and brings it to site where it runs it through a series of conveyance systems, takes it through a kiln and a cooler. From there, the material is taken through an alkaline leech and additional purification steps, and then into crystallization to produce battery-grade lithium hydroxide.

“Our process is more sustainable than traditional methods and eliminates hazardous byproducts and instead produces a co-product named anhydrite used in concrete mixes,” a refinery employee says in the Tesla video.

Tesla notes that this refinery enables it to have access to the critical minerals for energy storage, for battery manufacturing, and ultimately for EV growth.

The first-of-its-kind lithium refinery in North America also enables Tesla to accelerate its mission by “regionalizing supply chains for battery minerals and materials, by providing jobs, by cutting emissions from transportation that's required for those supply chains.

“It really allows us to usher in energy independence for North America,” Tesla says.

The company’s new domestic lithium refinery is one of the first concrete steps for America to reduce dependence on refined lithium supply on China.

The U.S. has been trying for years to break that industrial and national security dependence on critical minerals used in battery technology and defense, military, and automotive technologies.

The Trump Administration took this fight a notch up by directly investing, through the Departments of Defense and Energy, in minority stakes in North American lithium producers and refiners. That’s to ensure access to a domestic supply of key minerals and create jobs in the minerals supply chain.

The U.S. Administration is increasingly looking to have a direct equity involvement in America’s critical minerals supply chain, in the race to close the gap with China.

Direct Administration bets on lithium mining projects were a key theme in the sector last year.

For example, the Department of Energy (DOE) has agreed to provide a $2.26 billion loan to Vancouver-based Lithium Americas Corp. to help it complete a major lithium project in Humboldt County in northern Nevada.

For the first draw on the DOE loan, the Department received a 5% equity stake in Lithium Americas through warrants to purchase common shares, as well as a 5% economic stake in Lithium Americas’ joint venture with GM for the Thacker Pass lithium project in Nevada.

Lithium Americas targets late 2027 for the mechanical completion of the Thacker Pass project, in which GM last year bought a 38% interest for $625 million in total cash and letters of credit.

Thacker Pass is expected to be the biggest lithium supply project in the Western hemisphere. Thacker Pass alone is expected to raise nearly ten times the current U.S.-sourced lithium volumes.

In addition, in July 2025, U.S. rare earths miner and magnet producer MP Materials Corp announced it had entered into a public-private partnership with the Department of Defense (DoD) to accelerate the build-out of an end-to-end U.S. rare earth magnet supply chain and reduce foreign dependency.

The direct involvement of the U.S. federal government highlights the importance the Administration places on securing domestically-sourced critical minerals and reducing dependence on foreign suppliers, most notably China.

The Wildcat Ridge Data Center Campus became Lackawanna County’s first data center proposal when representatives approached Archbald officials in January 2025 to tout a $2.1 billion investment into data centers for artificial intelligence, but there was little information on how the project would impact local utilities. A 777-page conditional use application submitted to the borough last month provides the clearest picture of just how much water and electricity are needed to sustain 5.66 million square feet of data centers near Archbald’s Eynon and Sturges sections. If Archbald Borough Council approves the project, Brooklyn-based Cornell Realty Management LLC wants to build 14 data centers across 574.2 mountainside acres, including former mine land, along Business Route 6 and Route 247, or Wildcat Road. The commercial section of the campus also calls for a grocery store, an office building and mixed-use building.

The campus would use 1,600 megawatts of power, and to offset its water demands that top out at 3.3 million gallons per day, the data center campus is exploring tapping into the mine water below as a source of cooling for its computers.

Isaac Hagar, managing partner of Cornell Realty Management LLC, 347 Flushing Ave., Suite 800, Brooklyn, New York, is listed as the applicant in the Dec. 15 application.

The location quickly drew scrutiny from residents who urged Archbald officials to restrict data centers to industrial land across the Casey Highway. The opposition came amid Archbald’s efforts to amend its zoning to define, regulate and designate where data centers can be built. The Wildcat Ridge property is zoned for residential and conservation uses, and it was previously proposed to have a housing community with nearly 2,000 multifamily residential units, an additional 120 residential lots and 1.2 million square feet of commercial space. Borough council gave Wildcat Ridge the zoning relief it needed to move forward with the conditional use process when it adopted a data center zoning ordinance in November that made data centers conditional uses in multiple overlay districts throughout the town. As conditional uses, developers are required to attend a public hearing and adhere to a slew of conditions established by the borough in order to receive approval from council.

While other data centers in Archbald were able to move forward under legacy zoning by applying prior to the zoning amendment, the Wildcat Ridge Data Center Campus needed zoning relief due to the land’s residential and conservation zoning.

Following Wildcat Ridge’s initial proposal, and driven by both increased demand for artificial intelligence as well as local access to high-tension power lines and high-speed fiber optic internet lines, Archbald received applications for four more data center campuses — giving the town the highest concentration of data centers in the region with 44 buildings across five campuses. More data centers are proposed in Clifton and Covington townships, Dickson City, Jessup and Ransom Twp. Plans for up to four data centers in Blakely were also proposed and subsequently withdrawn.

Archbald Borough Council will hold a public hearing on Wildcat Ridge’s conditional use application Jan. 28 at 6 p.m. in the Valley View High School auditorium, 1 Columbus Drive, Archbald, according to a public notice published Tuesday in The Times-Tribune.

Council President Dave Moran declined to comment due to pending legal action.

What is Wildcat Ridge?

Composed of 14 two-story data centers, each up to 80 feet tall with a 202,340-square-foot footprint, the Wildcat Ridge Data Center Campus is one of the largest campuses proposed in Lackawanna County. The site is bounded by a PPL Electric Utilities access road across to its west near the Blakely border, continuing east along Business Route 6 until its split with Wildcat Road, and then moving up Wildcat for more than half a mile. The project is divided into an 11-data-center north campus and a three-data-center south campus. Tinklepaugh Creek flows between the north and south campuses, according to a site master plan included with the application.

Every data center would have 40 emergency generators, each with its own 1,000-gallon diesel fuel reservoir, totaling 560 generators, in addition to 60 cooling devices for computer hardware known as chillers on every rooftop. The generators and utility yards will face west up the mountain to reduce the potential for noise pollution, and the chillers would be screened, according to the application.

The master plan also depicts two substations — a 326,000-square-foot primary user substation and a 69,000-square-foot secondary user substation — a 3.75 million gallon water storage tank that would be about 101 feet in diameter, and a 33,000-square-foot admin and logistics building. Written descriptions of the water tower in the application describe it as 3 million gallons.

Just below the data centers, Cornell Realty Management plans to build 316,000 square feet of commercial space. Plans show a 50,000-square-foot grocery store with 1,800 square feet of retail space; two four-story, 85,000-square-foot buildings, with one mixed use and the other an office; and a 96,000-square-foot surface parking lot with about 360 spaces. Archbald officials have long looked to revive the town’s struggling Business Route 6 corridor in Eynon, which never recovered after the closure of the popular Sugerman’s shopping center in 1995, and Cornell’s plans promise to help accomplish that.

“Cornell Realty Management is committed to revitalizing the once vibrant commercial zone along the Business Rte. 6 corridor,” the company said in its application.

The entire campus would generate an estimated 2,500 new vehicle trips per day, representing a 13.6% increase in local traffic volume, according to the plans.

There will be a western entrance on Business Route 6 in Eynon near Terrace Drive, and there will be an east entrance on Wildcat Road after its split with Business Route 6.

The campus would create 1,280 permanent “high-wage” jobs divided into three shifts operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week, according to a project summary. The developers estimate the project would generate more than $44 million annually in revenue for local governments, with $7.4 million going to Archbald, $21.8 million to the cash-strapped Valley View School District, and $15.2 million to Lackawanna County. The developer also promises “significant investment” into both local STEM and career and technical education programs, with scholarships, internships and equipment donations, as well as fully funding any emergency responder training and specialized equipment.

The property owners selling their land to make way for the campus are: Pine Line Inc., Timothy J. Seaman, James L. and Michael A. Booth, and Archbald Ventures LLC, according to the application. Pine Line sold 249.87 acres of the land to Archbald Ventures LLC of Suffern, New York, for $4 million in February 2024, with Jeffrey and Alan Rudalavage signing the deed on behalf of Pine Line as president and secretary, respectively.

Water demands

The Wildcat Ridge Data Center Campus will use a daily average of 598,000 gallons of water, with a daily maximum of 3,310,149 gallons, according to the conditional use application. The developer attributes the range to the impact that temperature has on data center cooling systems between summer and winter, meaning the campus will use the most water when temperatures are hottest. At peak demand, the campus would require more water per minute than the average American family uses in a week. The campus would require just shy of 2,300 gallons per minute at 3.3 million gallons per day. The average American family uses about 300-plus gallons per day, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

An existing 4-inch water main owned by Pennsylvania American Water would service the site.

As a condition required for its approval, the data center developer included a will-serve letter from PAW, though the utility notes in its Nov. 18 letter, “It is understood that this is not a commitment to reserve water, and that such amounts are subject to curtailment or other operational conditions that require PAWC to suspend or limit water sales.”

The data center campus would discharge about 78,000 gallons per day to the Lackawanna River Basin Sewer Authority’s wastewater treatment plant on Boulevard Avenue in Throop, according to the application and an attached will-serve letter from the sewer authority dated Nov. 24.

Neither the 777-page application nor the letter from PAW indicates where the water company would source the water, but during a Jan. 6 meeting in Archbald, representatives from another proposed data center campus in the borough, Project Gravity, revealed that they will use up to 360,000 gallons of water per day sourced from Lake Scranton to cool their seven data centers along Eynon Jermyn Road and Business Route 6.

The Lake Scranton Reservoir can produce up to 33 million gallons of water per day, according to PAW, and the utility’s 2024 annual water quality report for Lake Scranton notes that it already supplies 17.5 million gallons per day from its Lake Scranton system, which would leave 15.5 million in available capacity as of 2024. The Lake Scranton system serves the city of Scranton and all or parts of Archbald, Blakely, Dickson City, Dunmore, Jessup, Moosic, North Abington Twp., Old Forge, Olyphant, Scott Twp., South Abington Twp., Taylor and Throop, according to PAW.

The EPA reports that Lake Scranton serves 134,570 people, representing more than 60% of Lackawanna County’s entire population. If the Wildcat Ridge campus uses water from Lake Scranton, it would account for up to 21% of the remaining capacity, requiring enough water to fill five 660,000-gallon Olympic-sized pools every day at its maximum daily limit. It would cost $3.7 million-plus per year buying the water from PAW, according to the application.

“The developer understands the concerns presented by the community regarding the consumption of domestic water to feed the cooling systems necessary to maintain efficient and consistent operation of the computers located inside each data center building,” according to the application. “To offset domestic water usage, the developer has directed the design team to pursue potential alternative water sources.”

One of those alternatives is to use the existing mine pool aquifer beneath its campus to help cool its computers.

“Fortunately, when the water supply infrastructure was developed for the Lackawanna Valley, the water companies chose to construct a large network of reservoirs for the production of domestic water,” the company wrote. “These reservoirs rely solely on the collection and treatment of surface water sources. Therefore, extraction of water from the mine pool will not impact the regional quality or quantity of domestic water.”

The project does not require the use of mine water, but if it is determined to be beneficial, the developer said it would work with the state Department of Environmental Protection, the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, the Eastern PA Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation and the Lackawanna River Conservation Association.

Archbald resident John Mellow, a retired DEP geologist and a technical adviser with the Sierra Club’s Northeastern Pennsylvania Group, believes it’s possible to use mine water to cool data centers, but the location might not be feasible due to limited water directly beneath the campus, based on his limited review of a 2014 mine pool mapping report included in the application.

“It depends a lot on how much water they need from the mines,” Mellow said. “If they need small quantities to supplement what they’re getting, maybe it’ll work. If they’re looking for large volumes of water … it might be not really there.”

Mellow believes there is limited water beneath the site due to the geography of the valley. Comparing it to a piece of paper folded into a U shape, Mellow said water drains into the low point at the syncline, which is roughly where the Lackawanna River is, and as a site gets higher up from the syncline, like Wildcat Ridge, it will have access to less underground water.

While there is the potential that disturbing the water could lead to more subsidences, Mellow believes they would be localized to the data center property itself. He noted the developer has an included subsidence plan.

Beyond the significant water demands, Mellow pointed to the developer’s plans to use large quantities of electricity.

Powering data centers

PPL committed to service the data center campus with 1,600 megawatts of power once the developer completes more than $93 million worth of upgrades, according to the application. In addition to notifying the developer about its ability to transmit the requested power, PPL submitted its request to the PJM’s Transmission Expansion Advisory Committee for consideration. PJM is a regional transmission organization that coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity throughout the eastern United States, including all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Washington, D.C.

The developer reports PPL has infrastructure in place to manage about 40 gigawatts, or 40,000 megawatts, and Pennsylvania has the current capacity to produce 47 gigawatts, with a net increase of 16 gigawatts expected within the next decade.

An attached June 10 project feasibility study from PPL breaks the data center campus down into three phases following a five-year timeline based on distribution/transmission capacity availability. Phase 1 would be up to 300 megawatts and would take 36 months from authorization, Phase 2 would then increase to 1,000 megawatts within 36 to 40 months after the initial authorization, followed by Phase 3 bringing the project to full capacity over 48 to 60 months from authorization.

Less than 3 miles away, and almost directly across the valley from the campus, the Lackawanna Energy Center natural gas-fired power plant in Jessup was touted as the largest natural gas power plant in Pennsylvania and one of the largest in the country by producing 1,485 megawatts of electricity. Marketed as a state-of-the-art power plant with the capacity to power 1 million homes, the Lackawanna Energy Center emitted just over 3.7 million tons of greenhouse gasses in 2023, which is the most recent year available, according to the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions inventory for large facilities. Despite that, the entire power plant would not be enough to fuel Wildcat Ridge if it were connected directly to the facility.

With additional power generation leading to more greenhouse gas emissions and more global warming as a result, Mellow noted the compounding effect on the grid.

“All of a sudden now, you’re going to have a lot of people, due to climate change in the summer, using a lot more electricity for air conditioners,” he said, pointing to other data centers proposed nearby in Archbald, Dickson City and Jessup.

Cumulative effects

Mellow contends regulators need to look at data centers cumulatively, not on a case-by-case basis — a notion that has gained traction locally as proposals inundate the Midvalley. He floated petitioning the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry to conduct a health study prior to data centers becoming operational to establish a baseline.

In late October, Archbald residents Justin Healey and his wife, Tamara Misewicz-Healey, who are the parents of three young children, formed the “Stop Archbald Data Centers” Facebook group, quickly amassing 3,200-plus members in 11 weeks. Residents use the page to livestream local meetings while creating hundreds of posts per month on data center proposals, not only in Archbald but surrounding communities. The Healeys also raised more than $16,600 through a GoFundMe campaign launched in November to fund a legal challenge to Archbald’s data center zoning ordinance.

“(Wildcat Ridge) is going to have a massive impact, and it’s going to have an impact in a lot more ways than we realize,” Justin Healey, 35, said.

He worried about draining up to 3.3 million gallons per day and if there could be impacts from tapping into mine water.

“Global heating trends are increasing, so we are going to see more of these ‘rare’ peaks,” he said. “The more I learn, the more it’s affirming everything that we initially thought and kind of pursued from there.”

The husband and wife are regulars at Archbald meetings, including testifying against the borough’s then-proposed data center zoning ordinance that ultimately let Wildcat Ridge move forward with the conditional use process.

It’s incredibly concerning, Misewicz-Healey, 37, said.

“I really feel like a lot of the local government, especially our council, is really just seeing the promises and not really looking at the big picture,” she said. “What we’re finding is we’re not sure anybody is looking at the big picture, and I think that is one of the scariest things about this regionally.”

By drawing up to 3.3 million gallons per day, Wildcat Ridge doesn’t impact just Archbald, it impacts the entire region, she said.

“We’re just getting either no answers or very little information at a time — just little bits, so we’ve really just been trying to piece all those little bits together to understand the scope of this,” Misewicz-Healey said. “For all of our local politicians, is there literally anyone overseeing sustainable, responsible development in Northeast Pennsylvania related to these data centers?”

If Wildcat Ridge ends up receiving water from the Lake Scranton system, which is still unknown, Misewicz-Healey stressed that the campus alone would consume as much as 21% of the system’s remaining capacity, not accounting for the other data centers proposed in Archbald, Dickson City and Jessup.

With 44 data centers proposed between Business Route 6 and Eynon Jermyn Road in Archbald, she also worried about flooding when developers replace forests with impervious surfaces, compounded by a request from the seven-data-center Project Gravity to permanently disturb 2.24 acres of wetlands for its campus.

“So while you’re clear cutting the mountains and you’re going to allow for more water to stream down faster, you’re simultaneously getting rid of the wetlands at the bottom of the mountain,” she said. “What kind of impact is that going to have?”

When council meets Jan. 28 at 6 p.m. at the Valley View High School auditorium for the conditional use hearing on Wildcat Ridge, Healey hopes for a large turnout — and that council members listen to the community.

“These are people’s lives, livelihoods, and it’s our whole community,” he said. “When I say community, not just Archbald — it’s our whole region that’s going to be impacted by these decisions, and they shouldn’t be taken lightly.”",https://www.thetimes-tribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/STT-L-DATA-0111-04-1.jpg?w=1024&h=576,N,,2026-01-18 22:58:02.470946

At home, electricity production is growing far faster than in most western peers, which is allowing utilities to deliver more power to the fast-growing and energy-intensive data centres and AI applications that are key drivers of the U.S. economy.

Overseas, the U.S. is set to cement its position as the largest and most influential exporter of crude oil and natural gas, which continue to underpin a vast majority of global energy systems and generate massive earnings for the U.S. Treasury.

The robust state of the U.S. energy sector makes good on U.S. President Donald Trump’s “energy dominance” push, which looks set to gather even more momentum this year as further supportive energy policy measures are rolled out.

Below are the main metrics on electricity generation and fossil fuel production and exports to help track the state of the U.S. energy sector through 2026 and beyond.

ELECTRIC GROWTH

Total U.S. electricity generation by utilities climbed by 3% in 2025 from the year before, which marks the second straight year that wholesale electricity output posted a 3% or better rise, data from Ember showed.

That electricity supply growth rate compares to an annual average of 0.3% during the previous five years, and so clearly reveals that utilities have stepped up generation efforts.

The lift in total utility generation resulted from a 5% annual increase in electricity output from clean power supplies, and a 1% rise in output from fossil fuel power plants.

The United States’ 3% expansion rate in total utility supplies compares with just a 0.2% rise last year in total utility electricity generation in Europe, which remains gripped by an economic slowdown due in part to stubbornly high energy costs.

The U.S. growth rate matches the global average in 2025, but lags the 5% rise in utility electricity output posted by China.

In 2026, U.S. utilities are expected to lift electricity generation to new heights, thanks mainly to scheduled additions to solar and battery networks as well as the planned restart of the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan.

However, scrapped federal support for renewable energy projects will slow the pace of new solar and wind capacity additions and may drag on the electricity output growth rate over the medium term.

OIL, GAS & COAL

While clean power sources gained a record share of the U.S. electricity mix in 2025, fossil fuels remain the primary pillar of the U.S. energy system and account for around 83% of total U.S. energy supplies, according to the Energy Institute.

Record production of both crude oil and natural gas in 2025 has helped fossil fuels maintain that heavy share of the energy supply mix.

U.S. crude oil output averaged 13.6 million barrels per day in 2025, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), while dry natural gas production averaged 107.4 billion cubic feet per day.

The output of coal also increased in 2025 – by around 5% from the year before – but total U.S. coal production remains well below the levels of a decade ago due to reduced use in the domestic power generation system.

Natural gas remains the primary power fuel in the U.S., and accounts for around 40% of electricity production and is also a major power and heating source for industry.

Rising natural gas prices – driven by rising power use as well as record demand from LNG exporters – are expected to lift extraction rates from gas wells in 2026, especially in low-cost basins in close proximity to liquefied natural gas export hubs.

FOSSIL EXPORTS

LNG was the star of the U.S. energy export arena in 2025, with a record 252 million cubic meters shipped out, according to commodities intelligence firm Kpler.

Total LNG exports in 2025 jumped by 25% from the year before, and are poised for additional growth in 2026 as new liquefaction capacity comes online along the Texas and Louisiana coasts.

The EIA has estimated that total U.S. LNG exports could climb by 9% in 2026 to 1.3 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) and will then rise to 1.7 Bcf/d in 2027.

The trajectory of U.S. crude oil exports in 2026 is less clear.

On the one hand, robust output combined with fairly flat domestic crude consumption suggests exporters will have ample supplies.

However, whether exporters will be able to ship out more than the 1.38 billion barrels they exported in 2025, according to Kpler, remains to be seen, as they will have to contend with higher supplies out of Venezuela following the U.S. ouster of Venezuelan President Maduro earlier this month.

U.S. exports of coal are also under pressure from declining global demand for the fuel and elevated competition from Indonesia, Australia, Colombia, Russia and South Africa, which all enjoy shorter trade routes to major importers.

That said, U.S. President Trump’s strong support for the coal industry is expected to yield higher coal output and use by the power sector in 2026, so even if coal exports remain flat overall, coal output and use look primed for growth in 2026.",,N,,2026-01-18 17:59:04.759449

Through separate letters of intent signed with the Mexican Association of Private Industrial Parks (AMPIP) and the National Chamber of the Cosmetic Products Industry (CANIPEC), CONUEE aims to promote best practices, strengthen technical capacities and encourage voluntary commitments to efficient energy use.

At the signing with AMPIP, CONUEE Director General Israel Jáuregui Nares said energy efficiency must be integrated across the full industrial cycle, from design and operation to final energy consumption. He said the agreement enables Conuee to extend its technical and operational capabilities to a sector with significant economic and territorial impact. “We are convinced that energy efficiency must always come first. This agreement is the start of work that will yield benefits for national development and for industrial parks themselves,” Jáuregui Nares said.

AMPIP Director General Claudia Esteves Cano said the association represents 95% of Mexico’s industrial parks, with operations in 28 states and more than 4,000 companies. AMPIP includes 477 industrial parks currently in operation and 103 under construction. She said the goal is for all affiliated parks to adopt energy efficiency measures and obtain a distinction reflecting a commitment to sustainability.

Esteves Cano added that AMPIP-affiliated parks concentrate 99% of foreign direct investment in manufacturing and 98% of national manufacturing GDP. Collaboration with CONUEE, she said, will support energy diagnostics, training programs and the dissemination of best practices to improve competitiveness and environmental performance.

CONUEE officials said the AMPIP agreement establishes four main lines of action: strengthening technical capabilities, creating collaboration networks, organizing joint training events and providing technical assistance to affiliated parks. The initiative is aligned with the National Energy Efficiency Agreement (ANEE), which targets large energy users and emerging industrial development hubs.

In a separate ceremony, CONUEE signed a letter of intent with CANIPEC to promote energy efficiency and sustainable practices in the personal care and household products industry. The agreement was led by Jáuregui Nares and CANIPEC Executive President Carlos Ramón Berzunza Sánchez.

Jáuregui Nares said cooperation with manufacturing sectors is essential to position energy efficiency as a core element of sustainability and competitiveness. Berzunza Sánchez highlighted the industry’s role in quality of life and said responsible energy use must be embedded throughout the value chain.

CANIPEC representatives said the chamber acts as a link between companies, authorities and consumers to promote environmental protection. Sustainability and circular economy initiatives already underway will be strengthened through collaboration with Conuee, including technical training, workshops and voluntary agreements under Mexico’s energy planning and transition framework.

Diana Verónica Noriega Navarrete, CONUEE’s director of large energy users, said the ANEE provides a platform for companies in both industrial parks and consumer goods manufacturing to adopt practices that improve energy performance and support decarbonization.

CONUEE: Advancing Energy Efficiency in Mexico

The AMPIP and CANIPEC agreements build on a series of similar memorandums signed by CONUEE and industry groups in late 2025. In September, the Commission signed a letter of intent with Mexican Institute of Chemical Engineers (IMIQ), laying the groundwork for joint energy efficiency initiatives through 2029. The signing was led by Jáuregui Nares and Víctor Martínez, National President, IMIQ.

Within the framework of Mexico’s National Energy Efficiency Agreement (ANEE), CONUEE outlined priority actions, including improving energy management among major users and driving efficiency gains across industrial processes. According to the Commission, the partnership is designed to facilitate technical information exchange and the development of collaborative projects, reinforcing both institutions’ roles as key players in advancing sustainable energy use. For its part, IMIQ highlighted the contribution of chemical engineers to improving processes, proposing innovative solutions, and creating networks of expertise to promote best practices.

That same month, CONUEE signed another letter of intent with National Institute of Electricity and Clean Energy (INEEL) at INEEL’s headquarters in Cuernavaca, Morelos, involving Jáuregui Nares and INEEL Director General Víctor Salcido. At the signing, both officials emphasized that the agreement formalizes joint efforts to develop strategic projects, training programs, and technical capacity-building initiatives that support the country’s energy transition.

Under the agreement, CONUEE and INEEL are set to establish joint working groups to design methodologies and technical tools, share information, and organize workshops, courses, and training events. The collaboration will also include the promotion of knowledge networks focused on efficient energy management in key sectors of the Mexican economy.

Officials highlighted that the partnership will allow INEEL to expand the services it provides to both public and private companies, while CONUEE will be able to access national and international programs supporting energy efficiency and sustainability. Together, the institutions said they aim to build synergies with academic, public, and private organizations to reinforce Mexico’s role in global clean energy efforts.

CONUEE has also sought to integrate state government agencies in its energy efficiency initiatives. In October 2025, the Commission signed an agreement with the Jalisco State Energy Agency (AEEJ) to promote energy efficiency across the state and strengthen the technical capacities of government personnel. The collaboration built on workshops held in August and September of that year, which trained state and municipal staff on energy efficiency in public buildings, street lighting, and water pumping systems. The sessions encouraged the adoption of measures aimed at reducing energy consumption and optimizing the operation of public services.

Meanwhile, in March 2025, CONUEE signed another letter of intent with Campeche’s Ministry of Environment, Biodiversity, Climate Change, and Energy (SEMABICCE), seeking to expand joint cooperation on energy efficiency initiatives in the state. The agreement followed an earlier collaboration launched in 2023 to promote energy-saving programs in public buildings across Campeche.

The initiative was initiated to bolster the technical capacity of municipal governments and support the implementation of best practices for energy efficiency in public facilities. It also included training, technical assistance, and project development guidance focused on improving public lighting and potable water pumping systems. These efforts were intended to equip municipalities with effective tools to lower operational costs associated with essential public services.

During the signing event, Jáuregui Nares highlighted the Commission’s readiness to continue working with Campeche’s government and to extend cooperation to the state’s industrial sector. SEMABICCE’s Director General of Sustainable Energy, Jorge Narro, noted progress in implementing energy efficiency programs in public buildings and emphasized the importance of interinstitutional collaboration to advance energy savings statewide.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2026-01/carta_ampip.jpg?h=597ddb7b&itok=FjeIWrsP,N,,2026-01-18 15:58:42.385855

The Boswell and Royalton projects represent more than two-thirds of the 300 megawatts of solar Minnesota Power announced in 2022 as part of an agreement with clean energy organizations weighing in on the company's required integrated resource plan, which outlines the next 15 years of expected energy sources and demands.

The nearly 100 remaining megawatts will come through ""an exciting distributed solar energy standard that we are working on meeting,"" Pierce said. The specifics are still being worked out, company officials said.

Between 50% and 60% of the company's energy now comes from renewable sources. State law requires utilities produce all electricity with carbon-free sources by 2040.

Boswell is home to Minnesota Power's last two coal-fired power plants, which are scheduled to retire by 2030 and 2035, and are significant sources of tax revenue to Cohasset and Itasca County. This solar project or other proposals, like refueling Boswell with natural gas, could preserve some of that tax base.

It also makes use of what's already there.

""One of the really great things about this project is it takes advantage of all the existing infrastructure that's already at the Boswell Energy Center, and utilizes that to bring this energy to the transmission system,"" Ryan said.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/a622e2c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5296x3531+0+0/resize/1599x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faf%2F39%2Fa6f9ad624d8eb968e4036322225b%2F102022.N.DNT.solarC3.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 15:58:52.494350

Hey everybody, happy Sunday. I hope that wherever you are and whatever you were doing, you’re safe, you are well, and you are with someone you care about who also cares for you — especially at this particularly troubling time in the world.

I’ve been thinking a lot in the last couple of weeks about the channel, about our future, and about the things we talk about. There’s been a lot of perceived pushback, both on our channel and also on other channels, where we have not been afraid to discuss what’s happening around the world. Lots of people are saying, “I don’t want that, I just want you to talk about happy things.” And moreover, a lot of people are posting random political stuff that doesn’t have any relationship to whatever it is we’ve made a video about.

I was watching a video from Cychic in which she was saying she’s noticed it too, and it’s made me question — who can we trust, and what is trustworthy? What is true, not what someone tells you is true, but what is actually factually true, based on your own experiences and the world around you.

That has led me to today’s topic, which is one in which — apologies, I was looking at the camera a lot today and being a very terrible presenter, I guess — my ADHD is on display today. I tend not to give people eye contact when I’m feeling a particular way. I’m worried about trust in the EV world and trust in the automotive world specifically, and today I want to talk to you about whether we can, should, or do trust automakers.

Earlier this week, at the time of filming, President Trump went to a Ford plant in Detroit. He was a guest of Ford. As Ford has pointed out, Ford has welcomed every president for decades. I think since the 1950s, Ford has welcomed every president to tour the facilities.

At that visit, a Ford employee on the factory floor heckled the president at one point, and the president flipped them off. That employee has since been laid off, lost their job, and I think they’ll be okay. I think there was a GoFundMe set up for that employee.

We could have a long discussion as to whether it is appropriate to heckle the president and whether it’s appropriate to engage in that in your workplace. Some people will say yes, some will say no. I’m not here to weigh in on that.

What I am here to weigh in on is the way in which the overwhelming majority of the auto industry has gone over backwards to give the president of the U.S. what he wants. We’ve seen slowing down of EV adoption, slowing down of EV production, and pushing back on emission standards.

I have stood in the same room as Ford CEO Jim Farley, more than once, actually many times, where he waxed lyrical about how amazing EVs were and how it was the future for the company. Now, Ford is dancing to a different tune. It’s pushing more V8s, more V6s, going back to gas guzzlers, really pushing out its plans for EVs. Yes, I know there’s a new model coming out in the future, but I have a lot of doubt. I know someone who covers the industry — my job is to be objective — but personally, I have a lot of doubt about the future of Ford EVs right now.

Ford did it in the past. You know, it made the Ranger EV in the 1990s — phenomenal truck, very small, very practical, great for around town. And it feels like with the F-150 Lightning now, we’re seeing that history repeat.

But it’s not just Ford. Stellantis has gone from “we’re going to make an electric Charger, we’re going to make an electric pickup truck, we’re going to do plug-in hybrids” — yes, we’ve decided that EVs are not our thing, plug-in hybrids are not our thing, and we’re just going to make what customers want.

As many have commented online in various forums, and also on our channel, it’s not really customers in the U.S. who pick a vehicle. It’s dealerships — the ones who buy the vehicles from the manufacturers — and dealerships are the ones who decide which vehicles go on their floors. There’s a disconnect between what automakers say they want and what we actually want. That disconnect is called the dealership. I’m sure dealerships play a large part in this, but I also think automakers play a large part, because they want government funds, tax rebates, incentives, and whatever. They are going to work with whoever is in charge because it’s easier — it’s easier to make money doing something that doesn’t rock the boat.

I have been told many times throughout my career to not rock the boat. But I have a different goal in why I do what I do, why I am here, and why I am still here — and that is to make sure people have the information they need to pick a better future for themselves and their families, whatever that may be. Hopefully a car-free one. Hopefully public transit. But now, it definitely does not focus for many people around internal combustion engines, no matter how many people tell us otherwise.

I know if you’re watching this outside of the U.S., and maybe outside of Canada, you might be thinking, “Yeah, it doesn’t affect us. We’re still seeing automakers really push forward with EVs.” I’d like to gently, quietly remind you that Stellantis is a big global company, Ford is a big global company, and they do produce for other markets.

I’ve got to a point now where I’m like, are they just looking for an excuse? Are they looking for an excuse to back down? Are they looking for an excuse to say, “Yeah, we tried it, it didn’t work”?

As a parent, I’m reminded of when a child is learning a new skill for the first time. They start doing something — it’s difficult, but it might be fun. It might be a challenge. After a while, they get the basics. You say “well done” and give lots of praise. Then they may decide they don’t like doing it and move on, or they may really, really like it and work on it, hopefully with a little encouragement, to get better.

It feels like a lot of automakers right now are looking for the excuse to give up. The excuse is, “It’s too hard. I didn’t really want to do it in the first place.” But they spent a lot of time convincing us they wanted to do it. Of course, we’re not parents to these automakers — we’re customers. It’s a very different relationship.

There’s a lot of inherent broken trust in the EV industry right now, in the auto industry as a whole. That’s part of why we’ve switched what we’re doing and what we’re making. In some ways, I know a lot of you have watched this channel for over a decade; I know many have not. We’re returning more to our roots — more advocacy/journaling, as opposed to just pure journalism — because we think it’s time, we think it’s needed.

Openly speaking out and saying, “I don’t trust the auto industry,” is a horrible thing to say for someone in my position. But I’m not the only one. Some people say, “Well, what about Tesla? Tesla’s fine.” Many say, “You wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t for Tesla.” But I started covering the industry before Tesla had a single vehicle on the road, or before Elon Musk was really involved with the company.

I will turn around and say I do not want to have an association with a company whose CEO has other companies doing things I find objectionable. Wherever possible, I will find alternatives or avoid working with or personally owning a vehicle from that company.

I don’t think that Tesla, with Elon Musk’s attention elsewhere, as an electric car company, is going to continue to exist in the way it currently is. I think there has been a metaphorical bed made, and people will lie in it. Even Tesla has had issues — some of the things Elon Musk has said about full-self driving. Some people call them lies, some call them extensions to timeframes, some call them missed deadlines. Others say, “We were sold a lie, it was a charlatan act.” I’m not going to give my personal verdict again — that’s down to each individual.

Right now: can we trust the auto industry? Can we trust automakers to make, support, and keep EVs on the road? Can we trust specialist EV companies, or are they just trying to make a quick buck? In the last decade, I’ve seen companies come and go that I perceive as not really doing it to change the world or make travel better, but because a wealthy person decided to invest in a company to sell a product that wasn’t ready for prime time. They just banged out as many as they could, and screwed the consequences.

Maybe I’m just feeling depressed after a week where geopolitical instability looks like it’s going to be the new norm for 2026 — where things that used to only be associated with nations in other parts of the world are becoming here in the U.S.

I’d love to know your thoughts. Let me know in the comments what you think. Remember, we are 100% Patreon-supported — without you, we wouldn’t exist.

,Clean Energy ,2026-01-18 19:11:38+00:00,The Japan Times,Beijing row highlights need for Japan to reduce cleantech dependence on China,"Nithin Coca, Nithin Coca Contributing, www.japantimes.co.jp, nithin-coca",,,,,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/environment/2026/01/18/energy/china-solar-supply-chain-issues/,"Today, despite limited flat, open space, it gets about 10% of its electricity from solar panels — more than France, the United States, and, perhaps most surprisingly, China.
But there’s a problem — those technologies are dominated by China, and Japan’s history shows that economic dependence on China comes with risks.
Behind China’s rise It was not so long ago that the world’s leading exporter of solar panels was, in fact, Japan.
“But companies lost the market to China.” Today, Japan has limited solar manufacturing capacity, relying on imports for more than 90% of installed solar panels in 2024.
“Because of cheap labor costs and other factors, China could produce inexpensive solar panels and could export and kill Japan, Germany and U.S. production,” Ohta said.","Since the Fukushima nuclear disaster, Japan has been one of the world leaders in solar. Today, despite limited flat, open space, it gets about 10% of its electricity from solar panels — more than France, the United States, and, perhaps most surprisingly, China.

But this solar might has mostly been generated using imported panels, as Japan has nearly no domestic production of photovoltaics (PV), despite it being a technology that Japan pioneered.

Japan’s ambitious climate and energy goals, including its Paris Agreement target to cut emissions by 60% by 2035 compared with 2013 levels and its plan — announced in 2021 — to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, will require a massive expansion of domestic renewable energy production, especially solar, but also wind and battery storage.

But there’s a problem — those technologies are dominated by China, and Japan’s history shows that economic dependence on China comes with risks.

“China has shown it is willing to use the business side for what the United States calls economic coercion,” said Yuriy Humber, the founder of Japan NRG, a Tokyo-based energy intelligence company. “China could, if it wanted, impose restrictions on the exports of other technologies, cleantech included, which could affect solar panels and batteries.”

Japan, which faced the wrath of China blocking exports of rare earth minerals back in 2010, a situation that is repeating itself in 2026 over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s comments about a potential military response in a Taiwan contingency, has become increasingly wary of relying on China. The Takaichi administration has also come out with new policies against megasolar while showing enthusiastic support for nuclear power. As part of this, Tokyo has expanded state support for alternative decarbonization technologies with questionable efficacy — including carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), ammonia and liquefied natural gas (LNG).

The concern is that Japan might not only fail to meet its own decarbonization goals but also see its energy and automotive industries lose out to the Chinese cleantech industry as countries around the world shift away from internal combustion vehicles and fossil fuel power generation.

Behind China’s rise

It was not so long ago that the world’s leading exporter of solar panels was, in fact, Japan. At the time, Japanese companies, including Sharp and Kyocera, were manufacturing and exporting solar panels from factories in Katsuragi, Nara Prefecture, and Sakai, Osaka Prefecture, to countries such as Germany and the United States.

“Japan once led in solar panel production until the early 2000s,” said Hiroshi Ohta, a professor and energy expert at Waseda University. “But companies lost the market to China.”

Today, Japan has limited solar manufacturing capacity, relying on imports for more than 90% of installed solar panels in 2024. Sharp and Kyocera, once leading global producers, are now not even ranked in the top 10 globally. A similar dynamic took place with solar manufacturers in other countries, like Germany and the U.S. The undisputed world leader is now China, which produces more than 80% of solar panels and components, and has near total control of key solar, battery, and wind turbine components, such as solar-grade polysilicon, silicon wafers and modules.

“Because of cheap labor costs and other factors, China could produce inexpensive solar panels and could export and kill Japan, Germany and U.S. production,” Ohta said.

Low prices, state subsidies, and access to cheap inputs made it difficult for solar manufacturers in Europe, Japan, South Korea and the U.S. to compete on price. While there are still solar manufacturers in the U.S. and South Korea, they benefit from state support that, in Japan, has mostly been reserved for traditional energy sources such as LNG.

“For China, it was about gaining technological advantage in the next generation of tech and gaining business advantage as well as global influence and political leverage, with cleantech as a side benefit,” said Humber.

Social and human rights risks

While some climate advocates see China’s excess solar, electric vehicle and cleantech capacity — and growing power as an exporter — as a good thing for global decarbonization, others raise concerns about security and social impacts.

“The idea that China’s clean technology successes have uncovered a more hopeful recipe for climate salvation is wrong,” said Seaver Wang, who leads the energy team at the Breakthrough Institute, a U.S.-based think tank.

Wang and others point to the clear links that solar, wind and other Chinese technologies have to the Xinjiang region, the homeland of the Uyghurs, who the Group of Seven nations say have been subject to wide-ranging human rights abuses. In May 2025, a report from the Japan Uyghur Association and the Tokyo-based nonprofit Human Rights Now identified numerous brands — including Japanese giants Marubeni, Mitsubishi Electric and Panasonic — as having indirectly sourced from suppliers in the region. Numerous reports have also shown the global reach of Xinjiang’s products, including in the areas of cleantech, particularly the solar supply chain.

“Allegations of state-sponsored Uyghur forced labor program participation have plagued solar polysilicon, metallurgical silicon and aluminum production in Xinjiang,” said Wang.

It’s not just in Xinjiang — Chinese sourcing of minerals from countries such as Indonesia, Myanmar and the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been linked to labor and human rights abuses. Often, these are regions where — due to instability or sanctions — Japanese and Western companies are unable to operate.

“Globally, many unethical supply chains leverage China as their chief refuge from accountability,” Wang added.

There are growing efforts by governments to scrutinize supply chains and restrict imports from China due to these concerns. The most direct instance was the passage of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) in the U.S. The bill, which came into force in 2022, prohibits the import of all goods from the Xinjiang region due to concerns about complicity in state-sanctioned forced labor.

The European Union has been considering an even broader set of rules, the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, that would also impact Chinese cleantech imports and add scrutiny to mining supply chains in other source countries. France, Germany, Canada and Mexico have also recently expanded national human rights due diligence requirements, which Johannes Blankenbach, the senior Europe researcher at the Business and Human Rights Center, sees as part of a global trend.

“Over the last couple of years, there has been a trend towards mandatory rules,” said Blankenbach. “I’m hopeful that the trend towards mandatory is here to stay and continues in other parts of the world.”

While Japan has yet to pass its own, there has been a push from the government to get companies to adopt stricter voluntary guidelines. In parliament, the cross-party Japan Uyghur Parliamentary Association has begun discussions on drafting a UFLPA-like law for Japan. Moreover, with Europe and the U.S. as major markets for Japanese exports, regulations there could have an impact on Japanese supply chain management too.

The nonprofit World Benchmarking Alliance argued in a statement released last year in favor of a mandatory human rights due diligence law, noting that “Japanese companies struggle to extend due diligence ... into complex global supply chains, which is critical for meeting international expectations and maintaining competitiveness in global markets.”

In the U.S., fewer imports of solar panels tainted by forced labor and increased tariffs on Chinese solar products hasn’t slowed down the expansion of solar due to increased domestic production, partly as a result of increased state support through initiatives such as former U.S. President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act and imports from other countries such as South Korea and Malaysia. Japan hasn’t yet made similar moves, with state support mostly going to fossil fuel technologies, but the recent push to support next-generation perovskite solar cells — which are thinner, more flexible and could be produced domestically without reliance on Chinese inputs, but do come with questions over durability and price — might be a sign of a shift in thinking.

“With perovskite, Japan has been quite secretive,” said Humber. “The number of companies involved has been somewhat limited, and state support has been very tight, partly to prevent technology know-how from being leaked.”

Diversifying the energy transition

Japan’s companies have, for now, a strategic advantage in certain energy technologies such as gas turbines, said Humber. Japan has also pushed technologies such as CCS and ammonia co-firing through government-led efforts such as the Asia Energy Transition Initiative. And while there are pilot projects to expand CCS and co-firing in places such as Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, there isn’t yet a proven business model for those technologies, and many analysts are skeptical there ever will be.

But Southeast Asia does present an opportunity when it comes to proven cleantech, as countries in the region are also expressing concern about China’s dominance in the sector and its dumping of excess solar onto developing countries. There are also concerns about China’s perceived reluctance to share that technology, which would allow other countries to expand their cleantech sectors.

Japan’s investment in alternative cleantech supply chains, perhaps with partners such as India, who also fear Chinese economic coercion, could be a way to reduce fears of Chinese dependence while also expanding Japan’s role in this growing sector.

“There has to be diversification of supply chains,” said Humber. “You may not be able to achieve 100% diversification or find a supplier as big as China, but you should certainly try to build up capacities domestically and elsewhere.”",https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2026/01/18/517160.jpg?v=3.1,N,,2026-01-18 15:58:47.072990

The new normal: geopolitics and growth are inseparable

As the World Economic Forum commences on January 19 2026, the message for global business is simple: the old playbook is obsolete. Geopolitics and trade have become inseparable, with sanctions, tariffs, and export controls shaping market access as much as consumer demand. In this environment, risk management is not a back-office function; it is a strategic directive at the board level.

The WEF’s theme “A Spirit of Dialogue” is organized around five imperatives: cooperating in a contested world; unlocking growth; investing in people; deploying innovation responsibly; and building prosperity within planetary boundaries. That framing mirrors what executives already feel in their P&L and risk registers: trade, regulation, technology, and climate have fused into a single operating system for corporate strategy.

Trade is fragmenting, but competition for growth is intensifying

Davos 2026 will center on a singular key question: how to achieve growth in an era defined by fragmentation and shifting rules.

Recent indicators capture the two-speed reality. The WTO’s 2025 outlook warns of turbulence: tariff spikes and policy uncertainty have darkened the near-term horizon, with scenarios ranging from fractional declines in merchandise trade to only modest recovery.

Yet, paradoxically, UNCTAD reports global trade values reaching a record $35 trillion in 2025, powered by East Asia and South-South corridors. This is not globalization’s collapse but its reconfiguration. Commerce is adapting, not retreating; shifting toward regional clusters and politically aligned bilateral partners.

McKinsey’s latest analysis reveals the underlying architecture: trade is tilting toward proximity and trust. U.S. flows increasingly favor Mexico and Vietnam; Europe continues to pivot away from Russia; ASEAN, India, and Brazil are weaving cross-bloc ties. These patterns signal that growth remains attainable – but through different lanes and under different rules, where resilience and strategic alignment matter as much as efficiency.

Sanctions and tariffs are converging into one regulatory front dominated by national security

In line with this overarching shift, boards can no longer treat sanctions, export controls, tariffs and trade defense as discrete issues. Regulators themselves are coordinating more closely than at any time in recent memory and this integration blurs traditional boundaries between trade compliance and geopolitical risk management, creating a complex environment where businesses must navigate overlapping restrictions.

2025 – 26 brings tighter U.S. and EU scrutiny on advanced technologies, China moving toward tighter customs and export controls on strategic resources, evolving controls on inbound and outbound investments, and sustained pressure tied to Russia, Iran, and China. At the same time, tariffs have shifted from a secondary tool to a primary driver of trade outcomes – suppressing volumes and forcing companies to front-load shipments or reroute flows, as seen in the first half of 2025 where cross-border trade figures reflected companies front-loading imports ahead of the expected impact of escalating tariffs. A tariff adjustment may trigger sanctions exposure, and vice versa. The result is a unified, high-stakes framework where proactive monitoring and strategic foresight are essential to maintain competitiveness and avoid costly disruptions.

Supply chains: resilience with measurable value at risk

Additionally, expect 2026 to elevate supply-chain resilience further from a defensive measure to a core growth lever. Resilience now underpins agility, market access, and investor confidence in a world where disruption is structural, not cyclical. As such, industry analysts point to three converging pressures: geopolitical intervention, regulatory complexity – including cross-jurisdictional human rights and due diligence regimes – and climate-driven shocks. Taken together, these trends make resilience a strategic differentiator: companies that invest in adaptive, compliant, and transparent supply chains will not only mitigate risk but unlock sustainable performance gains.

CEOs need a new resilience playbook

Many companies are not yet equipped for integrated legal-operational-geopolitical risks. Here’s a pragmatic, board-level playbook we see high performers adopting:

It starts with building the right team and equipping them for a world where traditional silos no longer suffice: resilience requires cross-functional collaboration. The Davos 2026 imperative of investing in people reflects this necessity of equipping teams with cross-disciplinary expertise: Legal teams must grasp geopolitical risk; compliance officers need fluency in sanctions regimes; procurement specialists should be versed in export controls and ESG dynamics; and teams must prepare for cyber threats. And the C-Suite must have oversight of all of these.

Secondly, a culture of operational continuity is the heartbeat of resilience, and it thrives on adaptability. In a world where global shocks and policy rifts can disrupt supply chains, digital systems, and workforce stability, organizations that embed continuity into their culture stand apart. This means considering strategically building delays into critical processes, requiring rigorous risk assessment and the agility to adjust plans quickly through established governance frameworks as conditions shift – whether due to market volatility, geopolitical tensions, or unexpected operational challenges. For leading enterprises, continuity is proactive – one that ensures not only operational stability but also compliance adaptability, and preserves trust, sustains performance, and turns unpredictability into an expected and manageable constant.

Thirdly, a robust internal compliance program (ICP) is essential – not as a static checklist, but as a living framework that evolves with geopolitical and regulatory shifts. This means continuous monitoring of sanctions, export controls, and trade restrictions, paired with clear communication channels across legal, procurement, and operations teams. A strong ICP should anticipate risk rather than merely react: scenario planning, early-warning systems, and regular cross-functional briefings help organizations stay ahead of sudden policy changes. Embedding compliance into strategic decision-making ensures that resilience is not an after-thought but a core business capability, and one which is designed to grease, rather than gum up, the wheels of productivity

Finally, documentation, though often overlooked, is the cornerstone of accountability. CEOs should ensure that documentation is not treated as a formality but as a strategic tool: it creates internal accountability, demonstrates diligence to regulators, and serves as the first line of defense in audits or investigations.

In a fragmented global environment and an era of uncertainty, disciplined preparation is both the most reliable shield and the most effective weapon.

Hawaii has long been a leader in renewable energy, and that leadership is something we can be proud of.
A modern, resilient grid is the backbone of a clean energy future.
It supports the recommendations in the “Alternative Fuels, Repowering and Energy Transition” study published last year by the Hawaii State Energy Office, which calls for greater diversification and innovation in how we produce power.
Hawaii’s energy transformation will not happen overnight and will go way beyond election cycles.","Throughout my legislative and regulatory careers, I voiced concerns about Hawaii’s heavy dependence on imported oil and the need to diversify our energy mix balancing the goals of: 1) the need to increase our use of renewable resources; 2) ensuring grid stability and reliability; and 3) keeping energy costs stable, equitable and affordable for Hawaii’s families and businesses.

A critical component to balancing those goals was a timely transition to natural gas. Working alongside renewable resources, natural gas could have provided a bridge to a more stable and affordable energy future. The intent was never to slow Hawaii’s progress, it was to give Hawaii a realistic timetable to transition cost effectively and responsibly while maintaining reliability and affordability. By not moving forward, our state missed out on an estimated $1.5-$3.5 billion in fuel cost savings over the past 10 years.

Hawaii has long been a leader in renewable energy, and that leadership is something we can be proud of. We have seen more rooftop solar, more wind and growing investment in storage and efficiency.

Yet, as isolated island grids, we still rely heavily on imported fuel and have limited options for backup power when disruptions occur. These realities remind us that our transition must be guided by both vision and practicality.

A 2020 state Public Utilities Commission audit of Hawaiian Electric highlighted the need to modernize our infrastructure and strengthen reliability. The report did not point fingers, but it did make clear that we must move faster to replace aging, highly inefficient, unflexible oil-fired generators. A modern, resilient grid is the backbone of a clean energy future. Without it, even the cleanest renewable resources and policies cannot deliver on their promise.

Having spent many years developing energy policy and regulating the key drivers of this transformation, I know that progress depends on both inspiration, careful planning and investments. Hawaii has always been rich in vision, but we must continue to match that vision with practical action. This means investing in new technologies, modernizing our grid, and supporting policies that strengthen resilience and affordability at every level of our energy system

That is why I was encouraged by Gov. Josh Green’s mission to Japan last fall. His meetings with energy and technology leaders, including JERA Co., Inc., NEC Corporation and the Yomiuri Shimbun Group, signal that Hawaii is seeking solutions through global collaboration.

The new agreement between the state of Hawaii and JERA is a meaningful step forward. It supports the recommendations in the “Alternative Fuels, Repowering and Energy Transition” study published last year by the Hawaii State Energy Office, which calls for greater diversification and innovation in how we produce power.

JERA, Japan’s largest power producer, has committed to achieving zero carbon emissions by 2050. Its experience in clean and low-carbon energy development aligns with Hawaii’s goals and can help us strengthen energy security while moving toward a carbon-free future. Hawaii’s clean energy transition does not have to be a choice between renewables and other cleaner alternatives. When we create these strategic partnerships, we build the momentum needed toward full decarbonization.

Hawaii’s energy transformation will not happen overnight and will go way beyond election cycles. It will take time, persistence, collaboration, considerable investment and flexibility while we keep our eye on Hawaii’s end goals. We will succeed when we combine local expertise, innovation and partnerships focused on real solutions that protect both our environment and our economy.

Vision and pragmatism are not opposing forces. When we embrace both, we move closer to an energy future that is sustainable, secure, and truly reflective of who we are as an island community — innovative, resilient and guided by our shared purpose of aloha aina.",https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/web1_20240412-oped-solar.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 13:58:50.524982

The New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board (“EIB”) will hold a public hearing beginning at 9 a.m., March 23, 2026, to consider EIB 25-77 (R) – In the Matter of Proposed Repeal and Replacement of 20.2.71 NMAC – Operating Permit Emissions Fees and 20.2.75 NMAC – Construction Permit Fees.

The hearing will last as long as required to hear all testimony, evidence, and public comment, and is expected to last approximately three days.

The EIB may deliberate and make a decision on the proposed regulatory changes at the conclusion of the hearing or may convene a meeting after the hearing to consider action on the proposal.

The hearing will be conducted in a hybrid format to allow for both in-person and virtual participation. The in-person component will be held at the New Mexico State Capitol, 490 Old Santa Fe Trail (alternatively 411 S. State Capitol Street), Santa Fe, New Mexico 87501. Hearing details, including the meeting room number and how to participate virtually, will be available on the New Mexico Environment Department (“NMED”) events calendar at https://www.env.nm.gov/events-calendar/, under the calendar entry corresponding to the hearing start date. For more information, contact the EIB Administrator at 505.660.4305 or pamela.jones@env.nm.gov.

The purpose of the hearing is for the EIB to consider and take possible action on a petition by NMED requesting that the EIB repeal and replace 20.2.71 NMAC, Operating Permit Emissions Fees, and 20.2.75 NMAC, Construction Permit Fees. The petition, statement of reasons (attached to the petition as Exhibit A), proposed replacement rules 20.2.71 NMAC and 20.2.75 NMAC (attached to the petition as Exhibits B and C), and current rules 20.2.71 NMAC and 20.2.75 NMAC with proposed changes shown in redline fashion (attached to the petition as Exhibits D and E) are available on NMED’s docketed matters website at https://www.env.nm.gov/opf/docketed-matters/.

To access these documents, click on “Environmental Improvement Board” to display the drop-down list of matters before the EIB, then click on “EIB 25-77 (R): In the Matter of Proposed Repeal and Replacement of 20.2.71 NMAC – Operating Permit Emissions Fees and 20.2.75 NMAC – Construction Permit Fees” to display the drop-down list of all documents filed in conjunction with this matter. Copies of the petition, statement of reasons, and proposed replacement rules can also be obtained by contacting Eric Peters at 505.629.5299 or eric.peters@env.nm.gov, or at any of NMED’s offices statewide.

The purpose of proposed replacement rules 20.2.71 NMAC and 20.2.75 NMAC is to ensure that NMED’s emissions and construction permit fees are sufficient to cover the reasonable costs of NMED’s Title V Operating Permit Program and Construction Permit Program. The EIB is authorized to adopt the proposed rules pursuant to the Environmental Improvement Act, Section 74-1-8(A)(4), and the Air Quality Control Act, NMSA 1978, Sections 74-2-1 to 17. The schedule of Title V operating permit emissions fees must be consistent with the provisions of Section 502(b)(3) of the 1990 amendments to the federal Clean Air Act, which requires sources that are required to obtain an operating permit to pay fees sufficient to cover all reasonable direct and indirect costs of developing and administering the state’s Title V Operating Permit Program. See Air Quality Control Act, NMSA 1978, Section 74-2-7(B)(7). The schedule of construction permit fees must be sufficient to cover the reasonable costs of reviewing and acting upon any application for such permit and implementing and enforcing the terms and conditions of the permit, excluding any court costs or other costs associated with an enforcement action. See Air Quality Control Act, NMSA 1978, Section 74-2-7(B)(6).

20.2.71 NMAC establishes a schedule of emissions fees for sources required to obtain a Title V permit under 20.2.70 NMAC, Operating Permits. The schedule specifies the annual emissions fee for each fee pollutant expressed in dollars per ton of allowable emissions. Proposed replacement rule 20.2.71 NMAC revises the current definition of fee pollutant, adding particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter (“PM10”) and particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter (“PM2.5”) and removing mercury and total suspended particulate matter; reduces the maximum tons used in the fee calculation for each fee pollutant; provides that a fee shall be assessed for either PM10 or PM2.5, not both, depending on which has the higher allowable emission rate; increases the dollar per ton amount used in the fee calculation for each fee pollutant; establishes a late fee for failing to timely pay annual emissions fees; and confirms administrative compliance costs for enforcement of New Mexico’s air quality regulations. If adopted, replacement rule 20.2.71 NMAC will be submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) as a revision to New Mexico’s Title V Operating Permit Program.

Similarly, 20.2.75 NMAC establishes a schedule of construction permit fees for notices of intent, permits to construct or modify a source, construction permit revisions, and technical reviews of existing construction permits under 20.2.72 NMAC, Construction Permits, and 20.2.73 NMAC, Notice of Intent and Emissions Inventory Requirements. The schedule includes a complexity-based points schedule for various actions and a cost per point, which is multiplied by the sum of all the points applicable to a given permitting action to determine the required permit fee. The schedule also includes an annual fee for sources that have already been issued a construction permit. Proposed replacement rule 20.2.75 NMAC revises the current complexity-based points schedule, increasing the points for certain actions and adding points for notices of intent; increases the cost per point used to calculate permit fees; increases the annual fee for sources that have already been issued a construction permit and institutes an annual fee for sources that have filed a notice of intent; establishes a late fee for failing to timely pay annual fees; and confirms administrative compliance costs for enforcement of New Mexico’s air quality regulations. If adopted, replacement rule 20.2.75 NMAC will be submitted to EPA as a revision to the New Mexico State Implementation Plan.

The hearing will be conducted in accordance with 20.1.1 NMAC, Rulemaking Procedures – Environmental Improvement Board; the Environmental Improvement Act, NMSA 1978, Section 74-1-9; the Air Quality Control Act, NMSA 1978, Section 74-2-6; orders issued by the hearing officer appointed by the EIB; and other applicable procedures.

Trump’s energy and interior secretaries greeted the roomful of coal industry and utility executives in Washington.

“No coal, no modern world,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright. “No coal, no lifestyle we have today. It’s just that simple.”

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum thanked the industry.

“Thanks for keeping the lights on on the coldest days of the year,” Burgum said. “You’re making a difference for this country on affordability and on national security and we’re grateful for all of you.”

The coal council includes Kentuckians such as Sam McKown, president of the Kentucky Coal Association, and Joe Craft, president, CEO and director of Alliance Resource Partners, and a prominent Kentucky political donor.

It also includes Tony Campbell, retired president CEO of East Kentucky Power Cooperative, based in Winchester, and Don Gulley, president and CEO of Big Rivers Electric Cooperative, based in Owensboro.

The Trump administration has taken steps to promote coal, such as delaying the retirement of coal plants in Michigan, Indiana, Colorado and Washington. Federal agencies have also rolled back regulations on coal that were implemented in previous administrations.

However, the Trump administration’s own data show coal generation will decline in the next few years. The U.S. Energy Administration forecasts that coal generation will fall from 17% in 2025 to 15% in 2027. That’s where it was in 2024.

“The jobs of 2026 are no longer living inside traditional career ladders,” Houle told me.
A Final Takeaway On Where The Jobs Are In 2026 The 2026 job market isn’t broken.","The first Wednesday in January has long been the busiest job-search day of the year. AI is reshaping work at record speed amid layoffs and burnout and a tough economy. Experts predict the surge will be greater heading into 2026. If you’re planning a job search, you must look in the right place. I spoke with labor-market analysts, recruiters and workforce leaders about where the jobs are in 2026. The message is consistent: opportunity hasn’t disappeared, but the rules of engagement have changed.

Why Finding Where The Jobs Are In January Is Intense

So where are the jobs in 2026? Why do so many qualified candidates still feel stuck? And why is January’s job search surge so intense? “The first week of January is when reality sets in,” Meghan Houle, executive recruiter and founder of CONCÉ, told me. “People return from the holidays having received performance reviews, smaller-than-expected bonuses or clarity that the role they’re in no longer aligns with who they’ve become.”

Houle notes that this year’s surge is more emotionally charged. Burnout, return-to-office mandates, leadership turnover and rapid AI disruption have created one of the most psychologically driven job markets in decades. She points out that professionals aren’t just chasing titles anymore—they’re chasing alignment.

Where The Jobs Are In 2026

Chris Graham, executive vice president of workforce education solutions at National University insists that a major focus on AI isn’t going away. He believes fields like technology and cybersecurity will continue to hire due to innovation, accelerating AI adoption and an increasingly competitive landscape. Graham adds a shortage of healthcare workers gives those pursuing degrees in medicine and nursing more opportunities for employment.

Jason Greer, president of Greer Consulting, Inc., agrees that healthcare will remain one of the largest job engines this year. Green energy, infrastructure and skilled trades will expand. And human skills will differentiate workers in an AI-driven economy.

Greer predicts AI, data and technology-enabled roles will dominate growth. “Jobs tied to artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics and cloud computing will continue to surge as organizations embed AI into daily operations. Demand will be strongest for professionals who can translate AI insights into real business decisions.”

Ali Gohar, CHRO at Software Finder sees AI as the operating layer for everything from HR to healthcare software in 2026. It’s creating massive demand for roles like AI prompt engineers, AI trainers and compliance specialists to translate legal and ethical frameworks into machine-readable rules. He believes you’re a winner if you can link AI and real-world needs.

Monster’s 2026 Job Market Outlook, based on full-year 2025 job postings and search behavior, confirms the expert opinions, showing employer demand holding firm in four high-volume, high-growth careers as job seekers navigate 2026:

1. Healthcare And Behavioral Health

Chronic labor shortages and an aging population are driving continued demand for registered nurses, physical therapists, respiratory therapists, EMTs, dentists, dietitians and other healthcare professionals. Healthcare remains one of the most reliable job engines in the economy.

2. Skilled Trades And Technical Services

Automotive technicians, electronics technicians, mechanics, electricians, and repair specialists are in short supply. Infrastructure investment, domestic manufacturing, and clean-energy projects are fueling long-term growth in these roles.

3. Transportation, Logistics And Essential Services

Essential jobs that support supply chains and emergency responses. Logistics specialists, supply-chain professionals and over-the-road truck drivers remain critical as companies re-shore production and optimize fulfillment.

4. Technology And Data

While tech hiring is uneven, demand persists for practical, business-aligned roles such as data engineers, quality assurance engineers, cybersecurity specialists, and AI-adjacent positions—especially in healthcare, finance, SaaS and enterprise software.

Other fields—including sales, construction, installation and repair and computer and mathematical roles—are largely stable. They aren’t experiencing explosive growth, but they’re not in decline either.

“The jobs of 2026 are no longer living inside traditional career ladders,” Houle told me. “They’re forming at the intersection of technology, creativity and human-centered leadership.” Demand is rising for roles blending AI fluency with emotional intelligence, Houle explains, citing such positions such as AI integration coaches, learning and development leaders, brand and growth strategists and people-and-performance leaders.

“Across the 2026 hiring landscape, the market has shifted from volume recruiting to precision hiring, with companies prioritizing roles that directly drive revenue, decision quality and operational efficiency,” Houle states. That’s why professional services, consulting, finance, operations, logistics and data-driven customer experience roles remain resilient.

How To Put Yourself Where The Jobs Are In 2026

Experts agree that if you rely solely on online applications, you probably feel invisible because you’re standing in the most crowded line with the weakest odds. Monster career expert Vicki Salemi, asserts that while you’re on the bench waiting out your job search, several industries are thriving.

She suggests you consider pivoting your career path to areas where hiring is concentrated and strong. ""Skills and labor shortages still exist. The key for workers is to upskill and leverage their transferable skills into these areas where employers are struggling to keep up with the demand to fill their open roles.”

In today’s market, Houle advises that submitting hundreds of applications is far less effective than a targeted, strategic approach. She offers five practical strategies for 2026:

Stop relying only on job boards. Use them, but don’t build your entire strategy around them. The most important shift job seekers still overlook is that the best roles in 2026 never appear on job boards. Silent hiring has led to roles being filled through warm networks, curated communities, referrals and internal pipelines—long before anything is posted publicly.

Build visibility with intention. Share insights publicly, comment thoughtfully on industry conversations, and position yourself as a problem-solver—not a desperate applicant.

Focus on proximity to decision-makers. Alumni groups, professional communities, mentors, and warm introductions matter more than cold applications.

Tell a future-focused story. Employers care less about where you’ve been and more about how you’ll add value next.

Treat your career like a brand. Clear positioning, consistent messaging, and intentional growth make it easier for the right opportunities to find you.

Houle says some candidates are going even further—submitting short video introductions, sharing 30-day impact plans or following up with concrete ideas on how they would tackle a role’s challenges. Those signals stand out to recruiters.

A Final Takeaway On Where The Jobs Are In 2026

The 2026 job market isn’t broken. Experts say it’s fundamentally different. Healthcare, skilled trades, logistics, AI-adjacent roles and human-centered leadership positions continue to grow. At the same time, the path to those jobs has shifted away from mass applications toward alignment, visibility and relationships.

Hiring is more competitive and moves faster than in previous years, Houle admits. But it’s also more opportunity-rich for candidates who know how to show signal, not just credentials. Employers are prioritizing adaptability, learning velocity and leadership presence over perfectly linear resumes.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/696cdaa752d652d6c9e65792/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2026-01-18 10:59:22.806178

Davos, the Forum’s largest meeting, brings together some 3,000 global leaders from business, politics and civil society.
This is very much a learning journey, but one informed by 55 years of hosting the meeting in Davos.
The Congress Centre, our first and main structure, has had a heat pump since 2020.
We also haven’t had PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic bottles [which are not biodegradable] at the Congress Centre since 2016.","When the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting begins in Davos, Switzerland, on Monday, sustainability will again be at the forefront. Last year, “Safeguarding the Planet” was one of the five pillars of the gathering, and the topic continues to be top of mind at this year’s event. One of the five key global challenges under the meeting’s headlining theme, “A Spirit of Dialogue,” asks: “How can we build prosperity within planetary boundaries?”

But the focus on sustainability extends beyond panel discussions and speeches, influencing how the event itself is designed and operated, according to Mirek Dusek, a managing board member, chief business officer and head of global programming for the World Economic Forum.

“Sustainability has always been a core operational principle because we believe in the long-term value of society, and overall, it is a smart thing to include sustainability in how we plan and run the event,” he said. To that end, the broader goal of sustainability globally is to meet the needs of people now, in the short term, without damaging the future of the planet.

Davos, the Forum’s largest meeting, brings together some 3,000 global leaders from business, politics and civil society. The gathering unfolds across three primary venues: the Congress Centre; Kurpark Village, a nearly 65,000-square-foot temporary wooden chalet that debuted in 2024, which gets assembled and disassembled each year; and the Zondacrypto-Arena, the home stadium of the local hockey team. Collectively, the sites form the Secured Zone and are within a five-minute walk of one another. “All have sustainable aspects in different ways,” Mr. Dusek said

How do the event’s organizers define sustainability with respect to planning and execution, and how do you accomplish that goal?

We look at sustainability from a big picture, holistic perspective. It is not a stand-alone objective or a box to be ticked, but something that sits at the heart of how we plan and deliver the annual meeting.

This is very much a learning journey, but one informed by 55 years of hosting the meeting in Davos. Over that time, sustainability has become a core operational principle. We draw on best practices, but we also focus strongly on lean design, smart procurement and the practical use of technology, including A.I., to improve efficiency and reduce environmental impact.

Context matters greatly. Davos is a small alpine town that depends on an intact natural environment to remain viable as a destination in both summer and winter. Sustainability, therefore, cannot be approached as something that only matters during one week of meetings. You need to be part of the place, not just treat it as a venue. That means thinking not only about outcomes, but about how those outcomes are achieved.

We work closely with local suppliers, prioritize local procurement wherever possible, collaborate year-round with the municipality and other stakeholders and aim to leave behind a legacy that the town and its residents can benefit from long after the meeting has ended.

Participants and media traveling from Europe to Davos receive 100 percent reimbursement for train travel, a benefit we began offering a few years ago. We also built a dedicated train stop at the Congress Centre [which operates during the event], making it easy to get there by public transportation.

For people flying in, we spearheaded several initiatives to help offset carbon emissions. One is Airports of Tomorrow, where we bring together experts, people working in the airline industry and policymakers on how to increase the use of sustainable fuel in aviation and other solutions for aviation to be at net-zero emissions.

During Davos, we provide free shuttles and public buses for attendees to get around. The majority of our shuttles are electric or hybrid, as well as the majority of the cars used by the Forum. We continue to increase the number of both each year.

Davos relies heavily on temporary structures, including pavilions, as spaces. How does sustainability figure into how they are designed, built and dismantled?

The Congress Centre, our first and main structure, has had a heat pump since 2020. This technology reduces emissions from heating and electricity by moving existing heat, thereby generating fewer emissions. Also, the Centre roof has solar panels. In the Kurpark Village, we have 100 percent pellet heating [pellet heating uses renewable, recycled wood waste for fuel]. The structure is highly insulated, which means it requires less heating.

At every venue, we reuse materials for several years, but eventually, when we need to invest in new furniture, we donate what we have through a green-share program, which distributes it to various entities within the Davos community. Most of our temporary structures are stored in Davos, so we don’t expend energy transporting them in and out.

And we use only LED lighting throughout.

At the Congress Centre and core venues under our responsibility, we have cut fuel consumption by 50 percent since 2023 and expect to reduce it by a further 45 percent by 2027. We achieved this through investments in better-insulated temporary structures that can be heated with renewable energy, upgrades to the heating system and the introduction of smarter energy concepts and energy-saving measures.

How does the Forum approach food sourcing, waste reduction and recycling during the week?

With A.I., we monitor how we use food and what goes to waste.

This technology continues to improve and enables us to plan for subsequent years, including how many ingredients to purchase and in what quantities.

We donate any extra ingredients to our pop-up restaurant, 4Reasons, which is open to the public during Davos. There’s no cost to dine, but diners can make a [voluntary] donation.

In addition, over the past few years, we have reduced bottled drinks by 50 percent. We also haven’t had PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic bottles [which are not biodegradable] at the Congress Centre since 2016.

How important is collaboration with local Swiss suppliers and municipalities in making Davos more sustainable?

Very important. Without their cooperation, we wouldn’t be able to make our sustainability initiatives as effective. They’re our partners on the train stop at the Congress Centre, 4Reasons and the Congress Centre heat pump, which are all joint projects with the local municipality, along with other initiatives. We also collaborate with local suppliers for our ingredients, such as nearby bakeries and farms, cheese producers, and hunters, who supply meat that is not farmed but comes from animals living in the natural environment.

The Congress Centre is fully supplied by a local caterer, and our food sourcing reflects a strong focus on local and seasonal products. We primarily purchase seasonal fruit, typically Swiss apples, of which we consume more than 1.2 metric tons [roughly 2,645 pounds] during the meeting. All fish served is 100 percent Swiss, and more than 70 percent of our ingredients are local and seasonal.

What sustainability goals have proven hardest to achieve at Davos?

Many of the challenges are not about intent, but about time, scale and influence. Davos is a small town, the meeting is temporary and a lot depends on partners, suppliers and systems that cannot be changed overnight.

We try to go beyond our own operations and influence the wider environment, for example, by working with local chefs and caterers and offering training on more sustainable kitchen and catering practices. That kind of change is important, but it takes time and trust, and results tend to build gradually rather than happen immediately.

There are always further improvements that could be made. The trade-off is often between pushing for small changes everywhere and focusing our efforts on measures that deliver real impact and can be sustained year after year. In practice, sustainability means making choices, setting priorities and accepting that progress is sometimes incremental rather than instant.

As climate concerns intensify, do you foresee changes to the scale or format of the annual meeting in the years ahead?

In addition to in-person participation, we encourage people to tune in online so they don’t incur travel-related emissions. We livestream 200 sessions [of some 270 total] and aim to improve the online experience every year with the latest technology.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/19/multimedia/19sp-Davos-QandA-inyt-01-tvql/19sp-Davos-QandA-inyt-01-tvql-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 11:00:38.614210

“That’s new.” The business-oriented mindset even rankles people who don’t spend time suing polluters as a way to enforce the Clean Water Act.
First, does the water in question “abut” another body of water, such as a river or ocean, that is protected under the Clean Water Act?
“The Porter-Cologne Act regulates water quality more broadly than the Clean Water Act,” Herman said.
“Trump’s EPA has been directed to narrow the scope of the Clean Water Act as much as possible,” Spinuzzi said.","The long-term health of the ocean off the coast of Southern California, and the health of the region’s freshwater streams and rivers and lakes, soon could hinge on the Trump administration’s definition of a single word: ditch.

The Environmental Protection Agency is in the midst of sorting out which of the “waters of the United States,” or WOTUS – the creeks, streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, wetlands, oceans, and, yes, in a few cases, ditches – should still be protected from pollution by the Clean Water Act of 1972.

At least some of the proposed new rules could result in more pollution in Southern California’s vast network of paved flood control channels, which soon could be viewed by the federal government as “ephemeral ditches.” That, in turn, could translate into a dirtier Pacific and dirtier rivers and creeks.

Though details of the EPA’s proposals are complex and filled with legalese, the agency’s broader goal is pretty simple. In November, when it initially posted its water proposals, the EPA wrote: “When finished, this WOTUS rule will help accelerate economic prosperity while protecting vital water resources.”

The original language of the Clean Water Act – which is widely credited with staving off and, in some cases, reversing water pollution for more than a half-century – explicitly mentions environmental and human health, yet says nothing about economic prosperity.

The new emphasis, and the current EPA’s view that economic interests should be critical to environmental rules, pleases many business groups. The comment section of the EPA’s WOTUS proposal, included letters from agriculture interests and home builders and others who applauded what they view as “clarity” of the EPA’s new definitions. Such regulatory clarity is, in fact, a goal that’s been shared by EPA officials from both political parties for many years.

But the new EPA’s business-oriented mindset, as reflected in everything from its preamble to some details of the proposals to remake the Clean Water Act, also frustrates some people who work to reduce water pollution in Southern California.

“Over the years, we’ve seen the definitions change when it comes to which waters are covered (by the Clean Water Act). When Obama was president, the definition gave us more protection. When Trump came in the first time, the definitions became more narrow,” said Garry Brown, founder and president of Orange County Coastkeeper, a Costa Mesa-based nonprofit that works to make sure clean water laws are followed in Orange County and the Inland Empire.

“But we’ve never seen any politician campaign on the idea that more pollution is OK,” he added. “That’s new.”

The business-oriented mindset even rankles people who don’t spend time suing polluters as a way to enforce the Clean Water Act.

“Look, I’m for nature,” said Kyle Gerhard, a Beaumont resident who teaches science at Palm Middle School in Moreno Valley.

“Nature needs more protection, not less,” Gerhard said. “From what I’m hearing, these EPA rules would mean less protection.”

Ditched

The EPA’s move to redefine the scope of the Clean Water Act isn’t anything new. In fact, the Trump administration’s proposals, which are widely expected to kick in later this year, are coming less than three years after the Biden administration’s EPA took on the same question.

Both reinterpretations of the Clean Water Act were sparked by the Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling in a case known as Sackett vs. EPA. That’s when the Supreme Court said federal anti-pollution rules could apply only to waters that had a “continuous surface connection” to other protected waters.

That language raised a lot of questions. Could federal anti-pollution rules be applied to streams and creeks that flow partly underground, which might not have “continuous surface connection” even if those underground streams can, and often do, carry pollutants? What about wetlands that are dry for some or much of any year? Or paved channels that carry storm water from, say, a freeway underpass in Hawaiian Gardens to the ocean off the coast of Bolsa Chica?

The EPA plans to answer all that with a two-part test.

First, does the water in question “abut” another body of water, such as a river or ocean, that is protected under the Clean Water Act? And, second, does the water in question have “surface water” at least during that region’s wet season?

The first part of the EPA’s test – the “abut” rule – could free up millions of acres of land around the country for future development. That would please, among others, groups that hope lower-priced housing can help lower-income home buyers and reduce homelessness. But it also could mean more pollution in waterways that flow above and below ground, a category that includes most streams in dry climates such as the southwest part of the United States.

The second part of that test – the “wet season” rule – could exclude many marshes, ponds and streams in dry, higher-elevation areas, such as the Sierra, San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountain ranges. At altitude, in California and other hot areas, wet seasons aren’t always clear or consistent.

By some accounts, the EPA’s proposals would lift water pollution protection from 90% of the nation’s wetlands.

Critically, the EPA’s ideas about water also delve into the world of ditches.

Though federal Clean Water Act rules don’t apply (and haven’t ever applied) to most ditches, they have protected the water flowing in some paved channels that serve as tributaries from existing natural sources, like rivers, and for some ditches on farms that connect to rivers or lakes.

The EPA, under its new proposal, would set anti-pollution rules only for water flowing in ditches that were “constructed or excavated in dry land.”

That could mean huge changes in Southern California.

Over the decades, the state and counties in the region have built more than 500 miles of paved flood control channels to direct stormwater runoff and flows from the Los Angeles, San Gabriel and Santa Ana rivers. Those channels often flow into the ocean.

It’s unclear if the new EPA proposals would force government agencies to adhere to federal rules by paying to remove or prevent certain types of pollution from those paved waterways. If not, pollution could flow more freely.

“As drafted, ‘flood channels’ would not be (protected) waters if they have surface water only in response to heavy rain events,” Sean Herman, a lawyer with San Francisco-based Hansen Bridgett LLP who specializes in water pollution law, said via email.

Herman, who represents clients with a wide range of opinions about environmental questions – from public agencies to commercial developers to agricultural companies – said the EPA’s proposals, as written, present several unresolved issues that figure to be challenged in court.

But he also noted that federal rules might not matter as much in California as they do in other states.

California waters have an extra layer of legal protection – the state’s Porter-Cologne Act, passed in 1969. Herman said in many ways, the state law is more stringent than the Clean Water Act, so even if the EPA bows out of regulating Southern California’s ditch system, the state’s rules might prevent pollution from flowing.

“The Porter-Cologne Act regulates water quality more broadly than the Clean Water Act,” Herman said.

“Where we draw these jurisdictional lines on features like flood channels affects how we regulate those features rather than whether we regulate them.”

See everybody in court?

In its comment to the EPA, Orange County Coastkeeper argues that many of the agency’s goals – at least those about clarity – aren’t met in its proposed new rules. In fact, Coastkeeper claimed, the proposed new rules “introduces new uncertainty,” particularly in Southern California, where “upstream pollution routinely affects downstream waters” that are covered by the Clean Water Act.

Still, Sarah Spinuzzi, a lawyer for Orange County Coastkeeper, who wrote the comment for her organization, suggested that details in the EPA’s proposal might not be as critical as the bigger, pro-business picture.

“Trump’s EPA has been directed to narrow the scope of the Clean Water Act as much as possible,” Spinuzzi said.

“So when they add in these new variables, like the wet season versus the dry season, that’s kind of not so important,” she added. “When you’re talking about whether water gets polluted or not, the time of year isn’t relevant.”

She added that by filing a comment on Jan 5, the last day when the EPA was taking public comments on its WOTUS proposal, Coastkeeper could have more leverage if it files a lawsuit against some aspect of the new rules.

“It keeps our options open,” she said.

Herman, another lawyer, said a lot of people interested in the Clean Water Act – from all sides of the political spectrum – are keeping their options open, too.

“I expect that there will be more litigation resulting from these proposed changes, as there has been in the past,” Herman said. “And I would expect that future presidential administrations will have a different view of the Clean Water Act, resulting in more tinkering with regulations and more litigation in the future.

“This regulatory volleyball, across presidential administrations, will continue until Congress finds consensus and amends this half-century-old law to provide greater clarity. I look forward to the day when Congress returns to a culture of consensus building.”",https://www.redlandsdailyfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/SBS-L-CHANNEL-0313-edv.jpg?w=1024&h=685,N,,2026-01-18 11:58:44.197658

As per this bill, intended to cut the power bills of millions, the SB868, the Plug and Play Solar Act, and the SB222, the Heat Pump Access Act, will be combined in an attempt to reduce the power bills of millions of Californians. In this way, clean power will be accessible to more citizens, and citizens will stress less about their state ranking second to Hawaii in terms of high power prices.

Looking at SB222, the Heat Pump Access Act

As per SB222, heat pumps are advocated and seen as a better alternative to gas furnaces and water heaters. Cutting down electricity usage by more or less 75 percent, heat pumps are an ideal solution. With heat pumps, the idea is to have a fossil fuel HVAC or water pump system replaced by a heat pump.

Despite the adoption of heat pumps being slow, SB222 would enable automated permitting for standard installations along with cap fees. Such measures may very well be necessary if the state meets its goal of installing six million heat pumps by 2030.

What does the SB868 Act mean on its own?

A central part of SB868 would be to ensure that California becomes the second state to make plug-in photovoltaic systems legal. These systems are described as “balcony solar” and rely on using the abundant sunshine available in the state. The output ranges from 200 to 1800 watts, and the units are made up of a few panels, an inverter, and a small battery that plugs in directly to a 120-volt outlet. Electrons do not leave the house and flow to the grid, but these electrons would rather flow to the house next door.

Understanding what plug-in solar could mean for Californians

Balcony solar can be mounted on railings, patios, and yards, and can be fitted on older roofs or easily on roofs without requiring major construction or adjustment. Electricity generated gets consumed effortlessly within the home, providing power to appliances, like refrigerators, with very little power being exported to the grid.

According to supporters, this bill could unlock tremendous savings for renters and homeowners in the state. A concept like this has been established abroad, with Germany having installed balcony solar systems already. Ten million consumers have enjoyed massive savings. While the house and the model chosen matter, a plug-in solar system could very well mean savings of up to $450 per year, with average households saving about $400 yearly just by making the switch to a heat pump. California is not the only state that has braced itself for increasing electricity prices. Another state’s energy bill has gone up by 20% in one month.

Increasing energy costs are curbed by the Balcony Solar Bill

The Clean Homes and Energy Affordability Package (CHEAP) has come into effect, and it considers both bills together, making clean energy technology that is easier and cheaper for many Californians. Since electricity rates in this state have been increasing between 2022 and 2025, this package seems essential for many Californians who have been finding escalating energy costs hard to deal with. According to Senator Scott Wiener, citizens have been given the tools to reduce energy costs.",https://www.ecoportal.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Balcony-Solar-Panels.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 11:00:07.900552

Clean energy can deliver affordability, good jobs, and energy security — if leaders choose to act.
Continue delaying in service of fossil fuels or unlock a future where clean energy is understood for what it truly is: clean, common‑sense, and cheap.","This is a guest article written by Jean McLean, Director of Engagement at the Green Economy Coalition (GEC), a global movement for green and fair economies.

With the cost of living spiralling out of control, affordability is now the key factor determining whether climate action gains public support or faces opposition.

Zohran Mamdani’s recent successful mayoral campaign in New York was based on concrete affordability pledges to make life more affordable to New Yorkers: rent freezes, fare free buses, city owned grocery stores, raising the minimum wage, baby baskets for newborns and no-cost childcare. The UK and Australian governments have taken note of this success and have prioritised addressing the cost of living and affordability as key to electoral success. Climate leaders need to take note.

This success can be replicated! We know that the money exists to prioritise affordability for the general public, what we need is political will. Leaders must urgently switch to cleaner energy alternatives as they are proven to be cheaper than fossil fuels, bringing down energy costs for everyone. Taxing big polluters, the ultra-rich and using those funds towards public investment is a popular and necessary action.

For years, climate misinformation has tried to convince people that a green transition is a luxury not an inevitability. Despite the millions spent on disinformation, public opinion tells a very different story. Across countries and political contexts, people increasingly understand that clean energy is not the cause of rising costs — it is one of the most powerful solutions to them.

Our latest Global Green Attitudes polling shows a remarkably strong global public consensus:

82% per cent of respondents believe investment in clean energy should be a top government priority, even if it requires significant public spending.

An even larger share — 88%— agree that stronger laws are needed to support renewable energy like solar and wind.

Notably, this support has held steady despite inflation and increasing economic anxiety.

As cost-of-living pressures deepen, people are judging energy choices on a simple test — will this lower my bills? As routine household bills become the main source of financial stress, renewable energy offers both an economic solution and a political opportunity for governments prepared to act.

Crucially, public perceptions are already shifting in clean energy’s favour. Many people already see clean energy as cost‑competitive or cheaper than fossil fuels. In the United States, a majority now believe clean energy costs the same or less than oil and gas. Globally, renewable electricity is routinely 30–50 per cent cheaper than new fossil fuel generation.

In this context, this year’s polling data reveals an interesting dynamic between public support for environmental action and the perception of government performance:

People want lower bills and place responsibility for this squarely on governments.

The public wants transformative government action, such as public investment, fair rules, and accountability for polluters while also holding low trust in political leaders to deliver this.

Many are feeling deeply frustrated at political inaction as inflation and economic anxiety increase.

What is missing from climate action is not public backing then, but policy creativity. Clean energy can deliver affordability, good jobs, and energy security — if leaders choose to act.

From free or discounted solar power programs to large‑scale investment in grids, storage, and clean industries, the solutions exist. Renewables already save countries trillions in avoided fuel imports and shield households from price shocks.

The choice facing leaders is stark. Continue delaying in service of fossil fuels or unlock a future where clean energy is understood for what it truly is: clean, common‑sense, and cheap.

In his ruling pertaining to the Revolution Wind project, Judge Royce Lamberth also did not buy the administration’s arguments.
The decisions marked a near-term win for the projects’ developers and supporters of the offshore wind industry.
One legal expert said Trump’s disdain for wind power appeared to undercut the administration’s legal strategy.
The New England power grid operator said offshore wind projects are included in its planning forecasts and are needed to help meet electricity demand.","Democrats and wind supporters hailed the clean sweep in this week’s legal cases, even if the ultimate fate of those massive offshore energy projects remains to be determined.

“Trump is getting his butt kicked again. The question is whether he learns from that,” said Democratic Rep. Scott Peters of California.

The legal decisions, Peters said, “reinforces what we’ve been saying: That this is illegal. It’s a bad signal to the markets.”

Trump has made no secret of his deep dislike of wind farms — particularly those built in coastal waters. “My goal is to not let any windmill be built,” Trump told a meeting of oil executives at the White House last week. “They’re losers.”

White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers reiterated on Friday Trump’s contention that wind power represents “the scam of the century.”

The Trump administration paused the construction of projects because its “priority is to put America First and protect the national security of the American people,” she said. “The Administration looks forward to ultimate victory on the issue,” Rogers added.

Trump’s Interior Department in December paused all five leases for large-scale offshore wind projects that are currently under construction, citing publicly undisclosed national security concerns. Those projects were approved as part of then-President Joe Biden’s effort to create an offshore wind industry that could feed clean electricity into the nation’s power grid and reduce the need for fossil fuels.

The administration’s stop-work orders are among the roadblocks for renewable energy enacted by the Trump administration that also includes potentially revoking permits for offshore wind projects approved under the Biden administration. And they come with the added appeal for the administration of thumbing their nose at efforts to address climate change, which Trump has frequently derided as a hoax.

The companies behind the impacted projects quickly filed lawsuits to lift the stop-work orders, citing the billions of dollars already sunk into the projects and a tricky coordination required to synchronize the installation vessels that required the courts to act quickly.

A fourth wind farm’s appeal will be heard Feb. 2.

Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, said the Trump administration’s lawyers had failed to respond to several arguments from the developers of New York’s Empire Wind project, and noted that the government’s national security concerns were not enough to outweigh the harm to the project.

In his ruling pertaining to the Revolution Wind project, Judge Royce Lamberth also did not buy the administration’s arguments. The Ronald Reagan appointee pointed to press interviews by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that focused on offshore wind’s costs, its impacts on wildlife and “a variety of reasons unrelated to national security.”

And Judge Jamar Walker ruled Friday in Virginia that work on Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project could proceed while the litigation continues. The Biden appointee, too, said the administration failed to make a case for its concerns.

“Ordinarily a national security risk would weigh heavily in the government’s favor,” Walker said, adding, however, the “evidence does not demonstrate the security risk is so imminent” that a stop-work order is necessary.

The decisions marked a near-term win for the projects’ developers and supporters of the offshore wind industry.

“If you are a developer, the lesson is don’t cower in the corner. You have to be willing to fight for your legal rights,” said Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

One legal expert said Trump’s disdain for wind power appeared to undercut the administration’s legal strategy.

“The reality is that the animus that this administration has toward these projects has forced it to cut corners with its reasoning,” said Joel Eisen, a law professor at the University of Richmond. “It’s blinding them to making a good and reasoned explanation as to why it is they want to stop work.”

Eisen noted that under administrative law, the government must provide a sufficient explanation for major actions such as blocking projects already under construction.

“The government is required to explain itself and obviously in all three of these cases the judges are convinced that they haven’t,” Eisen said, noting the judges were appointed by three different presidents but all reached the same conclusion.

Yet, analysts warned the decisions are unlikely to stop Trump’s crusade, particularly as the rulings themselves could do little to calm the fears of companies looking to invest in future offshore wind development, a still-nascent industry in the United States.

The suspension orders may still “serve the long-term purpose of injecting significant uncertainty for offshore wind,” said Timothy Fox, the managing director of ClearView Energy Partners, a research firm.

“A future administration could support offshore wind, but we think the industry — and perhaps as importantly — financiers may be wary of investing in a capital-intensive sector with such demonstrable high election risk,” he said.

Other analysts said Friday the court rulings will likely force the administration to find other ways to try to impede offshore wind, even as the legal proceedings play out.

“While this blocks the latest targeting strategy, we expect the administration’s animus to continue in the form of other challenges,” Paul Greenough, a senior vice president on advisory firm Capstone’s energy team, wrote in an email.

Greenough pointed to Interior’s other court filings that seek remands for key offshore wind permits, as well as the potential for the administration to try to revive national security issues, flag new “findings” for endangered species impacts or other obstacles.

Craig Rucker, the president of Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow, which challenged the Virginia project, urged Interior to appeal the decision on Friday. “Instead of showing deference to well documented military objections, a single federal judge, without any expertise in national security, has taken it upon himself to substitute his judgment for the considered opinion of military professionals,” Rucker said.

Dominion noted in a press release after the Friday hearing that even as its lawsuit proceeds, the company “will continue seeking a durable resolution of this matter through cooperation with the federal government.”

The company told Walker that it had been in frequent contact with Interior, including as recently as December, and it was surprised by the stop order issued later that month.

“In none of these meetings was there an indication that an order was coming,” said Dominion attorney James Auslander, a principal at the firm Beveridge & Diamond.

Governors, particularly in New England, have positioned the projects as vital to bringing down energy costs in their states — some of which had been scheduled to begin generating power this year. Attorneys general in Connecticut, New York and Rhode Island — who have tussled with the administration over its efforts to slash other climate initiatives — joined the developers and filed their own lawsuits to contest the administration’s stoppage.

The New England power grid operator said offshore wind projects are included in its planning forecasts and are needed to help meet electricity demand. Attorneys for the PJM Interconnection, a regional transmission organization stretching 13 states, supported CVOW’s motion and argued that the project will help provide much-needed generation in the region amid already high demand.

“Given the size of the project and the long lead times associated with development of alternatives, further delay of the project will cause irreparable harm to the 67 million residents of this region that depend on continued reliable delivery of electricity,” the RTO said in a recent filing.

Trump administration officials met with a bipartisan group of governors on Friday on plans to direct PJM to hold a special auction for technology companies to fund the construction of new power plants needed to supply data centers — part of the president’s effort to address growing affordability concerns.

Trump energy officials have repeatedly put baseload energy sources, like natural gas and nuclear, at the center of their agenda, while targeting wind power as intermittent and unreliable.

Others contend that the stop-work orders may have impacts beyond states’ borders.

Alaska GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who is traveling this week to Copenhagen, Denmark, told POLITICO she is hoping to meet with Ørsted, the Danish developer of two of the projects impacted by the stop-work orders.

“You have this project that has been underway for years, millions of dollars, 80 percent complete, and then you have, ‘Sorry, that’s not on our approved list.’ Now they go through the courts,” she said of Ørsted’s Revolution Wind project.

“OK, now we’re back on. But what is the message that is sent to Ørsted? What is the message that is sent to any of these companies about the reliability of working on a project in the United States? I worry about that.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F59%2F40%2Ffc9ec3144bbeab3d327edaa46153%2Fblock-island-wind-farm-47493.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 11:00:15.212199

On one hand, you have the world’s largest market, China, accepting EVs and plug-in hybrids in even greater numbers than ever before. Meanwhile, in Europe, manufacturers are pulling back on their EV manifestos as the European Union provides some respite in the face of slower-than-predicted adoption.

Toyota, by contrast, has always been pro-ICE. For years, the company has questioned its competitors and governments, who have been advocating exclusively for electric vehicles. And while the company has shown off various plans for EVs, they’ve maintained a more balanced approach.

Read: Toyota GR GT Looks Like A Batmobile And Hits Like A Supercar

Now, it may be clear that Toyota wasn’t going to say goodbye to combustion without a fight, but we imagine not many would have predicted the unveiling of the GR GT: a production-slated halo supercar with a ferocious twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter hybridized V8 engine.

The Fight for Identity

In an era of tightening emissions regulations and downsized powertrains, the decision to green-light a V8 may seem almost rebellious. But for Toyota, the GR GT isn’t about volume or compliance alone. It’s about identity.

Nikkei Asia notes that the GR GT has been built without the assistance of Yamaha, unlike its spiritual forefathers, the 2000GT and Lexus LFA. “Automobiles, as an industrial product, are in danger of becoming commoditized,” says Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda. “The engine still has a role to play,” underscoring the importance of the in-house powerplant.

The reality is that Toyota’s focus on keeping engines around will permeate throughout its lineup for the foreseeable future. In June 2025, Toyota convened suppliers at an internal combustion engine rally, where executives outlined plans to develop new engines, including high-output units, while maintaining overall engine production volumes through 2030.

It was a clear signal that Toyota sees a long runway for combustion, even as the market fragments.

Satisfying the Giants: US vs China

However, Toyota is still hedging its bets with EVs, especially when it comes to China. Over there, the car-buying population continues to march towards an all-electric future.

Toyota, like all foreign manufacturers, is feeling the pinch against local rivals. At a supplier event in Shanghai last summer, a Toyota executive drew rare applause by declaring, “In China, we will focus not on cars for the global market, but on cars made specifically for China.”

He added pointedly that if Japan’s headquarters hesitated on investment, he would “explain things to them directly.”

That shift is already visible in the product lineup. The bZ3X electric SUV, launched in March 2025 through GAC Toyota, was co-developed with Guangzhou Automobile Group and uses cost-effective lithium iron phosphate batteries. Priced from 109,800 yuan or about $15,300, it surpassed 10,000 units in monthly sales by November. A bZ7 electric sedan is set to follow.

Hybrid Momentum in America

Back in the US, where EV adoption is not as clear-cut, Toyota is investing in hybrid production. The move is driven by strong demand as hybrids accounted for roughly 13 percent of new-vehicle sales in the U.S. during the third quarter of 2025.

Toyota opened its new battery plant in North Carolina on November 12. Toyota Motor North America President Tetsuo Ogawa called it “a pivotal moment in our company’s history.”

On the same day, Toyota announced plans to invest up to $10 billion over five years to expand U.S. production of hybrids and related components, boosting output at five American plants and reducing reliance on Japanese imports.

Is Betting on Everything the Smartest Bet?

Of course, building cars powered by everything from V8 hybrids to LFP-battery EVs is expensive. Toyota spent ¥1.3 trillion on R&D in the year ending March 2025, which is roughly on par with BYD, and well ahead of many rivals.

To manage the burden, Toyota has begun leaning more openly into partnerships, including work with NTT on AI-based crash prevention and a collaboration with Waymo on autonomous driving.

In a market increasingly obsessed with picking a single technological winner, Toyota’s refusal to do so may look risky. But if the global auto future really is plural rather than uniform, betting on engines, rather than shunning them, may yet prove to be the company’s most calculated move of all.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/008tholdgy1i5gohe92r5j32hn1e71ko-copy-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 09:58:59.212554

Renewable energy investor Kushagra Nandan, who cofounded SunSource Energy in 2011 and biofuel firm REnergy Dynamics (RED) in 2024, has launched a new clean technology company, LNK Energy, along with investor Varun Karad and Paritosh Ladhani, joint managing director of SLMG Beverages, India’s largest Coca-Cola bottler.

The trio plans to invest around ₹10,000 crore over the next five years to set up a solar equipment manufacturing factory in Maharashtra, and later expand operations into green fuels, including green hydrogen, renewable energy development, and energy storage.

The first project involves a 6 gigawatt solar cell and module manufacturing plant with integrated ingot and wafer facilities at Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar in Maharashtra. The company, incorporated last year, has already signed a memorandum of understanding with the Maharashtra government for the project.

Over time, LNK Energy will also manufacture key adjacencies such as junction boxes, battery platforms, and related energy storage components, supporting the development of a robust domestic clean energy ecosystem, the three investors told Business Standard in an interview.

In the long run, the plan is to build a renewable energy generation portfolio as an independent power producer and through hybrid open-access solutions, integrating storage, solar, and other forms of renewable energy to create a fully integrated platform spanning manufacturing, fuels, and operating assets.

“In the first phase of setting up the plant in Maharashtra, we plan to invest ₹1,000 crore. We have already received approvals from lenders — mostly domestic — to raise ₹700 crore for the project, while the remaining ₹300 crore will be infused as equity,” Ladhani said. The broader ₹10,000 crore investment will be deployed over time across the manufacturing and clean energy platform.

The investors said the time is ripe for new-age manufacturing to be integrated with renewable energy technologies and long-term patient capital in India, starting with solar manufacturing and batteries and eventually moving into green fuels.

“We have been working on this idea for one and a half years and have been working with a technology team from Germany for its expertise in setting up solar cell manufacturing. We also plan to participate in the solar production-linked incentive scheme,” Nandan said.

Asked whether the ongoing consolidation in the solar power sector makes this the right time to commit capital, Nandan said the government has launched several programmes to promote domestic solar manufacturing, including the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers, which provides confidence.

Senate Bill 26-022, introduced by Sen. Marc Snyder, Senate Minority Leader Cleave Simpson, House Minority Leader Jarvis Caldwell and Rep. Amy Paschal, gives us more time to find affordable and reliable replacement power for the coal-fired unit at our Ray Nixon Power Plant.

Under current state law, we must retire this unit by the end of 2029. We cannot meet this deadline without significant impacts on customers’ bills.

Make no mistake; we’re not abandoning the ultimate goals in our Clean Energy Plan, and we will retire Nixon. We are asking for more time so we can accomplish this retirement in a manner that is more affordable for our community.

Our Sustainable Energy Plan, adopted in 2020, set a path to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80% by 2030 and included plans to retire Nixon.

We have made tremendous progress in this plan, including the retirement of the former coal-powered Martin Drake Power Plant; however, we faced very unfavorable market conditions when seeking to replace the 200 megawatts of power generated by Nixon.

In 2023 and 2024, we sought renewable energy projects for this replacement power. The bids were 50-60% higher than forecasted.

If we had pursued those projects, customers would face an estimated additional 13.9% electric rate increase over 10 years. Combined with the already-approved annual electric base rate increases through 2029, this would result in a total rate increase of 35% over five years and a nearly 50% increase in the next 10 years.

The combination of these market conditions, the lack of immediately viable transmission developments in Colorado, and the ever-increasing demand for electricity has created a perfect storm against our ability to achieve Colorado’s goals before the state’s deadline.

When we retire a power plant, we must have reliable replacement power ready to go. That includes base-load power or energy that is available 24/7, even when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining.

We are taking important steps to ensure we have this power in a way that protects affordability. This April we will enter the Southwest Power Pool Regional Transmission Organization, giving us access to renewable energy from elsewhere at substantially lower prices than if we were to acquire these resources ourselves.

Later this year, we’ll update our Sustainable Energy Plan to help us chart our energy transition.

As Rep. Amy Paschal shared at a news conference last week, the people that care about the environment, and those that care about affordability and reliability are not different groups. These are things we all care about and need to carefully balance.

Citizens and customers may voice their opinion on the proposed legislation in a variety of ways in the coming months, including contacting their legislators.

Community leaders from across the rural south have come together to fight the Scottish government's position on renewable energy developments.

They now plan to join unified appeals from the Highlands and North East for Holyrood to pause all major planning applications.

More than 40 community councils and other organisations from across the Borders, Dumfries and Galloway, East Lothian and South Lanarkshire packed into Jedburgh town Hall for the convention.

The Scottish government denied that communities were being ignored during site specific assessments of renewable energy planning applications.

As the transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy gathers pace, the location of infrastructure to support the change has become increasingly contentious.

From a trickle of wind farm applications in areas like the Borders and the Highlands a decade ago, many rural communities are now facing a flood of development proposals for increasingly higher turbines, battery energy compounds, vast solar parks and new electricity sub stations.

Highlands councillor Helen Crawford began a push back last year which led to a unified statement on behalf of 50 community councils in her area being sent to Holyrood.

As well as asking the government to oppose the ""industrialisation"" of the countryside and protect communities, the appeal called for a planning inquiry, and all major applications to be paused.

Councillor Crawford, who was a guest speaker at the Jedburgh convention on Saturday, said: ""We need an urgent review of what is happening to our countryside - people from Shetland to here in the Borders are deeply concerned.

""We are starting to come together and that unified voice is powerful.

""It is becoming increasingly difficult for the Scottish government to ignore what rural communities are saying.""

A similar unified statement from community councils in the rural North East has already been sent to the Scottish government.

And, during the Jedburgh meeting, it was agreed that a document for the South of Scotland will be drawn up over the coming months.

Convention organiser Bob Hope, who is chair of Leitholm, Eccles and Birgham community council, said: ""The government promised that they would listen to us as communities when considering renewable energy applications, but they haven't and we are now having to come together in an effort to have a voice.""

He added the Highland statement had already been put in front of First Minister John Swinney.

Hope said: ""The North East has added its voice, and we will be doing the same.

""There comes a time when the Scottish government will have to listen to rural communities.""

The Scottish government aims to generate around half of the country's overall energy consumption from renewable sources by 2030.

Energy Secretary Gillian Martin, who declined an invitation to the South of Scotland convention, said: ""Renewable energy is set to further turbo-charge the economy of Scotland, and will provide many more jobs for the communities across the country as well as wider infrastructure benefits.

""The renewables industry also has a large positive impact on the domestic supply chain which includes many businesses based in Scotland.

""Increased generation of renewable energy is critical to the energy security of the country, and have the potential to reduce our reliance of fossil fuels and the price volatility they come with.""

Almost all rural towns and villages across the South of Scotland are currently either fighting planning applications or already have renewable energy developments on their doorstep.

Moffat Community Council is opposing proposals for wind farms and battery energy storage systems.

Chair Mick Barker said: ""Although the developers have a strategy for exploiting our landscapes and our communities, our council and government appear to be without any strategy.

""We are facing a Klondyke gold rush for space around our communities that they can develop.""

Fiona Nugent believes that developments near her home in Newcastleton are responsible for an increased risk of flooding.

She said: ""These developments don't just spoil the views, they damage the area.

""I can tell how bad the river is going to be by the amount of water pouring down the hill - the turbines are all the way around the headwaters of Hermitage Water and Liddel Water.

""Our village now has its back up against the wall.""

Borders MP John Lamont, who was one of the guest speakers at the convention, is backing a unified statement for the South of Scotland being sent to Holyrood.

He said: ""While Westminster determines the need under the Electricity Act, it is absolutely the planning process here in Scotland that approves all these applications.

""The power is very much with the Scottish government and I applaud the communities that are saying they have had enough.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ab30/live/99278270-f45b-11f0-8650-c15b6ede387c.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 10:59:47.322337

ValOre Metals expects preliminary economic assessment completion by end-2026 for Pedra Branca whilst pursuing acquisitions that could provide production in 2026.","Western dependence on concentrated supply sources has elevated battery metals from industrial commodities to national security imperatives, with single-country dominance in processing and production creating vulnerabilities that 2025 export restrictions and geopolitical tensions have starkly exposed across rare earths, nickel, and platinum group metals sectors.

Coordinated financing mechanisms, expedited permitting frameworks, price support discussions, and multi-billion dollar bilateral agreements demonstrate fundamental policy shift from recognition of supply vulnerabilities to active deployment of development finance, export credit agencies, and sovereign wealth fund partnerships for strategically significant projects.

Breakthrough processing technologies, geological advantages, and alternative extraction methods are demonstrating pathways to compete with incumbent low-cost producers through natural cost reductions, superior environmental performance, and elimination of traditional cost drivers rather than relying solely on premium pricing or subsidy support.

Electric vehicle manufacturing, renewable energy infrastructure, steel industry transition to direct reduction processes, and defence system requirements generate sustained demand across battery metals value chains, with hybrid vehicle dynamics and clean steel production proving more favourable to metals demand than earlier transition scenarios anticipated.

Multiple projects with completed or advancing feasibility studies, secured or progressing permits, established strategic partnerships, and near-term financing catalysts provide investors with exposure to assets transitioning from exploration to development execution within compressed 12-24 month timeframes backed by government coordination and strategic offtaker engagement.

Chinese export restrictions on rare earths, Indonesian dominance of nickel processing, and mounting concerns over Western defence and automotive manufacturing dependencies have elevated battery metals from industrial commodities to matters of national security. Against this backdrop, a cohort of advanced Western projects is progressing toward production with government backing, technical innovation, and partnership strategies designed to address the supply vulnerabilities that recent events have starkly illuminated.

For investors evaluating battery metals exposure, the distinction between aspirational exploration projects and assets approaching development decisions with government support, strategic partnerships, and demonstrated technical viability has become critical. The projects examined here—spanning heavy rare earths in Sweden and Australia, platinum-palladium in Brazil, and nickel and iron in Tanzania and Canada —represent advanced-stage opportunities positioned at the intersection of strategic necessity and commercial readiness.

Europe & Australia's Heavy Rare Earth Supply Security

Leading Edge Materials is advancing its Norra Kärr heavy rare earth project in Sweden towards a prefeasibility study expected to complete in the first half of 2026. The project's strategic significance derives from both its production profile and timing. CEO Kurt Budge emphasises the scale:

""If I look at the Lynas announcement back in October 2025 about the expansion of their Malaysian plant for heavy rare earth production, their nameplate capacity for that plant was 250 tonnes of dysprosium and 50 tonnes of terbium oxide. Norra Kärr is 248 tonnes of dysprosium and 38 tonnes of terbium oxides.""

This comparison positions Norra Kärr's output at comparable scale to expansions undertaken by Lynas Rare Earths, one of the few significant rare earth producers outside China. The project benefits from 16 years of technical work providing substantial data foundation. The current programme focuses on optimising mineral processing through 28,000 metres of drill core test work and upgrading the mineral resource classification.

Defence implications add urgency beyond industrial applications.

""When it comes to defence and whether it be equipment or armaments, depending on what global alliances form, can we really be reliant on heavy rare earths that come from jurisdictions that may not necessarily be fully aligned with Europe in our manufacturing processes to produce the equipment to the armaments we need,"" Budge questions.

Leading Edge is pursuing a mining lease decision in Sweden expected in the near future whilst engaging with downstream permanent magnet manufacturers. The development timeline positions the resource approximately three to four years from production.

Interview with Kurt Budge, CEO of Leading Edge Materials

Cobra Resources is advancing a heavy rare earth in-situ recovery project in South Australia with unique palaeochannel geology that bypasses traditional clay-hosted operational challenges. Recent field hydrology studies demonstrate exceptional permeability and connectivity, achieving pump rates of nearly 20,000 litres per day with 60% tracer recovery in four days at 7-metre well spacing.

The most significant technical development is natural acid generation from sulfide-rich organics within the ore body. As Managing Director ad CEO Rupert Verco explained,

""Our ore body is very unique. It's got natural high sulfides in the organics. And we've shown in bench scale tests and based on some of the observations in our field tests, we put an oxidant into that ore and it creates a reaction that produces sulfuric acid.""

This characteristic addresses one of the largest cost drivers in rare earth recovery.

""Sulfuric acid's one of your primary costs in the recovery of rare earth and this gives us a significant opportunity to really decouple ourselves from supply chain risk, particularly sourcing equipment and consumables from China and give ourselves some self-reliance, further drive down that cost basis and control our acid generation,"" Verco added.

Current testing indicates acid consumption under 4 kilograms per ton of ore—dramatically lower than typical rare earth operations. Metallurgical breakthroughs centre on cerium suppression with the ability to suppress 90% of cerium and results to concentrate containing 35% magnet rare earths and nearly 50% heavy rare earths—exceptional by global standards.

The company controls 3,300+ square kilometres of prospective tenure and plans resource drilling in early 2026, targeting 4,000-5,000 tons annual mixed rare earth carbonate production with modular, low-capex development.

Interview with Rupert Verco, CEO of Cobra Resources

The platinum-palladium market has shifted dramatically from anticipated decline to structural deficit. ValOre Metals CEO Nick Smart,Smart explains the dynamics:

""Instead of this declining picture, you've had a steady level of demand, but the last few years with prices as low as they have been has not incentivized as new supply to come on. As a result, you've got the situation of steady demand, declining supply, so older mines particularly in South Africa which become more and more challenging to operate, more costly to operate, and you have a drop off in terms of supply and that leads to that deficit situation that we're seeing today.""

ValOre Metals is transforming from a single-asset platinum-palladium explorer into an integrated precious metals producer across Brazil, pursuing strategic acquisitions of advanced-stage projects whilst advancing the flagship Pedra Branca project towards a preliminary economic assessment by end-2026.

Stable jurisdiction, fantastic infrastructure, good access to electricity and a supportive government in terms of permitting and bringing that forward - that's a huge advantage for us,"" Smart noted.

ValOre targets H2 2028 production from Pedra Branca's initial phase following an 18-month construction period after licensing approval, leveraging Brazil's trial mining pathway that allows demonstration-scale operations at one-tenth of full capacity.

Nickel Secures Major Projects Office Referral

Lifezone Metals acquired BHP's 17% stake in Kabanga for deferred consideration, gaining 100% control of one of the world's highest-grade undeveloped nickel assets. Chief Financial Officer Ingo Hofmaier detailed the transaction economics: payment is structured as $10 million due 12 months after FID, plus $28 million indexed to Lifezone's share price after declaring commercial production.

""Tanzania is expected to become an exporter of electricity in the next couple of years once they have gone through a maintenance cycle of the older ones now that the newer ones are coming on,"" Ingo confirmed.

Tanzania's infrastructure improvements have fundamentally altered the project's viability. The country commissioned three new hydropower stations creating electricity surplus where shortages previously existed, with 95-98% grid availability replacing diesel generators.

""Environmental concerns are one element but the key thing is that traceability of nickel sulfates that ultimately go through western smelters and end up in the defense industries or the stainless steel industry,"" Ingo emphasises.

Indonesian production, primarily Chinese-controlled, now represents 70-80% of global supply—concentration exceeding OPEC's oil market dominance. Lifezone is in advanced discussions with US DFC, European ECAs, and Mineral Security Partnership members. The company targets 60/40 debt-to-equity project financing with FID targeted for late 2026.

""We are in regular touch with European capitals, Washington and Tokyo through the MSP, the Mineral Security Partnership. We are very well advanced in due diligence exercises with several of them,"" Ingo confirmed.

Interview with Ingo Hofmaier, Chief Financial Officer of Lifezone Metals

Canada Nickel's Crawford project has been referred to Canada's Major Projects Office, becoming one of only three mining projects selected for expedited government support. The Minister of Natural Resources Tim Hodgson personally flew to the Crawford site for the announcement. His statement emphasized the project's national significance:

""With global nickel demand surging, now is the moment for Canada to build on over 140 years of nickel-mining legacy in Northern Ontario - and bring greater reliability and sustainability to the global commodities market for our allies. That's why the Crawford Nickel Project is now with the Major Projects Office: to move faster, get shovels in the ground sooner, unlock jobs and Indigenous equity opportunities, and raise the bar for clean, responsible mining.""

Prime Minister Carney stated that Crawford is setting a new standard in terms of how responsible mining gets done, representing explicit political commitment. Canada Nickel CEO Mark Selby emphasised the significance:

""When you have the Prime Minister of the country talking about the fact that Crawford is setting a new standard, using those kind of words in the speech that he did, you can be certain that he wants to make sure that we deliver on what his statement is saying as coming true.""

Beyond domestic coordination, the MPO facilitates connections with international funding sources. Selby explained that being sponsored by the major project office means having express pass to the front of the line referencing French, German, and Japanese funding programmes.

Canada Nickel committed to breaking ground by end of 2026, as Selby outlined, targeting construction decision in late Q3 or early Q4 2026.

""Starting from now, you'll see a number of financing announcements from the different bits and pieces with a view to having the package in place by mid-year.""

Interview with Mark Selby, CEO of Canada Nickel

Steel Decarbonisation

Champion Iron operates at the nexus of battery metals supply chains through its role in steel industry decarbonisation. The company's ultra-high-grade iron ore concentrate proves essential to the direct reduction iron processes that enable low-carbon steel production for electric vehicles, wind turbines, and clean energy infrastructure.

CEO David Cataford explains the strategic importance:

""As we go into the next years and we get into a bigger transition into decarbonising the steel industry, we definitely think those premiums can increase. We have seen those sort of shifts. Is it predictable to a sense that we can put a date on it? No. But we know the trends make quite a lot of sense for us to position our material.""

Champion delivered its strongest quarterly performance in two years with approximately $175 million EBITDA and record sales of 4 million tonnes. The company's $500 million DR Pellet Feed project is over 80% complete and on track for delivery, transitioning half of production to up to 69% iron ore concentrate—amongst the world's highest grades.

""By producing 7-12 million tons of material that's higher grade, we want to sell more into North Africa, Middle East, and in Europe. That's going to reduce significantly our shipping costs while at the same time increasing our premiums for our material,"" Cataford detailed.

This geographic reorientation enables sales into markets where direct reduction iron production is accelerating as steel manufacturers respond to decarbonisation mandates.

The company's positioning captures the steel industry's inevitable transition toward lower-carbon production methods essential for battery metals supply chains. Electric vehicle manufacturing requires high-quality steel components, wind turbine construction demands structural steel meeting stringent specifications, and battery production facilities require steel infrastructure—all increasingly produced through direct reduction processes that depend on Champion's ultra-high-grade concentrate.

Interview with David Cataford, CEO of Champion Iron

What to Expect in 2026

Government support mechanisms continue advancing, with European price support policies under active discussion, the US-Australia $8 billion critical minerals agreement creating funding pathways, and Canada's Major Projects Office demonstrating coordinated permitting and financing approaches. Strategic partnerships with downstream manufacturers, particularly in permanent magnets and battery materials, should accelerate as supply chain diversification imperatives translate into commercial arrangements.

""What they need now is capex to take it up to full operation,"" Smart noted. ""Through our positioning with ValOre and being backed by Discovery Group, access to capital from North America and Canada in particular is a big advantage.""

The $8 billion agreement between the US and Australian governments for critical minerals development has increased investor interest. Verco emphasises,

""We're going to be in a race with a number of other projects. So we're going to deploy a process with great efficiency to make sure that when that funding does reach projects, we're in a very competitive position for it.""

The 2026 calendar presents multiple inflection points across battery metals projects:

Leading Edge Materials expects prefeasibility study completion in H1 2026 alongside mining lease decision, serving as catalysts for government support programmes or strategic partnerships.

Cobra Resources commences resource drilling in early 2026 with results expected after several months of drilling and analysis, establishing the foundation for economic studies already supported by demonstrated metallurgical and hydrological parameters.

Lifezone Metals targets late 2026 FID for Kabanga following completion of project financing, with multiple financing components expected to materialise throughout the year.

Canada Nickel anticipates federal permit approval in early 2026, followed by progressive financing announcements through mid-year supporting the committed end-2026 construction start.

ValOre Metals expects preliminary economic assessment completion by end-2026 for Pedra Branca whilst pursuing acquisitions that could provide production in 2026.

Champion Iron's DR Pellet Feed project completion positions the company for first commercial shipments of ultra-high-grade concentrate in early 2026, with the seven-year capital expenditure cycle ending to enable material free cash flow generation with thedestocking of approximately 3 million tonnes of high-grade concentrates.

The Investment Thesis for Premium Metals

Single-country concentration exceeding 70-90% across critical battery metals has elevated supply security to national security priority, catalysing coordinated government support through development finance, expedited permitting, and price support mechanisms transitioning from policy discussion to capital deployment

Processing innovations including natural acid generation, hydrometallurgical alternatives, in-situ recovery methods, and surface mineralisation demonstrate pathways to compete with incumbent producers through fundamental cost reductions rather than relying exclusively on premium pricing or subsidies

Electric vehicle motors, renewable energy infrastructure, steel industry direct reduction processes, and defence systems create sustained demand, with hybrid vehicle dynamics and clean steel trajectories proving more supportive than earlier scenarios whilst supply remains constrained

Multiple projects with completed feasibility studies, secured permits, strategic partnerships, and government backing progressing toward 2026 final investment decisions and construction commencements provide exposure to assets transitioning from exploration to execution within compressed timeframes

Feasibility-stage projects with bankable economics, proven technical parameters, experienced management teams, and strategic government coordination trading at valuations not reflecting near-term catalysts, replacement costs, or strategic positioning in stable jurisdictions

Exposure spanning heavy rare earths, nickel, platinum group metals, and steel decarbonisation materials across projects from near-term production through study completion enables staged capital deployment whilst capturing multiple demand drivers across automotive, industrial, energy, and defence applications

Projects concentrated in established mining regions with reliable infrastructure, proven regulatory pathways, and community support provide optionality on government programmes and premium pricing for traceable materials whilst contrasting with emerging market political risk

TL;DR

Battery metals supply chain vulnerabilities exposed through 2025 export restrictions have elevated strategic importance from industrial concern to national security imperative, catalysing government coordination mechanisms, multi-billion dollar financing agreements, and expedited permitting frameworks. Advanced Western projects spanning rare earths, nickel, platinum group metals, and steel decarbonisation materials are progressing toward 2026 development decisions with demonstrated technical breakthroughs enabling cost-competitive production, completed feasibility studies establishing bankable economics, and strategic partnerships securing downstream offtake. Supply concentration exceeding 70-90% in incumbent producers, structural demand growth from decarbonisation imperatives across electric vehicles, renewable energy, and clean steel production, and government backing transitioning from policy recognition to capital deployment create favourable conditions for projects with jurisdictional advantages, proven management teams, and near-term execution catalysts. The 2026 calendar presents multiple inflection points including prefeasibility completions, final investment decisions, permit approvals, and construction commencements across projects positioned at the intersection of strategic necessity and commercial readiness.

The entire developed world spent the last 50 years playing a game of thermodynamic arbitrage to avoid the cost of domestic energy production.
We can calculate the “Substitution Penalty” using 2024 production data: Human Grid Load: ~4,200 kWh/year.","My apologies for the one week gap. Occasionally, the attic receives an inflow of new information that requires additional reorganizing. And this is why I love writing on Substack. In response to my scarcity posts, I received a research package from Hudson Bay Capital that perfectly crystallizes the “Optimism” narrative currently sweeping Wall Street. The papers, titled “Tech Trumps Tariffs” (Nouriel Roubini) and “No, Stocks Aren’t in a Valuation Bubble” (Jason Cuttler), are sophisticated, compelling, and arguably the most dangerous documents I have read this year. Please read them.

Their argument is the highest-conviction version of the “Soft Landing” consensus. They posit that we are on the precipice of a “positive supply shock” driven by AI that will raise US potential GDP growth to 4%, crush inflation, and justify an S&P 500 target of 9,000. Their thesis is elegant: Technology (AI) enables us to dematerialize growth, rendering physical constraints such as labor shortages and tariffs irrelevant.

It is a beautiful theory. Unfortunately, it violates the laws of physics — specifically, the physics of our infrastructure networks. And, as the latest research from Jones and Tonetti identifies, it violates the “laws” of economics. Using their projections, it also assumes a catastrophic path for wages vs capital that will not be tolerated:

Fortunately, it will not come to pass. The Hudson Bay thesis rests on a fatal accounting error. It assumes that Machine Labor is infrastructurally equivalent to Human Labor. It assumes that replacing a worker with an AI agent is a 1:1 swap in the economic ledger.

It is not. Per-capita productivity equals throughput divided by population only if capital scales at least proportionally with the population. Wall Street assumes the numerator (throughput) scales infinitely, while ignoring that the denominator (capital stock) is physically capped. This isn’t a Malthusian tale of inevitable collapse—I’m not predicting an endpoint where growth hits zero forever. It’s about the path: the short-run thermodynamic penalties and ergodicity errors that Wall Street’s linear models miss, turning a ‘productivity boom’ into a margin call unless we adapt.

I spent the last week auditing the energy books, and the results are stark. We are not facing a “Productivity Boom”; we are facing a “Thermodynamic Margin Call”. The transition from a human-led economy to a machine-led economy carries a specific topology penalty that Wall Street’s linear models are missing.

This is the Growth Wedge. And it implies that the “Cost of Capital” isn’t going back to zero—it’s going to track the cost of rebuilding the entire US energy grid from scratch.

The Optimist’s Delusion

To understand why the consensus is wrong, we must first steelman their argument. Hudson Bay posits that US exceptionalism is strengthening. They argue that the productivity gains from AI (estimated at 0.5–1.5% annually) will outweigh the stagflationary drag of protectionism.

In their model, AI acts as a deflationary force. By substituting capital (software/compute) for labor, we lower unit costs and expand margins. This justifies a “Sentiment Spread”—a premium valuation multiple—similar to the 1985-2001 period.

The mistake in the AI-optimist model is treating machine substitution as “Hicks-neutral” (a technological change that doesn’t alter the ratio of capital to labor). In reality, this transition is energy-biased and capital-deepening.

The Ergodicity Error

More fundamentally, the AI-optimist model commits an ergodicity error: it confuses the ensemble average with the time average.

Wall Street implicitly assumes that because capital can flow and equilibrate in the long run, it will do so smoothly over the short run. But we do not live in an ensemble of possible economies. We live in a single, path-dependent timeline.

If the copper wires, transformers, and gas turbines cannot be built fast enough to support the AI load in 2027, the system breaks long before it ever reaches the hypothetical 2035 equilibrium.

They see “The Cloud” as a place where value scales infinitely with near-zero friction. But “The Cloud” is not a place. It is a physical infrastructure of aluminum, copper, and megawatts. And unlike the software boom of the 1990s, which ran on the “stranded capacity” of office buildings and efficiency gains from the death of the incandescent bulb, this new boom requires Net New Industrial Capacity (a replay of the DotCom fiber buildout).

Revisionist History: The Decoupling of Throughput

To understand the trap we are in, we have to rewrite the history of the last 50 years. Standard economics holds that the divergence between Productivity and Wages that began in 1973 was a policy failure or the result of corporate greed, the loss of unions, etc.

Institutions and policy certainly shaped how this divergence manifested, but it became unavoidable once throughput migrated from human bodies to owned infrastructure.

Some economists argue that this divergence is a statistical illusion—that if you adjust for inflation correctly (using output prices instead of consumer prices) and include non-wage benefits, pay actually kept up with productivity.

They are missing the point (unsurprisingly). The divergence isn’t a measurement error; it is a Topology Shift.

As the chart above illustrates, Labor and Productivity marched in lockstep for the first half of the 20th century. Why? Because the economy ran on Liquid Fuels and Human Labor. To burn more oil, you needed more men to drive the trucks, man the rigs, and work the assembly lines. Labor controlled the throughput and hence negotiated its proportionate share. In the areas of the economy where this remained true, as the linked paper demonstrates, wages largely tracked productivity:

In 1973, we hit the Thermodynamic Wall. We couldn’t just add more men to burn more oil. We switched to the “Cheat Code” (Offshoring) and began the slow transition to the “Electro-Capital” grid.

The reason “Consumer Prices” (what workers buy) rose faster than “Output Prices” (what workers make)—creating the statistical gap economists struggle to “correct” away—is Global Arbitrage. We used foreign labor to suppress the price of tradable goods (TVs, Toys), but we could not suppress the thermodynamic cost of living (Housing, Energy, Healthcare) in the domestic economy.

Whether you call it the end of the “Family Wage” (Sociology) or the end of “Cheap Oil” (Physics), the result is the same: The Surplus Evaporated.

The Bottleneck Arbitrage:

Pre-1973: Energy flowed through human bodies (food/transport). Labor captured the gains because Labor was the transmission mechanism.

Post-1973: Energy began to flow through increasingly privately-owned infrastructure (wires, pipelines, servers). Capital captured the gains because Capital owned the bottleneck.

The “China Shock” and automation were just accelerators of this trend. But the system didn’t totally bypass the human. Ironically, it increasingly consumed their LEISURE as data inputs to the machine.

We didn’t stop working; we just stopped getting paid. We entered a Barter Economy: we trade our “Audience Services” (attention/labor) for “Media Services” (content). The value of this labor is captured in GDP as Advertising Services (Corporate Revenue), but it is absent from Wages (Household Income). We lost the paycheck, kept the work, and called it “content.”

The Global Cheat Code

This wasn’t just an American phenomenon. The entire developed world spent the last 50 years playing a game of thermodynamic arbitrage to avoid the cost of domestic energy production.

The UK Model: When the UK hit the wall in 1976, they didn’t solve it with efficiency; they solved it with geology (North Sea Oil). When that ran out in 2000, they swapped cheap oil for cheap imported labor.

The EU Model: Europe combined cheap energy (Russia gas) with successive waves of labor arbitrage. The first phase absorbed high-skill Eastern European labor following EU expansion, effectively delaying automation. As wage convergence and demographic decline closed that channel, Europe substituted quantity for quality via non-EU migration. This preserved headcount but diluted capital per worker, intensifying pressure on housing, infrastructure, and long-standing social norms. The model’s instability reflects the same Hicks-neutral error seen in AI optimism: assuming labor inflows can substitute indefinitely for capital formation.

The East Asian Model: The “China Shock” wasn’t an isolated event; it was the last gasp of a 50-year strategy to outsource the world’s entropy to a manufacturing sink.

This becomes apparent when we consider the arbitrage that existed in 1990 that allowed the US (and other developed nations, but mostly the US) to outsource human labor:

The crisis today is that all three Cheat Codes are failing simultaneously.

The China Valve: Closed by geopolitics and demographics.

The Russia Valve: Closed by war.

The Migration Valve: Closing due to a Physical Capital Crisis.

The Hicks-Neutral Fallacy of Migration

Just as Wall Street treats AI projections as having access to infinite energy, policymakers treat migration as having infinite infrastructure. The standard assumption was that migrants moving from capital-poor to capital-rich regions would “level up” to Western productivity.

This is not a claim about migration per se. In a capital-abundant regime that builds housing and infrastructure at scale, migration is productivity-enhancing. The failure arises only when policymakers assume Hicks-neutrality and refuse to build. Migration stress arises not from flows per se, but from the slow-moving stock of housing and infrastructure.

If Physical Capital (Housing, Healthcare, Roads, Schools) is constrained, adding more people doesn’t raise the migrant; it levels down the native and forces them to compete (via higher prices) for these increasingly scarce resources. When the capital stock per capita dilutes, the “B-Sector” (Housing/Services) experiences massive inflation. The political backlash closing borders today isn’t just cultural; it is a reaction to the thermodynamic crowding out of the native working class.

The Energy Investment Equation

The end of the “Cheat Code” is visible in the raw physical data.

For twenty years (2000–2019), the US economy pulled off a magic trick. We grew GDP while keeping energy consumption flat. This was the “Negative Slope” anomaly.

That illusion is over.

Since 2020, the US slope has turned positive (Beta = 1.34). To generate the next dollar of GDP, we must once again use more energy. Why? Because “US Exceptionalism” now includes Reshoring. We are bringing aluminum smelting, chip fabs, and data centers back home.

The “14% Bottleneck”

Here is where the math gets violent. The core of the Bull Case is that AI will “fill the gap” left by a stagnating labor force and efficiency will lower overall usage.

But let’s look at the topology of that thesis.

You can’t efficiency your way out of a shortage.

The US primary energy system consumes roughly 100 Quads (29,000 TWh) of energy per year. However, the electrical grid only generates ~4,200 TWh.

The Reality: The grid handles only ~14% of the nation’s energy flow.

The Rest: The other 86% flows through liquid fuels (oil/gas) and direct chemical inputs (food/fertilizer).

The Human Engine (Distributed & Diversified)

Humans are energetically expensive (~36,500 kWh/year in biological and chemical energy consumption required to sustain a Western worker) but infrastructurally diversified. We draw ~80% of our energy from the “Off-Grid” system: Gasoline, Natural Gas, and Food. Only ~4,200 kWh of that burden is transmitted to the electrical grid (residential load).

The Machine Engine (Concentrated & Constrained)

Machines are infrastructurally concentrated. An AI Agent draws 100% of its energy from the electrical grid. It cannot eat a sandwich, nor can it burn gasoline.

When you replace a Human with a Machine, you are attempting to route the entire economy through a 14% bottleneck. We can calculate the “Substitution Penalty” using 2024 production data:

Human Grid Load: ~4,200 kWh/year.

Machine Grid Load: To generate the same GDP output ($150k), a machine requires ~156,000 kWh of electricity (based on the current economy-wide average capital efficiency of ~1.04 kWh/$, a likely understated assumption as Data Centers run at much higher utilization than the average factory).

Recent work by Jones and Tonetti (2026) provides the mathematical proof: in a system of complementary inputs, growth is constrained by the “Weakest Link.”

The prevailing technocratic interpretation is that Human Labor is this weak link—a drag on efficiency that must be automated away.

This is not just a sociological error; it is a fatal strategic error. You cannot ask a human to build a machine whose stated purpose is to replace the human. It’s as inhumane as asking prisoners of war to dig their own graves. It is not a business plan; it is a declaration of war.

To fund the massive capex required to build the Thermodynamic Grid, we need the political and physical buy-in of the population. We are currently selling them “Fear of Replacement.” We need to sell them “Inheritance.” The Meek don’t want to just serve the machine; they want to inherit the Earth it builds.

Until we correct this narrative — until we make the human a beneficiary rather than a target — the grid will remain the binding constraint. The machine waits for the electron because the voter refuses to dig the trench.

The Predatory Nature of Capital Deepening

Standard economic theory and status quo defending economists assume that “Capital Deepening” (investing in machines) raises wages because it makes workers more productive.

This assumes Energy is elastic. It assumes that if we build a Machine, the grid will expand to feed both the Machine and the Human.

In a 14% Bottleneck world, Capital Deepening can be predatory.

The Machine does not just compete with the Human for work; it competes with the Human for current. The AI Data Center pays for the substation upgrade; the residential neighborhood gets the brownout. And the protests begin:

If you doubt the cost of this transition, look at the divergence between the fuel (Gas) and the product (Electricity).

As the chart above illustrates, the cost of Electricity (White Line) has largely decoupled from the cost of Natural Gas (Orange Line).

The Molecule (Orange): Remains cheap due to the shale revolution and “Associated Gas” surplus. More on that later.

The Electron (White): Is soaring in price.

The Ratio (Green): This is the Topology Penalty. It is the cost of grid congestion, ESG mandates, and transmission complexity. We have plenty of cheap gas, but we cannot turn it into cheap power because the transmission layer is broken.

The counterargument is that the grid can be bypassed or modularized via “behind-the-meter” generation, i.e., Microsoft building power plants. This path has been promoted by the Trump administration. This can be done — but only at the cost of turning software firms into utilities and internalizing capital costs that markets price currently as external. Privatization does not remove the constraint; it converts a public bottleneck into a balance-sheet one, raising the marginal cost of capital for every downstream activity.

The issue is not that this capital cannot be built, but that it cannot be built fast enough, cheaply enough, or uniformly enough to avoid a decade-scale binding constraint.

The “Triple Load” Disaster

Critics might argue that demographic decline will offset this load. This ignores the Transition Period (2025–2035) discussed in my end-of-year post. We are facing a period of Displacement, not just Replacement.

We are squeezing the grid in a Triple Pincer:

The Legacy Pincer (The Human Stays): The displaced worker is still alive. They still heat their home and drive their car (increasingly electric). Their 36,500 kWh load remains.

The Machine Pincer (The AI Arrives): The AI Data Center comes online to do its job, adding 156,000 kWh of new load to the grid.

The Rerouting Pincer (The Electrification): Even the “efficiencies” we are promised (EVs, Heat Pumps) work against us topologically. When you swap a gas car for an EV, you may save energy in aggregate, but you worsen congestion in the constrained layer that sets the system’s price.

The Net Result: We don’t save energy. We add a massive new layer of industrial demand (Pincer 2) while simultaneously dumping the entire transportation load (Pincer 3) onto the same fragile copper wires used by the legacy base (Pincer 1). The policy goal is to raise the grid’s share—but doing so requires rebuilding the transmission layer itself, which is precisely the binding constraint.

We are trying to force a disproportionate share of future growth through a pipe built for a fraction of today’s load.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ru7B!,w_1200,h_675,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41997641-f034-4e7f-92fa-768b65691761_512x359.png",N,,2026-01-18 11:00:19.134783
,Louisiana Environment,2026-01-18 12:00:58+00:00,NOLA.com,Is Louisiana bucking a national trend on greenhouse gas emissions? Here's what the numbers say.,"Josie Abugov, Staff, DAVID GRUNFELD",,,,,https://www.nola.com/news/environment/louisiana-climate-warming-greenhouse-gas-industrry/article_0cf13047-fc0c-4327-a2fc-be2069b48cc8.html,"At the national level, power generation drives greenhouse gas emissions, said David Dismukes, professor emeritus at the LSU Center for Energy Studies.
""Even though it's natural gas and it's not renewable, we're emitting far less greenhouse gas emissions for that power generation,"" Dismukes said.
""It's not just about reducing carbon emissions,"" said Justin Carr, a carbon capture asset manager for ExxonMobil.
She pointed to year-to-year changes in state emissions data, noting that 2023 emissions figures were similar to nearly a decade prior.
""If we remove that one source of natural gas transport, that takes away most of the decrease,"" Terrell said.","Louisiana has been among the nation's biggest greenhouse gas emitters due to its heavy industry, but new data shows the state may be at least temporarily bucking a trend.

While climate-warming emissions increased nationwide last year, Louisiana's share has slightly declined over the past few years and was relatively flat in 2025, the preliminary data from an independent research group shows.

Any reduction in greenhouse gases classifies as good news. But industry and environmental analysts caution that Louisiana's figures should be taken with a heavy dose of caution.

The uptick in nationwide emissions reverses a trend of decreases over the past two years, note analysts at the Rhodium Group, which used U.S Environmental Protection Agency data for its report. Much of the increase was due to utilities burning more coal to help meet the growing power needs of artificial intelligence data centers and residents heating their homes during cold winter weather, the analysts say.

But some of the underlying factors are different in Louisiana.

At the national level, power generation drives greenhouse gas emissions, said David Dismukes, professor emeritus at the LSU Center for Energy Studies. But nearly 60% of Louisiana's carbon emissions came from industry as of 2023.

""We have a much higher industrial base than the average state and we also have a lower population,"" said Dismukes. ""Where industry goes is where our greenhouse gas emissions are going to go in the state.""

It is precisely for that reason that the reductions may come as a surprise to some.

The state has welcomed a variety of industrial plants in recent years, from a booming liquefied natural gas export sector to continued petrochemical production along the Mississippi River corridor. A range of projects are also slated to begin operations in the coming years, such as a nearly $6 billion Hyundai steel mill and Meta's power-hungry AI data center.

Dismukes attributes Louisiana's decreasing emissions to improved efficiency when it comes to both power generation and industry. He highlighted utilities phasing out old generators and replacing them with newer, less polluting, models.

""Even though it's natural gas and it's not renewable, we're emitting far less greenhouse gas emissions for that power generation,"" Dismukes said.

The same is true on the industrial side, Dismukes said, as Louisiana expands its productive capacity without making substantial changes in emissions at ammonia plants, methanol plants and refineries. Greg Upton, the current director of the LSU Center for Energy Studies, also noted that many industrial plants are trying to connect to the grid, which could reduce emissions if the energy being transmitted there is cleaner.

""It's not just about reducing carbon emissions,"" said Justin Carr, a carbon capture asset manager for ExxonMobil. ""It's about consuming less energy and natural gas to save cost, too. There's always a push to make the products with less input.""

A mixed result

Carr argued that Louisiana has the opportunity to decrease emissions ""without sacrificing its ability to be a manufacturing powerhouse"" through carbon capture -- but that technology is highly controversial and it is unclear how intensively the state will pursue it in the future.

Carbon capture involves piping C02 emissions deep underground for permanent storage, but it has faced heavy opposition in rural areas.

Another concern is that an influx of new industry could outpace improvements.

""On one hand, you'll have the emissions intensity of products decline, but on the other hand, you have these billions of dollars of investment in facilities that are going to come online,"" Upton said. ""Even if they're producing a very low carbon product...that can actually increase the total amount of emissions.""

Kimberly Terrell, a research scientist at the Environmental Integrity Project, said that even a single large facility can change the overall picture for the state's emissions. She pointed to year-to-year changes in state emissions data, noting that 2023 emissions figures were similar to nearly a decade prior.

Decreasing emissions from 2023 to 2024 largely came from reductions in natural gas pipeline transport, she said, even as other sectors increased their emissions.

""If we remove that one source of natural gas transport, that takes away most of the decrease,"" Terrell said. ""Individual sectors in Louisiana have been remaining steady or increasing slightly.""

Over the last two decades, carbon emissions dropped nine percent in Louisiana, according to the Rhodium Group, mirroring a larger national trend to a less dramatic degree. Across the country as a whole, emissions declined by 18% in the same period as the country phased out coal power in favor of mostly natural gas and some renewable energy.

But there are warnings that the Trump administration's opposition to renewable energy and embrace of coal could reverse many gains.

What about on the national level?

Competing forces are also playing out on the national level, the Rhodium Group's estimates show.

Last year, solar power was the fastest growing source of electricity. But higher demand in the power sector, largely fueled by AI data centers, and the resurgence of coal due to high natural gas prices — in part spurred by liquefied natural gas exports — ultimately trumped the surge in solar, the researchers found.

""When power demand is growing substantially, both things can be true: You can be bringing a record amount of renewables online, but at the same time you're not really reducing emissions,"" said Michael Gaffney, a lead author of the report.

Gaffney noted that Louisiana has seen some emissions reductions in the power sector, as natural gas has reduced the grid share of coal. Conversely, emissions from LNG exports have increased as more capacity for the facilities come online. Louisiana is the global epicenter of the carbon-intensive industry and President Donald Trump has pushed to expand the sector further.

The three existing LNG export terminals in Louisiana were all among the top 10 carbon emitting facilities in the state as of 2023, according to data from Upton. There are more than a dozen more terminals approved or proposed for Louisiana. The other top emitters were chemical plants and refineries.

Terrell noted that Rhodium's low, medium and high emissions predictions for Louisiana all project a ""massive increase in emissions from LNG,"" even as the state's holistic emissions figures are more varied.

The Rhodium Group found that some of the national emission changes resulted from Trump repealing climate regulations and curbing clean energy tax credits passed under the Biden administration. More effects of policy changes may be felt in the coming years, Gaffney said.

Upton and Dismukes similarly pointed to the impact of the shuttered tax credits, but they cautioned against giving too much weight to some domestic political changes.

""I know broadly where the policy is going and it doesn't matter who it is,"" Dismukes said. ""It's going to be more efficient and having lower emissions and delivering product and commodity at the lowest cost, both environmentally and economically.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/15/015afb34-75e5-11ef-9d7f-876a5df48d0f/6373fd8ad3900.image.jpg?crop=1917%2C1006%2C0%2C37&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-18 09:59:02.744354

Merifund Capital Management continues to track how supply-chain control, regional production and pricing translate into resilience, and Saunders describes “operational discipline and repeatable execution” as the attributes most likely to define leadership as competition intensifies.","Annual delivery data to 31 December 2025 places BYD ahead of Tesla in battery-electric volumes, sharpening focus on scale, supply-chain control and overseas plants, while Tesla’s strategy pivots towards robotaxis, AI and humanoid robotics.

New full-year delivery disclosures tighten the competitive picture in electric vehicles, and Merifund Capital Management Pte. Ltd. is spotlighting a clear change in leadership as BYD reports 2.26 million battery-electric deliveries against Tesla’s 1.64 million.

Set against the preceding comparable period, Tesla deliveries contract 8.6%, while BYD’s battery-electric volume expands 28%. Across its broader automotive footprint, BYD reports 4.55 million vehicle sales, alongside plug-in hybrid volumes of 2.29 million, down 8% on the prior year.

For institutional investors tracking the energy transition, the significance sits in how the lead is built. Scale manufacturing, supply-chain control and disciplined cost curves are becoming as important as early-mover branding, particularly as price-sensitive buyers take a larger share of demand across major regions.

Tesla’s softer trend is most visible in the final quarter of the reporting period, when deliveries slip 15.61% compared with the same quarter a year earlier to 418,227. The end of the $7,500 US federal tax credit at the start of this month adds pressure to pricing, with competitive alternatives multiplying across the mid-market segment.

Governance scrutiny is also sharpening. A coalition of pension investors representing 7.9 million Tesla shares is now pressing for a minimum 40-hour commitment each week from Elon Musk, arguing that operational focus, brand perception and share-price volatility are increasingly intertwined.

Tesla is simultaneously reframing its forward narrative around autonomy and physical artificial intelligence. Robotaxi trials in Austin currently run with a pilot fleet of around 25 to 30 vehicles and retain in-car safety monitors, while hiring activity points to expansion across multiple US cities over the coming year. Optimus, the humanoid robot programme, remains prominent in factory planning, even as rare-earth magnet supply constraints influence deployment pace.

BYD is taking a more industrial route to expansion, backed by integrated production and a broad line-up across price points. Overseas volumes now exceed one million vehicles on the latest full-year reading, up 150% on the prior year, as the group broadens manufacturing in locations including Thailand, Turkey and Hungary to reduce shipping costs and policy risk. Merifund Capital Management notes that current supply-chain mapping suggests BYD produces roughly 65% of direct materials internally. For Anthony Saunders, Director of Private Equity at Merifund Capital Management, “BYD’s manufacturing diversification strategy positions the company effectively against trade policy uncertainties” while “maintaining cost competitiveness through technological advantages in battery production” is now central to its international push.

Cost and pricing signals reinforce that assessment. Industry estimates currently put BYD’s Blade battery manufacturing costs about $11.6 per kilowatt-hour below Tesla’s 4680 approach. As of this month’s published UK list prices, a Tesla Model 3 rear-wheel drive is listed at about $53,586.6, while a BYD Seal is around $61,640 for comparable positioning. In Australia, current market pricing places the Seal about 22% below the Model 3, strengthening BYD’s ability to compete for volume without relying on subsidies.

Policy settings are splitting the market into distinct regional battlegrounds. In the United States, the removal of the $7,500 consumer credit is reshaping demand and pushing manufacturers to route incentives through leases, with some projections pointing to EV penetration easing towards 5% of total vehicle sales over the next year. China remains driven by consumer preference, with the electric share of new-car sales staying close to half on the latest full-year data, and surveys released over the past year indicating that more than 80% of buyers expect their next purchase to be electric.

Taken together, BYD’s delivery lead and Tesla’s technology pivot underline a sector where manufacturing discipline and software ambition are both being priced by investors.

No one elected the judges who keep inserting themselves into the day-to-day policy decisions, and they are a huge problem. Members of Congress need to stop their nonsense. This president is setting the United States on a good path forward to sustain itself into the future for hundreds of years. Other politicians only look to the next election. We need to protect the U.S. first and foremost. Thankfully, Trump is doing exactly this.

Tariffs: Implemented worldwide tariffs in April, helped resolve wars in India and Pakistan, and collecting $200 billion in additional tariff revenue by the end of 2025, with the U.S. economy holding up as noted by The Wall Street Journal.

Immigration: Achieved seven straight months of zero illegal aliens release into the United States, reducing nationwide crossings by 93% compared with the peak under the Biden administration, by enforcing existing laws without new legislation.

Drill, baby, drill: Ushered in energy dominance with record production, leading the world in oil (24.2 million barrels per day, more than Saudi Arabia and Russia combined) and natural gas (nearly 109 billion cubic feet per day), with gas prices at a four-year low of $2.90 a gallon.

Passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act: Made 2017 tax cuts permanent, added childcare subsidies, eliminated the tax on tips, exempted overtime and Social Security from taxation for most beneficiaries, and included Trump Accounts with $1,000 investments for U.S.-born children.

President of peace: Ended multiple wars using economic pressure and military might, facilitating peaceful resolutions in warring nations including in the Middle East, though a Russia-Ukraine deal remained elusive.

He should not allow Chinese students to attend our universities. Their exemption is a mistake. China pressures students to spy for them.

We are safer and our finances are doing much better under President Trump.

Trump should work to maintain control of Congress, and he should focus on expanding U.S. energy dominance policies to achieve full American energy independence, slashing regulations to even further to boost the economy and securing our borders with unprecedented immigration enforcement to keep America first in 2026.

More thoughts from readers on Trump's first year

I had hope originally that he would bring us out of foreign conflicts as he repeatedly said on the campaign trail. I have been severely disappointed in Trump’s second term. He's essentially betrayed everyone that voted for him on America First principles. On the contrary, it seems we're going back to neocon interventionism.

— John Walling, New Jersey

It's worse than I could have possibly imagined, and the spineless Republicans just let Trump get away with it. He has alienated our former friends and is sucking up to war criminals. Things are more expensive because of tariffs, and the environment will degrade faster. For me, it touches so many things in daily life.

— Isabel Ackerman, Montana

I’m afraid there's been no change. Groceries are still expensive, and there's still a lot of political division between people in a way that you can't even sit and have a normal conversation. The immigration raids keep me off the street with my family, just because I'm Latino, even though I'm a citizen. I know I'll be targeted.

— Wilfredo Pagan, North Carolina

I am watching the greatest experiment in freedom and democracy die. It is understandable that Trump is acting with such shamefully malicious behaviors, such despicable abuses of power. To be abandoned by Congress is what is utterly shocking. When coequal branches of government are subservient to one another, the show is over.

And rather than relying entirely on the private sector, Maine should create a public power authority comparable to those in other states that have produced lower rates and greater public benefits.
The benefits of public power are newly relevant to renewable conversion, which requires major investment and skillful navigation through the shoals of public opinion.
Rather than attempting to uproot established regulated utilities, a public power authority focused on generation could be a winner.
Public power would allow us the shape our energy future to a significant degree, and for that reason alone demands debate.","Last week, I reviewed some of Maine’s policy hits and misses in attempting a transition to renewable energy without driving up electric rates to unaffordable levels. Heat pumps are working well, but all-electric vehicles have fallen well short of projections.

But there should be no doubt we need to replace fossil fuels to avert a climate disaster, especially since the cost of new solar installations is below that of natural gas, and over the last two years 80% of new U.S. generation came from renewables. President Donald Trump’s attempts to revert to fossil fuels will fail on economic as well as policy grounds.

Yet Maine faces formidable difficulties. It has the best chance to build renewables of any state in the Northeast, thanks to its wide-open landscapes away from the coast, but there are obstacles that can’t be surmounted without significant changes in way Maine builds and finances projects.

Exhibit A is an Aroostook County 1,200 megawatt wind project that the Legislature authorized and was put out to bid by the Public Utilities Commission in 2022. The effort failed when the contractor chosen ran into serious opposition from landowners along the transmission corridor that increased costs. A new RFP went out in December, supposedly better coordinated with New England-wide planning, but there are reasons to be skeptical it will be any more successful.

There’s no doubt Aroostook wind would be a major new energy source, equal to the Quebec hydropower that will soon flow through western Maine to Massachusetts, helping fulfill the Bay State’s ambitious renewable goals, similar to Maine’s. But the fraught history of the New England Clean Energy Connect line shows that even cost-effective projects are hard to pull off.

Though Maine ratepayers will actually benefit from NECEC, fervent opposition led by the Natural Resources Council of Maine resulted in its rejection by referendum in 2021, with 60% opposed. Only a Supreme Judicial Court decision finding developers that had already begun construction had “vested rights” allowed its completion, two years late and costing about 50% more than the original contract.

Although the Aroostook wind project more directly benefits Maine, it likely faces similar opposition to the necessary transmission lines. And since the Legislature has already ruled out use of eminent domain for private developers, the odds for lengthy delays and litigation will increase.

Changes in state policy and a new state agency could tip the balance back toward completion of projects making electricity more affordable and reliable. The new Department of Energy Resources is a start. It can focus on the comprehensive state energy plan that goes beyond goal-setting to specify what must be done to achieve them.

And rather than relying entirely on the private sector, Maine should create a public power authority comparable to those in other states that have produced lower rates and greater public benefits. Most state authorities were established in the early 20th century around hydroelectric dams that powered industrial growth; Maine missed that chance.

The benefits of public power are newly relevant to renewable conversion, which requires major investment and skillful navigation through the shoals of public opinion. A 2023 referendum to replace century-old Central Maine Power and Versant for electric transmission and distribution with a non-profit Pine Tree Power Co. failed utterly, but its argument about the benefits of public ownership were sound – just misdirected.

Rather than attempting to uproot established regulated utilities, a public power authority focused on generation could be a winner. Unlike CMP and its construction arm, Avangrid, a public authority would pay no federal or state taxes, require no profits, and should be far more responsive to public attitudes and needs. The savings would be substantial, but the ability to persevere for the decade or more it often takes to bring major projects on line could be even more important.

True, state government hasn’t attempted any similar agency-building in decades, but that’s all the more reason why public power is such a compelling concept now. Our major utilities were sold out-of-state, then out-of-country long ago, the result of misguided deregulation efforts.

We no longer have much control over the electric system powering new technology that promises – and threatens – to exceed the demands of 20th century industry. Public power would allow us the shape our energy future to a significant degree, and for that reason alone demands debate.

The real question is who among those who seek to lead Maine after 2026 will take up the challenge?

People in Maryland, New Jersey and Maine have seen electricity prices rise at a rate three times higher than the national average since October 2024.
As a result, energy bills across the country have skyrocketed,” Illinois Rep. Sean Casten said at a Wednesday news conference.
“Americans spend three or four times as much money as Australians or Europeans to put solar panels on the roof.","RIPTON, Vermont (AP) — At a time when the Trump administration rolled back numerous environmental regulations while global temperatures and U.S. carbon pollution spiked, longtime climate activist Bill McKibben finds hope in something that didn’t seem that strong on a recent single-digit-temperature day: the sun.

That sun has provided him cheap power for 25 years, and this month he installed his fourth iteration of solar panels on his Vermont home. In an interview after he set up the new system, he said President Donald Trump’s stance against solar and other cheap green energy will hurt the GOP in this year’s elections as electricity bills rise.

After the Biden and Obama administrations subsidized and championed solar, wind and other green power as answers to fight climate change, Trump has tried to dampen those and turn to older and dirtier fossil fuels. The Trump administration froze five big offshore wind projects last month but judges this week allowed three of the projects to resume. Federal clean energy tax incentives expired on Dec. 31 that include installing home solar panels.

Meanwhile, electricity prices are rising in the United States, and McKibben is counting on that to trigger political change.

“I think you’re starting to see that have a big political impact in the U.S. right now. My prediction would be that electric prices are going to be to the 2026 election what egg prices were to the 2024 election,” said McKibben, an author and founder of multiple environmental and activist groups. Everyday inflation hurt Democrats in the last presidential race, analysts said.

The Trump administration and a bipartisan group of governors on Friday tried to step up pressure on the operator of the nation’s largest electric grid to take urgent steps to boost power supplies in the mid-Atlantic and keep electricity bills from rising even higher.

“Ensuring the American people have reliable and affordable electricity is one of President Trump’s top priorities,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.

Renewable energy prices drop around the world

Globally, the price of wind and solar power is plummeting to the point that they are cheaper than fossil fuels, the United Nations found. And China leads the world in renewable energy technology, with one of its electric car companies passing Tesla in annual sales.

“We can’t economically compete in a world where China gets a lot of cheap energy and we have to pay for really expensive energy,” McKibben told The Associated Press, just after he installed a new type of solar panels that can hang on balconies with little fuss.

When Trump took office in January 2025, the national average electricity cost was 15.94 cents per kilowatt-hour. By September it was up to 18.07 cents and then down slightly to 17.98 cents in October, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

That’s a 12.8% increase in 10 months. It rose more in 10 months than the previous two years. People in Maryland, New Jersey and Maine have seen electricity prices rise at a rate three times higher than the national average since October 2024.

At 900 kilowatt-hours per month, that means the average monthly electricity bill is about $18 more than in January 2025.

Democrats blame Trump for rising electric bills

This week, Democrats on Capitol Hill blamed rising electric bills on Trump and his dislike of renewable energy.

“From his first day in office, he’s made it his mission to limit American’s access to cheap energy, all in the name of increasing profits for his friends in the fossil fuel industry. As a result, energy bills across the country have skyrocketed,” Illinois Rep. Sean Casten said at a Wednesday news conference.

“Donald Trump is the first president to intentionally raise the price of something that we all need,” Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, also a Democrat, said Wednesday on the Senate floor. “Nobody should be enthused about paying more for electricity, and this national solar ban is making everybody pay more. Clean is cheap and cheap is clean.”

Solar panels on McKibben’s Vermont home

McKibben has been sending excess electricity from his solar panels to the Vermont grid for years. Now he’s sending more.

As his dog, Birke, stood watch, McKibben, who refers to his home nestled in the Green Mountains of Vermont as a “museum of solar technology” got his new panels up and running in about 10 minutes. This type of panel from the California-based firm Bright Saver is often referred to as plug-in solar. Though it’s not yet widely available in the U.S., McKibben pointed to the style’s popularity in Europe and Australia.

“Americans spend three or four times as much money as Australians or Europeans to put solar panels on the roof. We have an absurdly overcomplicated permitting system that’s unlike anything else on the rest of the planet,” McKibben said.

McKibben said Australians can obtain three hours of free electricity each day through a government program because the country has built so many solar panels.

“And I’m almost certain that that’s an argument that every single person in America would understand,” he said. “I don’t know anyone who wouldn’t say: ‘I’d like three free hours of electricity.’”

Following the United States' intervention in Venezuela earlier this month, Cuba is expected to lose a vital supply chain for fuel, putting increasing pressure on the government to respond to the energy crisis. In the short-term, this will likely mean relying more heavily on oil-rich neighbours, such as Mexico, to provide supplies. However, Cuba must look for a long-term solution to its energy problems to bring an end to the crisis and enhance security.

The ongoing energy crisis in Cuba has led to residents experiencing almost daily blackouts and gas cuts in recent months. The crisis was driven by years of underinvestment in the country’s transmission network, which led power plants to run below capacity. The country’s energy supply now falls far below the consumer demand. The regular blackouts have forced Cubans to invest in charcoal stoves, rechargeable batteries, and fans, which many residents can scarcely afford.

In March last year, Cuba’s national electrical grid collapsed, leaving most of the island’s population of 10 million without power. Major tourist hotels came to rely on generators, while many had no access to power at all. This has resulted in mass protests, as residents call for the government to address the crisis.

Venezuela has become one of Cuba’s main oil suppliers in recent years. Despite its dwindling oil production, Venezuela was shipping an average of 26,500 bpd to Cuba last year, according to ship tracking data and internal documents of state-run PDVSA. This was thought to cover around 50 percent of Cuba’s oil deficit, while Venezuela accounted for roughly 10 percent of Cuba’s trade in 2025.

However, no cargoes have reportedly left Venezuelan ports for Cuba since the U.S. intervention in the South American country earlier this month. Thirty-two members of Cuba's armed forces and intelligence services were killed during the U.S. attack. President Donald Trump has since warned Cuba that it should sign an agreement with Washington to ensure it continues to receive much-needed oil from Venezuela.

Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, “THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA – ZERO!” He added, “I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.”

Shortly after, Trump wrote, “Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of oil and money from Venezuela. In return, Cuba provided ‘Security Services’ for the last two Venezuelan dictators.” The president went on to say, “But not anymore! Most of those Cubans are DEAD from last week’s U.S.A. attack, and Venezuela doesn't need protection anymore from the thugs and extortionists who held them hostage for so many years. Venezuela now has the United States of America, the most powerful military in the World (by far!), to protect them, and protect them we will.”

Cuba’s president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, responded by writing on the X social media site, “Cuba is a free, independent and sovereign nation. No one tells us what to do.” He added, “Cuba does not attack; it has been attacked by the U.S. for 66 years, and it does not threaten; it prepares, ready to defend the homeland to the last drop of blood.” Meanwhile, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez wrote on X that Cuba had the right to import fuel from any suppliers willing to export it.

The halt of Venezuelan oil exports to Cuba has forced Mexico to step in. Mexico moved ahead of Venezuela in 2025 as Cuba’s main oil supplier, according to a recent Financial Times article, although President Claudia Sheinbaum was quick to say that Mexico is not shipping significantly more oil to Cuba than in previous years. President Sheinbaum said, “We are not sending more oil than we have historically… Of course, with the current situation in Venezuela, Mexico has obviously become an important supplier. Before, it was Venezuela.”

Mexico was estimated to have sent a daily average of 12,284 bpd of crude to Cuba in 2025, contributing 44 percent of the Caribbean island’s crude imports, while Venezuela exported an estimated 9,528 bpd of oil to Cuba, accounting for 34 percent of its oil imports.

The Trump administration is less than impressed by the ongoing export of Mexican crude to Cuba, which could put increasing pressure on Sheinbaum to curb shipments due to the upcoming review of the North American USMCA free trade agreement. The Florida Republican Congressman Carlos Giménez recently threatened, “Make no mistake: if the Sheinbaum government continues to give away free oil to the terrorist dictatorship in Havana, there will be serious consequences as we renegotiate the USMCA.”

As the threats continue to mount, several Latin American countries are feeling increasing pressure from their northern aggressor to change their behaviour. President Trump is strongly encouraging Cuba to sign an agreement with Washington to ensure its oil supply and alleviate its ongoing energy crisis. While Mexico is feeling greater pressure to curb its increasingly vital oil exports to Cuba.

The certification applies to Prime’s Dallas facility, DFW01-01 and its Sacramento data centre, SMF01-01.

Both earn the EPA's label for demonstrating superior energy performance based on verified data across operational conditions such as occupancy, run hours and infrastructure usage.

ENERGY STAR® certification is the only energy efficiency mark in the United States based on actual measured energy use and independently verified performance.

To qualify, buildings must operate with lower energy intensity than the majority of comparable facilities, adjusted for environmental and usage factors.

According to the EPA, certified buildings use on average 35% less energy and emit 35% fewer greenhouse gases than non-certified peers, without compromising performance.

Steve Benson, Senior Vice President of Critical Operations at Prime Data Centers, says: “Data centres play an increasingly critical role in supporting the systems we depend on every day, which places a responsibility on operators to run facilities as efficiently and consistently as possible.

“These ENERGY STAR certifications validate the work our teams do to ensure our facilities are prepared to support customer needs today while scaling responsibly for what comes next.”

Focus on energy benchmarks and performance

The ENERGY STAR® programme uses normalised data that accounts for external variables to create a fair baseline for comparison.

Each facility's performance must be verified by a third party before certification is awarded.

The Dallas facility, DFW01-01, and the Sacramento site, SMF01-01, achieve scores that meet the EPA threshold, placing them among the most energy-efficient data centres in the country.

These scores reflect consistent performance across site infrastructure, IT load and support systems.

Prime designs its facilities with energy efficiency in mind, integrating infrastructure that supports operational best practice.

The company combines design, monitoring and benchmarking to reduce energy waste while maintaining uptime and supporting digital infrastructure at scale.

Sara Martinez, Vice President of Sustainability at Prime Data Centers, says: “This certification is a meaningful validation of Prime’s broader sustainability strategy and our commitment to responsible growth.

“Energy efficiency is a critical component of reducing environmental impact and ENERGY STAR recognition demonstrates that our facilities are performing at the highest standards as we continue to expand our footprint.”

Strategy built around operational efficiency

Prime Data Centers develops and operates hyperscale and purpose-built data centres, with a portfolio that supports global clients through scalable digital infrastructure. Its approach to sustainability aligns with long-term growth targets across markets.

Customers require high performance without energy inefficiency and this standard provides a validated performance marker.

As Prime expands, facilities are benchmarked and assessed against third-party frameworks to ensure operational integrity matches environmental performance.

Thousands of buildings and plants across the United States now hold ENERGY STAR® certification, including data centres, office buildings and manufacturing sites. Certification must be renewed annually, based on updated data and continued performance.

Prime's Dallas and Sacramento sites are among a smaller group of data centres that meet these requirements, marking a step in the company’s strategy to scale efficiently across its global footprint.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/18c396e3893ea73aa61f63859a5f0666:74f4ac66831194879d678ad0bbc8b689/sara-martinez-vice-president-of-sustainability-at-prime-data-centers.png.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 03:57:27.645925

The company documented the 5,000-mile-long road trip that put the Cadillac OPTIQ luxury crossover and a GMC Sierra EV pickup truck to the test. During the drive, three GM engineers gathered data on its hands-free driver assistance system, EV charging, and real-time range prediction while towing a trailer.

""We were able to get firsthand exposure to a lot of real-world scenarios, from trailering features and GPS navigation updates to Super Cruise behavior in unusual situations,"" quality engineering manager Tony Kraatz said.

​​GM noted that both vehicles were equipped with advanced monitoring gear that helped the team ""find the root cause of a frustrating problem"": slow performance at one public fast-charging system. Ultimately, they discovered that the charger's software code had a typo that was slowing it down. They contacted the operator, who promptly fixed the issue.

This kind of extreme real-world testing helps improve overall performance for electric vehicles, which should be a win for greater EV adoption. According to the Department of Energy, driving an EV can help slash fuel costs, though it adds that initial costs for EVs can be greater than those of combustion engine vehicles.

Still, many states offer rebates or tax credits that help offset this. For instance, New Mexico gives residents a $3,000 state tax credit when they purchase a new EV.

EV users can save even more money — and avoid annoying malfunctions like the one described by GM — by charging at home instead of using public chargers. If you're interested in exploring home-charging options, Qmerit can help get you started with a Level 2 charger system. The company offers free installation estimates, too.

Hugh CasswellEast Midlands environment correspondent

""You're talking once in multiple generations that a really new energy source comes into being.""

Speaking this week, UKIFS chief executive Paul Methven said a fusion power plant, set to be constructed in north Nottinghamshire, will have ""global significance.""

UKIFS is the company responsible for building the prototype, known as STEP (Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production), on the site of the soon-to-be-demolished West Burton A coal-fired power station near Retford.

The region's power-generating heritage was one of the chief reasons for it being chosen to pioneer the technology, which it is hoped could eventually provide humanity with near-limitless, clean energy.

Nuclear fusion is the process which powers the sun, and scientists have been trying to recreate it on Earth for decades.

It does not rely on fossil fuels or produce harmful greenhouse gases, and is the opposite of the nuclear fission used in existing nuclear power plants.

Speaking at one of the public consultation events which started this week, head of engineering for STEP's fuel cycle, Michael Lord, demonstrated the process with a model of a tokamak - the device at the fusion plant's heart.

""We're looking to replicate the conditions you would have in a star,"" he said.

""We're taking atoms, we're holding them together under high temperature and pressure, and when they fuse, they generate and release energy.""

Fusion experiments usually consume more energy than they create, but there have been major breakthroughs in recent years.

Scaling the technology up to a point where it is commercially viable, however, is still a long way away.

""I don't expect the first device to be putting power on [the] grid in a way that will bring down energy bills, but all that learning will mean we have a futuristic power supply and power source for generations to come,"" Lord said.

With successive governments having invested billions of pounds in the sector, it can seem like a lot to stake on unproven technology.

""It's not a gamble, it's a calculated risk,"" Methven said.

""We're facing energy security challenges, climate challenges in the future, cost-of-energy challenges.

""If we don't take big strategic decisions and follow through on them over decades then those problems just get worse.""

Overcoming the hurdles that still exist with fusion, he said, is ""the job of the prototype"".

""Solving every one of those problems is a business opportunity in itself,"" he said. ""The spin-off technologies could be massive out of this.""

He added he understands why people living nearby may be concerned about the project, but said the consultation is ""not a tick-box"".

Vikki Wallace attended one of the drop-in events, having moved to the area seven weeks ago.

""We've come for the quiet life, and now all this is happening,"" she said.

""They're going to need thousands of people coming to work here, they've all got to get here, they've got to live here somewhere.""

She added she was worried about traffic noise but was reassured after hearing about the project's transport strategy, which includes new rail infrastructure and using the River Trent for freight transport.

Godfrey Watmough has lived in the nearby village of Bole for almost 80 years.

""Anything that brings security in electricity and energy has got to be a good thing, if it works,"" he said.

""They seem to be spending a lot of money before they know it actually works, but it's going to be an experimental site so that's what you expect.""

“This conclusion is unacceptable given that Micron is expected to receive an estimated $20 billion in combined federal, state and local subsidies. Public agencies overseeing the approval process should require the company to pursue stronger mitigation measures and less harmful alternatives,” said Khadeejah Ahmad, a lifelong resident of Central New York and organizer with JMA.

The lawsuit argues that these ""impacts"" were not properly ""addressed and mitigated"" in the environmental review process. It points to three main concerns that the advocacy group holds:

Potential pollution of local air, water, and soil due to the intensive use and disposal of toxic forever chemicals;

Harms resulting from the destruction of approximately 200 acres of wetlands, including increased flood risk to surrounding properties;

The project’s enormous carbon footprint from on-site emissions and energy demand, and how that complies with greenhouse gas reduction goals enshrined in state law.

“Micron must be a good neighbor to those of us who have lived here for years. The agencies did not adequately make sure those of us who live near the Micron site will be protected,” said Bonita H. Siegel, President of Neighbors for a Better Micron. “The goal of the lawsuit is to make sure Micron moves forward in a way that keeps us and our environment safe. We want Micron to be a good neighbor for years to come.”

CNY Central did extensive coverage on the Environmental Review Process that Micron went through with the county's Industrial Development Agency. Including attending multiple public hearings where similar concerns, to the lawsuit, were raised.

Neighbors and advocacy groups over the summer of 2025, expressed worries about the time allotted to review the extensive 719-page document, which included references, thousands of pages worth of appendixes and further reading.

County Executive Ryan McMahon addressed community concerns at the time by taking a swipe at neighbors who had previously challenged projects in Onondaga County, calling them ""the usual suspects,"" before saying that some comments were ""interesting and validating"" to hear and would be addressed.

""We’re going to take the comments, we’re going to review them, we’re going to make sure we didn’t miss anything. Did someone think of something we did not? It took us a while, so I don’t think that is going to be the case. Then we are going to respond to those, which gives us the final Environmental Impact Statement,"" he said at the time.

The draft environmental impact statement for Micron passed through the local level, and the NYSDEC began issuing permits for Micron's construction in December of 2025. Which led up to the groundbreaking ceremony on Friday. The first phase of constructing what is being called ""the largest project in New York State history"" is removing hundreds of trees from the Clay site.

The Trump administration unveiled a plan at the White House on Friday that would require big tech companies to pay for the construction of new power generation in the region managed by PJM Interconnection, the largest U.S. grid operator, serving 67M customers in

Quick Insights

Trump's plan would cap how much existing power plants can charge, reducing potential profits for PJM power generators, as evidenced by falling share prices.

Energy equipment makers like GE Vernova, Quanta Services, and Vertiv may benefit from increased demand for power infrastructure due to requirements for new power generation, as shown by their share price gains.

Data centers will have to fund new generation capacity directly and could face mandatory supply curtailments during peak periods if they do not, altering their cost and reliability outlook.

Tony Bennett, president and CEO of the Texas Association of Manufacturers, said Texas' manufacturing renaissance is more about the transition to advanced and smart manufacturing.","Inside T1 Energy's state-of-the-art G1--Dallas facility in Wilmer, employees are dressed in gray and yellow vests, stationed at different points along seven parallel half-mile-long manufacturing lines.

The staff works alongside robots -- some of which blare ""The Imperial March"" from ""Star Wars"" at full volume as they cruise through the crisp, bright factory -- and large, boxy machinery to make 20,000 solar panels a day.

The advanced technology manufacturing facility, about 20 miles south of downtown Dallas, opened last year and employs 1,200 people. Operations have ramped up to 24 hours a day.

""What can we say? We're bullish on American solar,"" Russell Gold, T1's executive vice president for strategic communications, told The Dallas Morning News in a recent email.

The company is investing $1 billion in the state of Texas and in domestic manufacturing, including G1 Dallas and its forthcoming G2--Austin, a 5-gigawatt solar cell manufacturing facility being constructed in Rockdale, Texas. The latter is expected to begin production later this year.

""Honestly, we couldn't think of any other place we would rather be building right now,"" Gold said. ""Texas has got a great workforce, it's got a great business environment and it's got really good energy prices, which are all important.""

Nationwide, manufacturing has stumbled under the weight of macroeconomic headwinds like tariffs and stubborn inflation. Yet in North Texas, the sector has recently experienced a noticeable surge in domestic manufacturing, as other companies also place bets that the region -- and state -- can support these kinds of facilities and jobs at a rapid pace.

Some experts and manufacturers say the alternative energy industry has particularly acted as a catalyst for the uptick, as the region's population continues to multiply and data centers move in to support the artificial intelligence boom.

CLEAN ENERGY, BUILDING RENAISSANCE

Manufacturing in Texas isn't new. It has led the nation as the No. 1 exporting state for 23 years in a row, accounting for more exports than California, New York and Louisiana combined, according to a U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis.

As of December 2024, Texas exports year to date totaled $455 billion, a 2% increase from 2023, and exports accounted for 17.3% of Texas GDP, according to the Texas Economic Development Corporation.

A manufacturing renaissance in the U.S. has been driven by a historic wave of investment in clean energy technologies like wind, solar and battery storage, according to a study published last May by American Clean Power.

MJ Shiao, the trade group's vice president of supply chain and manufacturing, said the largely bipartisan push to reinvigorate domestic manufacturing came from the COVID pandemic, when global trade was disrupted and showed how fragile supply chains were. Then, he said, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 continued the momentum.

In the past couple years, American Clean Power tracked about 200 primary clean power component manufacturing facilities across the country. About 20 of those -- a majority solar -- are in Texas.

""A big driver of that is Texas being a clean energy hub with all the deployments of solar and wind and batteries that are already in Texas, that puts these facilities close to their customer base,"" Shiao said.

Also driving the energy manufacturing wave are parts of the supply chains being completely absent from the U.S. That prompted companies to start their manufacturing businesses domestically with the end product, like a solar panel or battery energy storage system, before adding upstream components like solar or battery cells.

""You do see these clusters building up in and around Dallas, and so that's helped Texas emerge as one of these leaders in clean energy manufacturing,"" Shiao said.

'NORTH TEXAS CHECKS A LOT OF THE BOXES'

In Mesquite, Texas, last summer, Chinese manufacturer Hithium opened its first U.S.-based manufacturing facility.

The nearly half-million square-foot plant East of Dallas is producing complete battery energy storage systems, as well as battery modules and components.

Like the other manufacturing facilities, Hithium's plants have high-level technology with artificial intelligence and robotics.

The facility was at about 60% production with 160 employees, according to James Boswell, Hithium VP for North America operations, who spoke during a panel discussion at The Intersolar & Energy Storage North America Texas conference in November.

""I've built many factories in my career in the U.S., and this was probably the smoothest, fastest, most supportive and complex factory situation that I've been a part of,"" Boswell said. ""Texas has been very beneficial for Hithium and that's why we chose it.""

Abdul El Baba, vice president of advanced technology at Gray Construction, which designed and built the facility, also praised the local community's business-friendly environment, adding that North Texas is becoming a hub for smart manufacturing.

""North Texas checks a lot of the boxes: logistics, talent, incentive and just the growing demand. It's quickly becoming like a magnet for clean energy investment,"" El Baba said.

Companies ""...want to build in the U.S. and that's a key indicator that this is an emerging market.""

'A BIT OF A BET'

The University of Texas at Dallas is also embracing the uptick in clean energy manufacturing, opening its new Batteries and Energy to Advance Commercialization and National Security (or BEACONS) facility earlier this year.

""We're placing a bit of a bet here,"" Joseph Pancrazio, UTD's vice president for research and innovation, said.

"" ... It's easy for academics to stay in the realm of theory and basic science, but we know our best stories are going to be those that support economic development, and we are placing a bet that energy storage is going to be an area for continued economic development not only for North Texas but for the country,"" Pancrazio added.

Supported in part by a $30 million award from the U.S. Department of Defense and millions more in private capital, the 15,000-square-foot facility is designed to develop and commercialize new battery technologies and manufacturing processes, as well as train students for jobs in the energy storage industry. It's set up to fast-track energy storage innovation and close supply-chain gaps.

On a recent afternoon, students in white coats and blue jackets buzzed around the different rooms of the facility, taking notes, weighing out samples of anode material and monitoring the battery-making machines.

BEACONS director Kyeongjae Cho stopped by a lab station and picked up a finished battery.

""What we are doing here is really reengaging manufacturing production, connecting with innovation and streamlining the whole process of novel batteries,"" Cho said. ""This is really leading the change the whole country is trying to achieve.""

HOPEFUL THE UPWARD TREND WILL CONTINUE

The revival is a harbinger of the state's broader manufacturing activity, which is accelerating, according to a recent survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas

Business executives responding to the Dallas Fed's survey reported factory activity expanded at a markedly faster pace in November.

The production index, a key measure of state manufacturing conditions, rose 15 points to 20.5, signaling a notable increase in output growth. Expectations for the next six months also remained positive.

Tony Bennett, president and CEO of the Texas Association of Manufacturers, said Texas' manufacturing renaissance is more about the transition to advanced and smart manufacturing.

""There have been so many advances in production and processing and now with AI coming along rapidly, you're going to see a whole 'nother element to manufacturing,"" Bennett said.

Bennett is optimistic the upward trend in domestic production will continue and Texas is set to remain a leader with the odds stacked in its favor. Pluses include infrastructure that's close to ports; highways and markets; a young workforce; strong education systems with technical colleges and higher education institutions; low energy costs, and business-friendly tax environment.

How Will Trump’s Statement Affect the Stock Market?

This latest post has the potential to affect the stock market. That’s because Trump’s strong endorsement of Julia Letlow on an explicitly pro–oil & gas, pro–defense, and pro–manufacturing platform could create a short-term sentiment boost for energy producers and services (XOM, XLE, OIH, VDE) and defense/aerospace names (LMT, PPA, XAR, ITA), as well as broader industrials (VIS, XLI, IYJ) that are tied to U.S. infrastructure and manufacturing themes. Deere (DE) may see modest positive read-through from rhetoric supporting farmers and domestic production, though the impact is likely smaller and more localized than for energy and defense. Overall, while a single social post has limited fundamental impact, it reinforces market narratives around Republican policy priorities—lower regulation, energy dominance, defense spending—that investors often interpret as constructive for these sectors and related ETFs.

An EPA representative replied to the New York Times’ claims in a Friday email to the Post-Tribune.
“You should not rely on The New York Times as (a) reliable source of information,” the email said.
No one questioned if they were following the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.
The organization gave Lake County failing grades in three categories: ozone pollution, 24-hour particle pollution and annual particle pollution.","A former regional administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Region 5 said the department was created during former President Richard Nixon’s administration to follow science, follow the law and be transparent.

Now, Debra Shore believes the agency and Administrator Lee Zeldin are doing the exact opposite.

“He’s ignoring the science,” she said. “He’s disregarding the law. He’s being duplicitous, and by that, I mean he’s saying one thing and then doing another, which is certainly not being transparent.”

On Monday, The New York Times reported that the EPA plans to stop considering health benefits when setting air pollution rules, specifically from curbing pollutants from fine particulate matter and ozone. The New York Times reviewed EPA emails and documents before publishing the article.

The change could repeal limits on pollutants from coal-burning power plants, oil refineries, steel mills and other industrial facilities nationwide, according to the outlet, which could lower costs for companies but result in dirtier air.

An EPA representative replied to the New York Times’ claims in a Friday email to the Post-Tribune.

“You should not rely on The New York Times as (a) reliable source of information,” the email said. “As usual, the premises of The New York Times’ headline and article were inaccurate – not only were they inaccurate, the body of the actual article proved they were false!”

The spokesperson also said the agency remains committed to its core mission to protect human health and the environment, adding that its mission guides all of its decisions.

“EPA, like the agency always has, is still considering the impacts that (fine particulate matter) and ozone emissions have on human health, but the agency will not be monetizing the impacts at this time,” the statement said. “If you had been paying attention at all, you would know that the Biden administration also didn’t monetize many air pollutants in their rules. No one questioned if they were following the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment. Not monetizing DOES NOT equal not considering or not valuing human health impact. In every action, EPA applies the highest gold standard of science and analysis. The agency’s ongoing work to refine its economic methodologies demonstrates, not diminishes, its commitment to protecting human health and the environment through science-based decision-making.”

In February 2024, former President Joe Biden’s administration finalized a “significantly stronger air quality standard,” according to a 2024 EPA news release. The air quality change allowed 9 micrograms of fine particulate matter per cubic meter, which was a decrease from 12 micrograms of fine particulate matter per cubic meter.

At the time, the agency suggested that for every $1 spent from the action, there could be $77 in health benefits in 2032, according to the previous release.

If the EPA’s goal is to establish a new approach that doesn’t provide false confidence of monetized impacts, Shore believes that the agency should not disregard the positive benefits, but instead go to the National Academy of Sciences to establish an independent scientific review panel and come up with an analytical strategy.

“The prior system, which was not perfect, was done through EPA with many years of work and scientists and experts weighing in,” Shore said. “But instead, right now, their position is by not putting a dollar figure on the benefits, they’re hiding all the positive numbers and saying they’re not accurate, and all you see are the costs. That’s just a complete backflip on how the EPA is meant to work.”

The Environmental Protection Network, an agency made up of more than 700 former EPA staff and appointees, responded to the EPA’s reported changes, saying the decision is part of a pattern of ignoring or downplaying health effects in the rulemaking process.

“EPA’s current leadership has abandoned EPA’s mission to protect human health and safety,” an EPN statement said. “Human lives don’t count. Childhood asthma doesn’t count. It is a shameful abdication of EPA’s responsibility to protect Americans from harm. Under this administration, the Environmental Protection Agency is now the Environmental Pollution Agency, helping polluters at the expense of human health.”

Allan Halline, a retired physician in Ogden Dunes and member of Gary Advocates for Responsible Development, said he was “shocked and dismayed” when he read The New York Times’ report.

“To now simply ignore the health consequences of pollution and value a human life at $0, it’s just jaw-droppingly appalling,” Halline said. “It’s frightening to think that this is going to encourage industry to pollute at their own discretion and ignore any consequences in their decision-making.”

Halline believes the changes will have a “tremendous negative impact” on Northwest Indiana. Some immediate health consequences include exacerbations of asthma, emergency room visits, hospital visits and cardiovascular events, including sudden cardiac deaths.

In the long-term, Halline expects that the community will see an increase in cancers and chronic health effects.

“I think we’re going to look back in about 20 to 30 years and say, ‘Oh my gosh, we shouldn’t have done that,’” Halline said. “But it takes a long time to see those more chronic, adverse effects.”

The American Lung Association, in April 2025, announced that Hoosiers are breathing some of the nation’s most polluted air, according to Post-Tribune archives. The organization gave Lake County failing grades in three categories: ozone pollution, 24-hour particle pollution and annual particle pollution. Porter County only received a passing grade for annual particle pollution.

Ozone and particle pollution can cause premature death and other health effects, including asthma attacks, heart attacks, strokes, preterm birth and impaired cognitive function, according to the American Lung Association. Particle pollution can also cause lung cancer, according to the organization.

The American Lung Association found that, in 2020, Indiana had a lung cancer rate of 72.5 per 100,000 people, with Lake County as one of the state’s counties with the highest cancer mortality rates. A 2016 report from the JAMA Network also found Gary as one of the five U.S. cities with the lowest life expectancy at one point.

Lisa Vallee, organizing director for Just Transition Northwest Indiana, said the EPA’s changes are going to continue benefitting companies that have polluted communities like those in Northwest Indiana.

“Knowing that companies that have been poisoning communities like mine are getting even more of a benefit from the EPA feels like a punch in the gut,” Vallee, who’s a Whiting resident, said. “I feel so bad for the people who have lived in these communities even longer than I have, who are dealing with illnesses and cancer.”

Vallee is most concerned by how the changes will increase pollution, and she’s worried that industrial companies will have free rein nationwide. She’s also upset that it seems that environmental rules are going backwards, and Vallee said she feels bad for the activists who have pushed for healthier communities, especially in Northwest Indiana.

Vallee also believes that states will follow what the federal government does, and she’s worried that state pollution oversight will also lessen.

“I have met so many wonderful people in Northwest Indiana who beg for better outcomes, tight restrictions and more government oversight,” Vallee said. “And instead, in this day and age, we’re getting laxer regulations and reduced restrictions. It’s heartbreaking, and I will not be shocked about anything else that comes down after this.”

The New York Times reported the EPA changes are not the first time that activists have been shocked by the agency’s deregulation. In March 2025, Zeldin announced in a news release that the EPA had the “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history,” according to Post-Tribune archives, which included the reconsideration of power plant regulations, vehicle regulations and terminating environmental justice and diversity, equity and inclusion arms of the agency.

An internal memo to the EPA said Zeldin planned to reorganize and eliminate offices of environmental justice at all 10 regional offices and in Washington, D.C., according to Post-Tribune archives.

Gov. Mike Braun also signed two executive orders targeting the environment, including one to make state regulations consistent with national ones and another prohibiting the use of “environmental justice” in permitting, enforcement and grant decisions, according to Post-Tribune archives.

Even after the EPA’s changes, Shore said she’s surprised by the air pollution changes because she thought there was “a clear linkage” between regulations that have reduced ozone and fine particulate matter and improved public health.

“This sort of wholesale rejection of the foundational mission of the EPA, and its complete give away to oil, gas and polluting industries,” Shore said, “I think many of us didn’t anticipate or expect the outright rejection of the agency’s mission.”

From record-breaking heatwaves to devastating floods, the state is experiencing firsthand the impacts of our changing climate. But what does this mean for Texans and their future?

The Lone Star State is known for its vast landscapes and diverse ecosystems, but it’s also home to some of the most extreme weather patterns in the country. As Gavin Schmidt from NASA points out, we are currently living through a unique phase of climate change—one that is largely driven by human activity.

This past summer was particularly brutal; temperatures soared above 100 degrees Fahrenheit for weeks on end. Many residents found themselves seeking refuge indoors as air conditioning units worked overtime to combat the sweltering heat. It wasn’t just uncomfortable—it was dangerous. Heat-related illnesses surged as people struggled to cope with conditions that felt more like an oven than a home.

But it's not just heat that's wreaking havoc in Texas; flooding has also become increasingly common due to intense rainfall events linked to climate change. Just last year, parts of Houston were submerged after storms dumped several inches of rain within hours—a stark reminder that while droughts may dominate headlines one season, torrential downpours can follow soon after.

These changes aren’t merely statistical anomalies; they have real consequences for communities across Texas—from agriculture and water supply issues to health risks associated with poor air quality exacerbated by rising temperatures.

Interestingly enough, many Texans are beginning to take notice and adapt accordingly. Farmers are exploring sustainable practices aimed at conserving water while ensuring crop yields remain steady despite unpredictable weather patterns. Urban planners are investing in green infrastructure designed not only to manage stormwater but also improve overall resilience against future climatic shifts.

As Jim Green emphasizes during his discussions with experts like Schmidt, understanding these phenomena requires looking back into Earth’s geological history—the ice ages tell us much about how our planet responds over time when faced with drastic environmental changes.

Yet here lies a crucial difference: unlike previous epochs marked by natural occurrences such as volcanic eruptions or asteroid impacts altering atmospheric composition dramatically over millennia—we now possess agency over our actions today which could mitigate further damage tomorrow if addressed promptly.",https://www.oreateai.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a6p7qra6p7qra6p7.png,N,,2026-01-17 22:59:09.031679

According to Community Development Director Deb Sielski, this resolution authorizes county staff to apply for a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Brownfields Assessment Coalition Grant valued up to $1.5 million.

A brownfield site is an abandoned or underused property, often industrial or commercial, where redevelopment is complicated by the presence or potential presence of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants, like old factories, gas stations, or dry cleaners, making cleanup and reuse challenging but also a key part of community revitalization. While not always confirmed to be polluted, the perception of contamination prevents economic use, and these sites can range from small lots to large complexes.

The grant can be utilized for actions such as developing inventories of brownfield sites, prioritizing sites, conducting community involvement activities, conducting planning, conducting site assessments, developing site-specific cleanup plans, and developing reuse plans related to brownfield sites.

The county is planning to engage Stantec Consulting Services to assist with the development of the grant application at a cost not to exceed $7,500. The grant does not require a cost share match and there are no budget impacts at this time. If awarded, the grant will be incorporated into the county’s 2026 budget.

Following the approval of the resolution regarding the grant application, County Attorney Brad Stern brought forward an update on the progress of the county’s application for a grant to be utilized for the redevelopment of the former University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee at Washington County campus. Stern noted that the county had recently received word that there are outlying claims that will be delaying the state’s processing of their application. These include a notice of claim that was filed against the county related to ""an alleged donation the county received decades ago concerning the construction of the science hall,"" in addition to other factors relating to the county’s eligibility.

""We have come to find out in the last few days that the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation — the agency that is statutorily designated to administer the grant — has decided to put the county’s grant on ice for a while,"" said Stern.

“Americans spend three or four times as much money as Australians or Europeans to put solar panels on the roof.","RIPTON, Vermont (AP) — At a time when the Trump administration rolled back numerous environmental regulations while global temperatures and U.S. carbon pollution spiked, longtime climate activist Bill McKibben finds hope in something that didn’t seem that strong on a recent single-digit-temperature day: the sun.

That sun has provided him cheap power for 25 years, and this month he installed his fourth iteration of solar panels on his Vermont home. In an interview after he set up the new system, he said President Donald Trump’s stance against solar and other cheap green energy will hurt the GOP in this year’s elections as electricity bills rise.

After the Biden and Obama administrations subsidized and championed solar, wind and other green power as answers to fight climate change, Trump has tried to dampen those and turn to older and dirtier fossil fuels. The Trump administration froze five big offshore wind projects last month but judges this week allowed three of the projects to resume. Federal clean energy tax incentives expired on Dec. 31 that include installing home solar panels.

Meanwhile, electricity prices are rising in the United States, and McKibben is counting on that to trigger political change.

“I think you’re starting to see that have a big political impact in the U.S. right now. My prediction would be that electric prices are going to be to the 2026 election what egg prices were to the 2024 election,” said McKibben, an author and founder of multiple environmental and activist groups. Everyday inflation hurt Democrats in the last presidential race, analysts said.

The Trump administration and a bipartisan group of governors on Friday tried to step up pressure on the operator of the nation’s largest electric grid to take urgent steps to boost power supplies in the mid-Atlantic and keep electricity bills from rising even higher.

“Ensuring the American people have reliable and affordable electricity is one of President Trump’s top priorities,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.

Renewable energy prices drop around the world

Globally, the price of wind and solar power is plummeting to the point that they are cheaper than fossil fuels, the United Nations found. And China leads the world in renewable energy technology, with one of its electric car companies passing Tesla in annual sales.

“We can’t economically compete in a world where China gets a lot of cheap energy and we have to pay for really expensive energy,” McKibben told The Associated Press, just after he installed a new type of solar panels that can hang on balconies with little fuss.

When Trump took office in January 2025, the national average electricity cost was 15.94 cents per kilowatt-hour. By September it was up to 18.07 cents and then down slightly to 17.98 cents in October, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

That’s a 12.8% increase in 10 months. It rose more in 10 months than the previous two years. People in Maryland, New Jersey and Maine have seen electricity prices rise at a rate three times higher than the national average since October 2024.

At 900 kilowatt-hours per month, that means the average monthly electricity bill is about $18 more than in January 2025.

Democrats blame Trump for rising electric bills

This week, Democrats on Capitol Hill blamed rising electric bills on Trump and his dislike of renewable energy.

“From his first day in office, he’s made it his mission to limit American’s access to cheap energy, all in the name of increasing profits for his friends in the fossil fuel industry. As a result, energy bills across the country have skyrocketed,” Illinois Rep. Sean Casten said at a Wednesday news conference.

“Donald Trump is the first president to intentionally raise the price of something that we all need,” Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, also a Democrat, said Wednesday on the Senate floor. “Nobody should be enthused about paying more for electricity, and this national solar ban is making everybody pay more. Clean is cheap and cheap is clean.”

Solar panels on McKibben’s Vermont home

McKibben has been sending excess electricity from his solar panels to the Vermont grid for years. Now he’s sending more.

As his dog, Birke, stood watch, McKibben, who refers to his home nestled in the Green Mountains of Vermont as a “museum of solar technology” got his new panels up and running in about 10 minutes. This type of panel from the California-based firm Bright Saver is often referred to as plug-in solar. Though it’s not yet widely available in the U.S., McKibben pointed to the style’s popularity in Europe and Australia.

“Americans spend three or four times as much money as Australians or Europeans to put solar panels on the roof. We have an absurdly overcomplicated permitting system that’s unlike anything else on the rest of the planet,” McKibben said.

McKibben said Australians can obtain three hours of free electricity each day through a government program because the country has built so many solar panels.

“And I’m almost certain that that’s an argument that every single person in America would understand,” he said. “I don’t know anyone who wouldn’t say: ‘I’d like three free hours of electricity.’”

PJM is the largest U.S. power grid operator, whose coverage area stretches from portions of Illinois to New Jersey and Pennsylvania to North Carolina.

State lawmakers aim to protect consumers, stabilize the energy market and make Maryland more self-sufficient when it comes to energy.

Experts said if state energy policies and the current PJM model remain intact, rolling blackouts, uncontrollable power surges and skyrocketing electric bills will become the norm.

“It is a simple supply-and-demand equation,” Gov. Wes Moore said. “We need PJM to take action. We need PJM to take this seriously. We need for PJM to build a table that is big enough for each and every one of us to have a seat at that table. We need to make sure that the decisions being made are not being made to us, but they are being made with us.”

The group of governors called on PJM to protect consumers over the next four years by freezing costs associated with stalled power-generating projects. The leaders said such action will provide time to implement new reforms to shield residents.

The governors want PJM to require data centers to either generate their own power, shut down during surges or pay higher prices for electricity.

They also want PJM to conduct an emergency auction, allowing companies to bid on 15-year contracts. The governors believe such action will help stabilize rates and expedite construction of new power plants.

The Trump administration supports the bipartisan call for reform. An emergency auction would need approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

PJM statement

PJM was not invited to the White House event. The company sent a statement to WBAL-TV 11 News that follows.

The PJM Board of Managers today outlined a series of actions to be taken by PJM and its stakeholders in 2026 to address the multiple challenges of integrating new data centers and other large load customers onto the grid while preserving electricity system reliability and affordability for the 67 million people PJM serves.

The board’s announcement represents the culmination of an accelerated stakeholder process that produced 12 proposals. The depth and quality of concepts advanced in that process informed the board’s decision, which incorporates ideas drawn from multiple proposals.

The plan detailed by the board (PDF) includes proposals to be filed directly with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; changes in PJM’s policies and procedures that can be made immediately; and proposed stakeholder processes to inform the Board on complex but equally urgent issues.

The board’s course of action will address the need for new power generation that can come online quickly and is coupled with options for new load customers whose electricity demand can be curtailed in times of system need. Both of these goals will also help address the supply-and-demand imbalance that has the potential to threaten grid reliability and is currently driving up wholesale costs that can impact consumer bills. The board proposes:

Significant load forecasting improvements and increased role for states

Avenues for new large loads to bring their own new generation or enter into a connect and manage framework subject to earlier curtailment

Creation of an accelerated interconnection track for state-sponsored generation projects

Immediate initiation of a backstop generation procurement process to address short-term reliability needs

A review of PJM markets to assess how they can best work in combination to support investment

The PJM Board will seek additional feedback from its stakeholders before deciding whether to extend the price floor and ceiling, also known as a “price collar,” that was in place for the last two auctions to the 28/29 and 29/30 auctions in light of the holistic market review it has asked the PJM Staff to perform in 2026.

The board’s decision drew upon multiple proposals put forth by stakeholders during the Critical Issue Fast Path for Large Loads in the second half of 2025. While stakeholders did not come to consensus on any of 12 proposals, the detailed analyses presented throughout the process helped the board create a comprehensive package that reflects a broad array of solutions.

The board, in its letter, describes the interim nature of the some of the actions taken until the region’s supply/demand balance and reserve margins have been restored. PJM will continue to engage stakeholders, regulators, and policymakers as implementation details are refined and as load growth continues to evolve.

The PJM statement included remarks from David Mills, PJM board chair and interim president and CEO, who said:

“This decision is about how PJM integrates large new loads in a way that preserves reliability for customers while creating a predictable, transparent path for growth. This is not a yes/no to data centers. This is, ‘How can we do this while keeping the lights on and recognizing the impact on consumers at the same time?’ We look forward to implementing, along with our stakeholders, these proposals to manage the phenomenal demand growth we are experiencing.”

The PJM statement included remarks from Stu Bresler, PJM’s chief operating officer, who said:

“PJM is establishing clear, transparent guardrails for integrating large new loads under defined conditions. This proposed course of action will require intense work by all of us in 2026 and involve significant changes, but it’s clear that bold action will be required to support the positive growth that is happening throughout the PJM region and the nation.”

Maryland Freedom Caucus meets to consider options

Also Friday, members of the Maryland Freedom Caucus met in Annapolis with regional lawmakers for an energy summit.

“Families and those on fixed incomes are getting crushed choosing between heating their homes and putting food on the table,” said Calvert County Delegate Mark Fisher, R-District 27C.

The lawmakers heard from panelists that included a representative of PJM and a power grid expert.

“We would implore everyone not to retire any more resources until you have the resources to backfill those retirements,” said Jason Stanek, PJM’s executive director of governmental services.

“This is no longer about a single peak hour. Reliability risks are showing up in more and more hours in the year,” said Diane Holder, vice president of entity engagement and corporate services at ReliabilityFirst.

The United States has seen unprecedented growth across its conventional oil and gas sector in recent months, thanks in no small part to the new directive issued by the Trump administration aimed at increasing oil and gas production.

The Black Fin Pipeline stands at the precipice of the US oil and gas market

The development of the Black Fin Pipeline comes as the United States is dramatically increasing output capacity in the oil and gas markets. Since taking office for his second term, Donald Trump has implemented a new directive aimed at increasing the oil and gas production market in the US.

The Black Fin Pipeline will consist of a 193-mile intrastate pipeline specifically designed to move 3.5 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas from its base in Colorado County to Jasper County in East Texas. The Permian Basin is of vital importance to the US oil and gas markets and has seen a multitude of energy companies developing new pipelines in the region.

The development of the Black Fin Pipeline has been a driver of growth for the US market as energy companies aim to take full advantage of the new approach to oil and gas production under the current administration. The growth of the US market has transformed the nation into the world’s top oil and gas producer, overtaking China by a long shot.

“By helping promote the uninterrupted transportation of American-produced natural gas, the Blackfin Pipeline strengthens our nation’s energy security and reduces dependence on foreign energy sources. Reliable access to abundant domestic energy supports American jobs, bolsters economic growth, and reinforces the United States’ position as a global energy leader.” – Black Fin Pipeline managment

The project has raised concerns with locals and businesses alike

While the tremendous growth of the US oil and gas market has boosted the standing of the nation across the international oil and gas supply chain, locals have raised some serious concerns over the placement of the compressor station, which, under normal circumstances, should be installed in an empty space, away from the city center.

Sarah Bartholet Gwin, a local business owner whose shop is relatively close to the intended location for the compressor station, has filed a lawsuit with the local courts to force the Black Fin Pipeline management to reconsider and possibly relocate the compressor station.

“My family has owned and operated Bartholet Home Furnishings for over 22 years and has been part of the furniture industry in Conroe for nearly 60 years,” said Gwin. “That’s why I feel a moral obligation to speak out about an industrial project that we believe could have serious consequences for the health, safety, and livability of our community.” – Sarah Bartholet Gwin, a local business owner

The astonishing growth of the US oil and gas market has seen a multitude of energy companies developing new pipelines that will dramatically increase the output capacity in the US market. The Black Fin Pipeline is just the latest in a long line of pipelines that will forever alter the perception of US-based energy production.

Administration officials said doing so is essential to win the artificial intelligence race against China, even as voters raise concerns about the enormous amount of power data centers use and analysts warn of the growing possibility of blackouts in the mid-Atlantic grid in the coming years.

“We know that with the demands of AI and the power and the productivity that comes with that, it’s going to transform every job and every company and every industry,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told reporters at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, next to the White House. “But we need to be able to power that in the race that we are in against China.”

Trump administration says it has ‘the answer’

The White House and 13 governors want the mid-Atlantic grid operator to hold a power auction for tech companies to bid on 15-year contracts to build new power plants, so that data center operators, not regular consumers, pay for their own power needs.

Data centers that don't have their own power source and don't volunteer to be cut off from the grid during power emergencies should be billed for the cost of new power plants, they said.

They also want the operator, PJM Interconnection, to contain consumer costs by extending a cap that it imposed last year, under pressure from governors, that limited the increase of wholesale electricity payments to power plant owners. The cap applied to payments through mid-2028.

“Our message today is just to try and push PJM ... to say, ‘we know the answer.’ The answer is we need to be able to build new generation to accommodate new jobs and new growth,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

Former Gov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, Wes Moore of Maryland and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania appeared with Burgum and Wright and expressed frustration with PJM.

“We need for PJM to take action, we need for PJM to take it seriously,” Moore told reporters. Youngkin called it a “massive, massive crisis.”

Grid operator issues its own plan to meet demand

PJM wasn’t invited to the event and said it'll review the recommendations from the White House and governors.

Later Friday, it issued its own plan after searching for months for ways to meet rising electricity demand, including trying to fast-track new power plants and suggesting that utilities should bump data centers off the grid during power emergencies. The tech industry opposed the idea.

Still, a core element of PJM's plan issued Friday involves adopting a formula to cut power during emergencies to big energy users, such as data centers, that rely on the grid for electricity.

Data centers typically have diesel-fueled backup generators to ensure an uninterrupted power supply, but they had envisioned using it in a power outage, not to help grid operators meet demand.

Another element of PJM's new plan is fast-tracking the interconnection of power plants that data centers want to build.

The White House and governors don’t have direct authority over PJM, but grid operators are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is chaired by an appointee of President Donald Trump.

Trump and governors are under pressure to insulate consumers and businesses alike from the costs of feeding Big Tech’s data centers. Meanwhile, more Americans are falling behind on their electricity bills as rates rise faster than inflation in many parts of the U.S.

In some areas, bills have risen because of strained natural gas supplies or expensive upgrades to transmission systems, to harden them against more extreme weather or wildfires. But energy-hungry data centers are also a factor in some areas.

Ratepayers in the mid-Atlantic grid — which encompasses all or parts of 13 states stretching from New Jersey to Illinois, as well as Washington, D.C. — are already paying billions more to underwrite power supplies to data centers, some of which haven't been built yet, analysts say.

Critics also say these extra billions aren't resulting in the construction of new power plants needed to meet the rising demand.

Tech giants say they're working to lower consumer costs

Technology industry groups have said their members are willing to pay their fair share of electricity costs.

On Friday, the Information Technology Industry Council, which represents tech giants Google, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon, said it welcomed the White House's announcement and the opportunity “to craft solutions to lower electricity bills.”

The tech industry is committed to “making investments to modernize the grid and working to offset costs for ratepayers,"" it said.

The Edison Electric Institute, which represents investor-owned electric companies, said it supports the idea from the White House and the governors of tech companies bidding — and paying for — contracts to build new power plants.

The idea is a new and creative one, said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies LLC, a Washington, D.C.-based energy markets and transmission consultancy.

But it’s not clear how or if it’ll work, or how it fits into the existing industry structure or state and federal regulations, Gramlich said.

Part of PJM’s problem in keeping up with power demand is that getting industrial construction permits typically takes longer in the mid-Atlantic region than, say, Texas, which is also seeing strong energy demand from data centers, Gramlich said.

In addition, utilities in many PJM states that deregulated the energy industry were not signing up power plants to long-term contracts, Gramlich said.

That meant that the electricity was available to tech companies and data center developers that had large power needs and bought the electricity, putting additional stress on the mid-Atlantic grid, Gramlich said.

“States and consumers in the region thought that power was there for them, but the problem is they hadn’t bought it,” Gramlich said.

California has not figured out how to reduce single-use plastic. But its efforts to do so have created a headache for the fossil fuel industry and plastic manufacturers. The two businesses are linked since most plastic is derived from oil or natural gas.

In December, a Republican congressman from Texas introduced a bill designed to preempt states — in particular, California — from imposing their own truth-in-labeling or recycling laws. The bill, called the Packaging and Claims Knowledge Act, calls for a national standard for environmental claims on packaging that companies would voluntarily adhere to.

“California’s policies have slowed American commerce long enough,” Rep. Randy Weber (R-Texas) said in a post on the social media platform X announcing the bill. “Not anymore.”

Read more: Very little plastic being recycled in California as state efforts falter

The legislation was written for American consumers, Weber said in a press release. Its purpose is to reduce a patchwork of state recycling and composting laws that only confuse people, he said, and make it hard for them to know which products are recyclable, compostable or destined for the landfill.

But it's clear that California's laws — such as Senate Bill 343, which requires that packaging meet certain recycling milestones in order to carry the chasing arrows recycling label — are the ones he and the industry have in mind.

“Packaging and labeling standards in the United States are increasingly influenced by state-level regulations, particularly those adopted in California,” Weber said in a statement. “Because of the size of California’s market, standards set by the state can have national implications for manufacturers, supply chains and consumers, even when companies operate primarily outside of California.”

It's a departure from Weber's usual stance on states' rights, which he has supported in the past on topics such as marriage laws, abortion, border security and voting.

""We need to remember that the 13 Colonies and the 13 states created the federal government,"" he said on Fox News in 2024, in an interview about the border. ""The federal government did not create the states. ... All rights go to the people in the state, the states and the people respectively.""

During the 2023-2024 campaign cycle, the oil and gas industry was Weber's largest contributor, with more than $130,000 from companies such as Philips 66, the American Chemistry Council, Koch Inc. and Valero, according to OpenSecrets.org.

Weber did not respond to a request for comment. The bill has been referred to the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

Plastic and packaging companies and trade organizations such as Ameripen, Keurig, Dr Pepper, the Biodegradable Plastics Industry and the Plastics Industry Assn. have come out in support of the bill.

Other companies and trade groups that manufacture plastics that are banned in California — such as Dart, which produces polystyrene, and plastic bag manufacturers such as Amcor — support the bill. So do some who could potentially lose their recycling label because they're not meeting California's requirements. They include the Carton Council, which represents companies that make milk and other beverage containers.

Read more: California banned polystyrene. Has the plastic industry spooked the governor into silence?

""Plastic packaging is essential to modern life ... yet companies and consumers are currently navigating a complex landscape of rules around recyclable, compostable, and reusable packaging claims,"" Matt Seaholm, chief executive of the Plastics Industry Assn., said in a statement. The bill ""would establish a clear national framework under the FTC, reducing uncertainty and supporting businesses operating across state lines.""

The law, if enacted, would require the Federal Trade Commission to work with third-party certifiers to determine the recyclability, compostability or reusability of a product or packaging material, and make the designation consistent across the country.

The law applies to all kinds of packaging, not just plastic.

Lauren Zuber, a spokeswoman for Ameripen — a packaging trade association — said in an email that the law doesn't necessarily target California, but the Golden State has ""created problematic labeling requirements"" that ""threaten to curtail recycling instead of encouraging it by confusing consumers.""

Ameripen helped draft the legislation.

Advocates focused on reducing waste say the bill is a free pass for the plastic industry to continue pushing plastic into the marketplace without considering where it ends up. They say the bill would gut consumer trust and make it harder for people to know whether the products they are dealing with are truly recyclable, compostable or reusable.

“California’s truth-in-advertising laws exist for a simple reason: People should be able to trust what companies tell them,"" said Nick Lapis, director of advocacy for Californians Against Waste. ""It’s not surprising that manufacturers of unrecyclable plastic want to weaken those rules, but it’s pretty astonishing that some members of Congress think their constituents want to be misled.""

If the bill were adopted, it would ""punish the companies that have done the right thing by investing in real solutions.""

""At the end of the day, a product isn’t recyclable if it doesn’t get recycled, and it isn’t compostable if it doesn’t get composted. Deception is never in the public interest,” he said.

On Friday, California's Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta announced settlements totaling $3.35 million with three major plastic bag producers for violating state law regarding deceptive marketing of non-recyclable bags. The settlement follows a similar one in October with five other plastic bag manufacturers.

Plastic debris and waste is a growing problem in California and across the world. Plastic bags clog streams and injure and kill marine mammals and wildlife. Plastic breaks down into microplastics, which have been found in just about every human tissue sampled, including from the brain, testicles and heart. They've also been discovered in air, sludge, dirt, dust and drinking water.

At the North American International Auto Show, tires squeal as gearheads put shiny new vehicles through their paces on a pair of indoor tracks that sprawl across the event space. One of those tracks used to be set aside exclusively for electric vehicles as US automakers sought to quickly build out the cars of the future.

But no longer. This year, both strips are open to hybrids and gas-powered vehicles as Detroit continues a pivot away from EVs since President Donald Trump returned to the White House with a pro-fossil fuels agenda.

“The show will always reflect what’s happening in the industry at the consumer level,” said Todd Szott, chairman of this year’s event and an auto dealer. “Obviously things have changed in the EV landscape.” Some industry players say they’re emphasizing “consumer choice” in the cars they’re showing at Detroit’s premier auto event. But some experts expressed concern about the EV pullback’s long-term effect on American automakers as the rest of the globe — especially China — electrifies.

“What we worry about is how competitive will we be on the global stage as the market continues to advance around us,” Michael Robinet, vice president of forecast strategy at auto market intelligence firm S&P Global Mobility, said during a panel Wednesday on industry trends.

Including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, US sales of electrified cars grew just 1 percent last year, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week. Compare that to China, which saw 17 percent growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles last year, and Europe, which saw a 33 percent increase. (US pure-EV market share was just under 8 percent in 2025, with 1.23 million EVs sold — a slight decline from 2024.) None of that seemed to alarm President Donald Trump earlier this week when he toured the Ford River Rouge Complex, which churns out pickup trucks and more in suburban Dearborn. Trump used his time in Detroit to boast of policy changes on EVs and tariffs that he says have boosted US automakers.

“Among my first acts in office was to end the radical left war on oil and gas and stop the crusade to kill American energy and, frankly, to open up cars so that you don’t have to have an electric car,” Trump said in remarks to an economic club before the plant tour.

Trump revoked a Biden-era target for half of new vehicle sales in the US to be electric, and has tried to block money obligated to EV charging across the nation’s highways. Under Trump, Congress cut tax incentives that saved buyers up to $7,500 on an EV purchase. The administration has also weakened fuel economy standards — going so far as eliminating penalties for the automakers who do not meet them — and gas mileage rules.

“I love electric cars. I think they’re great,” Trump added. “But I’ve been saying it for four years. They wanted everybody to have an electric car in a very short period of time.” Those changes have cut into the US industry in 2025 and cost automakers billions of dollars in investment.

Ford Motor Co. announced last month $19.5 billion in charges from electrification efforts and ending production of the all-electric version of the F-150 Lightning truck. Detroit rival General Motors also recently announced $6 billion in EV-related charges, among other losses, and has also rolled back some of its EV commitments. Even once- market leader Tesla had a tough 2025.

“I still push for it because, I mean, it is the future of the company,” said Shawn Strain, marketing manager at Ford. “We still are just completely committed to EVs. And it may not be as overt as we once were.”",https://www.qatar-tribune.com/watanqatartribune/uploads/images/2026/01/18/334352.jpeg,N,,2026-01-17 17:58:38.886001

“Americans spend three or four times as much money as Australians or Europeans to put solar panels on the roof.","RIPTON, Vermont (AP) — At a time when the Trump administration rolled back numerous environmental regulations while global temperatures and U.S. carbon pollution spiked, longtime climate activist Bill McKibben finds hope in something that didn't seem that strong on a recent single-digit-temperature day: the sun.

That sun has provided him cheap power for 25 years, and this month he installed his fourth iteration of solar panels on his Vermont home. In an interview after he set up the new system, he said President Donald Trump's stance against solar and other cheap green energy will hurt the GOP in this year's elections as electricity bills rise.

After the Biden and Obama administrations subsidized and championed solar, wind and other green power as answers to fight climate change, Trump has tried to dampen those and turn to older and dirtier fossil fuels. The Trump administration froze five big offshore wind projects last month but judges this week allowed three of the projects to resume. Federal clean energy tax incentives expired on Dec. 31 that include installing home solar panels.

Meanwhile, electricity prices are rising in the United States, and McKibben is counting on that to trigger political change.

“I think you’re starting to see that have a big political impact in the U.S. right now. My prediction would be that electric prices are going to be to the 2026 election what egg prices were to the 2024 election,” said McKibben, an author and founder of multiple environmental and activist groups. Everyday inflation hurt Democrats in the last presidential race, analysts said.

The Trump administration and a bipartisan group of governors on Friday tried to step up pressure on the operator of the nation’s largest electric grid to take urgent steps to boost power supplies in the mid-Atlantic and keep electricity bills from rising even higher.

“Ensuring the American people have reliable and affordable electricity is one of President Trump’s top priorities,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.

Renewable energy prices drop around the world

Globally, the price of wind and solar power is plummeting to the point that they are cheaper than fossil fuels, the United Nations found. And China leads the world in renewable energy technology, with one of its electric car companies passing Tesla in annual sales.

""We can’t economically compete in a world where China gets a lot of cheap energy and we have to pay for really expensive energy,"" McKibben told The Associated Press, just after he installed a new type of solar panels that can hang on balconies with little fuss.

When Trump took office in January 2025, the national average electricity cost was 15.94 cents per kilowatt-hour. By September it was up to 18.07 cents and then down slightly to 17.98 cents in October, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

That's a 12.8% increase in 10 months. It rose more in 10 months than the previous two years. People in Maryland, New Jersey and Maine have seen electricity prices rise at a rate three times higher than the national average since October 2024.

At 900 kilowatt-hours per month, that means the average monthly electricity bill is about $18 more than in January 2025.

Democrats blame Trump for rising electric bills

This week, Democrats on Capitol Hill blamed rising electric bills on Trump and his dislike of renewable energy.

“From his first day in office, he’s made it his mission to limit American’s access to cheap energy, all in the name of increasing profits for his friends in the fossil fuel industry. As a result, energy bills across the country have skyrocketed,"" Illinois Rep. Sean Casten said at a Wednesday news conference.

“Donald Trump is the first president to intentionally raise the price of something that we all need,” Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, also a Democrat, said Wednesday on the Senate floor. “Nobody should be enthused about paying more for electricity, and this national solar ban is making everybody pay more. Clean is cheap and cheap is clean.”

Solar panels on McKibben's Vermont home

McKibben has been sending excess electricity from his solar panels to the Vermont grid for years. Now he's sending more.

As his dog, Birke, stood watch, McKibben, who refers to his home nestled in the Green Mountains of Vermont as a “museum of solar technology"" got his new panels up and running in about 10 minutes. This type of panel from the California-based firm Bright Saver is often referred to as plug-in solar. Though it's not yet widely available in the U.S., McKibben pointed to the style's popularity in Europe and Australia.

“Americans spend three or four times as much money as Australians or Europeans to put solar panels on the roof. We have an absurdly overcomplicated permitting system that’s unlike anything else on the rest of the planet,"" McKibben said.

McKibben said Australians can obtain three hours of free electricity each day through a government program because the country has built so many solar panels.

“And I’m almost certain that that’s an argument that every single person in America would understand,"" he said. ""I don’t know anyone who wouldn’t say: ‘I’d like three free hours of electricity.’”

That has had competitors concerned even before Canada this week agreed to cut its tariffs on EVs in exchange for concessions on Canadian farm products.

Experts now say an easier path into Canada could be a big boost for Chinese carmakers looking to dominate the global market -- particularly as their domestic market weakens -- continuing to threaten other auto manufacturers, particularly American companies.

""This is telling us that Chinese automakers continue to be really popular, and are doing better and better, and not just something that's sold in global markets that are more marginal or less important to U.S. automakers,"" said Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

What makes Chinese vehicles stand out?

Chinese-made vehicles are high-quality, stylish and inexpensive, experts say.

""It's clear that the vehicles made by Chinese brands come at a very competitive cost, but are also technologically quite desirable,"" Mazzocco said. ""They tend to be connected vehicles, so they have a lot of additional software capabilities that consumers seem to like. But the price point and the competitiveness are really big selling points.""

These vehicles can cost as little as $10,000 to $20,000; in the U.S., new vehicles are running close to $50,000 on average, and EVs even more so.

Chinese companies also have unique advantages as far as auto manufacturing and production, efficiency and making vehicles lighter, which helps extend an electrified vehicle's driving range.

""They've found a way to make small and mid-sized cars -- cars that people want -- at a reasonable price,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. ""These are the segments where GM and Ford and almost everybody else have abandoned.""

Many automakers have discontinued smaller vehicles in favor of higher-margin, large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that are far more profitable.

So why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?

Much of the global auto market is electrifying, an ideal opportunity for advanced Chinese automakers to capitalize on. China saw 17 percent growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles in 2025, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week, and Europe saw a 33 percent increase.

Meanwhile, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1 percent last year. As the rest of the world advances, U.S. automakers have weakened their once-ambitious, multibillion dollar electrification plans, instead opting for more efficient hybrid electric and gasoline vehicles amid the Trump administration's shift away from EV-friendly policy.

That shift threatens U.S. automakers' competitive edge in the coming years. As is, Tesla lost its crown as the world's bestselling electric vehicle maker last year, delivering only 1.64 million vehicles in 2025 to Chinese rival BYD's 2.26 million.

Trump administration policy slashing emissions rules at a time when Chinese companies are advancing quickly has experts worried for the future of American car manufacturers.

Chinese automakers will have to meet standards required for the Canadian auto market for the latest trade arrangement to be successful -- standards that are similar to those in the U.S. -- which is likely to incentivize Chinese auto manufacturing investment in Canada.

They'll also have to establish which segment of the market they are targeting there: Higher-end vehicles, or less-expensive ones that sell at higher volumes.

Regardless, ""It brings it home to what is needed to compete globally,"" said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at AlixPartners. The firm predicts Chinese brands will account for 30 percent of the global market by 2030.

""They've already started in Europe. They started in South America. Now Mexico and Canada,"" Wakefield said. American carmakers ""don't want to end up as a Brazil with your ethanol-based cars that aren't sellable anywhere else in the world and ... like Britain or Australia that used to matter in the auto world, and no longer really matter.""

Why have others sought to regulate Chinese EV-makers' expansion?

Countries have attempted to regulate Chinese EVs from entering their markets for several reasons.

""China has become this overwhelming machine making inexpensive vehicles. And the fear is that if you give them an inch, they're going to take a mile,"" Fiorani said. ""The other issue is technology. These vehicles are data centers... and the idea that a state-owned company in China could have access to where a high portion of drivers are going gives them leverage for all kinds of outlets.""

In remarks at the Toledo Assembly Complex in Toledo, Ohio on Friday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Chinese Communist Party invests in its auto industry to ""control this industry.""

""Why? They want to take over the auto industry. They want to take away these jobs,"" Duffy said. As far as the Canadian trade deal, he added: ""They will live to regret the day they partner with China and bring in their vehicles.""

The European Union hiked tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, though the two have been resolving that at the start of this year.

In 2024, former President Joe Biden set a 100 percent tariff on Chinese electric cars. Canada matched that import tax on the vehicles until this week. And even with an annual import cap, Canada cutting its tariffs this week means those companies are another step closer to U.S. soil. The Mexican auto market has welcomed Chinese EVs, with massive growth last year.

""The advance of Chinese manufacturers is inevitable. It will happen eventually. Everybody is negotiating to put up the roadblocks to figure out: What data is being processed, how much market share you're going to allow Chinese manufacturers to have?"" Fiorani added.

""There are a lot of guardrails that have to be put up, but eventually they're going to make their way into all Western markets.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2026/01/17/212005814_212005814-f52459f7dba0441ba8947878be12db9e_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2026-01-17 18:59:15.041251

He warned about the harmful unintended consequences of moving from natural gas to clean energy too fast out here with our population more spread out, less capacity in our electricity infrastructure, older homes, loss of jobs, and decrease in much needed gas and oil tax revenues that support schools, safety, and the like. He emphasized that we support innovation, cleaner technologies, and environmental stewardship, and wrote “all we are asking for is flexibility.”

Mesa County is not just talking about sound energy management, it is “walking the walk.” Mr. Fletcher and his fellow commissioners in 2024 approved a $20 million 20-year contract with Schneider Electric for a plan that guarantees nearly $20 million dollars in utility savings over the life of the contract while making extensive upgrades to the county’s energy and water management systems. These include replacing outdated lighting with LED fixtures and occupancy sensors, HVAC modernization, more efficient water systems, enhanced monitoring and maintenance plans, and 600,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power coupled with renewable energy credits. On top of all that, the county will decrease its greenhouse gas emissions by around 1,900 metric tons per year.

The City of Grand Junction also has an opportunity to make this type of fiscally and environmentally smart energy move. Let’s hope that the city follows the county’s lead by contracting with Schneider Electric or another provider in upgrading their energy systems to reduce their utility bills, improve their systems, and reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.

Hurd inconsistent in responding to tragedy

I am writing regarding the latest “Hurd Huddle” that came to my inbox Jan. 12, five days after Renee Nicole Good was murdered by an ICE agent.

While this edition of the Huddle was intended to be a recap of “accomplishments” in 2025, I find it incredibly sad and disrespectful that there is NO mention in Rep. Hurd’s newsletter of the terrible incident. No, Minnesota is not in his congressional district, but this atrocity was a national issue that deserved some kind of attention from Rep. Hurd.

When Charlie Kirk was murdered, Hurd posted the following on Facebook: “I am deeply saddened by the shooting of Charlie Kirk. I am praying for him, his wife and children. Political violence is unacceptable and we must fully prosecute the perpetrator of this evil crime.” Charlie Kirk was not a constituent in Hurd’s District, but this was an incident of national concern and he felt compelled to create a post.

And yet, when Renee Nicole Good was murdered by an ICE agent, he was silent. Masked ICE agents were sent by the president to a decidedly Democratic state to instill fear, chaos, terror and to murder with supposed immunity. This was clearly an act of political violence. Why not post something about it on Facebook or anywhere else and demand that “we must fully prosecute the perpetrator of this evil crime”?

I guess in Hurd’s eyes, an “evil crime” is only committed when the victim is a fellow white Republican.

Coloradans trust Polis not to free Tina Peters

I urge Gov. Polis to resist pressure from President Trump to pardon Tina Peters.

Ms. Peters was entrusted to run elections in Mesa County according to Colorado law. She broke the law and betrayed voters’ trust. She was tried, convicted and sentenced.

Lately, much has been said and done to sow distrust in our election processes. Her actions did much to destroy the faith and confidence that election results in Colorado are fair and accurate. She is now paying the consequences for her lawlessness.

I, and all Colorado voters count on Gov. Polis to courageously refuse demands for her release from prison.

Sincerely,

Ministry of New and Renewable Energy

The ‘Renewable Energy and Jobs Annual Review 2025’ by IRENA and ILO reveals global renewable energy employment reached 16.6 million in 2024, marking the highest level recorded to date. While China continues to lead with nearly 44% of global jobs, India has solidified its position as a top employer with 1.28 million jobs, driven primarily by record hydropower deployment and a surge in solar PV. The report notes a shift toward a new phase in the energy transition where automation and economies of scale are starting to moderate job growth in utility-scale projects.

India’s Sectoral Employment and Capacity

Hydropower Leadership: Large-scale hydropower remains the largest employer in India’s renewable sector, supporting 503,000 jobs.

Solar PV Record: India added a record 24.5 GW of solar capacity in 2024—nearly double its previous record—supporting 385,000 jobs across grid-connected and off-grid settings.

Manufacturing Expansion: India’s solar module manufacturing capacity rose to 68.2 GW, the third-largest globally, though actual cell production lags significantly at 22.4 GW.

Wind Energy Growth: India recorded its highest wind capacity additions in seven years (3.4 GW), with the domestic share of manufacturing reaching 70–80%.

Biofuels Impact: Driven by the Ethanol Blended Petrol programme, the sector employs approximately 165,000 people, largely in seasonal feedstock harvesting.

Inclusion and Structural Challenges

Gender and Diversity: Women hold 32% of full-time renewable jobs globally, with India showing progress in specific manufacturing sites where women comprise up to 80% of the workforce.

Import Dependency: Despite manufacturing gains, India remains a major importer, bringing in 15.6 GW of modules from China in 2024.

Labor Intensity: The report highlights that decentralised rooftop solar is significantly more labor-intensive than utility-scale projects, representing a vital area for job creation.

What is ‘Decentralised Solar’ and why is it more labor-intensive than utility-scale projects? It refers to solar energy systems installed at or near the point of use, such as residential rooftops or off-grid community systems, rather than at large, centralized power plants. In the context of employment, decentralised solar is more labor-intensive because it requires a larger number of individual installations, site assessments, and maintenance tasks across diverse locations. For example, in India, while utility-scale solar accounts for 80% of capacity, decentralized systems offer a higher ratio of jobs per megawatt because they cannot benefit from the same high-level automation and economies of scale found in massive solar parks.

Policy Relevance

The report underscores that sustaining job growth in India requires balancing rapid deployment with policies that incentivize local manufacturing and inclusive labor practices.

Strategic Impact

Bridging the Manufacturing Gap: Narrowing the 45.8 GW gap between module and cell capacity is critical for reducing supply chain vulnerabilities.

Leveraging Decentralised Potential: With rooftop solar being more labor-intensive, policies supporting distributed generation can maximize employment outcomes in regional economies.

Workforce Accessibility: Expanding opportunities for persons with disabilities, who currently face significant barriers, is vital for a truly just energy transition.

Standardizing Vocational Training: As technology evolves, India must align curricula with modern requirements in AI-supported operations and advanced component manufacturing.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hUjJ!,f_auto,q_auto:best,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fthepolicyedge.substack.com%2Ftwitter%2Fsubscribe-card.jpg%3Fv%3D-1043519867%26version%3D9",N,,2026-01-17 17:58:28.901841

In Greenland, it’s on critical minerals mining, including rare earths and uranium, and oil drilling.
Shortly thereafter, Australian geologist Greg Barnes, who founded the massive Tanbreez rare earths mining project in Greenland, which remains in development, briefed Trump at the White House.
“We’re in the rare earths boom now, but this boom is going to fund everything for the next 30 to 50 years.","The prize is great on paper for a real estate tycoon like Trump—after all, Greenland would exceed the Louisiana Purchase as the largest geographic acquisition in U.S. history. But multiple specialists in the region and its resources dismiss the economic reasoning as nonsensical, given that Greenland already is open to greater U.S. investment and military scale-up.

Greenland may be home to large reserves of critical minerals and crude oil, but they’re much cheaper to extract elsewhere in the world, including within the Lower 48, said Otto Svendsen, associate fellow specializing in the Arctic for the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

“The business case is non-existent, setting aside all the political and legal and practical reasons for why I think it’s impossible,” Svendsen told Fortune.

The White House’s own estimations place the cost of a purchase of Greenland close to $700 billion, he said. Then there are the hundreds of billions of dollars needed to fund the developments of mines, oil drilling, roads, electrification, ports, and more—with a wait of 10 to 20 years before seeing any notable commercial success. The U.S. would also presumably assume Denmark’s roughly $700 million in annual subsidies in perpetuity to pay for the education, health care, and more of Greenland’s 56,000 residents.

“The numbers just don’t add up at all,” Svendsen said. “It cannot be hammered home enough that the U.S. has an incredibly favorable arrangement at the moment with an incredible amount of access to Greenlandic territory, both to advance its security and its economic interests.”

Despite ample efforts over the years to develop mines and drill for oil—the last, unsuccessful drilling bid was abandoned in 2011—Greenland today is home to zero oil production and just two active mines, neither of which extract the desired rare earths essential to computer, automotive, and military defense equipment. There’s a small gold mine and another for anorthosite—a mineral used to produce fiberglass, paint, and other common materials. While some rare earths and oil projects are in development—by U.S. companies—they remain in early stages, with no guarantees of success.

The relative lack of success over decades is no fluke, said Malte Humpert, senior fellow and founder of The Arctic Institute nonprofit think tank.

“You’re dealing with ice, polar bears, darkness, lack of power, the sea ice being frozen, really low temperatures. It’s probably one of the roughest places on Earth,” Humpert said. “The fact that it hasn’t been done—when it could have been done—is really all you need to know. It’s very difficult to make it economical.”

None of this has publicly deterred the president, nor has the risk of shattering international laws and the NATO alliance. The White House describes owning Greenland as a national security imperative—a rationale that might outweigh the poor economics of an annexation. But analysts say existing treaties give the U.S. all the needed military advantages in the Arctic with the potential to grow and negotiate for even more.

As Trump focuses on his new “Donroe” doctrine and forewarns of a blitz through much of the Western Hemisphere—since launching a military strike in Venezuela this month, he’s threatened Colombia, Cuba, and Mexico—he has set his sights on annexing Greenland by any means necessary, through a purchase or military action.

“We are going to do something on Greenland whether they like it or not,” Trump told reporters last week. “I would like to make a deal and do it the easy way. But, if we don’t make a deal, we’re going to do it the hard way.”

While Trump publicly mulls seizing Greenland by force, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has focused on a negotiated purchase, which is a type of international diplomacy not practiced since World War II, and an approach that Denmark and Greenland have repeatedly rejected. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.

The Trump administration already is planning a large upgrade of its only military base in Greenland, the Pituffik Space Base, with the potential to expand much more.

So why not just continue to grow your existing U.S. footprint in Greenland? If the U.S. doesn’t annex Greenland, then Russia or China will instead, Trump has insisted. “When we own it, we defend it,” the former real estate developer said. “You don’t defend leases the same way. You have to own it.”

What’s at stake

After Trump initiated tariffs and trade wars last year, the United States’ over-reliance on China for critical minerals—especially rare earths—became painfully apparent when China threatened to withhold the necessary soft metals that drive America’s economy and help bolster its national security.

The oxymoron of rare earths is that they’re abundant around the world, but harder to find in larger concentrations that make the economics worthwhile. Greenland theoretically offers those large concentrations.

Greenland’s estimated rare earths reserves offer a smorgasbord of 1.5 million metric tons, including the more uncommon heavy rare earths. That would rank Greenland eighth worldwide, coincidentally just behind the United States, but well behind China and its 44 million tons, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

But as the research firm Wood Mackenzie says in a new report, “Here, ambition runs up against reality. Around 80% of the island is covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet, averaging a mile thick, meaning only limited work has been undertaken to quantify the true scale of Greenland’s deposits.”

An even bigger challenge is the higher costs of developing a mining industry in Greenland’s harsh terrain, where there’s little to no existing infrastructure. There are just a few short, warmer windows when drilling and mining are practical; there is less daylight than almost anywhere on earth; and most of the terrain is accessible only by helicopter.

But the less-discussed issue is that mining is only part of the equation, said Jennifer Li, senior geopolitical analyst for the Rystad Energy research firm.

In tandem, the U.S. must develop a much more extensive rare-earths processing and refining industry if it wants to break China’s near-global monopoly on the complicated refining process. That would mean constructing more minerals refineries in Greenland or elsewhere in the U.S. (Currently some domestic projects are underway, including ones with U.S. subsidies and direct government equity investments.)

The U.S. would also likely have to further subsidize the critical minerals sales with a floor pricing mechanism, to compete against China’s repeated price-dumping practices.

A race for resources

Greenland and Venezuela may represent very different cases, Li said, but they both come back to Trump’s focus on Western Hemisphere dominance and “governing from afar in order to try to change the policy regime.”

In Venezuela, the focus is on crude oil. In Greenland, it’s on critical minerals mining, including rare earths and uranium, and oil drilling. Greenland currently has moratoriums on both uranium mining and on oil drilling—minus grandfathered licenses that allowedone Texas company to drill for oil this summer. “There are a lot of ecological concerns,” Lisaid.

Trump could theoretically end those moratoriums and expedite permitting, essentially green-lighting Greenland for more mining and oil drilling.

Still, “even green-lighting rhetorically isn’t going to lead to seismic changes overnight,” Li said, given the historic lack of success in mining and oil drilling exploration and the many years of infrastructure construction required to build a commercial industry. A “more cooperative dialogue” with Greenland, Denmark, and NATO is a more feasible approach, Li said, than taking things further with annexation or military action.

Current tensions aside, Greenland is eager to attract much more U.S. investment, just not at the expense of ownership and sovereignty, said Christian Keldsen, managing director of the Greenland Business Association.

After all, 97% of Greenland’s exports are seafood, mostly shrimp. And Denmark’s subsidies account for over half of Greenland’s total revenues. Mining is only a tiny piece of the pie. Greenland wants the U.S. to invest in its mining and energy sectors, even developing data center campuses in the spacious and cold terrain that could prove suitable for such facilities, Keldsen said.

Just don’t conquer the icy and barren island. “We’re somewhat irritated by this. We’ve had an open business relationship with the U.S. for years,” Keldsen said. “All this talk creates instability and noise in the background. And, if there’s anything investors don’t like, it’s instability.”

What Trump wants

For all the focus on seizing Greenland of late, it was a cosmetics heir who first put the bug in Trump’s ear during his first term.

Back in 2018, during his first presidential term, Trump’s longtime friend, billionaire Ronald Lauder—from the family of Estée Lauder fame—discussed with Trump the importance of Greenland’s resources and strategic Arctic positioning, especially as ongoing global warming melts the ice sheets and creates more passageways between the U.S. and Russia. (Lauder declined comment for this story.)

Shortly thereafter, Australian geologist Greg Barnes, who founded the massive Tanbreez rare earths mining project in Greenland, which remains in development, briefed Trump at the White House. Last year, New York-based Critical Metals acquired 92.5% ownership of Tanbreez. A pilot project launched earlier in January, although full construction is yet to begin.

“In the 19th century, there was the gold boom. The 20th century was the oil boom,” Critical Metals CEO Tony Sage told Fortune in a recent interview. “We’re in the rare earths boom now, but this boom is going to fund everything for the next 30 to 50 years. Everything in your life needs rare earths.”

The rationale for acquiring Greenland may have less to do with the economic case, and more with Trump’s ego and his real estate background, said historians and analysts who are critical of the idea.

By a difference of just 8,000 square miles, an annexation of Greenland and its estimated 836,000 square miles would exceed the 1803 Louisiana Purchase and its 828,000 square miles, potentially making it the largest acquisition in U.S. history, noted David Silbey, a military historian at Cornell University.

“This is the biggest land grab ever. He loves big things, huge things, he would say,” Silbey said. “He’s a New York real estate guy. He likes to grab land, and he grew up in a world where bullying was part of business practice. He like to bully, and he’s picking on the little guy.”

Because Greenland doesn’t “move the needle economically in any way, shape, or form,” Trump following his real estate instincts is the most logical answer, Silbey said.

When it comes to hugeness, don’t negate the distorted perspective of maps. The Mercator global maps that Trump and many others grew up with, like the one below, show a Greenland that’s appears to be almost as large as all of Africa. In fact, Greenland is one-fourteenth the size of Africa, although it’s still of course quite large (more than triple the geographic footprint of Texas).

“We try to rationalize irrational behavior. This is classic Trump ego politics,” said Humpert of The Arctic Institute. “It’s about him putting a Trump tower in Nuuk and saying he made the U.S. larger than any other president.”

Militarily, Humpert is quick to point out that China and Russia have more ships and submarines traveling near Alaska’s coast than Greenland’s ice. “There’s some truth to the Arctic heating up and there being more power politics in the Arctic,” he said. “But the [U.S.] should take care of its own backyard first.”

Silbey agreed. Offshore of Greenland represents one of the fastest routes between the U.S. and Russia, but existing defense treaties with Denmark give Trump all of the necessary military access for bases and waterway patrols. From a foreign policy standpoint, he said, annexation “is just categorically dumb. You’re blowing up NATO for access you already have.”

A potentially more cynical view comes from Daniel Immerwahr, foreign relations historian at Northwestern University. Immerwahr says Trump is abandoning the U.S.’s long-standing soft power diplomacy approach—the U.S. maintains 750 military bases in other countries—that was intended to avoid wars over land and resources, and is now focusing on the old-school colonialism of ownership and control, especially in the Western Hemisphere

“It may be that we’re entering a world of closed borders, in which case it makes more sense for security reasons to lock down the territories that contain the things you need because you might be afraid some other country would close trade lines,” Immerwahr said, citing critical minerals as an example.

“China’s desires on Taiwan and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have corresponded to the more closed annexationist model,” he added. He also noted that a U.S. seizure of Greenland might be seen as a green light for China and Russia to follow suit in their own spheres of influence.

Trump has repeatedly insisted that, if the U.S. doesn’t acquire Greenland, then “Russia or China will take it over” and exploit its resources and strategic military positioning. But China has invested in many projects in Greenland that have mostly failed, and has largely pulled out since, said Adam Lajeunesse, chair in Canadian and Arctic policy at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia.

There’s no logic to a Chinese or Russian takeover, especially when Greenland has U.S. and NATO military backing, he said.

“That’s a myth,” Lajeunesse said. “The economic bogeyman the Trump administration is putting out there is really quite fictitious.”","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2255989063-e1768596550883.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2026-01-17 16:00:19.744090

The initial phase will deliver over 100MW of critical IT capacity, with future expansion planned beyond 300MW.

Renewable power meets GPU-ready infrastructure

Soluna Holdings develops green data centres for compute-heavy applications including Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence.

Its latest move is a partnership with Metrobloks, a data centre developer focused on AI-ready infrastructure.

The project combines Soluna’s renewable-powered site and ERCOT grid expertise with Metrobloks’ design and operations platform. The aim is to provide dense, GPU-compatible capacity with faster deployment than traditional builds.

Located near McAllen in South Texas, the site gives customers the opportunity to have a regional alternative to Central and West Texas.

Metrobloks’ leadership team has supported more than 12GW of global data centre capacity.

The company builds sustainable, high-density facilities that serve AI and low-latency workloads.

Soluna’s Project Kati campus already runs on wind power and is being developed in phases to serve both digital assets and compute workloads.

John Belizaire, CEO of Soluna: “Project Kati is our blueprint for Renewable Computing at scale and this site reflects the kind of infrastructure AI now demands.

“This site offers what AI and HPC deployments need most right now: available power, strong renewable resources and a regulatory and grid environment that supports speed.

“Our team spent years securing the right location and power position at Kati. By partnering with Metrobloks to lead design, operations and customer engagement for Kati 2, we can accelerate AI and HPC deployment while staying focused on what we do best, turning constrained renewable energy into productive compute.”

Joint structure to support speed and scale

The partners will create a project company to own and operate the new facility. Metrobloks will lead design, development, leasing and day-to-day operations.

This includes securing pre-lease agreements and handling customer engagement.

Soluna contributes site control, power entitlements, electrical infrastructure and development support.

Power for the project will come from Soluna’s existing sources and may expand with additional supply from EDF Power Solutions and the Las Majadas wind farm. The site is currently under a non-binding letter of intent from a potential neocloud tenant.

Ernest Popescu, CEO of Metrobloks says:“Customers are telling us the same thing in every market. They need power and capacity now, not years from now.

“Project Kati stands out because the power is both available and scalable. Soluna has already done the hard work to secure a renewable-powered site with room to grow.

“We’re building on that foundation with AI-ready design and a clear path for customers to scale high-density AI and HPC workloads beyond the initial 100 MW.”

The development strategy addresses growing demand from organisations seeking scalable capacity for AI models and other compute-intensive tasks.

By combining renewable energy, interconnection readiness and AI-specific design, the project is designed to support quick deployment.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/707c8819352428c1b5fb9d9b67cc5c67:2976907e9a9968d5a3b0843a28ad94fe/john-belizaire-ceo-of-soluna.jpg.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 17:58:41.994772

Countries that lead in advanced nuclear technology will control supply chains, safety standards, and long-term geopolitical influence.
When it comes to powering the next century of economic growth and national defense, advanced nuclear is not optional: it is essential.","By: Chris Brown, Mississippi Public Service Commission, Chairman

America’s economy is entering a new phase: one that requires enormous amounts of reliable electricity. Artificial intelligence, data centers, advanced manufacturing, military installations, and modern infrastructure all depend on power that is available every hour of every day, no matter the weather.

That reality matters deeply in Mississippi, where families, businesses, hospitals, and military facilities cannot afford rolling outages or skyrocketing power bills. If the United States wants to remain economically competitive and nationally secure, we must be honest about what works, and accelerate investment in advanced nuclear energy.

Much of today’s energy debate focuses on the falling cost of renewable power, especially solar. That progress is real and useful. But it often ignores a critical distinction: cheap power on paper is not the same as dependable power in the real world.

Solar energy can be inexpensive when the sun is shining. But electricity demand does not stop at night, during storms, or during prolonged cloudy periods. To deliver round-the-clock power, solar must be paired with massive battery systems. Those batteries are expensive, wear out over time, and must be replaced regularly. Once those costs are included, the price of “dispatchable” solar power rises sharply.

Once you require dispatchable, 24/7 power, the economics flip.

Cost per kWh (firm power):

• Advanced Nuclear: $0.06–$0.10

• Solar + 4h batteries: $0.09–$0.13 (still not fully reliable)

• Solar + 24h batteries: $0.20–$0.35

• Hardened solar (multi-day): $0.40–$0.80+

Dispatchable solar costs 2–8× more per kWh.

When measured fairly, comparing only power that is available on demand, the difference becomes clear. Advanced nuclear energy can produce electricity for roughly six to ten cents per kilowatt-hour, with plants operating more than 90 percent of the time and lasting for decades. By contrast, solar paired with enough storage to provide continuous power often costs two to four times more, and systems designed to handle multi-day outages can cost even more.

This is not a political issue. It is a matter of physics and engineering. Nuclear energy stores immense amounts of energy directly in its fuel. Solar energy must be generated when conditions allow and stored externally in batteries that require large amounts of land, minerals, and ongoing replacement.

Reliability matters more than ever as electricity demand grows. Data centers, manufacturing plants, military installations, and critical infrastructure cannot simply power down when conditions are unfavorable. A grid built primarily on intermittent generation like solar and wind becomes more fragile, not more resilient, without firm power sources to anchor it.

Advanced nuclear reactors are designed for exactly this challenge. Modern designs rely on passive safety systems, simplified construction, smaller footprints, and decades of operational experience. Unlike other technologies, nuclear power becomes more economical as it runs longer, without requiring massive new infrastructure, and only small amounts of additional fuel.

Nuclear energy is also a strategic national asset. Countries that lead in advanced nuclear technology will control supply chains, safety standards, and long-term geopolitical influence. Russia and China understand this clearly and are investing heavily to dominate the next generation of nuclear power. The United States cannot afford to fall behind, or worse, outsource its energy future while competitors lock in theirs.

Nuclear energy is the future of large-scale power generation. Serious nations know it. Rather than continuing to funnel billions of dollars into subsidized solar projects that depend on weather and constant backup, America should focus on technologies that deliver reliable power, strengthen national security, protect ratepayers, and secure long-term leadership. When it comes to powering the next century of economic growth and national defense, advanced nuclear is not optional: it is essential.",https://desotocountynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ChrisBrownHeadshot.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 22:58:50.790289

Meanwhile, electricity prices are rising in the United States, and McKibben is counting on that to trigger political change.
People in Maryland, New Jersey and Maine have seen electricity prices rise at a rate three times higher than the national average since October 2024.
As a result, energy bills across the country have skyrocketed,"" Illinois Rep. Sean Casten said at a Wednesday news conference.
“Americans spend three or four times as much money as Australians or Europeans to put solar panels on the roof.","RIPTON, Vermont (AP) — At a time when the Trump administration rolled back numerous environmental regulations while global temperatures and U.S. carbon pollution spiked, longtime climate activist Bill McKibben finds hope in something that didn't seem that strong on a recent single-digit-temperature day: the sun.

That sun has provided him cheap power for 25 years, and this month he installed his fourth iteration of solar panels on his Vermont home. In an interview after he set up the new system, he said President Donald Trump's stance against solar and other cheap green energy will hurt the GOP in this year's elections as electricity bills rise.

After the Biden and Obama administrations subsidized and championed solar, wind and other green power as answers to fight climate change, Trump has tried to dampen those and turn to older and dirtier fossil fuels. The Trump administration froze five big offshore wind projects last month but judges this week allowed three of the projects to resume. Federal clean energy tax incentives expired on Dec. 31 that include installing home solar panels.

Meanwhile, electricity prices are rising in the United States, and McKibben is counting on that to trigger political change.

“I think you’re starting to see that have a big political impact in the U.S. right now. My prediction would be that electric prices are going to be to the 2026 election what egg prices were to the 2024 election,” said McKibben, an author and founder of multiple environmental and activist groups. Everyday inflation hurt Democrats in the last presidential race, analysts said.

The Trump administration and a bipartisan group of governors on Friday tried to step up pressure on the operator of the nation’s largest electric grid to take urgent steps to boost power supplies in the mid-Atlantic and keep electricity bills from rising even higher.

“Ensuring the American people have reliable and affordable electricity is one of President Trump’s top priorities,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.

Renewable energy prices drop around the world

Globally, the price of wind and solar power is plummeting to the point that they are cheaper than fossil fuels, the United Nations found. And China leads the world in renewable energy technology, with one of its electric car companies passing Tesla in annual sales.

""We can’t economically compete in a world where China gets a lot of cheap energy and we have to pay for really expensive energy,"" McKibben told The Associated Press, just after he installed a new type of solar panels that can hang on balconies with little fuss.

When Trump took office in January 2025, the national average electricity cost was 15.94 cents per kilowatt-hour. By September it was up to 18.07 cents and then down slightly to 17.98 cents in October, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

That's a 12.8% increase in 10 months. It rose more in 10 months than the previous two years. People in Maryland, New Jersey and Maine have seen electricity prices rise at a rate three times higher than the national average since October 2024.

At 900 kilowatt-hours per month, that means the average monthly electricity bill is about $18 more than in January 2025.

Democrats blame Trump for rising electric bills

This week, Democrats on Capitol Hill blamed rising electric bills on Trump and his dislike of renewable energy.

“From his first day in office, he’s made it his mission to limit American’s access to cheap energy, all in the name of increasing profits for his friends in the fossil fuel industry. As a result, energy bills across the country have skyrocketed,"" Illinois Rep. Sean Casten said at a Wednesday news conference.

“Donald Trump is the first president to intentionally raise the price of something that we all need,” Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, also a Democrat, said Wednesday on the Senate floor. “Nobody should be enthused about paying more for electricity, and this national solar ban is making everybody pay more. Clean is cheap and cheap is clean.”

Solar panels on McKibben's Vermont home

McKibben has been sending excess electricity from his solar panels to the Vermont grid for years. Now he's sending more.

As his dog, Birke, stood watch, McKibben, who refers to his home nestled in the Green Mountains of Vermont as a “museum of solar technology"" got his new panels up and running in about 10 minutes. This type of panel from the California-based firm Bright Saver is often referred to as plug-in solar. Though it's not yet widely available in the U.S., McKibben pointed to the style's popularity in Europe and Australia.

“Americans spend three or four times as much money as Australians or Europeans to put solar panels on the roof. We have an absurdly overcomplicated permitting system that’s unlike anything else on the rest of the planet,"" McKibben said.

McKibben said Australians can obtain three hours of free electricity each day through a government program because the country has built so many solar panels.

“And I’m almost certain that that’s an argument that every single person in America would understand,"" he said. ""I don’t know anyone who wouldn’t say: ‘I’d like three free hours of electricity.’”

The Nordex Group secured the latest order earmarked for the Spanish wind sector

Towards the end of last year, the Nordex Group received the latest order for wind turbines earmarked for several new wind farms in Spain. The nation is among the top renewable energy producers in Europe, with renewable energy making up more than half of the energy produced in Spain in 2024.

Nordex has noted that a total of 38 wind turbines of various types will be installed in several provinces around Spain. The rapid transformation of the Spanish energy market has placed the nation at the forefront of embracing and adopting renewable energy.

Europe has seen a rapid acceleration of the energy transition, as the vast majority of nations aim to develop their renewable energy infrastructure over the coming years to alleviate concerns over emissions from the global energy sector.

“The EU’s dependence on fossil fuel imports must be replaced with home-grown renewable energies, for the benefit of citizens and businesses, and of the environment.” – European Commission

Spain is welcoming the renewable energy market with open arms and a blank checkbook

Nordex has noted that the combined 38 turbines’ output capacity for clean energy totals an astonishing 246 MW, and that the Spanish provinces of Teruel, Navarra, Burgos, and León will play host to several new wind energy projects that feature the latest state-of-the-art turbines from the company.

The first order came from the projects in Teruel, which will make use of Nordex’s N163/6.X wind turbines alongside the N175/6.X model. The notable expansion of the Spanish wind market has raised questions for the rest of Europe, as the need to integrate more renewable energy comes into focus.

The next province in Spain that will feature Nordex wind turbines is Navarra, which will see several of Nordex’s latest wind turbines, namely, the N163/6.X, N133/4800, and N163/5.X turbines. The wind project in Burgos will see Nordex’s N149/5.X turbines installed.

A major European renewable energy company has also placed an order with Nordex

While the project developers for the first wind projects in Spain have not been disclosed by Nordex, Nadara, one of the continent’s largest independent power producers, has placed an order with Nordex to supply the wind turbines for the Castillo 1 in the province of León. Nearby Italy is targeting the completion of the Palino and Venusia projects this year.

“We are proud to welcome Nadara as a new partner in Spain and to support their entry into the Spanish wind energy market. This project highlights the strength of our Delta4000 platform and our ability to deliver tailored solutions for diverse wind conditions.

Utility bills need to be decreased.","Gov. Kathy Hochul has heard the pleas from state residents who want something to be done to decrease the cost of living in the Empire State.

Helping lower state residents’ home heating and power bills while, at the same time, making sure the supply of power is plentiful, is a good place to start. So we’re encouraged to hear Hochul is advancing a new initiative, the Nuclear Reliability Backbone, directing state agencies to establish a clear pathway for additional advanced nuclear generation to support grid reliability. The Nuclear Reliability Backbone will be developed by a new Department of Public Service process to consider, review, and facilitate a cost-effective pathway to 4 gigawatts of new nuclear energy that will combine with existing nuclear generation and the New York Power Authority’s (NYPA) previously announced 1 gigawatt project, to create an 8.4 gigawatt “backbone” of reliable energy for New Yorkers.

When it comes to energy policy, that’s the 1% that Hochul gets right, in our opinion. We are glad to see Hochul agreeing with the state Independent System Operator’s assessment – repeated over the past few years – that the state’s power grid is going to struggle without dispatchable power sources as the state transitions to an all-electric power grid. Hochul’s move won’t make many left-leaning state legislators or environmental advocates happy, but it’s a step in the right direction.

Investments in programs that help people upgrade their homes to be more energy efficient – both in terms of electric consumption and home heating costs – also make sense. That’s especially true in cities like Jamestown, which have older housing stock that has suffered from lack of investment over the decades.

When it comes to actually decreasing utility bills, however, Hochul’s plan loses its luster.

The governor is proposing a the NYS Affordable Utilities Omnibus Legislation to modernize the Public Service Law to demand strict fiscal discipline from utilities and giving the state more power to fight more effectively for lower bills by tying executive pay to affordability, require utilities to present a budget constrained option that keeps operating and capital costs below the rate of inflation and remove “hidden” fees for things like corporate advertising, fines and legal fees.

That’s not all bad. But if we’re talking about hidden fees, then the state should allow utility companies to break out for customers the cost of state mandates paid by utilities that are then passed on to consumers in the form of Fuel Adjustment Charges. Legislation to allow such detail on utility bills has been vetoed in the past – and we have a feeling customers already unhappy with the state’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act’s costly renewable energy credits and zero energy credits would be really ticked to see how much their utility is spending due to state mandates.

And everyone should be wary of any plan that gives New York state the ability to appoint an “Affordability Monitor” inside of a utility that it deems isn’t doing enough to keep rates low.

In the transportation space, people often say an EV is “just a battery on wheels”. Usually that means that whether you stack a bus or a truck on top, it is all the same. But let us take it one step further. The familiar shape tricks us into thinking of them as only cars, but what we see is energy storage that happens to drive.

The vehicle is simply a chassis. The real value? The battery. It is the most expensive and most flexible component in the system. It is capable of delivering value continuously even when the vehicle is sitting in a driveway, as it does in many households about 90% of the time. Think batteries first, mobility second. This inversion of perspective—viewing EVs as mobile energy units—has wide-ranging implications for who leads, profits, and participates in this transformation.

Three key players have the opportunity to leverage this untapped resource.

Electricity Utilities understand the potential of grid-integrated storage. They want to build advanced electricity infrastructure and convince car owners to let them draw on unused EV battery capacity to meet power demand.

Charging Infrastructure companies are already beginning to build new business models around energy services, allowing them to become arbiters or traders between EV owners and electricity companies.

Automakers focus almost exclusively on the powertrain and mobility business, the exceptions being powerhouses like Tesla and BYD that are EV-first companies.

It will be fascinating to see who moves first to treat the battery not as a feature but as the product itself. Two questions underline the opportunity. First, where is the car owner in this equation? Second, can any one player move, without all players taking interconnected steps together?

Therein lies the EV mind shift. The original purpose of EVs as vehicles may end up being secondary or, more accurately, complementary to the value of the battery as an essential part of the global energy transition.

Such economic repositioning has happened before with other new innovations. Consider the Slack platform. It began as an internal communications tool for a video game project, but eventually creators realized the tool was the true product.

EV batteries must be a critical piece for a new decarbonization electrification economy. The mobility they provide is an added bonus. The true product is the significant power they contain.

The Hidden Value of an EV

If we embrace the EV as being a battery first, what does that unlock? Think of your mobile phone. Sure, it can make calls, but just look at your screen time for the last week. You use your phone to find directions, to read the news, to listen to music, for social media or to watch videos.

In a similar vein, EVs have a variety of untapped uses that can generate significant value. Filovi Kloutse Ayevide, a Senior Researcher at Hydro-Québec put forward the concept of an EV Value Stack at Electric Autonomy’s 2025 kWh Summit. This stack can be leveraged for a range of interests as we accelerate towards an electric future.

Let us put the pieces of this roadmap together:

Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G): EVs can charge up overnight when electricity is cheaper and available and sell power back to the grid during peak demand. Providing this energy access at scale across an economy or a utility-region has the potential to materially reduce peak electricity generation needs. The economics are enticing, and not just for cars.

There are 18,000 school buses in Quebec that are already wired for V2G, largely sitting idle during the evening peak from 5 to 8 pm. In British Columbia, BC Hydro is testing how this can work with a first-ofits-kind project in Canada that turns electric school buses into mobile power sources, sending electricity back to the grid during peak demand and provide backup power during outages.

Will this degrade car batteries faster than would otherwise be the case? New research from pioneering lithium-ion battery developer Jeff Dahn of Dalhousie University has shown that the shallow charge and discharge cycles for V2G has a negligible effect on battery longevity.

Backup & Resilience (V2B): An EV can power your home, replacing or reducing electricity grid load during the day especially during demand peaks, or supply energy when outages hit. Integrating this will require grid modernization and digital technology—a key challenge to overcome to realize the energy storage potential of EV batteries.

Your EV’s app could now focuses on charging as illustrated below.

Carbon Credit Generation (CCG): Compliance energy credits and offsets are mechanisms of incentivizing reduction of greenhouse gas emissions when non-emitting power is utilized. These allow projects that reduce climate-damaging emissions to sell credits to entities that seek to reduce carbon footprints, say as part of a corporate responsibility commitment or to meet regulatory obligations set by governments. Tesla has jumped on that opportunity.

In 2024 the company generated $US 2.76 billion from selling these environmental attributes generated by the owners of Tesla’s cars. Should the company be the only beneficiary of this windfall? Or do car owners deserve a share?

Second-Life Battery Use (SL): Even after 10+ years in a vehicle, batteries have lots of juice that can be repurposed for stationary grid storage and other energy applications. We have seen SL battery bundling for use in remote communities and offgrid cabins. Conventionally, batteries are sold in a package along with the vehicle, but SL battery opportunities are an unrealized business. There is even a case for utility companies or automakers owning batteries and leasing them out to customers.

Grid Flexibility (GF): It is a little-known fact that a significant percentage of power generation is wasted when it cannot be absorbed to meet power demand at the time. Simply put, you need to use electricity when it is generated or store it for future use. This is particularly pertinent for intermittent renewable energy generation. EVs can soak up and store excess clean power during periods of overproduction – sending energy back to the power grid when needed. If one were to conclude this needs sophisticated control systems and dynamic electricity pricing, that would be correct.

Demand Response (DR): Current demand response programs try to turn off consumers’ air conditioning during a peak heat wave, which is in direct competition with someone’s needs at that moment.

By incorporating EV batteries into current demand response programs, utility companies can more effectively meet the needs of consumers. EVs can be instructed to charge up when energy is abundant and cheaper as a part of managed charging programs. During peaks, they can be throttled down or instructed to send power to the home instead.

Mobility Plus (MP): An EVs battery’s value is multi-faceted. In addition to providing transport, adding an EV Revenue Stack encourages more people to “host” these batteries in their driveways and garages, making use of existing space instead of building more large-scale energy storage facilities.

The car becomes a vital part of a dynamic, intelligent, low-carbon energy network. Imagine offering people lower lease rates, modest but not immaterial income, discounted charging fees, or a combination of these if they simply plug in whenever they are not driving.

Indeed, you may end up managing your EV’s energy potential with your phone.

Connecting the Dots to Realize the EV Revenue Stack

Unlocking all these benefits for our energy system requires decarbonized and electrified transport leaders and keystone companies to make four game-changing commitments.

Open-Source Collaboration: The DNA of this new system needs to be shared. Electricity utilities, automakers and charging companies should not focus strictly on their own corporate gains but instead work together to unlock these benefits, including the driver in that mix. If any of these sectors tries to capture the lion’s share of the rewards, they will waste years fighting over market share.

EV Systems Standardization: Right now, the systems are fragmented. Different devices, charging standards, apps, and utility programs create a mess of complexity. EV ownership is already suffering from poor user experiences, less-than-ideal dealer interactions and challenges with fragmented charging systems, especially across large urban centers and city-tocity driving. For example, some new EV models have two charging ports because of the monumental gap between Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and charging infrastructure providers. We need a seamless, universal system that works across brands and providers. A system that feels effortless for drivers from the moment they purchase or lease their vehicle in the showroom, through charger installation, to everyday use. Incentive programs like carbon credits or V2G should be built in and automatic, not something that requires technical know-how. A recent report that Dunsky Energy + Climate prepared for CSA Group provides a comprehensive look at the standardization needed for vehicle-grid integration.

Scaling the EV Revenue Stack: For the economics to work, participation has to be big enough to matter. If individual drivers are expected to take on the extra costs and effort to sell that value to all these different players, this is unlikely and unrealistic. It is time to develop market-wide offerings driven by the major, trusted players for consistent commercial and regulatory markets. Other innovators will follow, creating tools, software, and services that make the system even smarter and more accessible.

Modernizing the Electricity Grid: Advanced systems management, regulatory provisions, and dynamic and incentivized power pricing and terms must underpin the electrification economy. The positive news is that AI can facilitate such systems integration.

However seizing these opportunities requires new electricity market design, a challenge we should embrace for a decarbonized Canadian economy.

Instead of relying on costly, gas-powered plants to cope with peak demand, the electricity grid taps into the collective battery power parked in our driveways and garages. This generates power payments for EV owners in return.

When EVs become a core facet of a clean electricity economy, value for car owners increases. That should drive demand for EVs as net costs trend downwards.

›Implicitly, the business model for automakers would also need to evolve, manufacturing a higher volume of EVs ready to drive off the lot—wired for the electricity grid.

These system changes need to be pioneered in test markets, with electricity planning agencies and utilities buying-in. Let us test drive these ideas. We suggest mid-market, tech savvy communities like Oakville, Ontario; Burnaby, British Columbia, or St. John, New Brunswick – maybe prime places to explore such EV and clean electricity innovations.

Who’s Trying What

Pioneering companies are road testing out-of-the-box thinking to realize an EV Value Stack.

1. Octopus Energy + BYD in the UK Offering cheaper leases and free home charging in exchange for using the vehicles as V2G assets.

2. Grizzl-e chargers Allowing drivers to earn carbon credits through home charging as part of a subscription, with potential to layer other utility programs on top.

3. Tesla Powerwall VPP Paying homeowners about $350 USD to allow grid control of a 14 kWh battery during summer peaks. An EV battery is often five times that size, meaning you would only have to “lease out” 20% of the battery capacity to generate that income.

4. Elastic Energy Acting as a “home energy router” that coordinates capacity from EVs, heat pumps and thermostats to respond to energy prices and household needs.

Are consumers ready to embrace the power of an EV battery? “Empowering Households”, a recent report released by Clean Energy Canada found in a survey of thousands of Canadians in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, and Metro Vancouver that 59% of households are inclined to buy an EV as their next car, and 56% and 57% respectively say it is important that their next home is energy smart. This is strong affirmation for the potential of a car + home electricity platform.

Unlocking the Powerful Potential of EVs

Forget trying to get people to adopt electric vehicles because they are better technology and zero emissions.

We have the story wrong. Once we flip the switch on the energy potential of EV batteries, it becomes evident that the personal combustion car is obsolete, suited only for a single, specialized, and more expensive job.

The technology exists today. We just need a new roadmap.

Named a Top Woman in EV in North America in 2024, Ilana Weitzman serves as VP of Strategic Development, Clean Transportation at Electric Autonomy, where she shapes the conversation around sustainable transportation and energy innovation. Chris Henderson is curator at Tranformative Energy, where this post was originally published, aimed at forwarding a dialogue that invites key players to collaborate on systems designs to monetize the EV Revenue Stack.

When two vehicles of identical mass and horsepower are juxtaposed—one powered by petrol, the other by electricity generated from fossil fuels—the carbon calculus becomes markedly more intricate than tailpipe-centred comparisons suggest.

To grasp this complexity, researchers rely on well-to-wheel (WTW) and life-cycle assessment (LCA) frameworks. These analytical instruments trace emissions from the point of fuel extraction and processing—the “well”—through conversion, transmission, and ultimately energy use at the wheels.

Comparison between internal combustion engines and EVs

A conventional petrol vehicle converts chemical energy into mechanical motion through an internal combustion engine, a process characterised by profound thermodynamic inefficiency. Canonical engineering studies show that barely 15–20 per cent of petrol’s energy content is converted into useful work, with the remainder dissipated as waste heat through exhaust and cooling systems. From a carbon standpoint, the combustion of petrol releases approximately 2.3 kg of CO2 per litre. When upstream emissions arising from crude oil extraction, refining, and transportation are incorporated, the well-to-wheel emissions of a typical petrol car in India fall within the range of 150–180 grams of CO2 per km, contingent upon vehicle efficiency and driving conditions.

Electric motors convert roughly 85–90 per cent of electrical energy into motion. But EVs do not generate energy. They depend on electricity that charges their batteries. EV performance is grid-dependent by design. This dependence becomes decisive in countries such as India, where electricity generation remains overwhelmingly coal-based (more than 75 per cent).

Scenario One: Petrol burned at the power plant

Consider a thought experiment. Instead of combusting petrol within a vehicle engine, the same fuel is burned in a thermal power plant to generate electricity, which is then used to charge an EV. Under real-world operating conditions, thermal power plants convert fuel into electricity at efficiencies of roughly 33–38 per cent. In India, an additional 15–17 per cent of generated electricity is lost during transmission and distribution before it reaches the end user. Charging losses and battery inefficiencies further erode usable energy by approximately 15–20 per cent.

Once these layered inefficiencies are aggregated, the ostensible efficiency superiority of EVs is substantially reduced. Multiple well-to-wheel studies demonstrate that an EV powered by electricity generated from petroleum products yields only a marginal reduction—and in some cases no reduction at all—in CO2 emissions relative to a petrol internal combustion engine vehicle. The apparent advantage dissolves once upstream losses are fully internalised.

Scenario Two: India’s coal-dominated grid

The comparison becomes more fraught when electricity is generated not from petrol but from coal. Coal-based electricity in India exhibits a high carbon intensity, frequently exceeding 800–900 grams of CO2 per kilowatt-hour at the point of generation. When transmission and distribution losses are incorporated, the effective emissions per delivered kilowatt-hour escalate further. Peer-reviewed studies find that EVs charged on coal-heavy grids can emit between 200 and 226 grams of CO2 per km on a well-to-wheel basis.

EVs and the hidden architecture of subsidies

Beneath the rapid global proliferation of EVs lies a dense, often obfuscated lattice of overt and covert subsidies.

Overt subsidies: Overt subsidies constitute the most visible instruments of state intervention. These include direct purchase incentives, tax rebates, reduced registration fees, and production-linked incentives for manufacturers. The United States’ federal tax credit of up to USD 7,500, generous purchase bonuses across Europe, and China’s expansive pre-2022 subsidy regime were central to early EV adoption. Empirical research corroborates this effect. A global econometric analysis finds EV demand to be highly price-elastic: a 1 per cent reduction in effective purchase price increases EV sales by approximately 2.5–3 per cent. Subsidies, in other words, translate into sales more than proportionately.

India’s experience conforms to this pattern. Under FAME-II, combined with GST reductions (from 12 per cent to 5 per cent) and state-level incentives, EV prices—particularly in the two-wheeler segment—were effectively reduced by 30–50 per cent. Empirical studies identify a statistically significant relationship between subsidy intensity and EV uptake, especially for electric two- and three-wheelers.

Covert subsidies: The invisible supports are less conspicuous, yet no less consequential. These encompass publicly financed charging infrastructure, preferential electricity tariffs, subsidised land for battery manufacturing, research grants, relaxed regulatory treatment, and import-duty exemptions for critical components. Globally, such support is substantial: the IEA estimates cumulative public spending on EV charging infrastructure exceeded USD 35 billion by 2023.

In India, most public charging stations are funded or co-funded by central and state governments, while distribution companies absorb part of the cost of preferential tariffs—effectively a cross-subsidy borne by other electricity consumers.

What happens when subsidies are withdrawn?

Cross-national evidence indicates that subsidy withdrawal precipitates price increases and adoption slowdowns, at least in the short to medium term. Germany’s reduction of EV purchase incentives in 2023 was followed by a marked deceleration in EV sales growth. Comparable effects were observed in Sweden and the Netherlands, particularly in private leasing markets. EU-level modelling suggests that eliminating purchase subsidies would significantly curtail EV market share, especially among middle-income households. In the United States, analysis indicates that up to half of early EV purchases would not have occurred absent subsidies.

Indian assessments are not much different. Without FAME-II and associated tax concessions, most mass-market electric two-wheelers and cars would struggle to compete with ICE alternatives, particularly given higher financing costs and persistent range anxiety. Bernstein Research concludes that the Indian EV industry “is not viable at scale without incentives” under prevailing cost structures. In a parliamentary response, the Minister of State for Heavy Industries stated that ₹6,559 crore had been disbursed as EV demand incentives up to 31 March 2025, benefiting 1,616,215 vehicles.

Price scenarios without subsidies

If these subsidies were withdrawn, EV prices would rise through multiple channels:

The removal of direct purchase incentives would immediately raise sticker prices by approximately 10–30 per cent, depending on the segment. The reinstatement of standard GST and road taxes would add a further 5–10 per cent. Infrastructure costs, no longer socialised, would increasingly be passed on to consumers via higher charging tariffs.

In the Indian context, the elimination of direct subsidies, preferential GST treatment, and state-level fiscal support would plausibly raise EV prices by roughly 30–45 per cent overall, fundamentally reconfiguring the affordability calculus that currently sustains EV adoption.

Carbon debt of electric vehicles: Manufacturing, materials, and the limits of decarbonisation

While EVs eliminate tailpipe emissions, this framing occludes a critical dimension: the substantial carbon debt incurred during manufacturing, particularly battery production.

Carbon debt refers to the upfront greenhouse gas emissions generated during raw material extraction, component manufacturing, and vehicle assembly. Life-cycle analysis studies consistently show that EVs leave the factory with higher embodied emissions than comparable petrol or diesel vehicles.

Lithium-ion battery production is the single largest contributor. Mining and refining lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, copper, and graphite, followed by energy-intensive cell manufacturing, generate emissions estimated at 60–100 kg CO₂-eq per kWh of battery capacity. For a mid-size EV with a 60–75 kWh battery, this translates into 4–7 tonnes of CO₂-eq even before accounting for the remainder of the vehicle. EVs also require greater quantities of aluminium and copper to offset battery mass—materials whose production is itself highly carbon-intensive.

Battery degradation compounds these concerns. EV batteries typically lose 20–30 per cent of capacity after 100,000 miles. Replacement costs can approach USD 20,000, rendering EV ownership economically untenable for lower-income households. Absent robust recycling systems, discarded battery packs pose serious contamination risks. Battery recycling infrastructure is limited and technologically demanding. In the United Kingdom, tens of thousands of used EV batteries remain in storage, with only a small fraction recycled.

Resource scarcity and geopolitical concentration further complicate the picture. Battery material supply chains are frequently associated with labour abuses and ecological degradation in producer countries, while dependence on a narrow set of processors—particularly in China—renders the EV ecosystem vulnerable to geopolitical shocks.",https://media.newindianexpress.com/newindianexpress%2F2026-01-17%2F4rdheihk%2FEV.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2026-01-17 19:58:57.416919

This transaction marks Mitsubishi’s largest acquisition to date and its first major foray into U.S. shale gas production, positioning the company as a key player in North America’s natural gas landscape. The assets span roughly 380,000 acres across Texas and Louisiana in the prolific Haynesville Shale formation, currently producing about 2.1 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of natural gas, equivalent to around 15 million metric tons per annum (mtpa) of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Mitsubishi anticipates peak production reaching 2.6 Bcf/d, or about 18 mtpa of LNG equivalent, which could cover roughly a quarter of Japan’s annual LNG demand.

Aethon Energy, a Dallas-based private firm founded in 1990, will retain operational responsibilities and has the option to repurchase up to 25% of the assets within six months of closing, expected between April and June 2026.

The sellers include Aethon Energy Management alongside major stakeholders like Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan and RedBird Capital Partners.

This deal aligns with Japan’s broader strategy to bolster energy security amid global uncertainties. As a resource-scarce nation heavily reliant on imports, Japan has ramped up investments in U.S. shale to ensure stable, diversified supplies. Recent examples include JERA’s $1.5 billion Haynesville acquisition in October 2025, part of Tokyo’s $550 billion U.S. investment pledge.

By controlling upstream production, Mitsubishi can better manage supply chains, reducing vulnerability to price swings and geopolitical risks while supporting the energy transition with natural gas as a bridge fuel.

Earnings Insights for the Companies Involved

Mitsubishi Corporation, a diversified trading conglomerate, reported solid financials in its latest Q2 FY2025 results (six months ended September 30, 2025). Underlying operating cash flow stood at ¥446.3 billion, with consolidated net income at ¥355.8 billion, on track for full-year forecasts of ¥900 billion in operating cash flow and ¥700 billion in net income.

The Environmental Energy segment, which encompasses natural gas and LNG, saw its full-year forecast revised upward to ¥93 billion from ¥82 billion, reflecting optimism in restructuring upstream LNG businesses.

Mitsubishi projects the Haynesville assets to contribute significantly post-acquisition, with an estimated FY2027 underlying operating cash flow of ¥270-300 billion and consolidated net income of ¥70-80 billion on a 100% basis.

Aethon Energy, as a privately held entity, discloses limited public financials. Recent estimates peg its annual revenue between $500 million and $1 billion, with a three-year average EBITDA of around ¥200 billion (approximately $1.3 billion USD at current exchange rates).

The company’s hedging strategy for 2025-2026 covers significant portions of production at prices around $2.77-$3.10 per thousand cubic feet, providing revenue stability amid market volatility.

What This Means for Investors

For Mitsubishi investors, the deal enhances portfolio resilience by integrating upstream assets into its global LNG value chain, potentially driving long-term earnings growth. The company emphasizes capturing U.S. demand surges from AI/data centers, manufacturing, and LNG exports, while hedging risks through production optimization and futures markets.

However, shares dipped 2% on the announcement, reflecting concerns over the premium paid and near-term payback horizons in a volatile energy market.

Broader energy investors may see this as a bullish signal for U.S. shale, with Japanese capital inflows (now controlling 32% of operated Haynesville volumes) validating the basin’s role in global LNG supply.

The buy-and-hold strategy could stabilize valuations, but it also highlights risks like regulatory hurdles or price downturns.

Implications for ConsumersConsumers, particularly in Japan and Asia, stand to benefit from enhanced energy security and potentially more stable pricing. By securing competitive U.S. gas, Mitsubishi can mitigate supply disruptions, supporting affordable imports amid rising global demand.

In the U.S., the deal could boost local production and infrastructure, indirectly lowering domestic gas costs while contributing to economic growth in Texas and Louisiana. Globally, it promotes natural gas as a cleaner alternative during the transition to renewables, though environmental groups may scrutinize methane emissions from shale operations.

The Path to Japan: Natural Gas to LNG and Shipping

Haynesville gas will flow via in-house midstream infrastructure and secured pipelines to Gulf Coast LNG terminals, optimizing sales through Mitsubishi’s Houston-based CIMA Energy.

Key among these is Cameron LNG in Louisiana, where Mitsubishi holds a 16.6% stake through a partnership with Japanese shipping firm NYK Line and liquefaction tolling rights.

Gas will be liquefied there for export, with portions earmarked for Asia (including Japan) and Europe.

Shipping will likely involve NYK’s LNG fleet, leveraging Mitsubishi’s integrated logistics to ensure efficient delivery.

This acquisition not only fortifies Japan’s energy supply lines but also signals a new era of international collaboration in the global gas market. As Mitsubishi integrates these assets, watch for ripple effects on LNG pricing and U.S. export dynamics in the coming years.

It means plans to ramp up domestic battery manufacturing by 2030 will remain heavily reliant on parts made overseas.

Modelling by the Institute for Public Policy Research found that a yearlong interruption at the main suppliers of battery parts could cost as many as 90,000 UK jobs and wipe out production of more than 580,000 electric vehicles from 2030.

Such a shock would leave domestic carmakers ceding ground to Chinese electric-vehicle manufacturers, with BYD Co. already increasing its UK market share from 0.5% to 2.5% in 2025, and would ripple into other industries such as rail, aerospace and defense manufacturing, the think tank warned in a report published Friday.

Batteries are just one of the clean-energy areas where the UK is exposed to global markets, just as tensions intensify following US President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Disruptions to supplies of solar panels, steel and critical minerals also threaten the transition to net zero carbon emissions and jobs in regions already weakened by industrial decline, the report said.

“Trump’s trade war with China, the rise of conflicts around the world – these shocks ultimately hurt the UK economy because we rely so much on trade to source the essentials, including clean energy technologies,” said Pranesh Narayanan, senior research fellow at the IPPR.

The IPPR also estimated that delays to solar deployment and continued reliance on gas could also add about £1.5 billion ($2 billion) a year to energy import costs.

The researcher offered some policy recommendations to increase the UK’s energy resilience. It said the government should invest in domestic production, diversify supply with allies, build strategic stockpiles and set out a clear stance on Chinese involvement in the most critical supply chains.

“The UK is a small open trading nation sailing through an international economy whose waters are getting choppier by the day,” Narayanan said.

More From Our Experts

President Donald Trump talked of purchasing Greenland in 2019 during his first time in office, but Europeans have only now realized how serious he is about acquiring it by any means necessary.

At first, Europeans deployed the same playbook they used to safeguard NATO during the alliance’s June 2025 summit at The Hague. To avert the worst of tariffs for the European market and prevent a breakdown of U.S. support for Ukraine, leaders engaged the president directly and sold him a victory. Announcing favorable trade deals or new defense spending successes allowed the administration to claim victory and move on from the issue, before negotiations and reality set in and complicated the picture.

Facing similar tensions over Greenland, the Europeans adopted a strategy that effectively offered “everything but territory” to address the economic and security concerns of the United States. European, Danish, and Greenlandic officials offered a greater NATO presence (called Arctic Sentry, in reference to NATO’s Baltic mission), more U.S. troops, and several investment deals for resources. All this notwithstanding the fact that the United States already has an agreement with Denmark and Greenland—one of three that governs the U.S. relationship with the island—that allows it to increase its military presence on Greenland as desired.

But Europe has found that its playbook is not working as effectively as in the past. This time, Trump’s desires seem to be not only about security and economic concerns, but about territory. And this is a bright red line for the European side: A U.S. annexation of Greenland would violate Danish sovereignty and Greenland’s right of self-determination. It would also be a crass breach of international law that would end theNATO alliance. If the United States—as the group’s most powerful member—annexed the territory of another NATO member, how could the alliance’s defense pledge be considered credible?

More From Our Experts

Europeans have therefore begun to complement their strategy of engagement with deterrence. The idea is to raise the stakes of any forceful U.S. action on Greenland and demonstrate that annexing the island will not be an easy win, but have “unprecedented knock-on effects,” as French President Emmanuel Macron put it. Europeans hope that Trump is just testing the boundaries of how much resistance he will evoke, and that standing firmly united will make him back off.

To achieve this, European leaders are working with members of the U.S. Congress with the hope of future legislation that would make it more difficult for the president to make a move on Greenland. A bipartisan congressional delegation currently visiting Denmark and the island is meant to convey the message that there is no interest whatsoever for a U.S. takeover. In addition, Europeans are signaling to Congress that the possession of an island that is much smaller than it appears on the standard Mercator projection map is not worth the dissolution of NATO.

Europeans are also weighing their economic and military options to deter Trump’s threat. On the economic side, the use of limited sanctions, further punitive measures against U.S. tech companies, and the European Union’s (EU) anti-coercion instrument—which was already considered but discarded as a response to U.S. tariffs—are back as actions of last resort. However, Trump’s threat to use tariffs once again over Greenland may discourage some Europeans for fear of escalation.

On the military side, France, Germany, Norway, and Sweden have deployed a small number of troops to Greenland to deter a fait accompli from the U.S. side (and France has proposed sending more). However, Europeans are fully aware that a military conflict with the United States would be a disastrous scenario that they will only lose. Other “nuclear options,” like limiting U.S. access to bases in Europe, are technically available. But this tactic would assume that the transatlantic relationship is already irreparably harmed.

Yet, for all the same reasons European leaders have repeatedly genuflected to Trump—namely their near-total reliance on the United States for Europe’s defense —these nuclear options are unlikely to materialize. For many European capitals, there’s a difference between considering the relationship broken and actively breaking it.

Europe could attempt to divert Trump’s attention with various delaying tactics or wait and hope that it happens naturally. It is easy to imagine this happening, with Trump’s agenda so full. Iran, for example, is one area that could consume the president’s full focus, forcing him to move on.

But Greenland is not the only item challenging transatlantic relations. For Europe’s relationship with the United States, there is now an era before the publication of the U.S. National Security Strategy (NSS) and one after that. Prior to its release, Europeans thought they could still work with Trump constructively and that the administration considered Europe a partner, not a potential adversary.

After the release of the NSS and the Trump administration’s twenty-eight-point Ukraine peace plan—and now these threats to seize territory from Denmark—Europeans have lost all illusions about the transatlantic relationship and are just trying to prevent the very worst. The fact that Vice President JD Vance canceled his scheduled participation at the upcoming Munich Security Conference sends the message that the administration believes there is nothing to discuss, that everything has been said in the NSS, and that the White House stands by it.

Europe cannot afford to continually be caught so flatfooted on this and other issues. It needs to take the following lesson from Greenland and all prior disputes: Trump should be taken seriously, and they must plan for what was once considered unimaginable.

That sun has provided him cheap power for 25 years, and this month he installed his fourth iteration of solar panels on his Vermont home. In an interview after he set up the new system, he said President Donald Trump’s stance against solar and other cheap green energy will hurt the GOP in this year’s elections as electricity bills rise.

After the Biden and Obama administrations subsidized and championed solar, wind and other green power as answers to fight climate change, Trump has tried to dampen those and turn to older and dirtier fossil fuels. The Trump administration froze five big offshore wind projects last month but judges this week allowed three of the projects to resume. Federal clean energy tax incentives expired on Dec. 31 that include installing home solar panels.

Meanwhile, electricity prices are rising in the United States, and McKibben is counting on that to trigger political change.

“I think you’re starting to see that have a big political impact in the U.S. right now. My prediction would be that electric prices are going to be to the 2026 election what egg prices were to the 2024 election,” said McKibben, an author and founder of multiple environmental and activist groups. Everyday inflation hurt Democrats in the last presidential race, analysts said.

The Trump administration and a bipartisan group of governors on Friday tried to step up pressure on the operator of the nation’s largest electric grid to take urgent steps to boost power supplies in the mid-Atlantic and keep electricity bills from rising even higher.

“Ensuring the American people have reliable and affordable electricity is one of President Trump’s top priorities,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.

Renewable energy prices drop around the world

Globally, the price of wind and solar power is plummeting to the point that they are cheaper than fossil fuels, the United Nations found. And China leads the world in renewable energy technology, with one of its electric car companies passing Tesla in annual sales.

“We can’t economically compete in a world where China gets a lot of cheap energy and we have to pay for really expensive energy,” McKibben told The Associated Press, just after he installed a new type of solar panels that can hang on balconies with little fuss.

When Trump took office in January 2025, the national average electricity cost was 15.94 cents per kilowatt-hour. By September it was up to 18.07 cents and then down slightly to 17.98 cents in October, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

That’s a 12.8% increase in 10 months. It rose more in 10 months than the previous two years. People in Maryland, New Jersey and Maine have seen electricity prices rise at a rate three times higher than the national average since October 2024.

At 900 kilowatt-hours per month, that means the average monthly electricity bill is about $18 more than in January 2025.

Democrats blame Trump for rising electric bills

This week, Democrats on Capitol Hill blamed rising electric bills on Trump and his dislike of renewable energy.

“From his first day in office, he’s made it his mission to limit American’s access to cheap energy, all in the name of increasing profits for his friends in the fossil fuel industry. As a result, energy bills across the country have skyrocketed,” Illinois Rep. Sean Casten said at a Wednesday news conference.

“Donald Trump is the first president to intentionally raise the price of something that we all need,” Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, also a Democrat, said Wednesday on the Senate floor. “Nobody should be enthused about paying more for electricity, and this national solar ban is making everybody pay more. Clean is cheap and cheap is clean.”

Solar panels on McKibben’s Vermont home

McKibben has been sending excess electricity from his solar panels to the Vermont grid for years. Now he’s sending more.

As his dog, Birke, stood watch, McKibben, who refers to his home nestled in the Green Mountains of Vermont as a “museum of solar technology” got his new panels up and running in about 10 minutes. This type of panel from the California-based firm Bright Saver is often referred to as plug-in solar. Though it’s not yet widely available in the U.S., McKibben pointed to the style’s popularity in Europe and Australia.

“Americans spend three or four times as much money as Australians or Europeans to put solar panels on the roof. We have an absurdly overcomplicated permitting system that’s unlike anything else on the rest of the planet,” McKibben said.

McKibben said Australians can obtain three hours of free electricity each day through a government program because the country has built so many solar panels.

“And I’m almost certain that that’s an argument that every single person in America would understand,” he said. “I don’t know anyone who wouldn’t say: ‘I’d like three free hours of electricity.’”

The move is expected to attract“considerable” Chinese investment in Canada's auto sector within three years, Carney said, even as it risks friction with Washington.

Speaking in Beijing, Carney framed the deal as part of a broader effort to diversify Canada's trade partnerships in the wake of what he described as an“unreliable” U.S. approach under President Donald Trump.“In terms of the way that our relationship has progressed in recent months with China, it is more predictable,” Carney said. He also emphasized the depth of Canada-U.S. ties, calling the relationship“more multifaceted, much deeper, much broader.”

The policy reversal marks a departure from October 2025, when Ottawa imposed 100 percent tariffs on Chinese EVs in alignment with Washington, effectively halting imports. Carney noted that the new quotas return imports to 2023 levels, prior to the tariff restrictions.

The announcement coincides with recent protectionist moves in North America. Mexico's Senate last month raised its own Chinese EV tariff to 50 percent from 20, as automakers adapt assembly lines for electrified models. In return, China has agreed to reduce retaliatory tariffs on Canadian canola from a combined 85 percent to around 15 percent by March 1, easing long-standing trade tensions between the two countries.

While critics-including Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Canadian union leaders-warn that Chinese EVs could threaten the domestic auto industry, Carney downplayed the risk, noting that the quota represents a low single-digit proportion of Canada's auto market, where Canadians purchase about 1.8 million vehicles annually. Ford emphasized that imports must be tied to new manufacturing and employment in Ontario to be acceptable.

The shift follows an informal review of Canada's tariff policy launched last year, driven in part by China's punitive tariffs on Canadian canola. Carney's government is seeking to reduce reliance on the U.S. market and double non-U.S. trade within a decade, while attracting foreign investment.

One year into President Donald Trump’s second term, one of his most potent campaign pledges is unraveling under the weight of hard data.

Trump rode back to the White House promising to slash American energy bills by 50 percent, vowing that “energy dominance” would deliver instant relief to households battered by inflation. Instead, the opposite has happened. Electricity and gas costs have risen nationwide, leaving families paying more—not less—for basic utilities.

An analysis by The Guardian shows that average US electricity bills rose by 6.7 percent in 2025, while gas prices climbed by 5.2 percent. For the typical household, that translates into an additional $116 (about Sh15,000) per year, puncturing the president’s central economic pitch.

“Your Bill Will Be 5-0 Percent Less”

On the campaign trail in Detroit in 2024, Trump made the promise unmistakably clear:

“Your bill will be 5-0 percent less.”

Twelve months later, that pledge is proving politically toxic.

The increases have been uneven—but brutal in key regions. Washington, D.C. recorded a staggering 23 percent jump in electricity bills, while parts of the Midwest, long considered Trump’s electoral backbone, have also seen sustained rises. The pain is now extending beyond low-income households; middle-class families are increasingly struggling to keep up.

Tariffs, Markets, and Unintended Consequences

Energy economists point to a convergence of forces undermining the White House narrative.

Global fuel markets remain volatile, while Trump’s renewed tariff-heavy trade policy has driven up the cost of imported components critical for energy infrastructure—from transformers to grid hardware. Utilities, facing higher capital and maintenance costs, have passed those increases directly to consumers.

The result: disconnections for unpaid bills have reportedly surged, in some states increasing several-fold, an indicator usually associated with economic downturns rather than “dominance.”

Political Fallout Ahead of the Midterms

The timing could hardly be worse for Republicans. Energy affordability cuts across ideology, and rising utility bills are among the most visible costs of living for voters. In swing districts, the contrast between promise and performance is already being weaponized by Democrats, who argue that deregulation and tariffs have delivered corporate windfalls, not household relief.

Trump, for his part, has doubled down on his familiar mantra—“drill, baby, drill”—insisting that expanded domestic production will eventually bring prices down. But critics note that oil and gas output does not automatically translate into cheaper electricity, particularly in a grid shaped by regulation, infrastructure costs, and global supply chains.

The Bottom Line

Energy independence, it turns out, is not the same as energy affordability.

For millions of Americans, the numbers that matter are not the ones touted at rallies, but the figures printed on monthly bills. And right now, those numbers tell a far less triumphant story—one that threatens to turn a signature Trump promise into a defining political liability as the midterms approach.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c93dca57078f0e450903b892301db46052aaa7d7/0_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8c91e7885ae840e84e04023ca276e87e",N,,2026-01-17 14:59:12.308019

TCEQ says water safe for almost all uses

A public hearing for a proposed wastewater treatment plant planned for Taylor’s extraterritorial jurisdiction drew a crowd of about 50 armed with questions, research and concerns about erosion and pollution.

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality session held Jan. 12 at the Williamson County Expo Center was the last opportunity for the public to register comments before the state agency considers approving the wastewater permit.

Discharges from the facility are expected to

“ The subsequent continuous flow will make it impossible to control the soil erosion that will occur when the sewage plant is opened.”

— Glenn Harrington contain five-day carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids, ammonia nitrogen and E. coli bacteria, plus additional potential pollutants, according to the

application. Despite worries raised by residents, TCEQ said the water would still be safe for all uses except drinking, including swimming, playing, feeding livestock and watering vegetable gardens.

Residents said they are also apprehensive about the effect of erosion as waters rush through normally dry creek beds.

Glen Harrington, whose property includes a small creek designated to carry wastewater, said heavy rains often force him to rebuild the creek banks due to erosion.

“These creeks that only run part of the year are easily maintained. The dumping of 150,000 gallons per day of treated sewage, and the subsequent continuous flow will make it impossible to control the soil erosion that will occur when the sewage plant is opened,” Harrington said.

Jessica Anderson, a TCEQ staff attorney, told attendees TECQ would mail a document answering all official comments from the public hearing within 60 days.

Meanwhile, those potentially affected by the treatment plant who filed comments can request a contested case 30 days after a response is mailed.

The application for a Texas Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit was submitted in 2024. The development was originally planned to be residential, with 612 homes being built. Since then, the usage has changed to commercial.

TCEQ staff said the permit would not allow the development to discharge water from industrial or data center facilities.

The treatment plant will be about 850 feet northeast of FM 112 at Tucek Road. The wastewater will flow into a small, unnamed stream that travels one mile before meeting with Malish Lake.

After three miles, the flowing effluent meets Mustang Creek which later joins with Brushy Creek.

The unnamed stream is often dry, in some places running only when there is rain. In Texas, waterways which are considered navigable are the property of the state. The law identifies specific non-navigable streams, generally those under 30 feet wide that do not run year-round, as private property.

Luis Ayala, who said his home and business on 112 will be affected by the wastewater runoff, said the privateproperty issue means the commercial development will essentially be dumping wastewater on his land.

TCEQ officials said the Texas Water Code allows them to issue discharge permits for all groundwater sources, navigable or not.

Ayala said the public hearing was no more than a procedural item for TCEQ.

“The proposed discharge is 150,000 gallons per day. This is equivalent to 6,250 gallons per hour, or 104 gallons per minute. Typical household garden-hose flow rates are 5-9 gallons per minute for half-inch hoses,” Ayala said.

The public hearing was requested by state Rep. Caroline Harris Davila, R-Round Rock, and state Sen. Charles Schwertner, R- Georgetown. Katharine Chambers from Harris’ staff attended.

Williamson County Precinct 4 Commissioner Russ Boles and Cyrus Reed, conservation director of the state chapter of the Sierra Club, have also previously contacted TCEQ regarding the application.

According to Smetters, the primary issue with wealth taxes is that they rarely meet revenue expectations.
As of June 2024, only four countries in the OECD had a wealth tax, and the U.S. does not have any on the books; it’s unclear whether any would be constitutional.
Noting that most repeals were permanent, not experimental reversals, he said France was an exception, replacing a general wealth tax with a narrow real-estate tax.","The Wharton School professor and faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model (PWBM), speaking to Fortune from his office in Philadelphia, recently argued that the measure is an inefficient revenue tool born from a “perfect storm of craziness” in the current economic and social climate that makes “populist” ideas like this so sticky.

He has advised Congress on dynamic scoring, and policymakers from both parties consult him while drafting major tax and spending legislation. Smetters has described much of the PWBM’s work as private analysis, even a “sandbox,” for legislators to workshop ideas before bills are written.​ He lives and breathes economic policy.

According to Smetters, the primary issue with wealth taxes is that they rarely meet revenue expectations. “When you think about the wealth tax itself,” he told Fortune, “it’s not really a super efficient way of raising money over time, and it also often doesn’t actually raise as much revenue as people think.” He noted that many countries that adopted a wealth tax “gave up on it, partly just because it raised a lot less revenue than what they were thinking.”

Examples are legion of countries abandoning wealth-targeted taxes, from Austria in 1994 to Denmark and Germany in 1997, to France in 2018. As of June 2024, only four countries in the OECD had a wealth tax, and the U.S. does not have any on the books; it’s unclear whether any would be constitutional. Smetters noted that almost all repealed wealth taxes raised an amount less than or equal to 0.3% of GDP, often much less, showing his point that there just isn’t as much money in them as people think. Also, the administrative costs were high relative to revenue, especially due to asset valuation and avoidance. Noting that most repeals were permanent, not experimental reversals, he said France was an exception, replacing a general wealth tax with a narrow real-estate tax.

Smetters cited some PWBM research that asked the question: what would happen if it were illegal to be a billionaire, as some far-left figures such as Zohran Mamdani have previously suggested. If the federal government seized every dollar from every individual above $999 million at current market value, the resulting “wealth grab” would only fund the federal government for about seven to eight months, he said. “What people don’t realize is [there’s] just not as much money there as people think.”

A Different Path Forward

Instead of “jacking up” income taxes or implementing a wealth tax that targets illiquid assets—such as sports teams or startups—Smetters suggested that California could do with “broader participation in tax revenue,” recommending that the state consider more stable, broad-based options like a large sales tax or a value added tax (VAT). Without such discipline, Smetters warned that the state’s reliance on a highly progressive and volatile tax system will continue to leave it vulnerable to economic shifts.

Some progressive policy analysts and economists argue that PWBM, under Smetters’ direction, builds in assumptions that overstate the growth costs of deficits and taxes while understating the benefits of public investment, which they claim biases the model against expansive social spending.. If anything, Smetters argues, the PWBM does the opposite. Critics argue this biases PWBM’s results against expansive social spending, whereas Smetters offers examples of spending that grows the economy if designed well, including investments in pre-K education, healthcare, the environment, and some public goods. PWBM analysis also shows that, contrary to popular opinion, more high-skill immigration generally raises all wages, including for native-born workers.

Smetters said that he has a free-market bias somewhat, in the sense that he jokingly calls himself “80% libertarian,” meaning he generally thinks free market principles are the most effective at increasing human welfare, with some regulatory exceptions including pollution control and some human capital investments, especially at younger ages. In contrast, a lot of government spending today goes higher-income and older people.

Could the economy actually be harmed, Fortune asked Smetters, if the massively improved standard of living means that life is full of annoying, hidden expenses, prompting a widespread dissatisfaction with the economy and a populist thirst for wealth taxes? Smetters noted that even some conservative economists such as Milton Friedman and Martin Feldstein (his own dissertation advisor), had a very strong free-market orientation, “but they would basically agree that markets work well when you don’t deceive people and exploit people.”

A ‘Perfect Storm of Craziness’

When asked why he thinks there is such a push for a billionaires tax at the moment, Smetters described what he saw as a “perfect storm of craziness” involving the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the influence of social media. The concentration in the S&P 500 is one thing, he said, with only 10 companies at the top really driving all the gains in the three-year bull market since ChatGPT was released, and an existential fear (driven on by tech billionaires) about AI coming to replace everyone’s job. Smetters said this was making people “unnecessarily anxious” that “we’re getting replaced by robots and so forth.”

Standing in front of a row of terminals working away on his budget analyses, Smetters insisted that “the reality is that AI is not going to be that as impactful as people think.” Pointing at the computers all around him, he noted, “I literally have models running right now, and so I am a big user of AI,” but many were “probably embellishing how much impact it’s going to potentially have.” He distinguished between the two types of technologies: labor-augmenting versus labor-replacing, insisting that AI would be the former.

The economist cited a well-known phenomenon in behavioral economics known as the “money illusion,” where people don’t believe that they have, in fact, actually gotten richer because they are shocked by higher prices they see around them. “The reality is that, in fact, we have a much higher standard of living than we had even 20 or 30 years ago,” Smetter said. He allowed that much of this is poorly measured, and some goods are even priced at zero. “I’m not saying there’s no problems,” he allowed, but he said it’s a much different world from when he was growing up, and his low-income family had to budget for, say, their car breaking down every so often.","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2249826533-e1768592346699.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2026-01-17 13:00:25.817368

The CVOW project will consist of 176 offshore wind energy turbines with a combined capacity of 2.6 gigawatts, which the company says could power up to 660,000 homes.
Dominion Energy describes the project as part of its strategy to meet the region’s growing energy demand.
In other recent news, Dominion Resources has faced significant developments concerning its Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project.
Dominion Energy expressed concerns that this pause could impact grid reliability in areas with critical infrastructure, including military installations and data centers.","RICHMOND, Va. - The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia has granted Dominion Energy a preliminary injunction allowing construction to resume on its Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project, according to a company press release. The utility giant, with a market capitalization of nearly $52 billion, has seen its stock trading near its 52-week high of $62.87 as investors respond to developments in this significant renewable energy initiative.

The court decision enables work to continue on the project while Dominion Energy’s lawsuit challenging a federal agency’s action proceeds. The company stated it will now focus on safely restarting construction activities to ensure the project begins delivering energy in the coming weeks. InvestingPro data shows Dominion currently operates with a significant debt burden, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.83, reflecting the capital-intensive nature of such large infrastructure projects.

The CVOW project will consist of 176 offshore wind energy turbines with a combined capacity of 2.6 gigawatts, which the company says could power up to 660,000 homes. Dominion Energy describes the project as part of its strategy to meet the region’s growing energy demand. Despite the capital expenditure, the company has maintained its impressive 43-year streak of consecutive dividend payments, currently offering investors a 4.42% yield.

Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) provides regulated electricity service to 3.6 million customers across Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, along with natural gas service to 500,000 customers in South Carolina.

The company is pursuing a resolution of the matter through continued cooperation with the federal government while its legal challenge moves forward.

In other recent news, Dominion Resources has faced significant developments concerning its Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project. The U.S. Department of Interior issued a 90-day suspension of work on the project, citing national security concerns related to potential radar interference with military operations. This suspension affects multiple offshore wind projects, representing a $25 billion investment collectively. Dominion Energy expressed concerns that this pause could impact grid reliability in areas with critical infrastructure, including military installations and data centers.

Analyst firms have responded to these developments with mixed reactions. Jefferies lowered its price target for Dominion Resources from $62.00 to $60.00, maintaining a Hold rating, due to potential regulatory risks associated with the CVOW project. Meanwhile, TD Cowen initiated coverage on Dominion Resources with a Hold rating and a $65.00 price target, describing the company as a ""classic turnaround utility story."" BTIG has reiterated its Neutral rating on Dominion Resources, citing recent regulatory decisions that provide the company with increased certainty. These developments highlight the ongoing challenges and opportunities facing Dominion Resources in its energy projects.

Environmental groups argued Friday that PJM’s data center plan favors fossil fuels.
“The primary fast-tracking of energy PJM is doing is biased towards fossil gas,” wrote Charkoudian, vice chair of the House Economic Matters Committee.
Stanek, a former Maryland utility regulator, argued that PJM has pursued multiple reforms to approve new energy projects more quickly.
But he remains concerned that Moore will focus on renewable sources, such as wind and solar, to supply that new power to the grid.","Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) found himself in a rare position Friday: Joining forces with President Donald Trump’s (R) administration on energy policy.

Moore was one of 13 governors who signed an agreement with the Trump administration, pushing for PJM Interconnection, the operator of the nation’s largest electric grid, to bring $15 billion worth of new power online — with data center companies paying the tab.

Moore has been a critic of PJM, arguing that its policies delayed new clean energy projects, which got stuck in a backlogged queue waiting for approval, and then electricity demand skyrocketed because of power-hungry data centers.

“I have been crystal clear: We cannot build a 21st-century economy on an energy market that blocks new supply,” Moore said in a statement Friday. “This moment calls for urgency. Maryland families and businesses must be served by a reliable grid without shouldering the cost of sky-high energy bills.”

But PJM’s Board of Directors released its own data center plan later Friday.

That plan also initiated a “backstop procurement” for new energy. But PJM merely directed its staff to study assigning the costs of new energy to the jurisdictions, who could then pass those costs to the data center companies, such as Amazon and Google.

PJM’s plan also encourages — but doesn’t mandate — “bring your own generation,” wherein data centers could choose to bring new power onto the system on an expedited basis, to defray the possibility of being asked to reduce their power demand when the grid is strained.

“This decision is about how PJM integrates large new loads in a way that preserves reliability for customers while creating a predictable, transparent path for growth,” said David Mills, PJM Board Chair and Interim President and CEO, in a statement.

“This is not a yes/no to data centers,” Mills’ statement said. “This is, ‘How can we do this while keeping the lights on and recognizing the impact on consumers at the same time?’ We look forward to implementing, along with our stakeholders, these proposals to manage the phenomenal demand growth we are experiencing.”

PJM’s plan also includes changes to the way that the grid operator forecasts energy demand. Concerns had been raised that PJM’s projections were inflated, because companies looking to build data centers could be shopping the same data center proposal in more than one jurisdiction.

According to a news release from PJM, some of the items will require approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, while others can take place immediately.

Environmental groups argued Friday that PJM’s data center plan favors fossil fuels.

The Natural Resources Defense Council said in a statement that PJM’s decision protects “everyday families from blackouts” caused by data centers, but it falls short when it comes to new power generation.

PJM has created a “fast-track process that effectively excludes clean energy projects and gives special treatment to fossil fuel power plants built for data centers, allowing them to cut ahead of low-cost clean resources that have been waiting years to connect to the grid,” wrote Claire Lang-Ree, advocate for the Sustainable FERC Project at NRDC.

Maryland Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D- Montgomery) also chimed in, adding that PJM’s decision doesn’t provide sufficient protections for ratepayers.

“The primary fast-tracking of energy PJM is doing is biased towards fossil gas,” wrote Charkoudian, vice chair of the House Economic Matters Committee. “Given that solar and batteries are the fastest, cheapest way to provide new generation, this is another example of PJM serving for-profit energy companies and not families who can’t afford their energy bill.”

A Trump spokesperson called the administration’s plan with the governors an “unprecedented bi-partisan effort urging PJM to fix the energy subtraction failures of the past, prevent price increases, and reduce the risk of blackouts.”

“Ensuring the American people have reliable and affordable electricity is one of President Trump’s top priorities, and this would deliver much-needed, long-term relief to the Mid-Atlantic region,” wrote White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers in a statement.

The governors’ proposal would also have extended a cap on PJM’s energy capacity auction, which has lowered the price charged to ratepayers from the last several auctions, during which PJM procures energy supply to feed the grid in the future.

But PJM decided to request additional feedback about the cap before making a final decision.

Meanwhile, PJM executive director Jason Stanek was in Annapolis on Friday, speaking to a panel of legislators from Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, convened by Maryland’s conservative Freedom Caucus.

Stanek, a former Maryland utility regulator, argued that PJM has pursued multiple reforms to approve new energy projects more quickly.

“Despite what you may have heard, our interconnection queue is open, and PJM has been processing the connection of new, and mostly renewable, resources to connect to the grid at record pace,” Stanek said. “We soon hope to turn around requests in a period of one to two years, or possibly sooner.”

During his remarks, Stanek said that states own part of the blame for energy supply worries — and high electric bills, citing state-level energy policies and permitting procedures. He urged the legislators in the room to look inward as they aim to reduce prices.

“We would implore all of our states in the PJM region not to retire any more [power] resources until you have a sufficient amount of resources to backfill those retirements,” Stanek said.

“We would also ask that you look at your state permitting laws on the books to determine whether or not we can actually build energy infrastructure in your states in a timely manner.”

The Republicans in attendance were insistent that Maryland has contributed to its own power woes, by passing legislation to push the state away from fossil fuels — and toward a grid fueled by solar, wind and nuclear power. By law, Maryland has until 2031 to cut its carbon emissions 60% from 2006 levels.

“Why would politicians push to force the economy onto electricity while simultaneously shutting down the very power plants needed to generate it? It’s simple. Virtue signaling, green dreams over common sense,” said Del. Mark Fisher (R-Calvert).

Senate Minority Leader Steve Hershey (R-Upper Shore) said Friday that he was initially encouraged by the PJM governors’ announcement, because he agrees that data centers should pay for new power. But he remains concerned that Moore will focus on renewable sources, such as wind and solar, to supply that new power to the grid.

“Gov. Moore needs to embrace natural gas,” Hershey said. “He hasn’t done it yet. He’s trying to talk about nuclear, because it’s clean, but nuclear is 12 or 15 years out. As we heard today in this hearing, the quickest way to get reliable energy back on grid is to open up these retired fossil fuel generation facilities.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-101/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/52232240165_3efe674540_o-1024x6831768665316.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=RSos3tNW,N,,2026-01-17 12:00:00.463520

Texas recently became the first state to purchase bitcoin after a legislative effort that began in 2024, but numerous states have joined the ""Reserve Race"" to pass legislation that will allow them to ultimately buy cryptocurrencies.

New Hampshire passed its crypto strategic reserve law last May, even before Texas, giving the state treasurer the authority to invest up to 5% of the state funds in crypto ETFs, though precious metals such as gold are also authorized for purchase. Arizona passed similar legislation, while Massachusetts, Ohio, and South Dakota have legislation at various stages of committee review.

Despite much of the legislation being largely sponsored or co-sponsored by Republicans, the adoption of crypto at the state level is not expected to strictly fall along party lines. The 2024 election cycle was the first time that the cryptocurrency industry played a major role in lobbying in both state and national elections. In fact, it was the largest corporate donor in an election cycle, with support given to candidates on both sides. It is already amassing a war chest for the 2026 midterms.

Congress is currently debating a crypto market structure bill, and state-level politicians are as much out to prove that they, and their states, won't be left out of the digital assets boom. Justin Marlowe, a public policy professor at the University of Chicago, sees the state-level trend as largely one of signaling at present. ""If you're a governor and you want to broadcast that you are amenable to innovative business development in the digital economy, these are relatively low-cost, low-risk ways to send that signal. That's why we've seen leaders across the ideological spectrum and all over the country take tangible steps in this direction,"" he said.

Where the state-level crypto efforts can be described as ""bigger steps"" — Marlowe cited Texas, Arizona, and Florida, as examples — he said it has helped to acknowledge the growing political power of crypto advocates in these states.

Similarities in the actions taken across states to date include include authorizing the state treasurer or other investment official to allow the investment of a limited amount of public funds in crypto and building out the governance structure needed to invest in crypto. This often will involve more frequent reporting requirements and stronger custodial agreements compared to traditional asset classes. The seeding of the reserve can take the form of utilizing cash or government-seized crypto, as in the recent case of the federal government. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a strategic bitcoin reserve last March, but limited the authorization to seized crypto in an effort to show taxpayers would bear no financial burden.

It is no surprise that Texas was the first state to fund a crypto reserve. Texas has been a crypto hub for years through its role in bitcoin mining. The state's affordable and flexible power, as well as a political environment that has largely been pro-crypto, led Texas in recent years to a sizable position in not just the national, but global bitcoin hashing market.

""Texas has spent the last few years becoming one of the key centers of bitcoin activity, especially on the mining side,"" said Christian Catalini, founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab, seeing this move as one that early branded the state as ""open for business"" when it comes to digital assets.

""Once you've made that bet on infrastructure and industry, adding some Bitcoin exposure at the treasury level is a natural next step,"" Catalini said. Such a move essentially makes the state's balance sheet one that is explicitly aligned with the ecosystem it aims to attract.

Texas also has a long history with bitcoin's traditional market competitor: gold.

""Texas has proven to be a bedrock of government adoption of bitcoin, starting with laws that allow for legal custody arrangements akin to gold storage laws that are well established there,"" said Nik Bhatia, founder of The Bitcoin Layer.

When it comes to storing physical gold, Texas has clear rules on storage and ownership, and even the language invoked – vaults, custodians – helps grease the wheels for crypto assets at the state level. The Texas Bullion Depository of 2015, which allowed for state-level depository of bullion and precious metals, was specifically adapted to apply to digital assets like bitcoin. The Texas Bullion Depositary was the first state-administered precious metals depository in the nation.

Texas has not purchased any on-chain bitcoin. After passing the legislation to create a strategic bitcoin reserve that gave authorization to the state comptroller to hold the cryptocurrency, Texas purchased a stake in a bitcoin ETF — roughly $5 million in the largest bitcoin ETF, the BlackRock iShares' Bitcoin Trust (IBIT ), which since its launch in January 2024 has grown to over $72 billion in assets under management.

The Comptroller's office made its purchase on the morning of November 20, 2025, when the price of a single bitcoin was $91,336. As of Saturday morning, bitcoin was trading at a little over $95,000.

Bhatia said the approval of bitcoin ETFs by the SEC was crucial to the state plans to be comfortable with the holdings under current U.S. securities law. ""Using ETFs is a very clean and safe way to invest in bitcoin, minimizing storage logistical risk and opting for security law protection,"" Bhatia said.

Texas state officials have described this purchase — which deployed only half of the $10 million set aside by the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve — as a ""placeholder"" while security and storage for raw bitcoin can be put into place.

Crypto's move into core state finance and budgeting

In addition to the concept of reserve funds, states are bringing crypto into core finance functions, with an approach that balances the inherent trepidation of venturing into new terrain with a desire to be a part of the fast-moving crypto realm.

New Hampshire, for example, became the first state to approve the issuance of a bitcoin-backed municipal bond last November, a $100 million issuance that would mark the first time cryptocurrency is used as collateral in the U.S. municipal bond market. The deal has not taken place yet, though plans are for the issuance to occur this year. ""The idea is they'll use bitcoin to back a municipal bond issue, the proceeds of which will then be divvied up into loans to smaller governments for economic development projects across the state,"" Marlowe said. Repayment of these loans will recapitalize the fund.

It is a creative evolution in state finances, but like many of the mechanisms for crypto development at the state level, it utilizes existing financial structures and state goals, according to Marlowe, with similar public bonds in prior decades used for projects like clean water, school upgrades, and other infrastructure. ""What's different here is it's bitcoin rather than taxpayer dollars as the collateral,"" he said.

In numerous states, including, Colorada, Utah, and Louisiana, crypto is now accepted as payment for taxes and other state business. As more state public finance crypto efforts develop, the shift represents a change in a core philosophy of safety and liquidity that has dominated the investing of state and local funds for centuries.

In recent decades, assets including real estate and private equity expanded the investment approach of public funds, but crypto represents not only the most recent addition, but the most volatile.

""For many in the state/local investing industry, crypto-backed assets are still far too speculative and volatile for public money,"" Marlowe said. ""But others, and I think there's a sort of generational shift in the works, see it as a reasonable store of value that is actually stronger on many other public sector values like transparency and asset integrity,"" he added.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108252507-1768414217350-gettyimages-1076707262-_cpr3811.jpeg?v=1768414237&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2026-01-17 11:59:31.026146

So why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?
Much of the global auto market is electrifying, an ideal opportunity for advanced Chinese automakers to capitalize on.
Countries have attempted to regulate Chinese EVs from entering their markets for several reasons.
The Mexican auto market has welcomed Chinese EVs, with massive growth last year.","DETROIT (AP) — Chinese automakers have been making inroads around the world with growing sales of their high-tech, stylish and affordable electric vehicles. That has had competitors concerned even before Canada this week agreed to cut its tariffs on Chinese EVs in exchange for concessions on Canadian farm products.

Experts now say an easier path into Canada could be a big boost for Chinese carmakers looking to dominate the global market — particularly as their domestic market weakens. That poses a threat to other auto manufacturers, particularly American companies.

U.S. officials acknowledged that in remarks at an assembly plant for Jeep-maker Stellantis in Toledo, Ohio on Friday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Chinese Communist Party invests in its auto industry to “control this industry.”

“Why? They want to take over the auto industry. They want to take away these jobs,” Duffy said. As far as the Canadian trade deal, he added: “They will live to regret the day they partner with China and bring in their vehicles.”

Others say the shift is inevitable.

“This is telling us that Chinese automakers continue to be really popular, and are doing better and better, and not just something that’s sold in global markets that are more marginal or less important to U.S. automakers,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

What makes Chinese vehicles stand out?

Chinese-made vehicles are high-quality, stylish and inexpensive, experts say.

“It’s clear that the vehicles made by Chinese brands come at a very competitive cost, but are also technologically quite desirable,” Mazzocco said. “They tend to be connected vehicles, so they have a lot of additional software capabilities that consumers seem to like. But the price point and the competitiveness are really big selling points.”

These vehicles can cost as little as $10,000 to $20,000; in the U.S., new vehicles are running close to $50,000 on average, and EVs even more so.

Chinese companies also have unique advantages as far as auto manufacturing and production, efficiency and making vehicles lighter, which helps extend an electrified vehicle's driving range.

“They’ve found a way to make small and mid-sized cars — cars that people want — at a reasonable price,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. ""These are the segments where GM and Ford and almost everybody else have abandoned.”

Many automakers have discontinued smaller vehicles in favor of higher-margin, large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that are far more profitable.

So why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?

Much of the global auto market is electrifying, an ideal opportunity for advanced Chinese automakers to capitalize on. China saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles in 2025, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week, and Europe saw a 33% increase.

Meanwhile, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year. As the rest of the world advances, U.S. automakers have weakened their once-ambitious, multibillion dollar electrification plans, instead opting for more efficient hybrid electric and gasoline vehicles amid the Trump administration's shift away from EV-friendly policy.

That shift threatens U.S. automakers’ competitive edge in the coming years. As is, Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker last year, delivering only 1.64 million vehicles in 2025 to Chinese rival BYD’s 2.26 million.

Trump administration policy slashing emissions rules at a time when Chinese companies are advancing quickly has experts worried for the future of American car manufacturers.

Chinese automakers will have to meet standards required for the Canadian auto market for the latest trade arrangement to be successful — standards that are similar to those in the U.S. — which is likely to incentivize Chinese auto manufacturing investment in Canada.

They'll also have to establish which segment of the market they are targeting there: Higher-end vehicles, or less-expensive ones that sell at higher volumes.

Regardless, “It brings it home to what is needed to compete globally,” said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at AlixPartners. The firm predicts Chinese brands will account for 30% of the global market by 2030.

“They’ve already started in Europe. They started in South America. Now Mexico and Canada,"" Wakefield said. American carmakers ""don’t want to end up as a Brazil with your ethanol-based cars that aren’t sellable anywhere else in the world and ... like Britain or Australia that used to matter in the auto world, and no longer really matter.”

Why have others sought to regulate Chinese EV-makers’ expansion?

Countries have attempted to regulate Chinese EVs from entering their markets for several reasons.

“China has become this overwhelming machine making inexpensive vehicles. And the fear is that if you give them an inch, they’re going to take a mile,” Fiorani said. “The other issue is technology. These vehicles are data centers... and the idea that a state-owned company in China could have access to where a high portion of drivers are going gives them leverage for all kinds of outlets.”

The European Union hiked tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, though the two have been resolving that at the start of this year.

In 2024, former President Joe Biden set a 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars. Canada matched that import tax on the vehicles until this week. And even with an annual import cap, Canada cutting its tariffs this week means those companies are another step closer to U.S. soil. The Mexican auto market has welcomed Chinese EVs, with massive growth last year.

“The advance of Chinese manufacturers is inevitable. It will happen eventually. Everybody is negotiating to put up the roadblocks to figure out: What data is being processed, how much market share you’re going to allow Chinese manufacturers to have?"" Fiorani added.

""There are a lot of guardrails that have to be put up, but eventually they’re going to make their way into all Western markets.”

Environmental groups argued Friday that PJM’s data center plan favors fossil fuels.
“The primary fast-tracking of energy PJM is doing is biased towards fossil gas,” wrote Charkoudian, vice chair of the House Economic Matters Committee.
Stanek, a former Maryland utility regulator, argued that PJM has pursued multiple reforms to approve new energy projects more quickly.
But he remains concerned that Moore will focus on renewable sources, such as wind and solar, to supply that new power to the grid.","Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) found himself in a rare position Friday: Joining forces with President Donald Trump’s (R) administration on energy policy.

Moore was one of 13 governors who signed an agreement with the Trump administration, pushing for PJM Interconnection, the operator of the nation’s largest electric grid, to bring $15 billion worth of new power online — with data center companies paying the tab.

Moore has been a critic of PJM, arguing that its policies delayed new clean energy projects, which got stuck in a backlogged queue waiting for approval, and then electricity demand skyrocketed because of power-hungry data centers.

“I have been crystal clear: We cannot build a 21st-century economy on an energy market that blocks new supply,” Moore said in a statement Friday. “This moment calls for urgency. Maryland families and businesses must be served by a reliable grid without shouldering the cost of sky-high energy bills.”

But PJM’s Board of Directors released its own data center plan later Friday.

That plan also initiated a “backstop procurement” for new energy. But PJM merely directed its staff to study assigning the costs of new energy to the jurisdictions, who could then pass those costs to the data center companies, such as Amazon and Google.

PJM’s plan also encourages — but doesn’t mandate — “bring your own generation,” wherein data centers could choose to bring new power onto the system on an expedited basis, to defray the possibility of being asked to reduce their power demand when the grid is strained.

“This decision is about how PJM integrates large new loads in a way that preserves reliability for customers while creating a predictable, transparent path for growth,” said David Mills, PJM Board Chair and Interim President and CEO, in a statement.

“This is not a yes/no to data centers,” Mills’ statement said. “This is, ‘How can we do this while keeping the lights on and recognizing the impact on consumers at the same time?’ We look forward to implementing, along with our stakeholders, these proposals to manage the phenomenal demand growth we are experiencing.”

PJM’s plan also includes changes to the way that the grid operator forecasts energy demand. Concerns had been raised that PJM’s projections were inflated, because companies looking to build data centers could be shopping the same data center proposal in more than one jurisdiction.

According to a news release from PJM, some of the items will require approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, while others can take place immediately.

Environmental groups argued Friday that PJM’s data center plan favors fossil fuels.

The Natural Resources Defense Council said in a statement that PJM’s decision protects “everyday families from blackouts” caused by data centers, but it falls short when it comes to new power generation.

PJM has created a “fast-track process that effectively excludes clean energy projects and gives special treatment to fossil fuel power plants built for data centers, allowing them to cut ahead of low-cost clean resources that have been waiting years to connect to the grid,” wrote Claire Lang-Ree, advocate for the Sustainable FERC Project at NRDC.

Maryland Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D- Montgomery) also chimed in, adding that PJM’s decision doesn’t provide sufficient protections for ratepayers.

“The primary fast-tracking of energy PJM is doing is biased towards fossil gas,” wrote Charkoudian, vice chair of the House Economic Matters Committee. “Given that solar and batteries are the fastest, cheapest way to provide new generation, this is another example of PJM serving for-profit energy companies and not families who can’t afford their energy bill.”

A Trump spokesperson called the administration’s plan with the governors an “unprecedented bi-partisan effort urging PJM to fix the energy subtraction failures of the past, prevent price increases, and reduce the risk of blackouts.”

“Ensuring the American people have reliable and affordable electricity is one of President Trump’s top priorities, and this would deliver much-needed, long-term relief to the Mid-Atlantic region,” wrote White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers in a statement.

The governors’ proposal would also have extended a cap on PJM’s energy capacity auction, which has lowered the price charged to ratepayers from the last several auctions, during which PJM procures energy supply to feed the grid in the future.

But PJM decided to request additional feedback about the cap before making a final decision.

Meanwhile, PJM executive director Jason Stanek was in Annapolis on Friday, speaking to a panel of legislators from Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, convened by Maryland’s conservative Freedom Caucus.

Stanek, a former Maryland utility regulator, argued that PJM has pursued multiple reforms to approve new energy projects more quickly.

“Despite what you may have heard, our interconnection queue is open, and PJM has been processing the connection of new, and mostly renewable, resources to connect to the grid at record pace,” Stanek said. “We soon hope to turn around requests in a period of one to two years, or possibly sooner.”

During his remarks, Stanek said that states own part of the blame for energy supply worries — and high electric bills, citing state-level energy policies and permitting procedures. He urged the legislators in the room to look inward as they aim to reduce prices.

“We would implore all of our states in the PJM region not to retire any more [power] resources until you have a sufficient amount of resources to backfill those retirements,” Stanek said.

“We would also ask that you look at your state permitting laws on the books to determine whether or not we can actually build energy infrastructure in your states in a timely manner.”

The Republicans in attendance were insistent that Maryland has contributed to its own power woes, by passing legislation to push the state away from fossil fuels — and toward a grid fueled by solar, wind and nuclear power. By law, Maryland has until 2031 to cut its carbon emissions 60% from 2006 levels.

“Why would politicians push to force the economy onto electricity while simultaneously shutting down the very power plants needed to generate it? It’s simple. Virtue signaling, green dreams over common sense,” said Del. Mark Fisher (R-Calvert).

Senate Minority Leader Steve Hershey (R-Upper Shore) said Friday that he was initially encouraged by the PJM governors’ announcement, because he agrees that data centers should pay for new power. But he remains concerned that Moore will focus on renewable sources, such as wind and solar, to supply that new power to the grid.

“Gov. Moore needs to embrace natural gas,” Hershey said. “He hasn’t done it yet. He’s trying to talk about nuclear, because it’s clean, but nuclear is 12 or 15 years out. As we heard today in this hearing, the quickest way to get reliable energy back on grid is to open up these retired fossil fuel generation facilities.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/52232240165_3efe674540_o-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 16:58:45.673432

The president’s promise to slash power bills was, along with similar pledges to cut grocery costs and to reduce immigration to the US, a key pillar of his 2024 election triumph.
“Instead of reducing electric bills by 50%, the president’s actions have raised the cost of home energy for all Americans.
Democrats and their allies have warned Trump that his broken promise on energy bills will haunt his fellow Republicans.
“Are blue states going to adopt President Trump’s commonsense energy agenda to bring energy prices down in their states?”","Donald Trump has comprehensively failed to meet a key election promise to slash Americans’ energy bills in half within the first year of his presidency, with power prices instead surging across the US.

The average household electricity bill in the US was 6.7% more expensive in 2025 compared with the previous year, according to a Guardian analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the Department of Energy’s statistical arm. The increases meant that, on average, US households paid nearly $116 more across 2025 than they did in 2024.

The power bill increases have been extreme in many parts of the US, with residents of Washington DC experiencing the biggest increase, a 23% jump in electricity costs, followed by Indiana, with a 17% rise, and then Illinois, with a 15% increase, the EIA data shows. The midwest is the region of the US that has been hit by the steepest bill rises, which include utility costs laden on top of an underlying 4.9% average increase in the unit cost of the electricity itself.

On top of soaring electricity bills, US households have also been confronted by rising gas prices, which have jumped 5.2% on average in the past year, according to the EIA. As a result, there has been a spike in power disconnections for unpaid bills across many states – in New York the rate of disconnections rose fivefold from a year previous – with some households having to forgo other essentials in order to keep the lights on.

This all means that, with just days until the first anniversary of his inauguration, Trump has missed his self-imposed target of cutting bills in half in his first year. The president’s promise to slash power bills was, along with similar pledges to cut grocery costs and to reduce immigration to the US, a key pillar of his 2024 election triumph.

“You have some states where the power bills are instead up 10% or 20%, which is why so many people are angry about this now,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA).

“Instead of reducing electric bills by 50%, the president’s actions have raised the cost of home energy for all Americans. It used to be the poorest Americans who struggled with their power bills, but now we are seeing more and more middle-income families who have to make sacrifices to avoid being shut off. But there’s a limit to how much people are able to sacrifice, which we are very concerned about.”

During his election campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed to tackle power bills. “I will cut the price of energy and electricity in half,” he said at one rally in Detroit in October 2024. “12 months from January 20 – I take office on January 20 – your electric bill, including cars, air conditioning, heaters, everything, the total electric bill will be 50, 5-0 per cent, less.”

Trump told voters at a separate event that “your energy bill within 12 months will be cut in half. I’ll have your energy bill down within 12 months, throughout the country … That’s my pledge, all over the country.”

But this rhetoric has sharply reversed as electricity has replaced eggs as the most-talked-about area of inflation, with Trump recently claiming that the affordability crisis is a “hoax” and a “fake narrative” invented by his political enemies. On Tuesday, the president said he had overseen the “greatest first year in history” for the economy.

“The administration is tone-deaf about this – the president said it’s all made up, when it is in fact quite clear,” said Wolfe. “Families are struggling to pay energy bills and yet the Trump administration’s actions have made it worse.”

Angie Shaneyfelt, a 52-year-old resident of Baltimore, Maryland, has seen her bill shoot up rapidly this year, from less than $300 in December 2024 to $400 last month. In an effort to keep up with the increases, Shaneyfelt has considered taking up a second job, even signing up to deliver food with DoorDash last month.

More work hours would give her even less time with her twin 13-year-old daughters, but with another gas and electric rate hike planned for next month, she may be forced to bring in more income. “I’ve already slimmed back so much stuff,” she said. “And now I have to give up my time with my family?”

Trump pushes oil and gas – and AI

The administration’s energy policy has centered on ramping up the drilling of oil and gas – already at record levels in the US – while tearing up environmental rules that delay projects and limit the amount of pollution Americans are exposed to.

Trump has also embarked upon the aggressive promotion of an artificial intelligence industry that is raising US electricity demand for the first time in decades, while at the same time blocking numerous renewable energy projects he calls a “scam” and a “con job” but were set to provide electricity for millions of American homes.

This agenda – coupled with administration edicts to reverse the closure of ageing coal plants and to restart the overseas export of liquified natural gas, both actions that can raise costs for domestic consumers – has ensured that Trump’s election promise to cut bills had little chance of being met, experts say.

“The fundamental dynamic is that we are using more electricity than we did 12 months ago and the infrastructure isn’t keeping pace with that extra demand – if anything, we have fallen further behind,” said Abe Silverman, an expert in the energy transition at Johns Hopkins University.

The cost of Americans’ power bills largely matched overall inflation until around 2020, when they started to diverge, driven by a constellation of regionally varying factors such as utility upgrades of transmission lines, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and disruption from extreme weather events worsened by the climate crisis.

The rapid advance of AI has accelerated this trend, Silverman said, only for the administration to block available clean-energy projects, particularly offshore wind, from meeting soaring demand. In December, Trump halted construction of five windfarms off the east coast, a move that has been challenged in the courts. “We have not approved one windmill since I’ve been in office, and we’re going to keep it that way,” Trump said this month.

“If you think of it as a race, the demand-growth horse has got a shot of adrenaline and is galloping around the track at a faster pace,” Silverman said. “The supply horse is losing, by a lot. Unfortunately with the ideologically driven attack on certain technologies, such as wind and solar, it’s made it very difficult for investment to proceed and get the extra electrons we desperately need.”

As stress grows over bills, help is being cut

Electricity bills are now a “major” source of stress for more than a third of all Americans, polling has found, with colder-than-expected temperatures this winter pushing up heating bills by 9.2% on average compared with a year ago. The average household will pay $995 on heating this winter, an increase of $84 from last winter, as families struggle with electricity prices that are the highest in a decade, according to the NEADA.

As more Americans face higher bills, the Trump administration has slashed federal assistance, eliminating tax credits for home energy efficiency upgrades and attempting to scrap a federal program that helps low-income people with their energy bills, a move that would affect more than 6m households that rely on this support for heating and cooling.

Trump’s promise to bring down gasoline costs has seen more success, with retail prices at the gas pump falling by 6% on average in the last year. This decrease, the third year in a row in which gasoline prices have dropped, is due to a global glut of crude oil and a fall in demand due to concerns over an economic downturn, according to the EIA. Trump has claimed that the US seizing control of Venezuela’s oilfields will help drive down the cost of gasoline for American drivers.

Perhaps cognizant of a growing political backlash to persistently high power bills, Trump said this week he is pressing tech companies to foot the bill for the rising costs associated with their datacenters. “We are the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and Number One in AI,” the president posted on Truth Social. “Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way.’”

The overall cost of living is likely to remain a salient topic for voters this year, though, before the midterm elections in November that will determine the balance of power in Congress. Democrats and their allies have warned Trump that his broken promise on energy bills will haunt his fellow Republicans.

“Trump and Republicans are making life more expensive by taking energy options off the grid while demand skyrockets,” said Jesse Lee, senior adviser to Climate Power, a climate advocacy group. “We’re going to make sure that every Republican who rubber-stamps Trump’s anti-energy agenda pays the political price in 2026.”

A White House spokesperson said that lowering energy prices is a “top priority” for the president and said that Democratic-run states have seen higher costs than Republican-led states.

“The Trump administration will continue to aggressively implement President Trump’s energy dominance agenda because cheaper energy can unleash unprecedented growth in every facet of our economy,” she said.

Currently, Maryland imports about 40% of its energy from other states, and Republicans have long-criticized the state's current focus toward clean energy.

Officials with PJM, the regional grid operator, also spoke at the hearing, saying in order to have meaningful relief for ratepayers, the supply and demand needs to balance out. Since the demand is unlikely to decrease, due to data centers and other forms of electrification, supply needs to increase.

""State governments are ultimately responsible for resource adequacy,"" Jason Stanek, the Executive Director for Governmental Services with PJM, said.

While many Democrats have been advocates of renewable and clean energy sources like solar and wind, despite differences among the parties, even at the start of session there is already some middle ground.

While Senate President Bill Ferguson said while he is a strong believer of renewable energy sources, he acknowledged that reliability can be a problem with them. He said other sources of energy are also needed, which include natural gas in some capacity.

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle also support nuclear energy, but acknowledge that is a long-term solution since it can take years to get those projects connected to the grid.

This comes as Gov. Wes Moore joined a coalition of governors at the White House to sign a Statement of Principles, calling for urgent reforms related to PJM. The agreement, outlines a strategy to incentivize new power generation, protect residential customers from price increases, and ensure that data centers pay for the generation investments they drive.

“I have been crystal clear: We cannot build a 21st-century economy on an energy market that blocks new supply,” Gov. Moore said. “This moment calls for urgency. Maryland families and businesses must be served by a reliable grid without shouldering the cost of sky-high energy bills.”

The time it takes to get a US gas plant into service is increasing, with average lead times growing from 3.5 years to 5 years between 2023 and 2025, according to BloombergNEF. The cost of building a combined-cycle gas plant, the more efficient type, grew about 49% over the same time frame.

“The key limits are the turbine market and the people who actually build these things,” said Evercore analyst Nicholas Amicucci. “Siting and permitting are a mess.”

The massive jump in power consumption from data centers, new factories and the overall electrification of the economy has led to an accompanying spike in the demand for the turbines that produce electricity by burning natural gas. That’s led to a rush among tech firms, utilities and developers all competing to secure a limited number of gas turbines. Turbine manufacturer GE Vernova has said it’s sold out through 2028 and is now taking orders for 2029.

And it’s looking to friends in Congress to put the Golden State in its place.

California has not figured out how to reduce single-use plastic. But its efforts to do so have created a headache for the fossil fuel industry and plastic manufacturers. The two businesses are linked since most plastic is derived from oil or natural gas.

In December, a Republican congressman from Texas introduced a bill designed to preempt states — in particular, California — from imposing their own truth-in-labeling or recycling laws. The bill, called the Packaging and Claims Knowledge Act, calls for a national standard for environmental claims on packaging that companies would voluntarily adhere to.

“California’s policies have slowed American commerce long enough,” Rep. Randy Weber (R-Texas) said in a post on the social media platform X announcing the bill. “Not anymore.”

The legislation was written for American consumers, Weber said in a press release. Its purpose is to reduce a patchwork of state recycling and composting laws that only confuse people, he said, and make it hard for them to know which products are recyclable, compostable or destined for the landfill.

But it’s clear that California’s laws — such as Senate Bill 343, which requires that packaging meet certain recycling milestones in order to carry the chasing arrows recycling label — are the ones he and the industry have in mind.

“Packaging and labeling standards in the United States are increasingly influenced by state-level regulations, particularly those adopted in California,” Weber said in a statement. “Because of the size of California’s market, standards set by the state can have national implications for manufacturers, supply chains and consumers, even when companies operate primarily outside of California.”

It’s a departure from Weber’s usual stance on states’ rights, which he has supported in the past on topics such as marriage laws, abortion, border security and voting.

“We need to remember that the 13 Colonies and the 13 states created the federal government,” he said on Fox News in 2024, in an interview about the border. “The federal government did not create the states. ... All rights go to the people in the state, the states and the people respectively.”

During the 2023-2024 campaign cycle, the oil and gas industry was Weber’s largest contributor, with more than $130,000 from companies such as Philips 66, the American Chemistry Council, Koch Inc. and Valero, according to OpenSecrets.org.

Weber did not respond to a request for comment. The bill has been referred to the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

Plastic and packaging companies and trade organizations such as Ameripen, Keurig, Dr Pepper, the Biodegradable Plastics Industry and the Plastics Industry Assn. have come out in support of the bill.

Other companies and trade groups that manufacture plastics that are banned in California — such as Dart, which produces polystyrene, and plastic bag manufacturers such as Amcor — support the bill. So do some who could potentially lose their recycling label because they’re not meeting California’s requirements. They include the Carton Council, which represents companies that make milk and other beverage containers.

“Plastic packaging is essential to modern life ... yet companies and consumers are currently navigating a complex landscape of rules around recyclable, compostable, and reusable packaging claims,” Matt Seaholm, chief executive of the Plastics Industry Assn., said in a statement. The bill “would establish a clear national framework under the FTC, reducing uncertainty and supporting businesses operating across state lines.”

The law, if enacted, would require the Federal Trade Commission to work with third-party certifiers to determine the recyclability, compostability or reusability of a product or packaging material, and make the designation consistent across the country.

The law applies to all kinds of packaging, not just plastic.

Lauren Zuber, a spokeswoman for Ameripen — a packaging trade association — said in an email that the law doesn’t necessarily target California, but the Golden State has “created problematic labeling requirements” that “threaten to curtail recycling instead of encouraging it by confusing consumers.”

Ameripen helped draft the legislation.

Advocates focused on reducing waste say the bill is a free pass for the plastic industry to continue pushing plastic into the marketplace without considering where it ends up. They say the bill would gut consumer trust and make it harder for people to know whether the products they are dealing with are truly recyclable, compostable or reusable.

“California’s truth-in-advertising laws exist for a simple reason: People should be able to trust what companies tell them,” said Nick Lapis, director of advocacy for Californians Against Waste. “It’s not surprising that manufacturers of unrecyclable plastic want to weaken those rules, but it’s pretty astonishing that some members of Congress think their constituents want to be misled.”

If the bill were adopted, it would “punish the companies that have done the right thing by investing in real solutions.”

“At the end of the day, a product isn’t recyclable if it doesn’t get recycled, and it isn’t compostable if it doesn’t get composted. Deception is never in the public interest,” he said.

On Friday, California’s Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta announced settlements totaling $3.35 million with three major plastic bag producers for violating state law regarding deceptive marketing of non-recyclable bags. The settlement follows a similar one in October with five other plastic bag manufacturers.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6e12659/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3528+0+476/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F58%2F90%2F2f08e9fa4e13946196883e1abd11%2F1192415-me-plastics-project-wilmington-recycling-plant-05-cmc.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 11:00:29.443977

The Details: Media outlets took different approaches in their coverage of the new air pollution policy changes, ranging from warnings of a major shift to pushback from officials who say the reporting mischaracterized the agency's plans. The New York Times (Lean Left bias) reported that the EPA may stop counting many health gains from reducing fine particulate matter and ozone, citing internal documents reviewed by the Times. But the EPA said it will continue considering health impacts when setting pollution limits.

Key Quotes: EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin denied the claims by the Times, saying on social media platform X that the story is ""another dishonest, fake news claim courtesy of the New York Times."" Charlie Stadtlander, a spokesperson for the Times, said in a statement: ""Our reporting on internal EPA documents found that the agency is no longer calculating the health benefits of reducing fine particulate matter and ozone pollution when writing clean-air regulations.""

For Context: Although levels of particle pollution and ground‑level ozone are lower than in past decades, many areas still experience unhealthy levels, according to the EPA. These pollutants come from cars, power plants, industrial facilities, and wildfires, and they can travel long distances across state lines. Fine particles and ozone are linked to asthma attacks, heart and lung problems, and premature death.

How The Media Covered It: Fox News (Right bias) centered its report on EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who denounced The New York Times for ""claiming in a headline that the agency"" won't consider the impact of air pollution on human health. The outlet also highlighted claims that Zeldin has pushed efforts to repeal environmental policies enacted under the Biden and Obama administrations.

That sun has provided him cheap power for 25 years, and this month he installed his fourth iteration of solar panels on his Vermont home. In an interview after he set up the new system, he said President Donald Trump's stance against solar and other cheap green energy will hurt the GOP in this year's elections as electricity bills rise.

After the Biden and Obama administrations subsidized and championed solar, wind and other green power as answers to fight climate change, Trump has tried to dampen those and turn to older and dirtier fossil fuels. The Trump administration froze five big offshore wind projects last month but judges this week allowed three of the projects to resume. Federal clean energy tax incentives expired on Dec. 31 that include installing home solar panels.

Meanwhile, electricity prices are rising in the United States, and McKibben is counting on that to trigger political change.

“I think you’re starting to see that have a big political impact in the U.S. right now. My prediction would be that electric prices are going to be to the 2026 election what egg prices were to the 2024 election,” said McKibben, an author and founder of multiple environmental and activist groups. Everyday inflation hurt Democrats in the last presidential race, analysts said.

The Trump administration and a bipartisan group of governors on Friday tried to step up pressure on the operator of the nation’s largest electric grid to take urgent steps to boost power supplies in the mid-Atlantic and keep electricity bills from rising even higher.

“Ensuring the American people have reliable and affordable electricity is one of President Trump’s top priorities,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.

Renewable energy prices drop around the world

Globally, the price of wind and solar power is plummeting to the point that they are cheaper than fossil fuels, the United Nations found. And China leads the world in renewable energy technology, with one of its electric car companies passing Tesla in annual sales.

""We can’t economically compete in a world where China gets a lot of cheap energy and we have to pay for really expensive energy,"" McKibben told The Associated Press, just after he installed a new type of solar panels that can hang on balconies with little fuss.

When Trump took office in January 2025, the national average electricity cost was 15.94 cents per kilowatt-hour. By September it was up to 18.07 cents and then down slightly to 17.98 cents in October, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

That's a 12.8% increase in 10 months. It rose more in 10 months than the previous two years. People in Maryland, New Jersey and Maine have seen electricity prices rise at a rate three times higher than the national average since October 2024.

At 900 kilowatt-hours per month, that means the average monthly electricity bill is about $18 more than in January 2025.

Democrats blame Trump for rising electric bills

This week, Democrats on Capitol Hill blamed rising electric bills on Trump and his dislike of renewable energy.

“From his first day in office, he’s made it his mission to limit American’s access to cheap energy, all in the name of increasing profits for his friends in the fossil fuel industry. As a result, energy bills across the country have skyrocketed,"" Illinois Rep. Sean Casten said at a Wednesday news conference.

“Donald Trump is the first president to intentionally raise the price of something that we all need,” Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, also a Democrat, said Wednesday on the Senate floor. “Nobody should be enthused about paying more for electricity, and this national solar ban is making everybody pay more. Clean is cheap and cheap is clean.”

Solar panels on McKibben's Vermont home

McKibben has been sending excess electricity from his solar panels to the Vermont grid for years. Now he's sending more.

As his dog, Birke, stood watch, McKibben, who refers to his home nestled in the Green Mountains of Vermont as a “museum of solar technology"" got his new panels up and running in about 10 minutes. This type of panel from the California-based firm Bright Saver is often referred to as plug-in solar. Though it's not yet widely available in the U.S., McKibben pointed to the style's popularity in Europe and Australia.

“Americans spend three or four times as much money as Australians or Europeans to put solar panels on the roof. We have an absurdly overcomplicated permitting system that’s unlike anything else on the rest of the planet,"" McKibben said.

McKibben said Australians can obtain three hours of free electricity each day through a government program because the country has built so many solar panels.

“And I’m almost certain that that’s an argument that every single person in America would understand,"" he said. ""I don’t know anyone who wouldn’t say: ‘I’d like three free hours of electricity.’”

Dominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first.
“The men and women of NABTU are proud to be constructing every offshore wind project in the United States, all under strong project labor agreements.
Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind has been under construction since early 2024.
It will consist of 176 offshore wind energy turbines providing enough electricity to power about 660,000 homes.","A federal judge ruled Friday that work on a Virginia offshore wind project could resume, the third project this week to successfully challenge the Trump administration in court.

The administration announced last month it was suspending leases for at least 90 days on five East Coast offshore wind projects because of national security concerns. Its announcement did not reveal specifics about those concerns.

Developers and states sued in an effort to block the order. Dominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first.

In federal court in Virginia on Friday, a judge said he was granting the Richmond-based company’s request for a preliminary injunction, according to the record from the hearing. This allows construction to resume while Dominion Energy’s lawsuit challenging the government’s order proceeds.

In federal court for the District of Columbia, judges ruled this week that construction could also resume on the Empire Wind project for New York by Norwegian company Equinor, and the Revolution Wind project for Rhode Island and Connecticut, by Danish company Orsted.

President Donald Trump has targeted offshore wind from his first days back in the White House. White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said this week that Trump has been clear that “wind energy is the scam of the century.” Rogers said the pause is meant to protect the national security of the American people, and “we look forward to ultimate victory on the issue.”

Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond Law School professor who has been following the lawsuits, said the three judges essentially concluded that the government did not show that the national security risk is so imminent that construction must halt.

“They concluded that Trump’s effort to halt the important, but costly, projects lacked support and would injure the entities building them, so the projects must be permitted to proceed,” Tobias said.

Sean McGarvey, president of North America’s Building Trades Unions, applauded this week’s federal court rulings, which enable union workers to return to the job sites.

“With energy demand surging and prices spiking, the last thing our government should do is take any form of power generation offline,” McGarvey said in a statement. “The men and women of NABTU are proud to be constructing every offshore wind project in the United States, all under strong project labor agreements. These rulings mean our members can get back to work and keep affordable, clean, reliable power moving to our communities.”

Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of plans to shift to renewable energy in East Coast states that have limited land for onshore wind turbines or solar arrays. Orsted is also suing over the pause of its Sunrise Wind project for New York.

The fifth paused project is Vineyard Wind, under construction in Massachusetts. Vineyard Wind LLC, a joint venture between Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, joined the rest of the developers in challenging the administration on Thursday. They filed a complaint in District Court in Boston.

Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind has been under construction since early 2024. It will consist of 176 offshore wind energy turbines providing enough electricity to power about 660,000 homes.

Dominion Energy argued that the government’s order is “arbitrary and capricious” and unconstitutional. It said after the hearing that it will now focus on restarting work to ensure the project can begin delivering critical energy in just weeks. It says the project is essential to meet dramatically growing energy needs driven by dozens of new data centers.

Virginia’s U.S. senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, along with U.S. Reps. Bobby Scott and Jennifer McClellan, said in a joint statement that the ruling is a victory for the state’s residents, who otherwise “would face increased energy costs as a result of the Trump administration’s shortsighted opposition to clean energy.”

Trump has dismissed offshore wind developments as ugly, but the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is about 27 miles (43 kilometers) off the shores of Virginia Beach.

Meanwhile, electricity prices are rising in the United States, and McKibben is counting on that to trigger political change.

“I think you’re starting to see that have a big political impact in the U.S. right now. My prediction would be that electric prices are going to be to the 2026 election what egg prices were to the 2024 election,” said McKibben, an author and founder of multiple environmental and activist groups. Everyday inflation hurt Democrats in the last presidential race, analysts said.

The Trump administration and a bipartisan group of governors on Friday tried to step up pressure on the operator of the nation’s largest electric grid to take urgent steps to boost power supplies in the mid-Atlantic and keep electricity bills from rising even higher.

“Ensuring the American people have reliable and affordable electricity is one of President Trump’s top priorities,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.

Renewable energy prices drop around the world

Globally, the price of wind and solar power is plummeting to the point that they are cheaper than fossil fuels, the United Nations found. And China leads the world in renewable energy technology, with one of its electric car companies passing Tesla in annual sales.

“We can’t economically compete in a world where China gets a lot of cheap energy and we have to pay for really expensive energy,” McKibben told The Associated Press, just after he installed a new type of solar panels that can hang on balconies with little fuss.

When Trump took office in January 2025, the national average electricity cost was 15.94 cents per kilowatt-hour. By September it was up to 18.07 cents and then down slightly to 17.98 cents in October, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

That’s a 12.8% increase in 10 months. It rose more in 10 months than the previous two years. People in Maryland, New Jersey and Maine have seen electricity prices rise at a rate three times higher than the national average since October 2024.

At 900 kilowatt-hours per month, that means the average monthly electricity bill is about $18 more than in January 2025.

Democrats blame Trump for rising electric bills

This week, Democrats on Capitol Hill blamed rising electric bills on Trump and his dislike of renewable energy.

“From his first day in office, he’s made it his mission to limit American’s access to cheap energy, all in the name of increasing profits for his friends in the fossil fuel industry. As a result, energy bills across the country have skyrocketed,” Illinois Rep. Sean Casten said at a Wednesday news conference.

“Donald Trump is the first president to intentionally raise the price of something that we all need,” Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, also a Democrat, said Wednesday on the Senate floor. “Nobody should be enthused about paying more for electricity, and this national solar ban is making everybody pay more. Clean is cheap and cheap is clean.”

Solar panels on McKibben’s Vermont home

McKibben has been sending excess electricity from his solar panels to the Vermont grid for years. Now he’s sending more.

As his dog, Birke, stood watch, McKibben, who refers to his home nestled in the Green Mountains of Vermont as a “museum of solar technology” got his new panels up and running in about 10 minutes. This type of panel from the California-based firm Bright Saver is often referred to as plug-in solar. Though it’s not yet widely available in the U.S., McKibben pointed to the style’s popularity in Europe and Australia.

“Americans spend three or four times as much money as Australians or Europeans to put solar panels on the roof. We have an absurdly overcomplicated permitting system that’s unlike anything else on the rest of the planet,” McKibben said.

McKibben said Australians can obtain three hours of free electricity each day through a government program because the country has built so many solar panels.

“And I’m almost certain that that’s an argument that every single person in America would understand,” he said. “I don’t know anyone who wouldn’t say: ‘I’d like three free hours of electricity.’”

The exponential growth of electric vehicle adoption worldwide has created an unprecedented challenge for governments seeking to maintain control over critical mineral supply chains. As battery technologies mature and reach end-of-life cycles, nations must navigate complex trade-offs between environmental protection, strategic resource security, and industrial competitiveness. China's approach to this challenge represents a fundamental shift toward centralised material flow control that extends far beyond traditional environmental regulations, particularly as china mandates ev batteries remain with vehicles.

The Chinese regulatory framework encompasses comprehensive lifecycle management systems designed to capture maximum value from degraded battery materials whilst preventing uncontrolled disposal channels. This strategic approach addresses multiple objectives simultaneously: environmental protection through standardised processing, material security through domestic retention, and competitive positioning through secondary material market development.

Critical Threshold Analysis:

Waste Volume Year Projected Tonnes Growth Rate 2020 200,000 Baseline 2025 780,000 290% increase 2030 1,000,000+ 400% total growth

The regulatory implementation timeline reflects careful coordination between waste volume projections and infrastructure development. By establishing mandatory compliance before peak waste volumes materialise, Chinese authorities create processing capacity advantages over reactive regulatory approaches adopted elsewhere.

Comprehensive Lifecycle Management Implementation

The April 1, 2026 implementation date represents simultaneous activation of three interconnected regulatory mechanisms that fundamentally alter how electric vehicles reach end-of-life in the Chinese market. This coordination prevents regulatory gaps that could allow battery diversion during transition periods.

Mandatory Battery Retention Protocols:

Electric vehicles must retain power batteries throughout the scrapping process

Recycling facilities cannot separate batteries before official vehicle classification

Incomplete vehicle designation applies to any EV processed without its original battery

Real-time tracking prevents battery transfer to uncontrolled channels

The national information platform establishes unprecedented visibility into battery lifecycle progression from manufacturing through final disposal. According to state-run Xinhua News Agency reporting from January 16, 2026, this system addresses the increasing volume of discarded power batteries as EV models from previous years enter capacity degradation phases.

Manufacturer Responsibility Scope:

Battery manufacturers face expanded obligations covering both domestically-produced and imported batteries destined for Chinese market use. The framework excludes only batteries sold directly to vehicle manufacturers, ensuring comprehensive coverage of replacement and aftermarket segments.

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology regulations specify that manufacturers cannot refuse battery transfers from swap operators, leasing services, or repair enterprises. This mandatory acceptance requirement prevents processing bottlenecks whilst ensuring accountability across diverse business models.

Classification System Impact:

The incomplete vehicle designation creates powerful incentives for proper battery disposal. Vehicles lacking power batteries during scrapping face regulatory complications that encourage integrated processing rather than component separation. This mechanism maintains traceability whilst simplifying enforcement procedures.

Strategic Resource Recovery Objectives

China's battery lifecycle management framework addresses critical material security vulnerabilities through systematic recovery of lithium, cobalt, nickel, and rare earth elements from degraded cells. The timing of implementation coincides with the first major wave of battery retirements from vehicles purchased during China's early EV adoption phase between 2016-2019.

Material Volume Projections:

By 2030, waste battery volumes exceeding 1 million tonnes annually will contain substantial recoverable material quantities. Based on typical battery compositions, this represents approximately:

50,000-80,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent

15,000-25,000 tonnes of cobalt content

40,000-70,000 tonnes of nickel materials

Various rare earth elements depending on cathode chemistry mix

These projections assume continued dominance of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries in the Chinese market. Furthermore, the Chinese battery recycling breakthrough indicates significant technological advancement in increasing penetration of nickel-based chemistries in premium vehicle segments.

Secondary Material Market Positioning:

The regulatory framework positions Chinese processors as gatekeepers for secondary material exports by restricting waste battery material outflows. This creates pricing leverage in international markets whilst ensuring domestic supply chain access to recovered materials.

Strategic Advantage Alert: Domestic material retention reduces Chinese dependence on primary material imports whilst creating competitive pressure on international suppliers through secondary material availability.

The concentrated processing model enables quality standardisation for recycled materials, potentially achieving specification parity with primary extracted materials. This technological advancement transforms waste streams into strategic assets rather than disposal liabilities.

Battery Technology Differentiated Regulatory Impact

Different battery chemistries face varying regulatory compliance challenges and economic outcomes under the new framework. The Chinese EV market's dominance by lithium iron phosphate technology creates high-volume processing requirements with distinct characteristics from nickel-based alternatives.

Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) Battery Considerations

LFP batteries represent the highest volume segment in Chinese waste streams due to their market penetration across domestic vehicle manufacturers. These batteries present simplified processing profiles due to reduced toxic material content, enabling streamlined regulatory compliance.

Lower material recovery value per unit compared to nickel-based chemistries

Simplified pyrometallurgical processing requirements

High volume throughput potential for certified recycling facilities

Reduced hazardous material handling protocols

The economic viability of LFP recycling depends on processing scale rather than per-unit material value. Consequently, this creates advantages for high-capacity centralised facilities over distributed processing networks.

Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese (NCM) Battery Challenges

NCM batteries offer significantly higher material recovery value per unit but require specialised processing infrastructure due to hazardous electrolyte content and complex separation requirements.

High-value cobalt and nickel recovery potential

Complex hydrometallurgical processing requirements

Specialised equipment needs for safe electrolyte handling

Premium processing facility certification requirements

The regulatory framework's applicability to all non-swappable vehicles ensures comprehensive coverage regardless of battery chemistry. However, this prevents regulatory arbitrage between different technology platforms.

Capacity Degradation Thresholds

Batteries reaching 80% capacity retention trigger end-of-life classification under the regulatory framework. This standardised threshold applies across all battery technologies, simplifying regulatory administration whilst ensuring consistent processing timing.

Battery Swap Exemption Market Dynamics

The regulatory exemption for battery-swappable vehicles creates a bifurcated compliance landscape with significant competitive implications for different business models operating in the Chinese EV market.

Exemption Scope and Timeline:

According to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology statement from January 16, 2026, battery-swappable vehicle models are explicitly excluded from the April 1, 2026 mandate. Management measures for such vehicles remain under development with no specified implementation timeline.

Competitive Advantage Analysis:

Companies operating established battery-swap networks, including NIO with its extensive infrastructure deployment, retain operational flexibility in battery lifecycle management timing. This exemption provides several strategic advantages:

Delayed compliance infrastructure development costs

Flexible recycling timing optimisation based on business models

Potential battery lifecycle extension through continued operational use

Regulatory uncertainty that may deter new entrants to swap-compatible segments

Market Distortion Mechanisms:

The exemption creates unequal competitive conditions between traditional EV manufacturers and swap-enabled platforms:

Vehicle Type Compliance Date Infrastructure Requirements Non-swappable EVs April 1, 2026 Mandatory recycling partnerships Swappable EVs TBD Provisional regulatory status Hybrid models April 1, 2026 Full compliance if non-swappable

This regulatory asymmetry potentially influences vehicle platform development decisions as manufacturers evaluate compliance costs against market access benefits. The absence of finalised swap vehicle management measures creates strategic planning uncertainty for this segment.

International Supply Chain Transformation

The Chinese regulatory framework establishes domestic processing as a prerequisite for market access. This fundamentally alters operational requirements for international battery manufacturers and creates potential trade friction with battery-exporting nations.

Foreign Manufacturer Compliance Obligations:

International battery suppliers face mandatory domestic recycling infrastructure establishment or exclusive partnership requirements for continued Chinese market participation. This affects major suppliers including:

Emerging battery manufacturers seeking market entry

Capital Requirements Analysis:

Foreign manufacturers must establish either direct ownership of certified Chinese recycling facilities or exclusive partnerships with domestic processors. This creates substantial capital allocation decisions:

Investment Requirement: Foreign battery manufacturers selling into China must establish domestic recycling infrastructure or partner with certified processors to maintain market access beyond April 1, 2026.

The infrastructure requirement represents a significant market access barrier that may influence supplier consolidation and strategic partnership formation across the industry. Additionally, developments in battery-grade lithium refinery projects globally indicate increasing competition for processing capabilities.

Cross-Border Material Flow Restrictions:

The framework restricts waste battery material exports whilst enhancing tracking of imported battery components, creating controlled material circulation within Chinese borders:

Waste battery material export limitations prevent international competitor access to secondary materials

Enhanced import tracking systems monitor battery component origins

Domestic processing requirements ensure material retention within Chinese supply chains

Potential pricing leverage development for Chinese secondary material processors

“Americans spend three or four times as much money as Australians or Europeans to put solar panels on the roof.","RIPTON, Vermont (AP) — At a time when the Trump administration rolled back numerous environmental regulations while global temperatures and U.S. carbon pollution spiked, longtime climate activist Bill McKibben finds hope in something that didn’t seem that strong on a recent single-digit-temperature day: the sun.

That sun has provided him cheap power for 25 years, and this month he installed his fourth iteration of solar panels on his Vermont home. In an interview after he set up the new system, he said President Donald Trump’s stance against solar and other cheap green energy will hurt the GOP in this year’s elections as electricity bills rise.

After the Biden and Obama administrations subsidized and championed solar, wind and other green power as answers to fight climate change, Trump has tried to dampen those and turn to older and dirtier fossil fuels. The Trump administration froze five big offshore wind projects last month but judges this week allowed three of the projects to resume. Federal clean energy tax incentives expired on Dec. 31 that include installing home solar panels.

Meanwhile, electricity prices are rising in the United States, and McKibben is counting on that to trigger political change.

“I think you’re starting to see that have a big political impact in the U.S. right now. My prediction would be that electric prices are going to be to the 2026 election what egg prices were to the 2024 election,” said McKibben, an author and founder of multiple environmental and activist groups. Everyday inflation hurt Democrats in the last presidential race, analysts said.

The Trump administration and a bipartisan group of governors on Friday tried to step up pressure on the operator of the nation’s largest electric grid to take urgent steps to boost power supplies in the mid-Atlantic and keep electricity bills from rising even higher.

“Ensuring the American people have reliable and affordable electricity is one of President Trump’s top priorities,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.

Renewable energy prices drop around the world

Globally, the price of wind and solar power is plummeting to the point that they are cheaper than fossil fuels, the United Nations found. And China leads the world in renewable energy technology, with one of its electric car companies passing Tesla in annual sales.

“We can’t economically compete in a world where China gets a lot of cheap energy and we have to pay for really expensive energy,” McKibben told The Associated Press, just after he installed a new type of solar panels that can hang on balconies with little fuss.

When Trump took office in January 2025, the national average electricity cost was 15.94 cents per kilowatt-hour. By September it was up to 18.07 cents and then down slightly to 17.98 cents in October, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

That’s a 12.8% increase in 10 months. It rose more in 10 months than the previous two years. People in Maryland, New Jersey and Maine have seen electricity prices rise at a rate three times higher than the national average since October 2024.

At 900 kilowatt-hours per month, that means the average monthly electricity bill is about $18 more than in January 2025.

Democrats blame Trump for rising electric bills

This week, Democrats on Capitol Hill blamed rising electric bills on Trump and his dislike of renewable energy.

“From his first day in office, he’s made it his mission to limit American’s access to cheap energy, all in the name of increasing profits for his friends in the fossil fuel industry. As a result, energy bills across the country have skyrocketed,” Illinois Rep. Sean Casten said at a Wednesday news conference.

“Donald Trump is the first president to intentionally raise the price of something that we all need,” Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, also a Democrat, said Wednesday on the Senate floor. “Nobody should be enthused about paying more for electricity, and this national solar ban is making everybody pay more. Clean is cheap and cheap is clean.”

Solar panels on McKibben’s Vermont home

McKibben has been sending excess electricity from his solar panels to the Vermont grid for years. Now he’s sending more.

As his dog, Birke, stood watch, McKibben, who refers to his home nestled in the Green Mountains of Vermont as a “museum of solar technology” got his new panels up and running in about 10 minutes. This type of panel from the California-based firm Bright Saver is often referred to as plug-in solar. Though it’s not yet widely available in the U.S., McKibben pointed to the style’s popularity in Europe and Australia.

“Americans spend three or four times as much money as Australians or Europeans to put solar panels on the roof. We have an absurdly overcomplicated permitting system that’s unlike anything else on the rest of the planet,” McKibben said.

McKibben said Australians can obtain three hours of free electricity each day through a government program because the country has built so many solar panels.

“And I’m almost certain that that’s an argument that every single person in America would understand,” he said. “I don’t know anyone who wouldn’t say: ‘I’d like three free hours of electricity.’”

By Eric Starkman

China’s electric vehicle industry could not ask for a more authentic or credible pitchman than Ford CEO Jim Farley. While Farley has shown he is no wizard when it comes to automotive manufacturing, his connection to the product is undeniable. When he is not quietly volunteering at the Detroit homeless shelter he supports, Farley races his own classic cars and remains deeply involved in Ford’s racing programs.

In 2024, Farley disclosed that he had been driving a China-made Xiaomi SU7 sports car for six months and that he did not want to give it back. He also said he had traveled to China multiple times and was jolted by what he witnessed.

“It’s the most humbling thing I have ever seen,” Farley said. “They have far superior in-vehicle technology. Huawei and Xiaomi are in every car. You get in, you don’t have to pair your phone. Your whole digital life is mirrored in the car. The cost, the quality of their vehicles are far superior to what I see in the West.”

Farley was not issuing a warning. He was offering a confession.

Carney opens the gate

Imagine tens of thousands of Canadians making that discovery firsthand and you begin to grasp the significance of Prime Minister Mark Carney’s decision to slash tariffs and allow up to 49,000 Chinese-built electric and hybrid vehicles per year into Canada at a 6.1 percent duty. That rate mirrors the standard tariff Canada applied before it aligned with the United States and imposed a 100 percent surtax that effectively sealed the North American market, protecting domestic automakers, most notably GM and Ford, even as both have steadily reduced their unionized manufacturing footprint in Canada.

Canadian unions remain far more powerful than their American counterparts, which helps explain why Carney’s China deal lands as much as a political signal as an economic one.

“We are opening the floodgates,” warned Lana Payne, national president of Unifor, which represents Canadian autoworkers. “For the folks who think this is great because they’re going to get a few cheap cars, cheap has a price — and the price is good jobs in the auto sector in Canada and good jobs that support communities and an industrial base.”

Payne pointed to Chinese state subsidies as evidence of unfair competition, a claim that rings hollow only if one forgets the billions of dollars Canadian taxpayers have already poured into GM and other foreign automakers to preserve jobs and attract EV investment. Unifor itself was instrumental in securing those subsidies.

“It’s not fair play,” Payne said, noting how Chinese automakers have expanded their market share in Europe and Brazil.

Whatever else Carney’s trade agreement may be, it can fairly be read as a calculated rebuke to President Trump’s tariff-first trade regime, a posture Carney, the Davos globalist, has openly criticized. The message is not subtle. Canada will reopen its market to China on its own terms, even if doing so undermines Washington’s trade posture and complicates North American industrial strategy.

Carney’s deceptive math

Under the deal, the annual import cap rises to 70,000 vehicles by year five. The Carney government has said it “anticipates” that roughly half will be affordable EVs priced below $35,000. Carney insists this represents less than three percent of Canada’s annual auto sales, framing the move as modest and controlled.

That framing is deliberately misleading. The relevant denominator is not total vehicle sales. It is EV sales.

Final Canadian EV figures for 2025 are not yet available, but even a generous estimate places them at no more than 170,000 vehicles after a roughly 32 percent decline in the first nine months of the year. Viewed through that lens, the quota represents a staggeringly large share of Canada’s EV market, instantly positioning Chinese manufacturers as price setters in a sector Canada is struggling to sustain.

One caveat matters. The 49,000-vehicle figure does not mean 49,000 Chinese-brand EVs suddenly flooding Canada. The quota applies to all electric and hybrid vehicles built in China, including Teslas and vehicles produced there by Western automakers. In 2022 and 2023, roughly 40,000 such vehicles already entered Canada, most of them Teslas, making the immediate increase closer to 9,000 units.

But quotas do not remain static. They establish precedent, and precedent has a habit of expanding.

GM’s Canadian tab

GM’s vulnerability in Canada is self-inflicted. The company received roughly $500 million in federal and provincial support to produce electric delivery vehicles at its CAMI plant in Ingersoll, then shuttered the operation and sent more than 1,000 workers to the unemployment line. GM once built the gas-powered Equinox in Ontario before shifting production to Mexico, where it now also manufactures the electric version.

Canada also paid heavily for GM’s survival during the 2008 bankruptcy, ultimately losing an estimated C$800 million. In return, GM closed its massive Oshawa plant in 2019, wiping out roughly 5,000 plant and supplier jobs. When the facility reopened in 2020 to build highly profitable Silverado pickups, many jobs were rebuilt on worse terms, with lower pay for new hires and far less security.

Canadians can buy GM vehicles and also have good reason to resent GM’s conduct. GM remains a sales powerhouse in Canada, but its corporate behavior has given Canadians little reason to view it as a reliable long-term partner. GM’s EV sales have been stronger in Canada than in the U.S., even as the company builds several of its most affordable models in Mexico.

Once China’s EVs gain a foothold, it is not hard to imagine Canadians clamoring for more.

The bridges already exist

Ontario Premier Doug Ford has warned that China has secured access to Canada “without any real guarantee of equal or immediate investment in Canada’s auto sector,” adding that the deal risks jeopardizing Canada’s access to the U.S. market, still its largest export destination.

Toyota and Honda may be especially exposed. Some of their most popular U.S. vehicles are manufactured in Canada, and future EV production allocations by these automakers could be affected if Canada continues to trade industrial leverage for short-term affordability.

For GM and Ford, China’s entry into Canada could prove existential. Millions of Americans visit Canada each year. They will notice when Canadians are driving EVs that feel technologically superior to what Detroit sells at home, often at prices below the gas-powered vehicles still dominating U.S. showrooms.

There is a final irony in Carney’s deal. Jim Farley traveled halfway around the world to experience the future of the automobile. Before long, he may only need to drive to Windsor, barely 10 miles from Ford’s headquarters in Dearborn.

With 19 bridges and tunnels connecting Canada to the United States, China’s EV manufacturers don’t need to break down barriers. They only need to cross them.",https://d2nyfqh3g1stw3.cloudfront.net/photos/featured_detroit_river_59235.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 11:01:09.227788

HOUSTON/NEW YORK/LONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Oil major Shell (SHEL.L), opens new tab and Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi Corp (8058.T), opens new tab are exploring sale options for their respective stakes in the C$40 billion ($28.8 billion) LNG Canada project, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The moves come as owners of the massive liquefied natural gas facility weigh a potential expansion, and after another stakeholder, Petronas, successfully offloaded a piece of the project.

Shell, the largest owner with a 40% stake in LNG Canada, has been working with investment bankers at Rothschild & Co to sound out interested parties in recent weeks, said two of the sources. Two sources added that Shell could offload as much as three-quarters of its holding, or 30% of the project. Shell has expressed willingness, however, to consider different options relating to its exposure to the project's Phase 1, which is operational, and the proposed Phase 2, given their different risks.

One of the sources estimated that any buyer for Shell's stake could be committing roughly $15 billion, inclusive of the equity stake, debt and capital requirements for Phase 2.

MITSUBISHI HIRES RBC

Mitsubishi, which holds a 15% stake, has hired RBC Capital Markets as it weighs its options, two of the sources said, cautioning deliberations were early and any sale effort would not kick off until later this year. The sources did not elaborate on how much of its stake Mitsubishi could market.

All the sources said sales involving Shell and Mitsubishi were not guaranteed, and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations.

LNG Canada referred questions to Shell and Mitsubishi. Shell declined to comment. Mitsubishi was not immediately reachable outside Japanese office hours. RBC declined to comment. Rothschild did not immediately respond to a comment request.

MidOcean, backed by investment firm EIG and Saudi Aramco , closed a deal in December to buy a fifth of the Petronas venture that held a 25% stake in LNG Canada.

PetroChina (601857.SS), opens new tab holds a 15% stake, while Korea Gas Corporation owns 5% of LNG Canada.

LNG CANADA'S COST ADVANTAGE

LNG Canada is the first major LNG facility in North America with direct access to the Pacific Coast. The project in Kitimat, British Columbia, has a supply cost advantage because prices for Canadian natural gas consistently trade at a discount to the U.S. Henry Hub benchmark.

Even so, existing and potential owners will consider industry fears of global oversupply of the supercooled fuel, as new LNG output comes online. Energy Transfer (ET.N), opens new tab said in December that it was suspending development of its Lake Charles LNG export facility in Louisiana.

LNG Canada started production in June, but has since run into operational problems. Its second processing unit, known as Train 2, was down in December, nearly a month after its startup, two sources told Reuters.

When fully ramped up, Phase 1 will have the capacity to export 14 million metric tons of LNG per year.

Shell told potential bidders it will keep a gas contract with the terminal for 30 years, one source said.

Developers of major infrastructure projects often reduce their stakes once they become operational, allowing them to book profits and recycle cash into new ventures. Large investment firms and infrastructure funds are ready buyers of such stakes, as they like the projects' steady revenue.

Shell, the world's biggest LNG trader, said in March it targeted a 4% to 5% annual increase in LNG sales over the next five years and 1% annual production growth.

Shell and its partners were working toward a final investment decision for Phase 2, as soon as this year, which would double capacity.

That sun has provided him cheap power for 25 years, and this month he installed his fourth iteration of solar panels on his Vermont home. In an interview after he set up the new system, he said President Donald Trump's stance against solar and other cheap green energy will hurt the GOP in this year's elections as electricity bills rise.

After the Biden and Obama administrations subsidized and championed solar, wind and other green power as answers to fight climate change, Trump has tried to dampen those and turn to older and dirtier fossil fuels. The Trump administration froze five big offshore wind projects last month but judges this week allowed three of the projects to resume. Federal clean energy tax incentives expired on Dec. 31 that include installing home solar panels.

Meanwhile, electricity prices are rising in the United States, and McKibben is counting on that to trigger political change.

“I think you’re starting to see that have a big political impact in the U.S. right now. My prediction would be that electric prices are going to be to the 2026 election what egg prices were to the 2024 election,” said McKibben, an author and founder of multiple environmental and activist groups. Everyday inflation hurt Democrats in the last presidential race, analysts said.

The Trump administration and a bipartisan group of governors on Friday tried to step up pressure on the operator of the nation’s largest electric grid to take urgent steps to boost power supplies in the mid-Atlantic and keep electricity bills from rising even higher.

“Ensuring the American people have reliable and affordable electricity is one of President Trump’s top priorities,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.

Renewable energy prices drop around the world

Globally, the price of wind and solar power is plummeting to the point that they are cheaper than fossil fuels, the United Nations found. And China leads the world in renewable energy technology, with one of its electric car companies passing Tesla in annual sales.

""We can’t economically compete in a world where China gets a lot of cheap energy and we have to pay for really expensive energy,"" McKibben told The Associated Press, just after he installed a new type of solar panels that can hang on balconies with little fuss.

When Trump took office in January 2025, the national average electricity cost was 15.94 cents per kilowatt-hour. By September it was up to 18.07 cents and then down slightly to 17.98 cents in October, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

That's a 12.8% increase in 10 months. It rose more in 10 months than the previous two years. People in Maryland, New Jersey and Maine have seen electricity prices rise at a rate three times higher than the national average since October 2024.

At 900 kilowatt-hours per month, that means the average monthly electricity bill is about $18 more than in January 2025.

Democrats blame Trump for rising electric bills

This week, Democrats on Capitol Hill blamed rising electric bills on Trump and his dislike of renewable energy.

“From his first day in office, he’s made it his mission to limit American’s access to cheap energy, all in the name of increasing profits for his friends in the fossil fuel industry. As a result, energy bills across the country have skyrocketed,"" Illinois Rep. Sean Casten said at a Wednesday news conference.

“Donald Trump is the first president to intentionally raise the price of something that we all need,” Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, also a Democrat, said Wednesday on the Senate floor. “Nobody should be enthused about paying more for electricity, and this national solar ban is making everybody pay more. Clean is cheap and cheap is clean.”

Solar panels on McKibben's Vermont home

McKibben has been sending excess electricity from his solar panels to the Vermont grid for years. Now he's sending more.

As his dog, Birke, stood watch, McKibben, who refers to his home nestled in the Green Mountains of Vermont as a “museum of solar technology"" got his new panels up and running in about 10 minutes. This type of panel from the California-based firm Bright Saver is often referred to as plug-in solar. Though it's not yet widely available in the U.S., McKibben pointed to the style's popularity in Europe and Australia.

“Americans spend three or four times as much money as Australians or Europeans to put solar panels on the roof. We have an absurdly overcomplicated permitting system that’s unlike anything else on the rest of the planet,"" McKibben said.

McKibben said Australians can obtain three hours of free electricity each day through a government program because the country has built so many solar panels.

“And I’m almost certain that that’s an argument that every single person in America would understand,"" he said. ""I don’t know anyone who wouldn’t say: ‘I’d like three free hours of electricity.’”

That sun has provided him cheap power for 25 years, and this month he installed his fourth iteration of solar panels on his Vermont home. In an interview after he set up the new system, he said President Donald Trump’s stance against solar and other cheap green energy will hurt the GOP in this year’s elections as electricity bills rise.

After the Biden and Obama administrations subsidized and championed solar, wind and other green power as answers to fight climate change, Trump has tried to dampen those and turn to older and dirtier fossil fuels.

Nevertheless, the Venezuela vote is useful as a timely litmus test for Moran and Marshall, both as Republicans and surrogates for their constituents.

If you are shaking your head at weak tea that the Equivocaters served, consider the posse that our Kansas senators joined — I call them the Compliant Coalition.","This week provided more proof that Congress — and our two Kansas senators — are unwilling to check the powers of President Donald Trump.

A vote in the Senate on Wednesday could have blocked Trump’s ability to conduct further military action in Venezuela without congressional approval. Since Jan. 3, the U.S. has staged a military intervention, removed the president and claimed power over the country’s oil industry.

The vote narrowly failed, 51-50.

We are looking at you, Kansas Sens. Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall.

Kansans might dispute how consequential this vote was, especially compared with other opportunities to slow down Trump. Both senators could have voted against other measures that have inched us closer to an imperial presidency. For instance, both sided with Trump during impeachment votes in his first term.

Kansans might also argue that the vote on Venezuela was less significant than congressional action on domestic policies, such as deployments of the National Guard or widespread raids by immigration officials. The Kansas senators could have stood up when Trump asserted those powers. (In fact, they still can.)

Nevertheless, the Venezuela vote is useful as a timely litmus test for Moran and Marshall, both as Republicans and surrogates for their constituents. Wednesday’s vote shows where they sit after almost one year of Trump’s second term. That is to say, on the sidelines.

To understand this, let’s inspect the conservative coalitions on this vote. Republican ranks broke down into three camps.

In the first group — let’s call them the Principled Objectors — there were three Republican senators: Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky. Beginning last week, they broke unexpectedly from their party to force the Venezuela roll call vote and stuck by their convictions in the face of public and private threats from Trump.

Marshall and Moran joining this group would require an extraordinary upgrade to their courage and wild swings to their ideologies. Both have long-term voting records that support the conservative cause. Perhaps it’s fantasy (or folly) to expect this level of resistance.

In the second group — let’s call them the Equivocaters — there were two Republican senators: Todd Young of Indiana and Josh Hawley of Missouri.

How do they earn the title of the Equivocaters? After first signaling their hopes of restraining the president, both waffled back to supporting Trump by voting with fellow conservatives. In doing so, they took a position of some courage before retreating, never fully committing themselves.

We can associate them with equivocation in another way: They insisted on nothing more than weak language from the administration.

From a statement by Young: “I’ve also received a commitment that if President Trump were to determine American forces are needed in major military operations in Venezuela, the Administration will come to Congress in advance to ask for an authorization of force.”

Sounds like asking for congressional approval without actually mandating by legislation.

Hawley said his assurance came from Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

If you are shaking your head at weak tea that the Equivocaters served, consider the posse that our Kansas senators joined — I call them the Compliant Coalition. Forty-eight Republican senators, including Moran and Marshall, helped Trump get his legislative wish this week with the Venezuelan vote. Vice President JD Vance was needed to break the tie.

The Compliant Coalition appeases. It cedes power. It responds to threats. It holds its tongue.

During Congressional votes. During campaigns. During election disputes. And during two Trump administrations.

Lest the coalition say that they are simply representing the will of the American people, read the polls. According to an Associated Press poll this week, 61 percent of U.S. adults disapprove of how Trump is handling foreign policy, in general. Only 35 percent believe this administration’s intervention has “been about right.”

Recent polling from Reuters shows how divided and nervous Americans are about Venezuela. Polling from Jan. 4-5 shows Americans almost perfectly split on their approval of US military action to remove the nation’s leader Nicolás Maduro: 33 percent in support, 33 percent don’t know and 34 percent disapprove.

Asked if they are concerned that the U.S. will get too involved in Venezuela, 72 percent said yes.

These seem like the exact conditions when a robust Congress — and an empowered Kansas delegation — would want a say. The country is unsure and divided. Our president is volatile and threatening, while also vague about his military intentions. And the administration is pulling a U-turn from its first term, one that kicked off with an inaugural address trumpeting the wisdom of “America First.”

If not now, if not on this issue, then when does Congress want power?

Perhaps these categories — the Principled Objectors, the Equivocators and the Compliant Coalition — are in flux. Maybe leadership will reel in the rogue Republicans. Maybe the Equivocators will develop further backbone when it comes to balance of powers.

Or maybe — just maybe — a Republican from the heartland will assert Congressional power and grab the steering wheel.

What it is The 2009 finding concluded that six greenhouse gases -- including carbon dioxide and methane -- endanger public health and welfare by driving climate change.
As a result, repealing the finding would immediately affect vehicle emissions rules, while placing a broader suite of climate regulations in legal jeopardy.
""Their efforts to undo the Endangerment Finding are the latest evidence that President Trump is trying to remake the Environmental Protection Agency into the Polluter Protection Agency,"" Manish Bapna of the Natural Resources Defense Council said.
""If the EPA follows through and tries to repeal the Endangerment Finding, we will see them in court.""","The Environmental Protection Agency proposed reversing the 2009 Endangerment Finding last July.

After a public comment period that drew more than half a million submissions, the proposed final rule was sent to the White House's Office of Management and Budget for review on January 7, records show.

Here's what to know.

What it is

The 2009 finding concluded that six greenhouse gases -- including carbon dioxide and methane -- endanger public health and welfare by driving climate change.

That determination flowed from a 2007 Supreme Court decision, Massachusetts v. EPA, which ruled that greenhouse gases qualify as pollutants under the Clean Air Act and directed the EPA to determine whether they pose a danger to public health and welfare.

Although then president George W. Bush's administration delayed acting on the ruling, the EPA under president Barack Obama concluded that six greenhouse gases met the legal threshold for regulation.

While the finding initially applied only to a section of the Clean Air Act governing vehicle emissions, it was later incorporated into other regulations, including limits on carbon dioxide from power plants and methane from oil and gas operations.

As a result, repealing the finding would immediately affect vehicle emissions rules, while placing a broader suite of climate regulations in legal jeopardy.

""If finalized, it would be the largest act of deregulation in the history of the United States of America,"" EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said Friday at Ford's Ohio Assembly Plant where he and other officials touted policies they said would lower vehicle prices.

The Trump administration's arguments

The administration's draft proposal rests on both legal and scientific arguments.

Procedurally, it argues that greenhouse gases should not be treated as pollutants in the traditional sense because their effects on human health are indirect and global rather than local. Regulating them within US borders, it contends, cannot meaningfully resolve a worldwide problem.

On the scientific front, the administration has sought to downplay the scale and impacts of human-caused climate change.

It commissioned a Department of Energy working group filled with skeptics of human-caused climate change to produce a report challenging the scientific consensus.

That report was widely criticized for misattribution and for misstating the conclusions of the studies it cited.

Environmental groups sued the Energy Department, alleging the panel was convened behind closed doors in violation of federal rules. Energy Secretary Chris Wright later disbanded the group.

What happens next

Environmental organizations are expected to move quickly to challenge the rule in court.

Challengers point out that despite the current conservative-dominated Supreme Court's willingness to overturn precedent, the Endangerment Finding has survived multiple challenges and the underlying case Massachusetts v. EPA remains in effect.

""Their efforts to undo the Endangerment Finding are the latest evidence that President Trump is trying to remake the Environmental Protection Agency into the Polluter Protection Agency,"" Manish Bapna of the Natural Resources Defense Council said.

""If the EPA follows through and tries to repeal the Endangerment Finding, we will see them in court.""

JOHN,,,,,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinese-evs-making-inroads-north-211111525.html,"So why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?

In 2024, former President Joe Biden set a 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars.
The Mexican auto market has welcomed Chinese EVs, with massive growth last year.","So why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?

Much of the global auto market is electrifying, an ideal opportunity for advanced Chinese automakers to capitalize on. China saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles in 2025, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week, and Europe saw a 33% increase.

Meanwhile, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year. As the rest of the world advances, U.S. automakers have weakened their once-ambitious, multibillion dollar electrification plans, instead opting for more efficient hybrid electric and gasoline vehicles amid the Trump administration's shift away from EV-friendly policy.

That shift threatens U.S. automakers’ competitive edge in the coming years. As is, Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker last year, delivering only 1.64 million vehicles in 2025 to Chinese rival BYD’s 2.26 million.

Trump administration policy slashing emissions rules at a time when Chinese companies are advancing quickly has experts worried for the future of American car manufacturers.

Chinese automakers will have to meet standards required for the Canadian auto market for the latest trade arrangement to be successful — standards that are similar to those in the U.S. — which is likely to incentivize Chinese auto manufacturing investment in Canada.

They'll also have to establish which segment of the market they are targeting there: Higher-end vehicles, or less-expensive ones that sell at higher volumes.

Regardless, “It brings it home to what is needed to compete globally,” said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at AlixPartners. The firm predicts Chinese brands will account for 30% of the global market by 2030.

“They’ve already started in Europe. They started in South America. Now Mexico and Canada,"" Wakefield said. American carmakers ""don’t want to end up as a Brazil with your ethanol-based cars that aren’t sellable anywhere else in the world and ... like Britain or Australia that used to matter in the auto world, and no longer really matter.”

Why have others sought to regulate Chinese EV-makers’ expansion?

Countries have attempted to regulate Chinese EVs from entering their markets for several reasons.

“China has become this overwhelming machine making inexpensive vehicles. And the fear is that if you give them an inch, they’re going to take a mile,” Fiorani said. “The other issue is technology. These vehicles are data centers... and the idea that a state-owned company in China could have access to where a high portion of drivers are going gives them leverage for all kinds of outlets.”

The European Union hiked tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, though the two have been resolving that at the start of this year.

In 2024, former President Joe Biden set a 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars. Canada matched that import tax on the vehicles until this week. And even with an annual import cap, Canada cutting its tariffs this week means those companies are another step closer to U.S. soil. The Mexican auto market has welcomed Chinese EVs, with massive growth last year.

“The advance of Chinese manufacturers is inevitable. It will happen eventually. Everybody is negotiating to put up the roadblocks to figure out: What data is being processed, how much market share you’re going to allow Chinese manufacturers to have?"" Fiorani added.

""There are a lot of guardrails that have to be put up, but eventually they’re going to make their way into all Western markets.”

Those fees were previously included in customers’ bills, but are now being rolled into the base services charge, the PG&E email said.
Changes to customers’ bills caused by the base services charge is in response to Assembly Bill 205, which was passed by the California Legislature and signed into law in 2022.
“We know this transition to electrification is ongoing, and as customers incorporate more efficient appliances in their home, like an electric vehicle, their electric usage will go up.” The base services charge is meant to ultimately lower customers’ bills, Ornelas told The Center Square.
“For high-usage customers, the lower cost per kilowatt hour may help offset the base services charge,” Ornelas said.","(The Center Square) – Pacific Gas & Electric customers are going to see changes to their electricity rates starting in March, according to an email to a PG&E customer obtained by The Center Square.

The email said a “base services charge” will change what some PG&E customers will pay every month in California. PG&E serves the northern and central portions of the state.

It isn’t a new charge, according to PG&E, but it is what the company is using to describe certain charges, including fees for start-up connection, energy programs, call center services and billing service charges.

Those fees were previously included in customers’ bills, but are now being rolled into the base services charge, the PG&E email said.

That charge will be $25.15 a month, according to information sent by PG&E. Instituting the rate will reduce the cost of electricity anywhere from 5 to 7 cents per kilowatt hour, according to PG&E documents sent to The Center Square.

Changes to customers’ bills caused by the base services charge is in response to Assembly Bill 205, which was passed by the California Legislature and signed into law in 2022. The bill required utility providers to find ways to accelerate clean energy projects to reduce the state’s dependence on fossil fuels, according to the bill analysis.

Despite the newly-instituted base services charge, not everyone will see an increase in their bill, particularly low-income customers, a PG&E representative told The Center Square.

“The goal of Assembly Bill 205 is to lower rates for low-income customers,” a PG&E spokesperson told The Center Square. “Customers who are on the income-qualified programs pay a lower fixed charge than people who are not. The base charge goes onto bills, and as part of the restructuring, the actual rate per kilowatt hour gets decreased for all customers.”

Some programs that companies like PG&E and Southern California Edison participate in, like the California Alternative Rates for Energy program, or CARE, and the Family Electric Rate Assistance program, or FERA, charge lower energy rates if a customer is considered low-income. Southern California Edison customers enrolled in those programs can expect to see lower base service charges than their higher-income counterparts. Customers enrolled in CARE get charged only $6 a month for the base service charge, while customers enrolled in the FERA program pay $12 a month for the base service charge, according to Southern California Edison’s website.

“Low-income customers’ bills should be lower,” the PG&E representative said. “For customers who are not on CARE and FERA, they might see a slight bill impact, but the thought is between the September and January decreases, that might offset any bill impact they might see.”

Rates were decreased in recent months, company officials told The Center Square, in large part in anticipation of the rollout of the base services charge.

The new restructure of what PG&E customers pay for electricity will also include a lower price per kilowatt hour, although since each customer’s energy usage can vary, the rate restructure might not lead to a lower overall bill each month, PG&E officials familiar with the rate change told The Center Square.

“​​As required by the CPUC, PG&E will implement the Base Services Charge (BSC) in March,” PG&E told The Center Square. “Reducing the price of electricity makes it more affordable for low-income customers and encourages the transition to more clean-powered electric appliances in the home.”

The PG&E representative added that the company will know more in February about how the base service charge will affect customer bills.

A result of the bill changes might see lower-usage customers pay more for their PG&E bill every month, while higher-usage customers might be paying more, according to graphs showing one customer’s current and new bill rates included in the email sent from PG&E to the customer.

For example, one customer’s bill showed that under the new change to customer’s bills, monthly usage under 200 kilowatts would increase the bill from $75 to $95 with the inclusion of the new base service charge. Medium monthly usage would increase that same customer’s bill from $184 to $188, and would actually reduce the bill for high usage. That would bring the customer’s monthly bill down from $304 to $296 a month, according to an email from PG&E.

Another electricity provider in the state, Southern California Edison, is also instituting a base services charge. That charge went into effect in November 2025, according to the company.

According to Southern California Edison’s website, some customers who are low users of energy might see their electricity bill go up because the base services charge, set at $24 a month, might offset the decrease in the per-kilowatt hour rate.

Customers who are not enrolled in programs meant to help low-income households, like CARE and FERA, but who still try to reduce their energy use, might actually see their bills go up if they are low-energy users, according to Southern California Edison’s website. That’s because the company is trying to charge households for energy use in ways that will reduce customers’ energy bills as more and more households replace gas appliances with electric ones, according to a company spokesperson.

“The purpose of the base services charge is to make it more affordable for all residential customers to use electric technologies,” Gabriela Ornelas, a spokesperson for Southern California Edison, told The Center Square. “We know this transition to electrification is ongoing, and as customers incorporate more efficient appliances in their home, like an electric vehicle, their electric usage will go up.”

The base services charge is meant to ultimately lower customers’ bills, Ornelas told The Center Square. The lower cost of the kilowatt hour, Ornelas said, may help offset the cost of the base services charge.

“For high-usage customers, the lower cost per kilowatt hour may help offset the base services charge,” Ornelas said. “Consequently, for low-usage customers, the low cost per kilowatt hour may not be enough to offset the base services charge.”

The PG&E official who spoke to The Center Square also said the base services charge is meant to encourage customers to use electrical appliances.

“Not only does an incentive to encourage conservation remain, but this rate restructuring also supports important state decarbonization goals by making it more affordable for customers to electrify their homes and vehicles to help California achieve our clean energy transition goals,” the PG&E official told The Center Square.

Despite the explanations of officials at California’s two largest electricity companies, at least one lawmaker is skeptical of the base services charge.

“This is advertised as a transparent method to detail grid infrastructure costs and energy use costs separately,” Sen. Ben Allen, D-El Segundo, told The Center Square via an emailed statement. “But I share concerns that this may lead to subsidizing our highest consumers through redistributed charges. Such subsidizing is exactly what we need to be avoiding in the face of current affordability challenges.”

Allen added, “I am eager to see the net results of total electric costs as base charges are implemented.”

A fact sheet sent to The Center Square on Friday explains that all PG&E customers already pay for building and maintaining the electric grid, but that the newly-instituted base service charge reallocates how those costs are shared by customers. An official with PG&E familiar with the rate changes explained that low-income customers pay a lower fixed charge.

Staff who work for the California Public Utilities Commission, which approved the rate changes to electrical customers’ bills in 2025, were unavailable to talk to The Center Square in recent days.

Employees of the commission sent a fact sheet to The Center Square on Jan. 9 explaining the base service charge, but did not send a statement to The Center Square via email. Multiple phone calls to the commission went unreturned as of Friday afternoon.

When approached at the commission’s Sacramento office this week, employees of the commission who work in that office were unable to answer questions in person.

Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris, chair of the Assembly Utilities and Energy Committee, also was not available to speak with The Center Square.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/4a/e4a9c72d-db13-400b-8d80-d92c4fe3b9be/68dab6e7b565b.image.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 20:59:32.650121

Dominion Energy, which serves approximately 1.3 million customers in South Carolina, has provided several tips to help consumers save on energy costs during the colder months.

The company suggests setting thermostats to 68 degrees or lower and reducing the temperature further when away from home.

Each additional degree can significantly increase heating expenses.

For those with heat pumps, it's advised to raise the temperature only one to two degrees at a time to avoid triggering auxiliary or emergency heat.

Monthly checks and replacements of air filters, along with inspections of ductwork for leaks or tears, are recommended.

Additionally, opening drapes during the day can let in natural warmth from the sun, while closing them at night helps retain heat.

Sealing drafts with caulk and weather-stripping doors and windows can also keep the cold out.

Despite these conservation efforts, some residents report their bills are still climbing.

In a National Energy Dominance Council meeting, the government called on Mid-Atlantic-based PJM Interconnection to force data center developers to pay for any new power generation they require, ""whether they show up and use the power or not.""

PJM covers 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest, including the data center hotspot of Northern Virginia.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) and outgoing Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) joined the Trump administration in calling for a number of changes, including calling on PJM to hold an “emergency” power auction “to address escalating electricity prices and growing reliability risks.”

The Dominance Council said that PJM should build more than $15 billion of reliable baseload power generation, and accelerate the development of reliable power generation by providing 15-year revenue certainty for new power plants.

It also blamed PJM for supporting renewable energy projects over coal and gas. Monitoring Analytics, PJM’s independent monitor, found that 60 percent of 2025’s price increases were the result of high prices for fossil fuels, with the grid heavily reliant on natural gas.

""In the coming years, America’s reindustrialization and the AI race will require a significantly larger supply of around-the-clock, reliable, and uninterrupted power,"" the administration said.

""The United States cannot afford to continue down the unstable and dangerous path of energy subtraction previous leaders pursued, forcing the closure of baseload power sources like coal and natural gas.""

""If we are going to keep the lights on, win the AI race, and keep electricity prices from skyrocketing, the United States must unleash American energy.""

Trump this week said that data centers across the US will be expected to pay their fair share for electricity, with Microsoft first to announce it would cover any utility costs.

PJM was not invited to the Dominance Council meeting. Hours later, it published its own board letter on utility challenges, which said that it would seek to incentivize data centers to develop their own power. Such projects could be rewarded with expedited connections to the grid.

The utility said that it was still reviewing the government's demands.",https://media.datacenterdynamics.com/media/images/Grid_Transmission.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 14:59:02.452451

But “Canada’s approach to tariffs on Chinese EVs has never needed to be so binary.
Doran said the experience in Europe has shown Chinese EVs creating incentives for other automakers to be more competitive, not displacing them.","Prime Minister Mark Carney has agreed to sharply reduce tariffs on electric vehicle imports from China, while China offers up tariff relief for Canadian canola, peas, pork, and seafood, prompting Canadian observers to predict lower EV prices and possible long-term advantages for the country’s automotive industrial base.

Canada will slash duties on up to 49,000 Chinese EVs per year to a “most-favoured-nation tariff rate” of 6.1%, Carney’s office said in a statement. The imports will amount to less than 3% of annual new vehicle sales in Canada, but “will drive considerable new Chinese joint-venture investment in Canada with trusted partners to protect and create new auto manufacturing careers for Canadian workers, and ensure a robust buildout of Canada’s EV supply chain,” the PMO said.

Within five years, more than half of those vehicles “will be affordable EVs with an import price of less than $35,000, creating new lower-cost options for Canadian consumers,” the statement adds.

Carney later told media the annual total will rise to 70,000 vehicles per year by 2031.

In return, by March 1 China will reduce its 84% tariff on Canadian canola seed entering its $4-billion annual market to about 15%, and eliminate anti-discrimination tariffs on canola meal, lobsters, crabs, and peas.

Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping also “discussed increasing two-way investment in clean energy and technology, agri-food, wood products, and other sectors,” with Canada setting 2030 as a deadline to increase exports to China by 50%. That includes non-binding agreements on oil, gas, and uranium development, finance, public security and safety, and food safety, as well as a five-year memorandum of understanding on modern wood construction between Canada, China, and British Columbia.

“It’s a partnership that reflects the world as it is today, with an engagement that is realistic, respectful, and interest-based,” Carney told media in Beijing.

“From energy to agriculture to people-to-people ties to multilateralism, to issues on security, we believe that the spirit and the substance of these discussions, and these agreements, will provide great benefit to each of our peoples,” he added earlier in the visit.

No Need for Sledgehammers

Clean Energy Canada, a B.C.-based think tank that has long advocated against the EV tariff, hailed the announcement as “a breakthrough for consumers with potential for investment in a modern auto sector,” in a media release that included a detailed history and assessment of the issue.

“Canada inadvertently ‘broke’ its EV market with a combination of policy changes under the past two governments: ending the EV incentive, pausing the EV Availability Standard, and imposing a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs in late 2024,” Executive Director Rachel Doran said in the release. But “Canada’s approach to tariffs on Chinese EVs has never needed to be so binary. While we have simply followed the sledgehammer approach of the U.S. to date, the option has always been open to implement a more flexible lower tariff like our other allies did in the EU.”

Canada “is in a difficult position these days,” Doran told The Energy Mix in an interview. “So what we’ve been suggesting the government do in the changing terrain is put Canada first. The assumption that Canada is best served by borrowing Trump policies on EVs or fully endorsing the position of U.S.-based automakers may not be the best for Canadian consumers, or even for Canadian industry in the long term.”

Clean Energy Canada’s polling last summer found that nearly half of respondents wanted their next vehicle purchase to be electric, she added. “It’s just that we haven’t had the vehicles available at the price point that made sense for Canadians. So a choice, even if it’s just 3% of our EV market, can make some of those more available,” and “spark a bit of competition in the marketplace for Japanese or Korean automakers to bring more of their affordable models to Canada.”

Corporate Knights Research Director Ralph Torrie, who previously urged the federal government not to impose the EV tariff, said the announcement was “really quite exciting,” particularly if Chinese automakers can accelerate the timeline to send affordable EVs to Canada.

Even if that doesn’t happen, “the door has been cracked open, and it’s a good thing,” Torrie told The Mix. “I think this initial tranche of vehicles will be snapped up by Canadians who’ve been waiting for more choice in their electric vehicle purchase decisions, and I expect these vehicles will be relatively affordable, even if they’re not under the $35,000 cap.”

Throwing Down Gauntlets

Torrie pushed back on accusations that China has been “dumping” low-cost cars to distort and dominate the EV market in other countries.

“When you dump products, you sell them for below what it’s costing you to make them,” he explained. But apart from the “ridiculously low prices” that some Chinese manufacturers have come up with for their domestic market, “I don’t think they’re selling at a loss anywhere else in the world.”

Rather, what they’re doing is “throwing down the gauntlet to all the western carmakers and basically saying: If you want to compete against this new source of supply, you’re going to have to match them on price.” China’s EVs are “well-made, high-quality cars,” he added, and the small influx in the early years of the Canada-China deal “will address the fears Canadians have about these vehicles. They’ll start to see them on the road, and they’ll see their neighbours getting them.”

But another gauntlet landed hours after the announcement, with the Canadian Labour Congress and Unifor both arguing that Carney traded away well-paying, union jobs.

“While Ottawa frames this deal as a way to diversify markets for Canadian farmers and exporters, it ultimately puts both groups at risk, offering uncertain, short-term relief for canola and select fisheries while endangering hundreds of thousands of good jobs across Canada’s manufacturing and industrial sectors,” the CLC said in a statement. “In the end, no sector truly wins, and workers in every industry are left more vulnerable.”

“This is a self-inflicted wound to an already injured Canadian auto industry,” said Unifor National President Lana Payne. “Providing a foothold to cheap Chinese EVs, backed by massive state subsidies, overproduction, and designed to expand market share through exports, puts Canadian auto jobs at risk while rewarding labour violations and unfair trade practices.”

Jim Stanford, director of the Centre for Future Work, said the average price of a new car in Canada is well above the target for affordable EVs, but the Big Three Detroit automakers had a total of three electric models below the 2024 average of $56,393.

“I don’t know where this obsession with the $40,000 price point comes from,” Stanford wrotein an email last fall. “The vast majority of Canadian car buyers (85% or more) pay much more than that,” and a higher cost for EVs “is part of the trade-off: pay more up front, save big on energy costs over the vehicle’s life.”

Stanford added he supported “active measures to push the industry toward faster transition to EVs. I think the companies themselves know this is going to happen. But they are now also trying to appease Trump.” In response, “what we need are strong rules to both push the industry to keep moving in this direction, and strong rules to ensure that Canada gets a fair proportionate share of the resulting economic activity,” rather than “picking sides” among manufacturers.

Doran said the experience in Europe has shown Chinese EVs creating incentives for other automakers to be more competitive, not displacing them. Last fall, Clean Energy Canada reported that the EU had 21 electric vehicle models selling for less than $40,000—seven from China, the rest from Japan, South Korea, and the EU itself—compared to just one in Canada.

“Having these lower model price points in an open economy is going to spur some competition and make vehicles generally more affordable,” Doran said this week, with a “ripple effect” that goes beyond the initial 49,000 vehicles per year.

“We know the problem is not that that there is no Canadian who wants an EV. They want to benefit from the long-term savings, but have to be able to afford that up-front price.”

Trade War Truce

News reports interpreted the Canada-China deal as a marked departure from the past few years of frosty relations between Canada and China, triggered largely by the frostier and existentially dangerous relations brought to Canada’s doorstep by Donald Trump.

“The truce in a painful trade war helps lessen a major irritant in Canada-China relations as the Prime Minister seeks bigger overseas export markets and new foreign investment to offset the economic damage caused by… Donald Trump’s protectionist tariffs,” the Globe and Mail reports.

At the same time, it “raises the prospect that Canada may be putting itself offside of Mr. Trump’s tough-on-China agenda, which the president expects allies to follow,” the Globe adds. But Carney “told journalists that relations with China have recently been more predictable than those with the United States.”

The flurry of announcements in Beijing “marks a de-escalation in tensions with a country the Liberal government had, in recent years, branded as a disruptive power, and is getting mixed reactions in Canada,” The Canadian Press reports. “Ontario Premier Doug Ford and some auto industry groups are slamming the plan as a threat to the country’s auto industry, but Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, who was in Beijing with Carney, was thrilled to see a deal he said will allow his province’s canola exports to China to return to normal levels.”

Ford said the deal gives China “a foothold in the Canadian market” that it will use at the expense of Canadian workers, the Globe writes. “The federal government is inviting a flood of cheap made-in-China electric vehicles without any real guarantee of equal or immediate investments in Canada’s economy, auto sector, or supply chain.”

Moe said the deal is “very good news for Canada and Saskatchewan,” demonstrating “the importance of foreign trade missions and show[ing] what can be achieved when the federal and provincial governments and our export industries work together.”

Greg Cherewyk, president of Pulse Canada, said tariffs effectively stopped all shipments to China and Canadian yellow peas worth about $700 million a year were being displaced by Russian products, CP adds. “It was really important that this didn’t last as long as we had feared it would last, into the years. It was resolved in what really amounts to a short period,” with timing that was ideal for farmers to make seeding decisions for this year’s crop.

The ‘Unreliable’ States of America

The news of the deal landed just a day after Washington Post foreign affairs columnist Fareed Zakaria wrote that the world is “adjusting to an unreliable United States”. The European Union has also been working to reduce trade frictions with China, aiming to avert “a broader confrontation over electric vehicles, subsidies, and market access,” he said. “Europe remains wary of China’s industrial policies and political system, but the EU now views China as a necessary partner.”

Trump’s trade wars over the last year have also prompted the continent to sign a “sweeping trade agreement” with key Latin American countries that took a quarter-century to negotiate, and to accelerate its outreach in Southeast Asia.

Zakaria cites Canada as a country that “made a clear strategic bet” on deeper economic integration with the U.S. Three decades later, “that trust has now been shattered. Trump’s tariffs, threats to reopen trade agreements, and bizarre declarations about annexing Canada have forced a rethink.”

Declarations along those lines continued Friday, with Trump surrogates talking down the importance of Carney’s visit to China. Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-MO) called the PM’s meeting Thursday with Chinese Premier Li Qiang a “grovel session”, Politico reports, while former co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita wrote off his statements as “asinine”.

In Ottawa, opposition leader Pierre Poilievre demanded to know what has changed since a spring election campaign in which Carney took a tough-talking stance on China, CP says. “Prime Minister Carney must explain how he has gone from saying China was Canada’s ‘biggest security threat’ before the election to announcing a ‘strategic partnership’ with Beijing after the election,” he declared in a statement.

“The security landscape continues to change, and in a world that’s more dangerous and divided, we face many threats,” Carney responded, after a reporter posed the question Friday. “You manage the threats through engagement.”

He added that he had raised human rights issues during his meeting with Xi, from a position of “values-based realism”.

“We fundamentally stand up for human rights, for democracy, territorial integrity, rights to self-determination,” he said. “We take the world as it is, not as we wish it to be.”

Carney’s former interim chief of staff Marco Mendicino defended the “uncomplicated” and “real benefit” of Carney being in China, Politico writes, opining that his former boss was acting as “chief diplomat for this country at a time when we need serious leadership.”

“The world has changed, and we cannot take for granted the relationships that we depend on every day, that they will be there,” Mendicino told a public audience in Toronto.

In Ottawa, opposition leader Pierre Poilievre demanded to know what has changed since a spring election campaign in which Carney took a tough-talking stance on China, CP says. “Prime Minister Carney must explain how he has gone from saying China was Canada’s ‘biggest security threat’ before the election to announcing a ‘strategic partnership’ with Beijing after the election,” he declared in a statement.

“The security landscape continues to change, and in a world that’s more dangerous and divided, we face many threats,” Carney responded, after a reporter posed the question Friday. “You manage the threats through engagement.”

He added that he had raised human rights issues during his meeting with Xi, from a position of “values-based realism”.

“We fundamentally stand up for human rights, for democracy, territorial integrity, rights to self-determination,” he said. “We take the world as it is, not as we wish it to be.”

Carney’s former interim chief of staff Marco Mendicino defended the “uncomplicated” and “real benefit” of Carney being in China, Politico writes, opining that his former boss was acting as “chief diplomat for this country at a time when we need serious leadership.”

“The world has changed, and we cannot take for granted the relationships that we depend on every day, that they will be there,” Mendicino told a public audience in Toronto.",https://www.theenergymix.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/BYD-production-line-BYDYouTube.jpeg,N,,2026-01-17 11:58:47.692035

Four years later, the tribe is roughly halfway to meeting that target, driven by a slate of large‑scale energy projects, infrastructure upgrades and a long-term energy plan.
“Net zero” refers to balancing the carbon a community releases with the carbon it removes or avoids.

Four years later, the tribe is roughly halfway to meeting that target, driven by a slate of large‑scale energy projects, infrastructure upgrades and a long-term energy plan.

“Net zero” refers to balancing the carbon a community releases with the carbon it removes or avoids. Prairie Island’s goal requires eliminating or offsetting more than 20 million pounds of carbon annually.

The tribe’s Net Zero Program Manager Andrea Zimmerman said the tribe’s decision to pursue net zero is tied to a “long and painful” history, including energy development near the reservation without tribal consent. She pointed to the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant, which was built next to the reservation more than 50 years ago before modern tribal consultation requirements were in place.

“Prairie Island’s net zero work is the community’s response,” Zimmerman said. “It’s the tribe’s way of expressing energy sovereignty and embodying the community’s values.”

The tribe approached the Minnesota Legislature as early as 2018 to access the state’s Renewable Development Account, which is funded by Xcel Energy in exchange for nuclear waste storage at Prairie Island. After several years of legislative efforts, lawmakers ultimately allocated $46.2 million to the tribe, Zimmerman said, allowing the first phase of projects to move forward.

The tribe has since supplemented that funding with additional state grants and federal support, including funding under the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Job Act, ZImmerman said. The tribe generated $470,473 in revenue from its solar power purchase agreement since the project entered commercial operation in May 2024, according to its July 2025 Net Zero Progress Report to the Minnesota legislature.

Early planning efforts focused on offsetting on-reservation energy use through a mix of onsite solar, microgrids, geothermal systems and energy efficiency upgrades. As preliminary engineering and procurement advanced, the tribe narrowed the scope of earlier concepts that exceeded available funding and concentrated resources on a smaller number of large projects, including a utility-scale solar array designed to generate revenue through a power purchase agreement.

The first phase of the revised project includes a 5.4‑megawatt solar array and a geothermal and electrification project at the tribe’s Welch-based Treasure Island Resort and Casino.

The solar array sits on about 20 acres of tribal land and includes roughly 10,000 panels. Construction took place through most of 2023 and early 2024, and the project went live in May 2024. The array is a front‑of‑the‑meter project. All power generated is sold to Great River Energy through the aforementioned, 30-year power purchase agreement, creating a revenue stream for the tribe.

Zimmerman said the geothermal conversion at the casino is also nearing completion. The project replaces aging heating, cooling and hot water systems that were close to the end of their useful life. The geothermal system will reduce emissions and lower long‑term energy costs by relying on the constant temperature of the earth rather than energy‑intensive chillers.

“It was going to need to be replaced anyway,” she said. “It was a great opportunity to upgrade critical infrastructure that was becoming an issue in terms of higher maintenance costs and risk to the community.”

With those two projects in place, the program is about “halfway” to its target, Zimmerman said. Other ongoing projects include a workforce development program with Xcel Energy, as well as a large-scale retrofit initiative for community homes. Zimmerman said the latter will likely continue into 2027.

The tribe is now updating its net zero plan to identify the next set of projects, though specific timelines have not yet been established. Currently, the most likely next steps include transitioning some of the tribe’s transportation fleet to electric vehicles, as well as more opportunities for commercial energy efficiency in kind with the geothermal work at the casino.

In the wake of a federal pivot away from renewable energy funding, it’s likely the tribe will need to seek other investment, however, Zimmerman noted. With that in mind, planning becomes more important than ever to establish a firm scope ahead of seeking capital.

“Starting with a concrete goal is very important,” she said. “If you don’t know where you’re trying to go, then it becomes a challenge to get there, and having that community support is critical.”

She said competitive procurement and strong partnerships have also been key. The tribe used an open-bidding process to secure development partners for retrofits, engineering, and the solar array.

Energy consultant Rita Mackwood, a longtime net zero advocate who is not involved with Prairie Island, says the tribe’s project could be a model for other tribes, particularly those with access to state funding.

Mackwood, who runs Firebrand Environmental, a Charlotte, N.C.-based energy consultancy,

said net zero projects often spur economic activity as construction, operations and maintenance work expands.

She said the current funding landscape for climate resiliency is “grim,” but tribes should continue pursuing emissions-reduction strategies with clear economic returns.

“As you can see with Prairie Island, they turned that into a power purchase agreement, which is revenue,” Mackwood said. “And a lot of states and local energy companies would be interested in reducing their own costs. If the money’s there, they should be seeking that out.”

As Prairie Island moves into its next phase, the tribe plans to expand residential upgrades, complete the casino conversion, continue workforce training and identify additional clean‑energy projects. Zimmerman said the work is focused on reducing long-term operating risk, strengthening energy sovereignty and improving infrastructure resilience.

The tribe has also restored more than 400 acres of native prairie and invested in wild rice, shoreline and oak savanna projects, describing these efforts as part of the same climate and sovereignty framework as the energy work.

“There’s been a lot of benefits to this work already,” Zimmerman said. “I think we’re going to see a lot more as it continues to grow.”",https://tribalbusinessnews.com/images/2023/PIIC_SOLAR.jpeg,N,,2026-01-17 09:59:07.962923

And asking that question is especially essential given the many steps the administration has taken to target offshore wind projects in particular, several of which have been declared unlawful or are currently being challenged.” If completed, the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project will consist of 176 offshore wind turbines located 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach.","NORFOLK, Va. (CN) — In a blow to President Donald Trump, a federal judge on Friday granted an injunction allowing for the completion of a wind turbine project off the coast of Virginia.

In a ruling from the bench, Judge Jamar Walker, a Joe Biden appointee, granted a temporary restraining order permitting Dominion Energy to continue working on the coastal Virginia offshore wind project as litigation proceeds. Dominion Energy had sued the federal government in December after the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management suspended for 90 days all ongoing projects related to wind energy, citing national security.

“Our team will now focus on safely restarting work to ensure CVOW” — that is, the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project — “begins delivery of critical energy in just weeks,” Dominion Energy said in an email. “While our legal challenge proceeds, we will continue seeking a durable resolution of this matter through cooperation with the federal government.”

The bureau’s suspension came after Trump issued a presidential memorandum in January 2025 entitled “Temporary Withdrawal of All Areas on the Outer Continental Shelf from Offshore Wind Leasing and Review of the Federal Government’s Leasing and Permitting Practices for Wind Projects.” That memo prompted the Department of the Interior to review the project.

The administration cited purported confidential information from the War Department, which ostensibly indicated that offshore wind projects could impact national security.

“The prime duty of the United States government is to protect the American people,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a December press release. “Today’s action addresses emerging national security risks, including the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies, and the vulnerabilities created by large-scale offshore wind projects with proximity near our East Coast population centers. The Trump administration will always prioritize the security of the American people.”

The government argued that the court should wait until it had provided its confidential reasoning. Walker, however, sided with Dominion Energy, which sought to maintain the status quo until the court ruled on a preliminary injunction. The order comes as Dominion Energy continues to litigate the legal basis for the suspension.

Walker has yet to issue an opinion explaining his decision but indicated he believes the suspension is causing Dominion Energy irreparable harm and that the company is likely to succeed on its claim that the suspension violates the Administrative Procedures Act.

“I applaud the court’s decision to block this reckless and unlawful order. Three judges — appointed by three different presidents, Reagan, Trump, and Biden — have now all rejected President Trump’s attempt to shut down this critical project,” Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates Don Scott, a Democrat, said in a press release. “This disruption should never have happened. I look forward to the legal process continuing, construction moving forward, and Virginia doing what we do best: building a reliable, affordable energy future.”

Virginia Senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner and U.S. Representative Bobby Scott, all Democrats, submitted a brief in support of Dominion.

In it, they questioned why the administration hasn’t shared any specifics about this supposed national security threat.

“This lack of transparency raises grave concerns, which should inform this court’s review,” the legislators wrote in their support brief. “When information is not timely shared, it is reasonable to ask why. And asking that question is especially essential given the many steps the administration has taken to target offshore wind projects in particular, several of which have been declared unlawful or are currently being challenged.”

If completed, the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project will consist of 176 offshore wind turbines located 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach. They will be capable of supplying 9.5 million megawatt-hours of energy per year, enough to power approximately 660,000 homes.

Virginia State Senate Majority Leader Scott Surrovel, also a Democrat, estimated the project will save $320 million per year in avoided fuel charges while also generating renewable energy certificates.

The conservation community celebrated the order.

“Virginia needs more, not less, affordable clean energy, and today’s ruling helps make that happen,” Blair St. Ledger-Olson, director of advocacy and campaigns for the Virginia League of Conservation Voters, said in a press release. “The Trump administration’s continued obstruction of clean energy projects may be good for his fossil fuel donors, but it hurts Virginians, saddling us with higher energy bills and dirtier air while killing good-paying jobs.”

The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2023/03/offshore-wind-farm.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2026-01-17 13:59:02.510152

U.S. manufacturing construction spending declined after peaking in 2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. At the same time, industry analysts at E2 report that companies canceled more than $32 billion in clean energy manufacturing projects in 2025, citing reduced government incentives, funding cuts and tariff-related pressures.

Yet amid these headwinds, a number of global manufacturers are significantly expanding their U.S. footprints. Federal policies aimed at boosting domestic production — including funding from the CHIPS and Science Act and state-level tax incentives tied to job creation — continue to drive investment, particularly in semiconductors, electric vehicles and pharmaceuticals.

It was money, more than anything else, that got Wall Street to care about climate change in the first place.
Conservative politicians and media pundits began pressuring Wall Street to distance itself from the climate cause.","In January 2020, Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, stunned the business world by declaring that he intended to use the trillions of dollars managed by his firm to address global warming.

“Every government, company, and shareholder must confront climate change,” Mr. Fink wrote, calling for “a fundamental reshaping of finance.”

A few days later, Mr. Fink arrived in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum’s annual gathering, donning a scarf featuring a design of the “warming stripes,” a pattern that depicts 150 years of rising global temperatures.

Mr. Fink’s impassioned call to address climate change was the unofficial start of a movement. Nearly every major financial institution was soon pledging to reduce emissions, joining high-minded alliances designed to phase out fossil fuels and promising to support clean energy. Environmental, social and governance factors, known as E.S.G., became a defining feature of Wall Street investing.

But six years later, many of those Wall Street institutions have walked back or abandoned their commitments.

The alliances — like the Net-Zero Banking Alliance and the Net-Zero Asset Managers initiative — that were meant to steer investments toward clean energy and away from fossil fuels have largely fallen apart. Investors have withdrawn tens of billions of dollars each quarter from E.S.G. funds.

While U.S. investment in clean energy has boomed in recent years — reaching $279 billion last year — many large corporations have gone silent on climate change. On company earnings calls, mentions of words like climate and sustainability have plunged by 75 percent over the past year, according to a Bloomberg analysis.

And with President Trump back in office and using the presidency to promote fossil fuels and attack the clean energy industry, Wall Street’s retreat from climate action has coincided with American banks doubling down on coal, oil and gas projects.

These dynamics will be on full display next week, as Mr. Fink, now co-chair of the World Economic Forum, welcomes Mr. Trump to Davos, where climate issues have taken a back seat to A.I. and geopolitics.

Republican politicians joined conservative activists, including groups funded by the fossil fuel industry, to engineer a sweeping pushback at what they saw as corporate America’s attempt to advance liberal policies.

Their tactics involved filing lawsuits, passing laws, pulling funds out of Wall Street accounts and using social media to tarnish the reputation of individual executives, including Mr. Fink.

In short order, their efforts succeeded in beating back an environmental movement on Wall Street, which from its inception was defined more by idealistic rhetoric than substantive changes to business practices.

“These institutions signed up without having any clue what they were signing up for,” said Paddy McCully, an analyst at Reclaim Finance, a nonprofit group that pushes Wall Street to address climate change. “They were joining the herd and wanted to look good, but they never had any inclination to change their business model.”

The rise of E.S.G.

It was money, more than anything else, that got Wall Street to care about climate change in the first place.

In 2019, many of BlackRock’s biggest clients, including major Japanese and European sovereign wealth fund pension funds, started asking for more environmentally focused funds. If BlackRock came up with products that promised to benefit the planet, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds said they would entrust the company with even more of their money.

Mr. Fink obliged. BlackRock began designing new environmental funds and soon he was in Davos, wearing the climate scarf.

“Larry decided to be a leader in the bandwagon,” said Mindy Lubber, chief executive of Ceres, a nonprofit organization that works with companies to address climate change. “It worked out until it didn’t.”

Other Wall Street titans quickly followed BlackRock’s lead.

Every major American bank said it would no longer finance drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

JPMorgan said it was “adopting a financing commitment that is aligned to the goals of the Paris Agreement,” the 2015 agreement by most countries on Earth try and keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

It was a fashionable pledge, and the movement soon came to encompass everything from investing in environmentally friendly bundles of stocks, to making loans to clean energy companies, to reducing corporate carbon emissions.

For a bank like JPMorgan, which regularly ranks as the biggest U.S. funder of fossil fuel projects, that would have meant rapidly winding down a lucrative line of business. JPMorgan did not reply to a request for comment.

Sensing momentum, Mr. Fink was even more ambitious in his 2021 annual letter to investors. In it, he promised to report climate impact of all BlackRock’s funds, create custom sustainability products, produce new ways to measure climate risk, and use the voting power of his firm’s holdings to push companies to address climate change.

In the months that followed, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America collectively pledged to deploy $5 trillion in sustainable finance by 2030 through loans and investments.

Ambitions kept rising at the annual United Nations climate summit in 2021. Known as COP26, the event in Glasgow, Scotland, would be the first such gathering since the pandemic, and its organizers wanted something concrete to show for their efforts.

Mark Carney, who was then fresh off his time as the governor of the Bank of England and is now prime minister of Canada, was brought in to convene a new U.N.-backed group that would encourage the private sector to reduce emissions.

The result was the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, or G.F.A.N.Z., which said it would harness the collective might of its members — some $130 trillion in assets — to try and stop global warming.

More than 450 financial groups including BlackRock, Bank of America and Citi signed on. In addition to the main umbrella group, G.F.A.N.Z. came to encompass a handful of industry specific associations including the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, the Net-Zero Asset Managers initiative and the Net-Zero Asset Owners Alliance.

Those alliances were a way for financial firms to signal their support for the highly ambitious goal of eliminating new planet-warming emissions by the year 2050. And joining was easy, requiring little more than an expression of good intentions. With no expectations that banks or investors needed to change their business models, companies signed on to the alliances in droves.

When convincing finance executives they should join the groups, Mr. Carney and his allies emphasized the chance to generate profits.

Celebrating the launch of the banking alliance, John Kerry, then the U.S. Special Presidential envoy for climate, said, “The largest financial players in the world recognize energy transition represents a vast commercial opportunity as well as a planetary imperative.”

Yet even as Wall Street firms raced to promote their climate bona fides, some executives were skeptical of the new products.

Terrence Keeley, a senior executive at BlackRock who oversaw sovereign wealth funds, pensions and central banks at the time, was among the loudest dissenters.

“All of these E.S.G. funds are wrong,” said Mr. Keeley, who left BlackRock in 2022 and now runs an impact investing firm. “They weren’t going to generate better returns. They are not going to make the world a better place. E.S.G. as an investment thesis should be entirely shut down.”

Mr. Keeley said that even as BlackRock was pushing E.S.G. funds, he was telling his own clients that they should not invest in them.

Internal dissent hardly mattered. Mr. Fink had delivered what the some clients had asked for, and alongside Mr. Carney, he had sparked a global movement.

It all added up to a banner year for BlackRock, which attracted nearly $25 billion in new assets for its E.S.G. funds in 2021.

Backlash

On the same day that executives in Glasgow were promoting their plans to use Wall Street as a force for good, a group of Republican state treasurers were gathered in Orlando, Fla., making plans to stop them.

The treasurers, part of a group called the State Financial Officers Foundation, discussed ways they might prevent their states’ assets from being used to support environmental causes.

Within a matter of months, Republican state treasurers had withdrawn more than $1 billion in funds from BlackRock. Conservative politicians and media pundits began pressuring Wall Street to distance itself from the climate cause.

Backing these efforts were right-leaning research organizations such as the Heritage Foundation and the Heartland Institute, major conservative funders and operatives including the Koch brothers and Leonard Leo, as well as fossil fuel trade groups including the American Petroleum Institute.

As conservative opposition mounted, financial firms found themselves exposed to unexpected legal liabilities.

In 2022, a U.N.-backed group called Race to Zero, which was partnered with G.F.A.N.Z., updated its expectations about what the participating companies would actually do. Among the changes was new language that pushed financial firms to stop doing business with coal companies.

That raised alarm bells on Wall Street, and conservatives pounced. Just one month after the update, a group of Republican activists gathered at a meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council in Atlanta and discussed how they could target firms participating in G.F.A.N.Z. with antitrust lawsuits.

Then major banks and financial institutions pulled out of Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. Days later, the initiative said it was “suspending activities.” The group now says it will relaunch this year.

Bank of America, which said it would stop financing coal and refrain from financing drilling in the Arctic, walked back those commitments. The company declined to comment.

And BlackRock has slashed its support for social and environmental shareholder proposals.

In a statement, Chris Berger, a BlackRock spokesman, said that the company had built the industry’s largest platform for investing in sustainable business practices and the energy transition, with over $1 trillion in assets under management.

But in Mr. Fink’s most recent letter to investors, there was no mention of climate change. Instead, he emphasized the need for “energy pragmatism.”

“It was a bunch of empty promises from a bunch of Wall Street types who abandoned their pledges when it was no longer convenient,” said a former BlackRock executive who requested anonymity to speak freely about their former employer. “We marched up the hill, and we marched back down it.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/multimedia/17cli-wallstreet-01-fqhl/17cli-wallstreet-01-fqhl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 11:00:12.227949

Outlook for India’s EV Battery Ecosystem India has the right ingredients needed to emerge as a global EV battery manufacturing hub - a large domestic market, strong engineering talent, improving infrastructure, and a clear sustainability imperative.
If we get this right, EV batteries will no longer be a cost barrier.","India’s electric vehicle (EV) story has moved beyond pilots and proofs of concept. By 2030, India aims to have around 80 million EVs on the roads. The Indian EV market is projected to grow to $164.42 billion by 2033, registering a CAGR of 57.23 per cent.

The sector is also undergoing a distinct shift, given the consolidations in two-wheeler EVs and growth in heavy-duty EVs. One fact stands out clearly: the future of India’s EV growth will be shaped more by battery technology and economics.

Batteries account for nearly 40-50 per cent of an EV’s total cost. While vehicle platforms, power electronics, and software are getting increasingly localised, batteries are still largely imported. This makes EV manufacturers vulnerable to currency volatility, geopolitical risks and supply chain disruptions. It also limits the industry’s ability to drive down costs through scale, learning curves and design optimisation.

The Union Budget of India, therefore, has a critical role to play, not merely as a fiscal instrument, but as a signal of long-term intent to localise battery manufacturing, strengthening the value chain to ensure EV affordability. This can only be achieved with battery localisation.

Why Localisation of EV Batteries Matters

Though battery localisation is a strategic lever that shapes cost structures, supply chain resilience, sustainability outcomes, and long-term industrial competitiveness, the immediate impact is on cost. According to various market reports, batteries already account for the largest share of an EV’s bill of materials. Import dependence exposes manufacturers to issues that compound pricing pressures.

Local manufacturing, on the other hand, shortens supply chains and helps absorb these structural costs. It also allows battery chemistries and pack designs to be optimised for Indian conditions, such as high ambient temperatures, commuting through congested urban roads, and intensive daily usage, which are very different to global specifications that are designed for different environments. Localisation is central to energy security and supply chain resilience.

A study states that global battery supply chains remain highly concentrated, particularly across raw materials, processing infrastructure and cell manufacturing capacity. By developing a localised capability, manufacturers can reduce dependence on global hubs, besides gaining control over availability, quality and timelines.

Another report states that regions that succeed in building local battery value chains benefit greatly by having faster innovation cycles, deeper integration between design and manufacturing, and improved productivity at scale. This advantage enables manufacturers to move faster and compete more effectively in global markets.

Sustainability adds another layer, as global regulators and customers demand greater transparency on emissions, traceability, and circularity, localised battery ecosystems make compliance significantly more achievable. Proximity between manufacturing, usage, and end-of-life processes simplifies carbon tracking, enables recycling and second-life applications, and supports the transition toward more circular battery value chains.

India has already taken important steps through production-linked incentives and EV adoption programs, such as the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme. The next phase requires continuity of policy, clarity of long-term intent, and deeper support across the entire value chain, from materials and technology development to recycling infrastructure.

Role of Advanced Materials and Technology in EV Batteries

The focus of battery localisation is often on cell chemistry and giga factories. Yet, some of the most critical performance and safety gains come from materials and technologies that sit between components rather than at their core.

Thermal management is a case in point. As batteries move toward higher energy densities and faster charging, effective heat control becomes central to safety, longevity and charging performance. Industry analyses state that poor thermal regulation accelerates degradation and increases the risk of thermal runaway, especially under fast-charging and high load conditions. Advanced thermal interface materials, gap fillers, and heat-dissipating coatings help maintain optimal operating temperatures, extend battery life, and improve real-world reliability.

Modern battery packs rely on structural adhesives to enable lighter, more compact designs while improving crash performance and vibration resistance. These adhesives also support higher levels of automation and faster assembly, both of which are essential for scaling battery manufacturing. They must perform reliably under thermal cycling, chemical exposure, and long service lives, particularly in demanding operating environments such as India. Protective coatings and safety materials form the third pillar. Advanced coatings now deliver multiple functions in a single layer—electrical insulation, flame retardancy, corrosion resistance, and thermal stability. This multi-functionality improves safety while reducing weight and material complexity.

From an industry perspective, investment in advanced materials is foundational. Materials science enables consistency, scalability, and reliability, all of which will ultimately determine the competitiveness of localised EV battery manufacturing ecosystems.

What Industry Needs from Union Budget 2026

For the battery sector to truly come of age, the upcoming Union Budget should focus on long-term clarity and holistic support. Here is what the industry is looking forward to:

• Policy support across the full battery value chain: While incentives for cell manufacturing are essential, industry voices have consistently emphasised that batteries must be viewed as complete systems rather than isolated components. The automobile and EV ecosystem is seeking a more holistic approach, one that supports not only cells, but also packs, power electronics, materials, and enabling technologies. End-to-end value-chain support is critical to ensure that localisation delivers real cost and performance advantages.

• Incentives for R&D and advanced materials: Innovation in EV batteries is increasingly materials-led. The industry is calling for stronger R&D-linked incentives, simplified compliance, and greater support for startups and applied research. Targeted incentives for advanced materials, such as thermal solutions, adhesives, coatings, and safety materials, can accelerate the development of battery technologies tailored to Indian operating conditions. Structured industry–academia collaboration and pilot-scale validation facilities would further shorten the path from lab to manufacturing.

• Support for scaling manufacturing and infrastructure: Battery manufacturing is capital-intensive and highly sensitive to scale and utilisation. As per reports, auto industry is seeking a capex push, EV-specific support measures, and infrastructure investment to make large-scale manufacturing viable. Support for common infrastructure, financing mechanisms, and predictable demand signals, especially for fleet and public-sector adoption, can help de-risk early scale-up and improve project economics.

• Policy for long-term visibility: Across multiple industry commentaries, one message is consistent: long-term policy certainty matters as much as incentives. Battery investments have long gestation cycles. Clear timelines, stable subsidy structures, aligned regulations, and continuity across budget cycles are essential to unlock sustained private investment and accelerate EV adoption at scale.

Outlook for India’s EV Battery Ecosystem

India has the right ingredients needed to emerge as a global EV battery manufacturing hub - a large domestic market, strong engineering talent, improving infrastructure, and a clear sustainability imperative. What will determine its success is how effectively industry and government can work together to bridge the gap between intent and execution.

Localisation is not an end in itself. It is a means to build affordability, resilience, and competitiveness into the EV ecosystem. Batteries sit at the heart of this transformation, and their success depends on a network of materials, technologies, and capabilities that must evolve in parallel.

As we look at the Union Budget 2026, the opportunity is ripe to create an environment where innovation is rewarded, manufacturing is scalable, and sustainability is embedded by design. If we get this right, EV batteries will no longer be a cost barrier. They will become a strategic advantage that power not just vehicles, but also India’s broader industrial future.",https://static.businessworld.in/EV Battery Car_20260117164216_ogImage_18.jpeg,N,,2026-01-17 06:57:39.880358

are still taxed at 18 per cent, creating a clear cost imbalance for domestic manufacturers,” an industry expert said.
Further, the non-availability of a refund under IDS on ITC attributable to capital goods continues to add to the cost of production, given the capital-intensive nature of the EV industry, he said.
“EVs continue to attract a 5 per cent GST, but recent rate changes for some ICE segments have narrowed the gap.
“Faster adoption in these areas is essential to meeting the 30 per cent EV penetration target by 2030,” he said.","There is a need to correct inverted duty structures for electric vehicle makers, in addition to providing EVs with a clear GST advantage, including for charging infrastructure and services and battery swapping, industry players said ahead of the Union Budget.

While EVs continue to attract 5 per cent GST, the GST rate changes for internal combustion engine (ICE) segments in GST 2.0 have narrowed the price gap, thereby making ICE more attractive from a total cost of ownership perspective.

“GST on EVs and chargers remains at 5 per cent, but critical components such as power electronic components, magnetic cores, etc. are still taxed at 18 per cent, creating a clear cost imbalance for domestic manufacturers,” an industry expert said.

Aligning these GST rates and broadening government schemes, such as PM e-Drive, to also cover charging infrastructure costs would significantly enhance the overall market impact on India’s EV ecosystem, he added.

Expressing similar views, an tax expert said, “EV manufacturers in India continue to face challenges under the inverted duty structure (IDS), as the GST rate on electric vehicles is only 5 per cent, while most key inputs and components attract significantly higher rates.

Further, the non-availability of a refund under IDS on ITC attributable to capital goods continues to add to the cost of production, given the capital-intensive nature of the EV industry, he said.

“Considering the government’s intent to rigorously promote electrification and localised manufacturing of EVs, necessary steps should be taken to create a conducive environment for EV manufacturing in the country,” he noted.

This disparity leads to the accumulation of input tax credit and working capital strain.”

After the overhaul of the GST rate structure from September 22 2025, while the tax rate on parts and components was reduced from 28 per cent to 18 per cent, it provides partial relief to EV manufacturers, as the tax rate disparity persists for critical inputs compared to finished goods, he explained.

Another industry expert said that accelerating EV adoption in India, at a time when ICE vehicles are regaining momentum under GST 2.0 and global trade tensions are rising, requires steady, well-balanced policy support.

“EVs continue to attract a 5 per cent GST, but recent rate changes for some ICE segments have narrowed the gap. It is therefore important to protect a clear GST advantage for EVs, including on charging infrastructure, charging services, and battery swapping, to keep EVs affordable and investments viable,” he added.

He also said demand incentives under PM E-DRIVE should remain focused on segments where electrification delivers the maximum impact on public transport, shared mobility, commercial fleets, and last-mile delivery.

“Faster adoption in these areas is essential to meeting the 30 per cent EV penetration target by 2030,” he said.

On the supply side, he said duty exemptions on critical battery inputs should continue until domestic cell manufacturing under the PLI scheme reaches scale, especially in an uncertain global tariff environment.

Strong state support through demand, supply, and R&D incentives is also essential to sustain EV affordability, innovation, and long-term adoption momentum, he added.

""It's cheap to run an EV if you can charge at home,"" agreed one Redditor.

Driving an EV can save you $1,500 on gas and maintenance each year. EVs also help to improve air quality, as they do not emit any tailpipe pollution.

For homeowners with solar panels, driving an EV is a home run with long-term savings. Charging your EV at home is cheaper and more convenient than charging at public stations. ""I really wish people understood how affordable EVs can be when you charge at home or at a condo,"" the OP wrote.

The oil and gas rig count declined by about 7% in 2025, 5% in 2024, and 20% in 2023 as lower U.S. oil prices prompted energy firms to focus more on boosting shareholder returns and paying down debt rather than increasing output.

The independent exploration and production companies tracked by financial services firm TD Cowen said they planned to keep capital expenditures flat in 2026 after cutting spending by around 4% in 2025.

That compares with roughly flat year-on-year spending in 2024, increases of 27% in 2023, 40% in 2022, and 4% in 2021.

With U.S. spot crude prices expected to fall for a fourth year in a row in 2026, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected crude output would ease from a record 13.61 million barrels per day in 2025 to around 13.59 million bpd in 2026.

On the gas side, the EIA projected output would rise from a record 107.4 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2025 to 108.8 bcfd in 2026 even though spot prices at the Henry Hub benchmark were forecast to ease by about 2% in 2026.

IDEM bill sparks concern,TheStatehouseFile.com,,,,,https://dailyjournal.net/2026/01/16/burdensome-regulation-or-environmental-protection-idem-bill-sparks-concern/,"The bill amends the state’s environmental framework via Title 13, which is Indiana code governing the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM).
IDEM implements both state and federal regulations to protect human health and the environment.
Beyond the basics, IDEM controls air and water pollution, regulates waste management, and enforces legal action against violators.
Many of those who testified in the Senate Environmental Affairs Committee on Monday said they are worried the changes would leave loopholes that would protect industry rather than people.
Another major concern brought up during testimony was the short amount of time given to digest the nearly 200-page bill.","Senate Bill 277, authored by Sen. Rick Niemeyer, R-Lowell, passed its committee Monday 5-3 along party lines, heading to the Senate Appropriations Committee, but testifiers were left questioning if its purpose is economic growth or actual protection of Indiana’s environment.

The bill amends the state’s environmental framework via Title 13, which is Indiana code governing the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM). IDEM implements both state and federal regulations to protect human health and the environment. Beyond the basics, IDEM controls air and water pollution, regulates waste management, and enforces legal action against violators.

SB 277 seeks to make various changes that would impact these regulations. Many of those who testified in the Senate Environmental Affairs Committee on Monday said they are worried the changes would leave loopholes that would protect industry rather than people.

Another major concern brought up during testimony was the short amount of time given to digest the nearly 200-page bill.

“It is nearly unattainable to fully relay the broader implications and effects of its contents in the time we have had before us,” said Desi Rybolt, Indiana Conservation Voters campaign manager.

Similar concerns were shared by David Van Gilder, senior policy and legal director for Hoosier Environmental Council.

“This sprawling bill covers the entirety of Title 13, and thus the Hoosier Environmental Council’s remarks today cannot address all of these issues presented by the 176 pages that dropped on Thursday morning,” he said.

“Burdensome” is a word used eight times throughout the bill. When Sen. Greg Taylor, D-Indianapolis, questioned IDEM Commissioner Clint Woods about the implications of that word, Taylor’s conclusion came back to paperwork.

In March 2025, Gov. Mike Braun released an executive order that tasked the state’s environmental agencies with cutting regulations.

Van Gilder told TheStatehouseFile.com that the Environmental Council has no problem with lawmakers cleaning up the code and updating outdated references. However, in doing so, SB 277 also slips in language that creates an opportunity for IDEM to deny Hoosiers protection, he said—for example, the requirement for state agencies to report back to IDEM would be eliminated.

According to Shannon Anderson, director of advocacy for Earth Charter Indiana, a survey from the beginning of July found that businesses were far more concerned with small changes and clarity that would go back to helping the environment.

“What we saw from that process was that businesses were not burdened by most of our state regulations,” said Anderson. “The letters that I received were overwhelmingly in support of greater protections.”

The original Title 13 consistently uses the word “shall” to require action, but in the proposed bill, “shall” is replaced with “may.”

“The obligation the agency has to protect Hoosiers’ environment and health is limited to the discretion of whoever may be in charge,” Rybolt said.

Van Gilder offered an example of what he thought was an especially dangerous provision in the bill. In the event of substantial threat to human health in the environment, the commissioner now can choose whether or not to take action, he said.

Woods said that IDEM does not comment on pending legislation and directed TSF to his already recorded testimony.

Anderson told The Statehouse File that the big question to take away from the meeting is how it will impact the environment and if IDEM will continue protecting regulations those working with the environment deem crucial.

“One person’s burdensome regulation is another person’s protection,” Anderson said. “Who will ultimately end up paying for this?”",http://dailyjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/135924028_web1_idem-logo-web.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 12:00:56.312212

“Today’s civil nuclear agreement reflects our shared commitment to strengthening European energy security and sovereignty for decades to come.","WASHINGTON—U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico today signed an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) to advance cooperation on Slovakia’s civil nuclear power program. This landmark agreement includes the development of a new, state-owned American 1,200 MWe nuclear unit at the Jaslovské Bohunice Nuclear Power Plant, deepening the U.S.-Slovakia strategic partnership and strengthening European energy security.

The agreement builds on President Trump’s commitment to advancing American energy leadership. A project of this scale is expected to create thousands of American jobs across engineering, advanced manufacturing, construction, nuclear fuel services, and project management, while reinforcing U.S. supply chains and expanding access to global markets for American-made nuclear technology. These efforts lay the foundation for sustained U.S. engagement in Slovakia’s nuclear energy program and support future civil nuclear projects across the region.

It also supports Slovakia’s efforts to diversify its energy supply, strengthen long-term energy security, and integrate advanced American nuclear technology into Central Europe’s energy infrastructure.

“The United States is proud to partner with Slovakia as a trusted ally as we expand cooperation across the energy sector,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright. “Today’s civil nuclear agreement reflects our shared commitment to strengthening European energy security and sovereignty for decades to come. By deploying America’s leading nuclear technology, we are creating thousands of good-paying American jobs, expanding global markets for U.S. nuclear companies, and driving economic growth at home”.

“I see this moment as a significant milestone in our bilateral relations, but also as a clear signal that Slovakia and the United States are united by a common strategic thinking about the future of energy – about its safety, sustainability, and technological maturity,” said the Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic Robert Fico.

The planned nuclear unit represents a multibillion-dollar energy infrastructure investment and one of the largest in Slovakia’s history. The project will support Slovakia’s transition away from reliance on Russian-designed reactors toward a diversified and resilient nuclear fleet, strengthening national energy security through cooperation with trusted Western partners.

Under the IGA, the United States and Slovakia will cooperate across a broad range of civil nuclear activities, including reactor technology, supply chains, safety and security best practices, workforce development, and long-term project planning.

Exacerbating matters is the legacy of the Biden administration’s regulatory assault on America’s coal and natural gas power plants.
But that agenda led to the elimination of U.S. power plants that are now needed more than ever.
Consider that, in 2025 alone, heavy domestic demand and surging exports drove up U.S. natural gas prices by an astounding 70%.
Keeping America’s coal plants online is an overlooked but critically important step in recovering from the Biden administration’s failed energy subtraction.","As America moves into 2026, consumers are looking for relief from an ongoing “affordability crisis.” While prices for some key items have mercifully held steady — or even come down — other costs such as rent, dining out, and hospital visits continue to climb unabated.

U.S. electricity — the one sector that affects all consumer industries in some way — is also racing upward. America’s electricity costs have jumped 32% in just the past five years. That’s a major problem for our new digital economy.

Why are electricity prices rising so rapidly? Soaring power demand — particularly from data centers — is colliding with an electric grid already stretched to the limit. Add to that natural gas price volatility and we can see why America’s families are getting squeezed in an “affordability” crunch.

Exacerbating matters is the legacy of the Biden administration’s regulatory assault on America’s coal and natural gas power plants. The Biden team was singularly focused on reducing carbon emissions. But that agenda led to the elimination of U.S. power plants that are now needed more than ever.

Peak U.S. power demand is expected to jump 166 gigawatts in just the next five years, thanks to the vast needs of artificial intelligence and the data center boom. That’s 15 times the peak electricity needs of New York City.

This is unsustainable without more “dispatchable power” — the reliable, on-demand electricity generation provided by many of the very power plants the Biden administration sought to eliminate.

In parts of the U.S., electricity supplies are now stretched so thin that grid operators and regulators are scrambling to avoid power shortfalls. The nation’s top grid reliability regulator recently called the situation a “five-alarm fire.”

To its credit, the Trump administration is working feverishly to stop the bleeding. Instead of cutting power plants from the grid, the administration is working to rapidly expand the supply of on-demand power in the United States. As a first step, that means retaining the nation’s coal generating capacity. Doing so could bolster grid reliability and ease some of the current price inflation.

We know this works because America’s coal fleet is already being tapped as a buffer against rapidly rising natural gas prices. Because natural gas is the leading fuel for both electricity generation and home heating, even a small change in prices can have a large impact on consumers. Consider that, in 2025 alone, heavy domestic demand and surging exports drove up U.S. natural gas prices by an astounding 70%.

Fortunately for consumers, low-cost coal generation is still an option amidst rising natural gas prices. In 2025, coal-fired electricity generation in creased more than 13% across the nation, easing natural gas demand and electricity costs for tens of millions of Americans.

Keeping America’s coal plants online is an overlooked but critically important step in recovering from the Biden administration’s failed energy subtraction.

The path to lower electricity prices is through abundant, reliable energy. Using policy tools to grow America’s supply of electricity — not tear it down — will be essential to keeping the lights on this winter and taking the bite out of electricity price inflation.

Conclusion and Final Verdict In conclusion, the Canada–China trade relationship is not defined by sweeping agreements but by strategic calibration.","Canada–China trade relations have entered a complex and highly strategic phase. After years of tension marked by tariffs, import restrictions, and diplomatic disputes, both countries are reassessing their economic relationship under shifting global conditions. Rising geopolitical fragmentation, supply chain reconfiguration, and climate-driven industrial policy, particularly in electric vehicles (EVs) and clean technology, have pushed tariffs and market access back to the center of bilateral trade discussions.

In early 2026, Canada and China announced a major reset of their economic relationship, one that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney described as offering “historic gains” for both nations by leveraging mutual strengths across agriculture, energy, technology, and finance. This diplomatic milestone, marked by Carney’s first official visit to China since 2017, signals a deliberate effort to rebuild bilateral trade ties after years of tension and tariff escalations, and comes at a moment of global economic fragmentation and shifting trade alliances. According to the latest Canada export data and China import data, the total value of Canada-China trade reached $85.75 billion in 2024 and $65.40 billion in the first three quarters of 2025.

China is still one of Canada’s largest trading partners, while Canada remains an important supplier of agricultural commodities, natural resources, and increasingly, upstream inputs for clean energy and advanced manufacturing. At the same time, both governments are using tariffs and trade controls more actively to protect domestic industries and advance strategic objectives. This article breaks down the evolving Canada–China tariff landscape with a focus on three critical areas: electric vehicles (EVs), canola and agricultural trade, and broader structural trade dynamics shaping the bilateral relationship for Canada and China trade.

The EV–Canola Tariff Deal Reshaping Canada–China Trade Relations

At the heart of this renewed engagement is a preliminary tariff agreement focused on two previously contentious sectors, electric vehicles (EVs) and canola, with implications that go well beyond those industries. Canada agreed to slash tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, allowing up to 49,000 vehicles to enter at a most-favored-nation rate of 6.1 percent, a dramatic change from the punitive 100 percent tariffs imposed as recently as 2024 under the previous Canadian government. In exchange, China committed to reducing tariffs on Canadian canola seeds and related agricultural goods, including canola meal, lobsters, crabs, and peas. This shift in policy is expected to unlock billions of dollars in export opportunities for Canadian farmers and processors after prolonged market disruptions.

These breakthroughs are positioned by both governments as part of a strategic partnership aimed at sustainable economic cooperation, even as broader geopolitical tensions persist. Canada, long economically intertwined with both the United States and China, now appears intent on diversifying trade relationships and reducing dependency on any single market, a pragmatic response to unpredictable tariff environments and a fracturing global trading system. China, in turn, sees value in stabilizing and expanding trade with a major Western economy at a time when global supply chains and geopolitical alliances are shifting rapidly. This Canada-China tariff deal does not represent a full free trade deal in the conventional sense, but it positions trade policy as a core pillar of a deeper bilateral relationship.

By focusing on sectors central to both countries’ industrial strategies, EV manufacturing for Canada’s clean energy ambitions and canola agriculture for China’s food and industrial demand, the agreement reflects a pragmatic recalibration of Canada–China traderelations. In the sections that follow, we’ll break down this evolving tariff landscape, examine the ramifications for Canada’s EV and agricultural sectors, and explore broader trade implications as both nations navigate a complex global economy.

Canada–China Trade in Context: Size, Structure, & Imbalance

Trade Volume and Direction

Canada–China trade remains large but structurally imbalanced. As of the mid-2020s:

Annual two-way merchandise trade exceeds CAD 100 billion or USD 80 billion.

Canada consistently runs a significant trade deficit, importing far more from China than it exports.

Manufactured goods dominate Chinese exports to Canada.

Primary commodities dominate Canadian exports to China.

China is Canada’s second-largest trading partner after the United States, while Canada is a mid-tier partner for China, reflecting asymmetrical dependence.

What Canada Imports from China

Canada imports from China are heavily concentrated in:

Consumer electronics

Machinery and electrical equipment

Furniture and household goods

Textiles and apparel

Batteries and battery components

These imports are price-competitive and deeply embedded in Canadian retail and manufacturing supply chains.

What Canada Exports to China

Canada exports to China are narrower and more volatile, dominated by:

Canola and canola products

Wheat and barley

Pork and seafood

Wood pulp and lumber

Minerals and energy-related inputs

This structural asymmetry makes tariffs and non-tariff barriers particularly impactful for Canadian exporters.

Canada-China Trade in the Last 10 Years: Yearly Bilateral Trade Data

Tariffs as Policy Tools in Canada–China Relations

Unlike traditional free trade agreements, Canada–China tariff arrangements are selective, reactive, and politically sensitive. Tariffs are often accompanied, or replaced by, regulatory barriers, licensing requirements, and administrative controls. China imposed tariffs on about $2.6 billion worth of Canadian farm and food items, including canola oil and meal, in March in retaliation for Trudeau's tariffs. In August, the country imposed tariffs on canola seed. As a result, China's imports of Canadian commodities fell by 10.4% in 2025. According to Carney, Canada anticipates that China would reduce its canola seed tariffs from the current 84% to a combined rate of roughly 15% by March 1 as part of the new agreement. Canada anticipates the removal of anti-discrimination duties on canola meal, lobsters, crabs, and peas starting on March 1 and continuing until at least the end of the year.

Key characteristics of the Canada–China tariff environment include:

Limited tariff liberalization

High use of non-tariff measures

Sector-specific restrictions rather than economy-wide agreements

Strong linkage between trade actions and political developments

This context is critical when analyzing EVs and canola, where tariffs intersect with strategic and security concerns.

Electric Vehicles: Tariffs, Subsidies, & Strategic Competition

China’s Dominance in the EV Supply Chain

China is the world’s largest producer and exporter of electric vehicles and EV components. It controls significant portions of:

Battery cell manufacturing

Rare earth processing

Cathode and anode materials

EV platform manufacturing

Chinese EV exports have surged globally, raising concerns in importing countries about market distortion driven by state subsidies and scale advantages.

Canada’s EV Strategy

Canada has positioned itself as a clean automotive and battery manufacturing hub, supported by:

Large-scale investment incentives

Domestic battery plants

Critical mineral development

Industrial policy aligned with North American partners

Protecting this emerging ecosystem is a key priority for Canadian trade and tariff policy.

EV Tariffs Between Canada and China

Canada’s Approach to Chinese EV Imports

Canada does not have a comprehensive tariff agreement with China covering EVs. Instead, the EV trade is shaped by:

Existing Most-Favored-Nation tariff rates

Enhanced scrutiny of subsidies and state support

Alignment with broader industrial and national security policies

Canada has signaled a willingness to use:

Anti-dumping investigations

Countervailing duties

Investment screening

These tools function as de facto trade barriers even when formal tariffs remain unchanged.

Why EV Tariffs Matter More Than Volume

Currently, Chinese EVs represent a small share of Canada’s total vehicle market. However, their potential impact is significant due to:

Lower production costs

Rapid technological improvement

Aggressive export pricing

Tariff policy is therefore preemptive, aimed at shaping future market structure rather than reacting to existing volumes.

China’s Tariff and Market Access Policy on EV-Related Inputs

While China exports finished EVs, it imports upstream inputs where Canada is strategically positioned.

Canadian exports relevant to EV supply chains include:

Nickel

Cobalt

Copper

Lithium-related materials

Potash for battery-related chemical processing

China has generally maintained low tariff barriers on these inputs, prioritizing supply security. However, access is increasingly managed through:

Licensing

Long-term contracts

State-linked procurement

Tariffs are less important than strategic control mechanisms, which shape Canada’s export opportunities.

Canola: The Most Politically Sensitive Trade Issue

Importance of Canola to Canada

Canola is one of Canada’s most valuable agricultural exports:

Annual production exceeds 20 million tons

China has historically absorbed 30–40 percent of Canada’s canola exports

The sector supports tens of thousands of farmers and processors

Few Canadian exports are as exposed to China-specific trade policy risk.

China’s Restrictions on Canadian Canola

China’s actions on canola have rarely taken the form of straightforward tariffs. Instead, they have included:

Import suspensions

Tightened quality inspections

Revocation of exporter licenses

Delays at ports

While nominal tariff rates may remain unchanged, these measures function as effective trade barriers.

Economic Impact

During periods of restricted access:

Canadian canola prices have declined domestically

Export volumes have shifted to alternative markets at lower margins

Processing capacity utilization has fluctuated

These impacts demonstrate how non-tariff barriers can be more disruptive than tariffs.

Tariff Agreements vs. Managed Trade in Agriculture

Why Canola Is Treated Differently

Agricultural trade between Canada and China is shaped by:

Food security concerns

Domestic price stabilization

Political leverage

Consumer safety narratives

As a result, China prefers managed trade mechanisms over transparent tariff reductions. Even when tariffs are low, market access is conditional, unpredictable, and highly sensitive to bilateral relations.

Canada’s Response: Diversification and Domestic Processing

Canada has responded to canola trade volatility by:

Expanding domestic crushing capacity

Diversifying export markets in Asia and Europe

Promoting value-added exports such as canola oil and meal

While China remains important, its share of Canadian canola exports has become less dominant than a decade ago. This reduces vulnerability but does not eliminate exposure.

Beyond EVs and Canola: Other Tariff-Sensitive Sectors

Pork and Beef

Canadian meat exports to China are sensitive to:

Health certifications

Disease outbreaks

Inspection regimes

Tariffs are typically low, but access can be quickly curtailed through administrative action.

Seafood

Seafood exports face:

Seasonal demand volatility

Inspection delays

Changing consumer preferences

Tariffs are secondary to regulatory approvals.

Wood Products and Pulp

These products face cyclical demand and are influenced by China’s construction sector. Tariffs remain moderate, but demand swings drive trade volumes more than policy.

The Role of Tariffs in a Fragmenting Global Trade System

Canada and China trade illustrates a broader global trend:

Tariffs are no longer the primary barrier

Strategic controls and industrial policy matter more

Trade agreements are increasingly selective and sector-specific

EVs represent the future of industrial competition, while canola represents legacy commodity dependence. Both are shaped by policy rather than pure market forces.

Strategic Implications for Canadian Businesses

Risk Management Is Essential

Companies engaged in Canada–China trade must plan for:

Policy-driven disruptions

Sudden market access changes

Long-term uncertainty rather than short-term volatility

Sectoral Strategy Matters

EV-related firms should focus on upstream integration and trusted supply chain positioning.

Agricultural exporters should prioritize diversification and value-added processing.

Resource exporters should secure long-term contracts rather than rely on spot markets.

Outlook: What the Canada-China Trade Landscape Looks Like Ahead

What Is Unlikely

A comprehensive free trade agreement

Broad-based tariff elimination

Fully depoliticized trade relations

What Is Likely

Continued selective tariff use

Increased reliance on non-tariff measures

Strategic trade management in sensitive sectors

Deeper scrutiny of EVs, batteries, and clean technology

Trade will remain large but increasingly conditional.

Key Highlights of the Canada–China Trade & Strategic Partnership Agreement

Canada and China have agreed to forge a new strategic partnership aimed at delivering “historic gains” for both countries by leveraging strengths in areas such as agriculture, energy, agri-food, and finance.

This marked the first official visit to China by a Canadian prime minister since 2017, reflecting a reset in bilateral ties after years of diplomatic strain.

A preliminary trade deal was announced that includes tariff reductions on key products:

Canada will allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) to enter at a 6.1% tariff, down from the previous 100% tariffs.

China is expected to lower canola seed tariffs to about 15% by March 1, 2026 (down from 84%).

Additional Canadian agricultural products like canola meal, lobsters, crabs, & peas are expected to be free of discriminatory tariffs at least through the end of the year.

The changes are projected to unlock nearly $3 billion in Canadian export orders, benefiting farmers, fish harvesters, and processors.

China remains Canada’s second-largest export market, and these tariff reductions aim to rejuvenate trade that had been constrained by prior tariff disputes.

The deal also includes commitments to restart high-level economic and financial dialogue, boost two-way trade and investment, and expand cooperation in sectors like green energy, oil, gas, and clean technologies.

Part of the wider partnership includes discussions on visa-free travel for Canadians to China and enhancements in energy grid cooperation and LNG exports to Asia.

The agreement comes amid broader geopolitical dynamics as Canada seeks to diversify trade away from heavy reliance on the U.S. market, especially in the context of recent U.S. tariffs.

Conclusion and Final Verdict

In conclusion, the Canada–China trade relationship is not defined by sweeping agreements but by strategic calibration. Electric vehicles represent the future of industrial competition, where tariffs function as defensive tools. Canola represents legacy dependence, where market access is shaped more by politics and regulation than by tariff schedules. Understanding this dynamic is critical for policymakers, businesses, and investors. Canada and China trade is no longer about maximizing volume; it is about managing risk, protecting strategic sectors, and navigating an increasingly fragmented global trade system.

In this environment, tariffs are only one piece of the puzzle. The real story lies in how trade policy, industrial strategy, and geopolitics intersect to shape who trades, what they trade, and on what terms.",https://www.tradeimex.in/blogs/uploads/images/202601/img_w500_696b56bf663848-76682349.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 06:57:46.872218

That has had competitors concerned even before Canada this week agreed to cut its tariffs on Chinese EVs in exchange for concessions on Canadian farm products.

Experts now say an easier path into Canada could be a big boost for Chinese carmakers looking to dominate the global market — particularly as their domestic market weakens. That poses a threat to other auto manufacturers, particularly American companies.

U.S. officials acknowledged that in remarks at an assembly plant for Jeep-maker Stellantis in Toledo, Ohio on Friday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Chinese Communist Party invests in its auto industry to “control this industry.”

“Why? They want to take over the auto industry. They want to take away these jobs,” Duffy said. As far as the Canadian trade deal, he added: “They will live to regret the day they partner with China and bring in their vehicles.”

Others say the shift is inevitable.

“This is telling us that Chinese automakers continue to be really popular, and are doing better and better, and not just something that’s sold in global markets that are more marginal or less important to U.S. automakers,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

What makes Chinese vehicles stand out?

Chinese-made vehicles are high-quality, stylish and inexpensive, experts say.

“It’s clear that the vehicles made by Chinese brands come at a very competitive cost, but are also technologically quite desirable,” Mazzocco said. “They tend to be connected vehicles, so they have a lot of additional software capabilities that consumers seem to like. But the price point and the competitiveness are really big selling points.”

These vehicles can cost as little as $10,000 to $20,000; in the U.S., new vehicles are running close to $50,000 on average, and EVs even more so.

Chinese companies also have unique advantages as far as auto manufacturing and production, efficiency and making vehicles lighter, which helps extend an electrified vehicle's driving range.

“They’ve found a way to make small and mid-sized cars — cars that people want — at a reasonable price,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. ""These are the segments where GM and Ford and almost everybody else have abandoned.”

Many automakers have discontinued smaller vehicles in favor of higher-margin, large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that are far more profitable.

So why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?

Much of the global auto market is electrifying, an ideal opportunity for advanced Chinese automakers to capitalize on. China saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles in 2025, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week, and Europe saw a 33% increase.

Meanwhile, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year. As the rest of the world advances, U.S. automakers have weakened their once-ambitious, multibillion dollar electrification plans, instead opting for more efficient hybrid electric and gasoline vehicles amid the Trump administration's shift away from EV-friendly policy.

That shift threatens U.S. automakers' competitive edge in the coming years. As is, Tesla lost its crown as the world's bestselling electric vehicle maker last year, delivering only 1.64 million vehicles in 2025 to Chinese rival BYD's 2.26 million.

Trump administration policy slashing emissions rules at a time when Chinese companies are advancing quickly has experts worried for the future of American car manufacturers.

Chinese automakers will have to meet standards required for the Canadian auto market for the latest trade arrangement to be successful — standards that are similar to those in the U.S. — which is likely to incentivize Chinese auto manufacturing investment in Canada.

They'll also have to establish which segment of the market they are targeting there: Higher-end vehicles, or less-expensive ones that sell at higher volumes.

Regardless, “It brings it home to what is needed to compete globally,” said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at AlixPartners. The firm predicts Chinese brands will account for 30% of the global market by 2030.

“They’ve already started in Europe. They started in South America. Now Mexico and Canada,"" Wakefield said. American carmakers ""don’t want to end up as a Brazil with your ethanol-based cars that aren’t sellable anywhere else in the world and ... like Britain or Australia that used to matter in the auto world, and no longer really matter.”

Why have others sought to regulate Chinese EV-makers’ expansion?

Countries have attempted to regulate Chinese EVs from entering their markets for several reasons.

“China has become this overwhelming machine making inexpensive vehicles. And the fear is that if you give them an inch, they’re going to take a mile,” Fiorani said. “The other issue is technology. These vehicles are data centers... and the idea that a state-owned company in China could have access to where a high portion of drivers are going gives them leverage for all kinds of outlets.”

The European Union hiked tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, though the two have been resolving that at the start of this year.

In 2024, former President Joe Biden set a 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars. Canada matched that import tax on the vehicles until this week. And even with an annual import cap, Canada cutting its tariffs this week means those companies are another step closer to U.S. soil. The Mexican auto market has welcomed Chinese EVs, with massive growth last year.

“The advance of Chinese manufacturers is inevitable. It will happen eventually. Everybody is negotiating to put up the roadblocks to figure out: What data is being processed, how much market share you’re going to allow Chinese manufacturers to have?"" Fiorani added.

""There are a lot of guardrails that have to be put up, but eventually they’re going to make their way into all Western markets.”

Expanding on this, Palmer says that these students have “different ways of engagement” and how they spend time.
To meet this moment, Muashsher also noted, “It’s not just about creating great products and great service.
Looking ahead, the panel emphasized the growing need to blend technical skills with human‑centered, transferable skills, especially as industry change accelerates.
With drivers keeping their cars longer and new demands emerging from e‑drive systems and advanced diagnostics, new skill sets will be essential.","Throughout the panel discussion, a consistent theme emerged: the importance of partnerships and the shared desire for what’s best for students. As skills rapidly evolve to prepare students for the jobs of the future, Sawyer stressed the importance of partnerships with employers to understand their needs, saying, “It’s our responsibility to put the programs together to help address those needs.”

Sawyer also mentioned the importance of partnerships with K-12 partners and universities because “for those skills that require advanced degrees, we need to provide a conduit to help those students move on to a successful university.”

When Valvoline launched its Aspiring Mechanics Program (AMP), Muashsher said the company relied on strong partnerships and meaningful connections to create immersive experiences and real‑world demonstrations. One specific example included Valvoline leveraging its partnership with Formula 1 and taking students from a school they work with in Mexico to the Mexico Grand Prix, where they connected with engineers and technicians to better understand career paths beyond their initial perceptions.

No matter if they’re in Mexico or back home in Michigan, there are different ways to engage K-12 students, according to the panel, and there is no single solution. Expanding on this, Palmer says that these students have “different ways of engagement” and how they spend time.

“We need to engage them not only when they’re right for making those decisions, but in ways that we are reaching them and engaging them in where they’re living on a day-to-day basis, whether that’s online or through social media, those types of things,” Palmer said.

The panel also touched on how some students question the value of the educational pipeline, often thinking it’s simply about getting a two- or four-year degree. However, Sawyer advocates for a broader range of postsecondary options, such as union skilled trades programs, emphasizing that, at the end of the day, “It’s about developing those skills and making them marketable.”

For K–12 students, it’s important to understand what all those options actually are, Palmer explains. Returning to the idea that many students receive most of their information through their phones, this can become a real advantage — an accessible way to reach them where they already are.

Still, because they can’t always rely on getting this guidance at home or from a counselor, Palmer said, “we have to be much more hands‑on in the weeds of it all,” by using those digital touchpoints to spark curiosity and ultimately encourage students to explore what’s happening inside the plants to then get them physically in the plants.

When managing the priorities of today’s talent landscape, Muashsher said that “we have to prioritize based on the impact that we can make.” He emphasized that partnerships operate as a two‑way street: one partner can share the feedback they need, enabling the other to provide the right resources for mutual success.

Many industry leaders recognize that the market is shifting. To meet this moment, Muashsher also noted, “It’s not just about creating great products and great service. It’s about giving back and getting involved in our own industry.”

For Valvoline, long-time collaboration with mechanics has kept these changes front and center, reinforcing the need to continually develop solutions and programs that meet technicians’ evolving needs. From the community college perspective, the challenge lies in innovation that doesn’t outpace practicality, according to Sawyer.

“We want to be on the cutting edge, not the bleeding edge,” Sawyer said. “We have to have opportunities for our students when they complete.” That means equipping learners with skills and tools that employers actually use, rather than experimental ones that may fade quickly.

To support this, Macomb Community College regularly meets with companies considering Macomb County, showing how strong partnerships help shape a responsive workforce pipeline.

Looking ahead, the panel emphasized the growing need to blend technical skills with human‑centered, transferable skills, especially as industry change accelerates. Muashsher also explained that vehicle maintenance services will shift rapidly. With drivers keeping their cars longer and new demands emerging from e‑drive systems and advanced diagnostics, new skill sets will be essential.

“What comes next is making sure we’re making the significant investments to give both the timely resources and the access to continue to enable the additional credentialing that’s going to be required to be successful,” Muashsher said.",https://michauto.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-Detroit-Auto-Show-feature_4.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 11:01:20.853381

The policy, announced by China’s finance ministry, will lower VAT export rebates from 9% to 6% starting April 2026 and phase them out entirely by January 1, 2027. This move has already impacted lithium prices and reshaped market sentiment. Here are five critical takeaways from this announcement, with insights from Reuters.

1. Lithium prices surge amid anticipation of higher demand

The announcement has caused a sharp increase in lithium prices, reflecting market expectations of higher near-term demand. On Monday, the most-active lithium carbonate contract on the Guangzhou Futures Exchange jumped 9%, closing at 156,060 yuan ($21,650) per metric ton; the highest level since November 2023. Reuters reported, “Lithium prices soared in China on Monday after Beijing said it would roll back value-added tax export rebates, as investors bet the move would spur front-loaded export demand.” Analysts believe this surge is driven by expectations of faster battery production and exports before the rebate rollback.

2. Short-term winners: Chinese battery giants

Chinese battery manufacturers like CATL and BYD are poised to benefit from the policy in the short term. The anticipated rush to export batteries before the rebates disappear could boost production volumes and revenues. Reuters highlighted that “investors and analysts expect exporters to accelerate overseas shipments ahead of the tax rollback.” CATL, the world’s largest battery producer, is already navigating supply chain disruptions, including the halt of production at its Jianxiawo mine. This policy shift provides an opportunity for Chinese manufacturers to capitalize on higher export demand. As Orient Securities noted, “The policy is expected to lift battery output in the near term, while underscoring Beijing’s longer-term push to curb excessive involution-style competition.”

3. Global lithium producers gain strategic importance

The VAT rollback is expected to tighten global battery economics, making non-Chinese lithium supply more valuable. Lithium producers such as Albemarle, Lithium Americas, and Rio Tinto stand to benefit from firmer price expectations and increased demand. Reuters reported that “stronger near-term battery output could boost lithium demand sentiment, while reduced subsidies over time make non-Chinese lithium supply more strategically valuable.” Albemarle, a leading lithium supplier, is expanding its conversion capacity to meet growing demand for battery-grade lithium. Lithium Americas’ Thacker Pass project in Nevada, which holds the largest known lithium resource in the U.S., is set to produce up to 40,000 tons of lithium carbonate annually. Rio Tinto’s acquisition of Arcadium Lithium further solidifies its position as a major player, with plans to produce over 200,000 tons of lithium carbonate equivalent per year by 2028.

4. EV makers face rising costs

According to Reuters and Zacks Investment Research, while miners and battery producers benefit, electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers reliant on Chinese batteries may face margin pressure. Tesla and Rivian are particularly vulnerable to rising battery costs. Reuters noted that EV makers reliant on Chinese batteries could face rising costs and margin pressure. Tesla, already grappling with slower EV demand growth and aggressive price competition, may see its cost structure strained further. Rivian, still scaling operations and working toward profitability, lacks Tesla’s scale and vertical integration, making it more sensitive to cost inflation. Higher battery costs could slow Rivian’s profitability trajectory and complicate execution, as analysts have pointed out.

5. Long-term industry implications

China’s policy shift signals a broader effort to curb overcapacity and promote rational pricing in the battery industry. While the short-term rush to export may create volatility, the eventual elimination of rebates could lead to more balanced competition globally. South Korean and Japanese battery manufacturers, long critical of Chinese subsidies, may regain market share in the US and Europe. Reduced subsidies are expected to push the industry toward more rational pricing and elevate the strategic importance of non-Chinese lithium supply, reshaping the global supply chain.

GenWealth expands

presence in Conway

Arkansas-based financial firm GenWealth Financial Advisors has moved into a 4,000-square-foot office on Markham Street in Conway, expanding its presence in the state's eighth-largest city, the financial advisor said Friday.

The addition is meant to serve the firm's growing client base and includes four meeting rooms and a conference room that will double the Conway team's meeting capacity.

The office space sits on what was formerly a vacant lot, according to Faulkner County property records. The land was bought by Capital Land Development LLC in 2025.

GenWealth said it will host a ribbon cutting ceremony for the new office on Jan. 20. The firm, which has locations in north Louisiana and central and western Arkansas, has had an office in Conway since 2020. The firm broke ground on a 6,000-square-foot office in Bryant in 2024.

The firm has 48 employees and serves over 4,500 clients with more than $1 billion in assets under management, according to the firm's website.

Scenarios for PJM Money Problems Versus Physical Problems As this issue unfurls in new or modified PJM rules, a few distinct futures could emerge.
When that generation eventually turns on, it bids into the PJM market with its construction costs already covered.
As is usually the case in PJM, when a major market intervention suppresses price signals for existing thermal assets, it drags existing renewables down with it.
Ultimately, this intervention privatizes the cost of reliability, a move that stands in sharp contrast to the unitary market design PJM has administered to date.","Earlier today, the White House National Energy Dominance Council and partnering agencies released a “Statement of Principles Regarding PJM.” These principles come out of “an agreement with governors across the Mid-Atlantic region to urge PJM to make electricity more affordable for residential customers and strengthen grid reliability by building more than $15 billion of reliable baseload power generation.”

The Statement of Principles outlines a radical departure from market norms as follows:

A new reliability backstop auction that will guarantee 15-year price certainty, a stark contrast to the market’s traditional short-term signals.

To protect ratepayers, the plan extends the existing price cap on existing generation for two more auctions, effectively freezing scarcity revenues for the legacy fleet.

Costs for the new plants will be allocated 100 percent to new data centers—“whether they show up and use the power or not”—unless they can prove they have self-procured capacity or have agreed to be curtailable.

The Trump administration explicitly directs PJM to bypass its own stakeholder process (“no further CIFP processes are necessary”) and mandates that interconnection studies be completed in “150 days or less.”

A proposal to auction 15-year generation contracts will do more than just fund new power plants. It will fundamentally alter who bears the risk of building out the American grid and keeping current power plants (thermal and non-thermal) open, creating a new, paradoxical reality for the technology sector: Participants are potentially “short” on power today, but “long” on liability tomorrow.

This shift moves regional transmission organizations (RTOs) into uncharted territory. RTO markets were designed to facilitate bilateral contracting and unitary pricing, not to host separate government-mandated procurements for a specific asset class. Whether that is the intent of the proposal, and what PJM files, is yet to be seen.

The policy implication is clear though: By carving out a dedicated market for certain loads while leaving the rest of the grid in the legacy auction, this proposal breaks the unitary market structure. On first read, the reality appears to be a hybrid: financially segregated but physically integrated. The data center might pay the mortgage (the 15-year contract), but the electrons flow into the shared grid. This distinction will be vital to understand the merits of the rules to come from PJM; it determines whether this intervention actually lowers prices for consumers—via a “denominator effect,” discussed below.

Scenarios for PJM Money Problems Versus Physical Problems

As this issue unfurls in new or modified PJM rules, a few distinct futures could emerge.

In one scenario, the definition of “eligibility” could dictate: By explicitly listing self-procured capacity and curtailment as the only off-ramps, these principles create an immediate, existential financial incentive for large loads to engineer their way out of the auction. Building your own plants could be a path out of the cost allocation; an exemption for “curtailable” load puts pressure on PJM to enact pathways to validate and count on that behavior for economics and reliability.

Critically, a 15-year contract could solve the money problem, but it does not fix the physical problem. While the principles mandate that interconnection studies be completed in “150 days or less,” industry insiders note that a memo cannot manufacture a transformer or staff a power study team overnight. This is a path for creating a financial instrument to pay for infrastructure that may still take years to physically connect.

Further, a structural risk looms in either scenario. Whether this commissioned generation is “siphoned” for large loads or allocated into the shared PJM loads pool, the influx of mandated supply—without a guaranteed match in net demand—creates a signal of artificial oversupply. Paradoxically, this could depress prices enough to motivate the retirement of the very baseload power the policy intends to preserve.

Denominator Effects for Consumer Electricity Rates

If the intent of the policy comes into being—the potential to protect residential retail ratepayers from steep increases due to data center demand—the proposed auction could operate like a capital injection: It forces data centers to cover the capital cost of these new plants upfront. When that generation eventually turns on, it bids into the PJM market with its construction costs already covered. It only needs to recover its fuel and operations. The result would be to inject massive amounts of supply that can bid at marginal cost. Assuming all other factors remain equal, this suppresses the wholesale price of energy for everyone.

Rates are assessed based on the costs of building, maintaining, and operating the grid. If some of those costs are already being absorbed by data center developers, then there is more power for everyone without increased costs, and rates can fall. This isn’t magic—it’s simply the math of the denominator effect (more energy hours to pay for a relatively fixed or new expense-insulated delivery infrastructure cost = lower rates for all impacted classes who can benefit).

This will not, however, fully insulate ratepayers. Increasing rates are not usually driven by the cost of adding generation. It’s the wires. If a utility builds a $50 million substation for a data center and spreads that cost to the legacy rate base, residential bills can rise despite low-cost generation. This is where state regulators must hold the line, with tariffs that require large data centers to pay demand charges covering specific infrastructure costs (including substations). Regulators can look to models like the Rappahannock Electric Cooperative’s Large Power-Dedicated Facilities tariff, which bills based on the installed capacity of the delivery infrastructure, and incentivize loads to build private firming solutions that bring flexibility to the utility. The incentive has an effect of derisking overbuild of the utility infrastructure The policy announcement today from the White House seems similar in intent: Pay for the power plant capital costs, whether the energy hours are used or not.

Considerations for Large Loads Asset Class Fracturing

Even if the new math of PJM protects the residential consumer, the pain within the technology sector is expected to be uneven, as will the pain to be distributed between legacy generation assets (thermal and renewable) and new construction under contract. This is largely true of existing proposals in PJM’s stakeholder processes: at least one such proposal posits market-oriented reforms consisting of a reliability backstop mechanism with multiyear price certainty (from Amazon, Calpine, Constellation, Google, Microsoft, Talen).

Early reactions to the announcements portend that this approach—a contract-specific auction—effectively has the economic impact of fracturing the electricity ratepayer asset class into at least three tiers while at least solving some of the problems of bringing enough capacity into the market to support gigawatts of load. Impacts on these classes, at least from the principles released today, also depend on the work that states will do to effectuate load-serving entity cost allocation.

Residential customers could remain shielded, provided state regulators enforce the strict tariffs described above and other theoretical wins become reality, including distributed energy and grid utilization programs that support lowering the average cost of utility operations. They get the increased reliability of a robust grid without the increased costs. Tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are the “long capital” class. They are the most likely candidates who could possess the balance sheets to absorb a 15-year infrastructure liability, and if the rules of such a program or other PJM programs going forward allow it, the engineering depth to execute complex private firm delivery strategies needed to opt out (they can hedge the risk or pass it downstream).

The likely casualties of this new regime may include specialized infrastructure providers, co-location firms, and conventional industrial loads that lack the balance sheet of a hyperscaler. The administration’s Statement of Principles explicitly demands that new loads provide “credit/collateral support” to be counted, a hurdle that favors the giants. Often locked into fixed-price contracts with tenants, these “middle-class” providers lack the credit depth to absorb a 15-year liability and the physical footprint to execute the “self-procure or curtail” opt-outs envisioned by the new rules. For them, the choice between a massive balance sheet liability and a regulatory blockade represents an existential margin squeeze.

The other likely casualty to insure against, is price signals for existing PJM generators, and their contracted status with loads that cannot benefit from the new policy. The principles document extends the existing price collar for two more auctions, effectively capping scarcity revenues for the legacy fleet just as reliability value is rising. Perhaps most concerning to existing resources is a future where existing generators face a “dumping” risk. If the 7.5 GW of new mandated capacity is built but not fully utilized by data centers, that excess power flows onto the grid at zero marginal cost. This artificial oversupply creates a price-suppressive signal that could ironically force the retirement of the very baseload units the policy claims to value. As is usually the case in PJM, when a major market intervention suppresses price signals for existing thermal assets, it drags existing renewables down with it. By capping capacity revenues and potentially flooding the energy market with subsidized “must-run” baseload, the policy erodes the investment case for all legacy generation, not just the coal and gas plants it aims to protect.

Ultimately, this intervention privatizes the cost of reliability, a move that stands in sharp contrast to the unitary market design PJM has administered to date. While the principles document calls for a future “Return to Market Fundamentals” by 2027, the precedent from the proposed approach is one in which reliability procurement is no longer for and from a shared pool of buyers and sellers; PJM’s work over the next several months will be to develop a segmented product that is effectively procured by multi-state mandate and billed to specific asset classes. Market stakeholders invested in future-proofing retail and wholesale power deliverability solutions should find themselves even more invested than before in innovating solutions for their large and small customers.

FDA Finds “Significant Data Gaps” For PFAS Used In Cosmetic Products

As required under the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act of 2022 (MoCRA), on December 29, 2025, FDA published a Report on the Use of PFAS in Cosmetic Products and Associated Risks. The scope of the report is limited to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) intentionally added to cosmetic products as ingredients and does not include PFAS that may be present in the final product as contaminants. According to the report, “[c]ertain PFAS are intentionally added as ingredients to some cosmetic products, such as lipsticks, eyeshadows, moisturizers, nail polish and enamel, blushers and rouges, and cleansers.” FDA’s analysis found that 51 PFAS are intentionally added to 1,744 cosmetic products sold in the United States as of August 31, 2024. According to FDA, these products represent 0.41 percent of the total products registered as of August 2024. FDA prioritized the 25 PFAS most often used for a safety review. FDA states that for 19 of the PFAS, it could not definitively determine the safety due to the lack of critical toxicological data. FDA concluded that five PFAS were considered to pose low safety concerns in cosmetic products under intended use conditions. FDA identified one PFAS as having a potential safety concern when used in body lotion at the highest use level (i.e., the concentration of an ingredient in a final product). More information is available in our January 6, 2026, blog item.

Cracks In The Enamel: The Ascendance Of Federal And State Action To Restrict Fluoride Use

Fluoride, well-known for its anticavity properties, has seen a growing number of state and federal initiatives seeking to limit or prohibit various uses of the substance. Federal agency heads, as well as top state officials, have expressed a strong interest in “taking action” against existing fluoride use in public drinking water and ingestible drug products. Our December 16, 2025, memorandum covers the following topics:

Evolution of Fluoride Regulation, Past to Present;

Fluoride in 2025;

Federal Action; and

State Actions.

Given the Administration’s push for more stringent fluoride regulations, pending review of fluoride under TSCA, and the apparent gradual decline in public support of the chemical, facilities using fluoride in industrial processing or manufacturing products containing fluoride may find themselves caught in the net of state or federal initiatives. Currently, state and federal discussions around fluoride do not appear to contemplate new regulations or restrictions for industrial sources. More information on the federal and state actions is available in our memorandum.

OSHA Extends HCS Compliance Dates

OSHA published a final rule on January 15, 2026, extending the compliance dates in its HCS (29 C.F.R. Section 1910.1200), published in the Federal Register on May 20, 2024 (89 Fed. Reg. 44144), by four months. 91 Fed. Reg. 1695. The May 2024 final rule adopts a tiered approach to compliance and includes two sets of compliance dates for chemical manufacturers, importers, and distributors evaluating substances and mixtures. The initial compliance deadline in Section 1910.1200(j)(2)(i) of January 19, 2026, is imminent. According to OSHA, members of the regulated community asked for additional guidance to comply with the updated HCS. Although OSHA has been working to issue final guidance about the updated HCS for both the regulated community and agency personnel, it states that it has not been able to complete these documents with sufficient time before the initial compliance date. OSHA determined that it is necessary to extend the initial compliance date by four months to allow it time to publish the necessary guidance materials and for the regulated community to review those materials before the revised provisions take effect. To maintain the tiered approach to compliance adopted in the final rule, OSHA is also extending each of the subsequent compliance dates in paragraph (j)(2)(ii) and (j)(3) by four months. The compliance date in Section 1910.1200(j)(2)(i) is extended from January 19, 2026, until May 19, 2026; the compliance date in Section 1910.1200(j)(2)(ii) is extended from July 20, 2026, to November 20, 2026; the compliance date in Section 1910.1200(j)(3)(i) is extended from July 19, 2027, to November 19, 2027; and the compliance date in Section 1910.1200(j)(3)(ii) is extended from January 19, 2028, to May 19, 2028. The final rule was effective January 15, 2026. More information on the 2024 final rule is available in our May 30, 2024, memorandum.

JOHN, Associated Press",,,,,https://www.wane.com/news/business/ap-business/ap-chinese-evs-are-making-inroads-in-north-america-that-worries-industry-experts/,"DETROIT (AP) — Chinese automakers have been making inroads around the world with growing sales of their high-tech, stylish and affordable electric vehicles.
So why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?
Much of the global auto market is electrifying, an ideal opportunity for advanced Chinese automakers to capitalize on.

The Mexican auto market has welcomed Chinese EVs, with massive growth last year.","DETROIT (AP) — Chinese automakers have been making inroads around the world with growing sales of their high-tech, stylish and affordable electric vehicles. That has had competitors concerned even before Canada this week agreed to cut its tariffs on Chinese EVs in exchange for concessions on Canadian farm products.

Experts now say an easier path into Canada could be a big boost for Chinese carmakers looking to dominate the global market — particularly as their domestic market weakens. That poses a threat to other auto manufacturers, particularly American companies.

U.S. officials acknowledged that in remarks at an assembly plant for Jeep-maker Stellantis in Toledo, Ohio on Friday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Chinese Communist Party invests in its auto industry to “control this industry.”

“Why? They want to take over the auto industry. They want to take away these jobs,” Duffy said. As far as the Canadian trade deal, he added: “They will live to regret the day they partner with China and bring in their vehicles.”

Others say the shift is inevitable.

“This is telling us that Chinese automakers continue to be really popular, and are doing better and better, and not just something that’s sold in global markets that are more marginal or less important to U.S. automakers,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

What makes Chinese vehicles stand out?

Chinese-made vehicles are high-quality, stylish and inexpensive, experts say.

“It’s clear that the vehicles made by Chinese brands come at a very competitive cost, but are also technologically quite desirable,” Mazzocco said. “They tend to be connected vehicles, so they have a lot of additional software capabilities that consumers seem to like. But the price point and the competitiveness are really big selling points.”

These vehicles can cost as little as $10,000 to $20,000; in the U.S., new vehicles are running close to $50,000 on average, and EVs even more so.

Chinese companies also have unique advantages as far as auto manufacturing and production, efficiency and making vehicles lighter, which helps extend an electrified vehicle’s driving range.

“They’ve found a way to make small and mid-sized cars — cars that people want — at a reasonable price,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “These are the segments where GM and Ford and almost everybody else have abandoned.”

Many automakers have discontinued smaller vehicles in favor of higher-margin, large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that are far more profitable.

So why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?

Much of the global auto market is electrifying, an ideal opportunity for advanced Chinese automakers to capitalize on. China saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles in 2025, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week, and Europe saw a 33% increase.

Meanwhile, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year. As the rest of the world advances, U.S. automakers have weakened their once-ambitious, multibillion dollar electrification plans, instead opting for more efficient hybrid electric and gasoline vehicles amid the Trump administration’s shift away from EV-friendly policy.

That shift threatens U.S. automakers’ competitive edge in the coming years. As is, Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker last year, delivering only 1.64 million vehicles in 2025 to Chinese rival BYD’s 2.26 million.

Trump administration policy slashing emissions rules at a time when Chinese companies are advancing quickly has experts worried for the future of American car manufacturers.

Chinese automakers will have to meet standards required for the Canadian auto market for the latest trade arrangement to be successful — standards that are similar to those in the U.S. — which is likely to incentivize Chinese auto manufacturing investment in Canada.

They’ll also have to establish which segment of the market they are targeting there: Higher-end vehicles, or less-expensive ones that sell at higher volumes.

Regardless, “It brings it home to what is needed to compete globally,” said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at AlixPartners. The firm predicts Chinese brands will account for 30% of the global market by 2030.

“They’ve already started in Europe. They started in South America. Now Mexico and Canada,” Wakefield said. American carmakers “don’t want to end up as a Brazil with your ethanol-based cars that aren’t sellable anywhere else in the world and … like Britain or Australia that used to matter in the auto world, and no longer really matter.”

Why have others sought to regulate Chinese EV-makers’ expansion?

Countries have attempted to regulate Chinese EVs from entering their markets for several reasons.

“China has become this overwhelming machine making inexpensive vehicles. And the fear is that if you give them an inch, they’re going to take a mile,” Fiorani said. “The other issue is technology. These vehicles are data centers… and the idea that a state-owned company in China could have access to where a high portion of drivers are going gives them leverage for all kinds of outlets.”

The European Union hiked tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, though the two have been resolving that at the start of this year.

In 2024, former President Joe Biden set a 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars. Canada matched that import tax on the vehicles until this week. And even with an annual import cap, Canada cutting its tariffs this week means those companies are another step closer to U.S. soil. The Mexican auto market has welcomed Chinese EVs, with massive growth last year.

“The advance of Chinese manufacturers is inevitable. It will happen eventually. Everybody is negotiating to put up the roadblocks to figure out: What data is being processed, how much market share you’re going to allow Chinese manufacturers to have?” Fiorani added.

“There are a lot of guardrails that have to be put up, but eventually they’re going to make their way into all Western markets.”

The policy reverses a 100% additional duty imposed in 2024 and restores tariff levels that existed before bilateral trade frictions, lowering costs for consumers while reopening the door to industrial cooperation with China.

Speaking at a China–Canada trade event in Beijing, Carney said the quota would expand over time and would deliver tangible benefits to Canadians. He said cooperation with China was essential if Canada wanted to build a competitive domestic electric vehicle industry and secure resilient supply chains.

The previous tariff regime was introduced in August 2024 under former prime minister Justin Trudeau, when Canada imposed a 100% duty on Chinese EVs and a 25% tariff on Chinese steel and aluminum. Those measures took effect on October 1, 2024, and were closely aligned with U.S. trade policy at the time.

China responded by launching an anti-discrimination investigation and imposing countermeasures on Canadian agricultural products, including canola, contributing to a sharp deterioration in bilateral relations.

Under the revised framework, Chinese EVs imported within the 49,000-unit quota will face a 6.1% MFN tariff. The government did not specify the tariff rate for imports exceeding the quota or the precise implementation date, though the quota is expected to grow annually.

China exported 41,678 electric vehicles to Canada in 2023, with more than 80% produced at Tesla’s Shanghai plant. Carney said replacing blanket tariffs with a quota system would reduce vehicle purchase costs and allow bilateral cooperation to resume.

He described China as a global leader in electric vehicles, citing cost efficiency, energy performance, and innovation. He said Canada must learn from China’s experience and collaborate on supply chains rather than rely on trade barriers.

During meetings on January 16, leaders from both countries reaffirmed the principles guiding China–Canada relations. Canada reiterated its commitment to the one-China policy, and both sides pledged to provide fair and open business environments for companies.

The two governments endorsed the China–Canada Economic and Trade Cooperation Roadmap and agreed to advance cooperation through existing trade mechanisms. Energy cooperation featured prominently, with agreements to deepen collaboration in clean energy while expanding ties in oil and natural gas development.

Carney said the revised trade framework could attract large-scale Chinese investment into Canada’s automotive and energy sectors over the next three years, supporting job creation and Canada’s transition toward net-zero emissions.

Agriculture was another focus. Carney said China is expected to reduce tariffs on Canadian canola to about 15% by March 2026 and lift countermeasures on canola meal, lobster, crab, and peas from March through at least year-end. He said the changes could unlock nearly USD 3 billion in export opportunities.

He also said China would introduce visa-free entry for Canadian citizens, though this had not been formally confirmed by Chinese authorities at the time.

Addressing geopolitical questions, Carney said Canada and China still had differences but had established a more predictable and stable dialogue. He said recent engagement with China had delivered clearer economic outcomes, even as Canada maintained a broader relationship with the United States.

Canadian officials accompanying Carney signed agreements covering oil, natural gas, uranium, and renewable energy technologies, and held discussions with Chinese battery manufacturer CATL, which has already participated in multiple grid-scale energy storage projects in Ontario.

Industry Minister Mélanie Joly said Canada remained open to Chinese investment in renewable energy and battery manufacturing, including the possibility of local EV battery production.

The visit can be described as a political reset that signals intent rather than immediate economic gains, leaving open how quickly trade and investment flows will recover under Canada’s new China policy.",https://d4lckxzvtz1ll.cloudfront.net/XPENG%20MONA%20M03%20V4-1768613334098.webp,N,,2026-01-17 06:57:58.429362

As a result, we’re going to save consumers in the PJM grid – 65 million Americans – an additional $27 billion over the next several years.
Pennsylvania is the second largest energy producer in the entire country, and I’m an all-of-the-above energy Governor.","Washington, D.C. – Today, Governor Josh Shapiro signed a Statement of Principles alongside a bipartisan group of PJM governors, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum to extend Pennsylvania’s PJM price cap and protect consumers from rising electricity costs.

The agreement advances reforms to build more energy faster while keeping costs down and extends the price cap Governor Shapiro secured after suing PJM for two additional capacity auctions — a move expected to save consumers up to $27 billion and prevent price hikes across 13 states.

Governor Shapiro has led the push for PJM reform for more than two years, taking action when PJM failed to act and delivering consumer protections that are now shaping the national response.

See below for Governor Shapiro’s remarks as prepared for delivery:

Thank you, Secretary Burgum and Secretary Wright, for hosting us here today.

And thank you to my fellow Governors – Governors Moore and Youngkin – for your partnership in working to reform PJM and force them to cancel dramatic energy hikes over the past three years.

I’m glad that Governors on a bipartisan basis are leading the way and getting stuff done – because our collective work helped spur this action by the federal government.

Look, I hear it everyday: hardworking folks across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are worried about rising costs right now. I know my colleagues hear it too.

Trips to the grocery store and visits to the doctor cost more these days – and too many families and small businesses are struggling to make ends meet.

In Pennsylvania, we are laser focused on cutting costs – that’s why we’ve cut taxes seven times since I’ve been Governor.

And I’ve worked hard to make sure families have peace of mind knowing that they can afford to keep the lights on at home – and that we have reliable, affordable power when they go to flip that light switch.

Unfortunately, PJM has been too slow to let new generation onto the grid at a time when demand for energy is going up.

That’s led to dramatically increasing prices in PJM’s capacity auctions year after year – which means higher energy bills for consumers.

That’s unacceptable.

And, as we are showing here today, it doesn’t have to be this way.

18 months ago, when I learned PJM’s proposed prices for the next capacity auction would be the highest ever, I immediately objected.

I spent months working behind the scenes with PJM leaders to try and find a different path forward – one that spared ratepayers unnecessary rate hikes and did more to bring new power plants online faster.

PJM refused to budge and so when we couldn’t come to an agreement, I sued them with the backing of my colleagues.

Because of that lawsuit, we reached an agreement with PJM that staved off the kind of price increases they were talking about and instituted a 2-year price cap.

That price cap has saved consumers in the PJM grid over $18 billion already.

And in our productive work with them, I was insistent that an extension of our price cap be included in this statement of principles we’re signing today.

As a result, we’re going to save consumers in the PJM grid – 65 million Americans – an additional $27 billion over the next several years.

Now, I want to be very clear, even as we work to protect consumers, I also know that we need to bring more affordable power online. More power means more freedom and more opportunity.

We can do that by working with large data center developers – like Amazon, who I stood with last summer to announce the largest private sector investment in Pennsylvania – and protecting our consumers.

I think it can be a both/and – not just either/or.

We’ve sped up permitting to get big energy projects off the ground in Pennsylvania.

I’ve pushed PJM to do their part and expedite the interconnection of these new sources of energy – including the Crane Clean Energy Center, which will be ready to connect to the grid a year earlier than originally expected because of our work.

But we need more generation, and these principles will help get more energy on the grid.

Pennsylvania is the second largest energy producer in the entire country, and I’m an all-of-the-above energy Governor.

We need more energy on the grid – and we need it fast.

In Pennsylvania, I’ve launched the Lightning Plan to build more power in the Commonwealth, connect producers to the grid faster, create good-paying jobs, and prevent price hikes.

The statement of principles we’re about to sign today complements that work – and I’m grateful to my fellow Governors, who have been leading the way on energy affordability for years.

I’m glad the White House has joined us in this fight to push PJM to lower costs for consumers and deliver reliable, affordable energy for all.

Thank you.

Virginia, home to the largest concentration of data centers in the world, is actively debating additional transparency and infrastructure safeguards.","As we work in this legislative session, my focus is on advancing responsible, forward-thinking and strategic legislation that puts Hoosiers first. Indiana must strike the right balance between economic development, revenue growth, transparency and the long-term needs of our communities. Our state’s economic interests are not one-size-fits-all. Every region has its own priorities, challenges and vision for the future, and state policy should reflect that reality.

One of the most pressing issues facing communities across Indiana is the rapid interest in data center development. Whether Hoosiers support or oppose these projects, it is clear the Legislature must lead. Without clear guidance from the state, local governments are being forced to make complex decisions on their own. That has resulted in inconsistent processes, confusion and growing concerns from residents who want answers about water use, energy demands and long-term impacts on their communities.

I am working to develop a standardized, statewide framework for evaluating data center projects. That framework must guarantee safe, drinkable water, protect local water supplies and ensure that increased energy demand does not raise monthly utility bills for residential customers. Data centers can use millions of gallons of water and consume as much electricity as small cities, which makes thoughtful oversight essential.

At the federal level, there is currently no comprehensive framework governing data center development. Oversight is limited to broad environmental laws and permitting processes that were never designed to address the scale of water use and energy demand these facilities create. As a result, states across the country are stepping in to fill the gap.

California and Connecticut now require disclosure of water and energy use before projects move forward. Minnesota and Arizona have tightened water permitting for large industrial users, particularly in regions facing supply constraints. Virginia, home to the largest concentration of data centers in the world, is actively debating additional transparency and infrastructure safeguards. Indiana should learn from these efforts and lead with a clear, consistent approach rather than leaving communities to navigate uncertainty on their own.

Hoosiers are paying attention and want their voices heard. That is why transparency must be a cornerstone of this effort. I strongly believe that requiring public hearings once plans are ready to be shared gives communities a seat at the table and ensures concerns are heard and addressed.

Handled correctly, this approach can strengthen Indiana’s economy, protect our resources and position our state as a national leader. We cannot afford to think short term. This is our moment to act responsibly and put Hoosiers first.•

Today, Democratic governors from Pennsylvania, Delaware, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Maryland signed onto a deal to ensure PJM takes measures that ensure Big Tech is paying their fair share for their massive power usage.

The nation’s largest grid operator, PJM, has been in the process of creating a plan to confront the massive amount of demand brought to the region by Big Tech’s data centers. In December 2025, Sierra Club sent a letter urging PJM’s board members to adopt a plan that protects its 67 million customers from more exorbitant bills, and from potential financial liability if a data center fails to pay for its fair share. Many elements of what the Sierra Club and allies have been pushing for were reflected in the deal made today.

The Democratic Governors’ deal comes at an auspicious time, as PJM is expected to submit an update on their Critical Issue Fast Pass (Large Load Addition) policy development process to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Tuesday, January 20. Despite numerous attacks on low-cost energy by the current federal administration, including illegal cancellation of completed energy generation projects, and announcing a sham energy emergency that has been used to extend the operation of some of the most expensive coal-burning plants in the country, a coalition of bipartisan governors in the PJM have continued to participate in difficult dialogue and champion a meaningful set of solutions to address affordability.

“The Sierra Club has been on the frontlines fighting for PJM’s customers to get a fair deal on their electricity bills and urging the regional operator to adopt meaningful policy,” said Sierra Club Senior Advisor Jessi Eidbo. “We have been working continuously with lawmakers, advocates, and PJM, to ensure that our communities aren’t forced to pay Microsoft or Meta or any Big Tech company’s power bills. While the grid operator has been dragging their feet to adopt measures to address exponentially increasing electric demand from large loads like data centers, the continued leadership and activity from these governors is a positive sign that a meaningful solution could be on the horizon.

“We are glad to see this deal come to fruition, but we know that this is just the first step to the future that we have been pushing for. We will continue to advocate on behalf of the 67 million people who depend on PJM to keep the lights on, and ensure that fairness and reliability continue to be at the forefront of PJM’s work to serve its customers.”

Elements of the agreement include an extension of the PJM price cap that Democratic governors, including Pennsylvania’s Shapiro, fought to put in place during the 2025/2026 capacity auctions to protect customers from record-breaking high auction results at PJM.

However, other provisions proposed in the deal are still being discussed, like an expedited interconnection for data center generation, which raise concerns. As the specifics are hammered out, the Sierra Club will continue to advocate for expansion of low-cost generation assets to meaningfully address rising costs of electricity, which we understand to unequivocally be wind, solar, battery storage, and geothermal.

“The specifics of the deal will ultimately determine the extent to which consumers are meaningfully protected from electricity costs from large industrial users, but we are heartened by the continued leadership of strong governors throughout the PJM region who see the urgency of sound data center policy, and are willing to negotiate with non-traditional allies to develop solutions,” continues Jessi Eidbo.

However, for states that want to move faster, there are meaningful steps that can be taken right now to address rising electricity costs from large load users. States can establish large-load tariffs that offer favorable treatment for large loads that are willing to be reliably flexible for a small number of hours during the year, to prevent spikes in demand that then set the ceiling for price auctions.

AVON LAKE, Ohio, Jan 16 (Reuters) - U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the Canadian government's decision to allow ​in up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles at a low ‌tariff rate is ""problematic"" and that Canada may come to regret the decision.

""I think it's ‌problematic for Canada,"" Greer told CNBC on Friday.

""There's a reason why we don't sell a lot of Chinese cars in the United States. It's because we have tariffs to protect American auto workers and Americans ⁠from those vehicles.""

Greer said ‌Canada was seeking agriculture tariff relief as part of the EV agreement. ""I think in the long run, they're ‍not going to like having made that deal.""

Greer said rules adopted in January 2025 on vehicles that are connected to the internet and navigation systems are ​a significant impediment to Chinese vehicles in the U.S. market.

""I ‌think it would be hard for them to operate here,"" Greer said. ""There are rules and regulations in place in America about the cybersecurity of our vehicles and the systems that go into those, so I think it might be hard for the Chinese to comply with ⁠those kind of rules.""

“If ⁠they want to come in and build a plant and hire you and hire your friends and your neighbors, that’s great, ⁠I love that,” Trump said during remarks at a January 13 meeting of the ‌Detroit Economic Club. “Let China come in.""

,Clean Energy ,2026-01-17 05:10:59+00:00,Adirondack Daily Enterprise,"On energy and climate, Hochul goes nuclear | News, Sports, Jobs - Adirondack Daily Enterprise",Not Available,,,,,https://www.adirondackdailyenterprise.com/news/2026/01/on-energy-and-climate-hochul-goes-nuclear/,"Nowhere is this clearer than with nuclear energy, which she’s making her signature energy policy as she seeks reelection.
“If there’s one thing I believe, it’s this: Go big or go home,” Hochul said of the nuclear plans.
“We’ve seen a lot of movement to clear the way for nuclear power plant development.
Senator Rachel May said she was “not a fan, but I understand why she’s doing it, I guess.” Even some Republicans, who tend to prefer nuclear energy to renewables, are wary.
Like so many debates in New York energy policy today, the nuclear fight will likely be won by the side that convinces the public it represents affordability.","If 2025 was the year Gov. Kathy Hochul embraced “abundance” as the solution to New York’s woes — above all, the rising cost of living — 2026 is her year to show that she was just getting started.

That is, at least, what Hochul vowed in her State of the State address on Tuesday, putting the promise to “build, build, build” at the center of her agenda. And it is increasingly her answer to the conundrum facing New York’s energy system: how to keep the lights on while meeting growing demand for electricity, keeping utility bills in check and fighting climate change.

Nowhere is this clearer than with nuclear energy, which she’s making her signature energy policy as she seeks reelection. On Tuesday, the governor announced efforts to build four gigawatts’ worth of new reactors in the state. Combined with the one gigawatt she tasked the state power authority with building last year, that would be slightly more than the entire United States has built in the last three decades, and rival the total amount New York has ever built.

“If there’s one thing I believe, it’s this: Go big or go home,” Hochul said of the nuclear plans.

In her accompanying policy book, Hochul outlined a number of other proposals to curb energy bills and clean up the grid, but none come close to matching her ambitions for the nuclear buildout. She did not mention any new funding for climate initiatives — whether rebooting cap and invest, as many green groups are still calling for, or renewing the $1 billion climate action fund she introduced last year. (Asked about additional climate funding, spokesperson Ken Lovett said only that “the governor will be outlining her budget next week.”) Hochul likewise kept mum about whether or how she might seek to amend the climate law, as she suggested she wanted to last fall, after a judge ruled her administration was breaking it by failing to issue rules to cut emissions. She could still attempt such a maneuver in the state budget; she’s due to present her first draft of it in less than a week.

Instead, she proposed a wide range of less flashy items: an additional $50 million for the Empower energy efficiency program, which, along with a separate funding boost announced in December, will help rescue the program from drastic cuts; a package of reforms aimed at reining in utility rate hikes; customer incentives to participate in programs that reduce strain on the grid; and a sales tax exemption for electric vehicle charging stations, among others.

She also proposed a measure to help schools add more solar energy and create “cooler schoolyards,” apparently in line with New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s plans to green hundreds of city schools. And she vowed to make data centers “pay their fair share” for grid upgrades so that, the policy book says, “every-day New Yorkers do not subsidize” the industry.

The data center proposal could be an island of bipartisan consensus in what promises to be another year of bruising climate fights. The policy echoes calls from green groups as well as from a growing number of Republicans across the country, as artificial intelligence and its colossal demands on the grid face a mounting popular backlash.

But Liz Moran, New York policy advocate at the environmental law group Earthjustice, warned that much depends on the details: Will Hochul stipulate, for example, that data centers be required to provide their own clean power? Or will they be allowed to rely on gas?

Few climate advocates are in the mood to give Hochul the benefit of the doubt. Still fuming from Hochul’s repeated backtracking on climate policies last year — including her approval of a thrice-rejected gas pipeline after talks with President Donald Trump — they largely panned her agenda as insufficient, if not a betrayal of New York’s climate mandates.

“Under Gov. Hochul’s watch, New York has shifted from being a national climate leader to a state where the fossil fuel industry status quo holds New Yorkers hostage,” said Stephan Edel, executive director of the ny Renews coalition, in a statement.

Dozens of environmentalists rallied outside the entrance to Albany’s Egg theater before Hochul’s speech, denouncing the pipeline decision and her leap to nuclear power while the state continues to lag on building solar, wind, and batteries.

The renewable energy industry is striking a more bullish tone. Marguerite Wells, executive director of the trade group Alliance for Clean Energy New York, said Hochul’s proposals to cut red tape for housing and infrastructure — notably by reforming the 50-year-old State Environmental Quality Review Act — could pay dividends for clean energy, too.

“We’ve seen a lot of movement to clear the way for nuclear power plant development. We need equal movement for renewables,” Wells said in a statement. “New Yorkers need affordable electrons now, not in the decade-plus it will take until new nuclear could be operational.”

State officials insist the two go hand in hand. “We see nuclear as essential toward meeting the future energy needs in a way that pairs well with our existing renewable energy ambitions,” Public Service Commission Chair Rory Christian told New York Focus on Tuesday.

The state energy plan published in December envisions New York building at least two to three gigawatts’ worth of new nuclear alongside roughly 40 gigawatts of solar and wind by 2040.

Many Democratic lawmakers are lukewarm on Hochul’s nuclear plan. State Senate energy committee chair Kevin Parker said it was “not the optimal answer” to rising demand and prices. Senate environment committee chair Pete Harckham said he was “not wild” about the proposal. Senator Rachel May said she was “not a fan, but I understand why she’s doing it, I guess.”

Even some Republicans, who tend to prefer nuclear energy to renewables, are wary. “The benefits [Hochul] promises from her energy policies are years away, while families are struggling to afford their utility bills today,” said Assemblymember Matt Simpson in a statement.

Like so many debates in New York energy policy today, the nuclear fight will likely be won by the side that convinces the public it represents affordability. The pro-renewable Public Power New York this week blasted Hochul’s agenda as an “anti-affordability plan that will send already unaffordable utility bills skyrocketing,” citing a new analysis from a University of Pennsylvania researcher.

nyserda President Doreen Harris countered that, according to state modeling, even five gigawatts of new nuclear “was still a more affordable option than some of the alternatives” when considering the reliability of the grid overall.

Christian, the Public Service Commission chair, said he sees New York’s history of building massive hydroelectric dams as a roadmap. More than half a century later, those dams still provide some of the cheapest electricity in the country.

“New York has a history of going big and making those big investments pay off in the long run,” he said. “This is no different.”",https://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.adirondackdailyenterprise.com/images/2017/04/17105339/Untitled-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 00:58:27.791023

Carney also met senior executives from prominent Chinese businesses, including an EV battery maker and an energy giant.
The prime minister has repeatedly said he wants to reduce barriers to trade with Asia and Europe as a self-protection mechanism, and to take away “the cards” the U.S. holds against Ottawa in negotiations on economic matters and other issues.
On Friday, Carney said his new deal with China would unlock nearly $3 billion in export orders for Canadian farmers, fish harvesters, and processors.
Partnerships for natural gas exports were announced as well.","“This is a return to levels prior to recent trade frictions, but under an agreement that promises much more for Canadians,” Carney told reporters, referencing Beijing’s commitment to reduce the tariff on imports of Canadian canola seed from an 85% rate to 15% by March 1, and ensure visa-free access for Canadians travelling to China.

Carney made the remarks after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, notably marking the first visit to China by a Canadian leader in nearly a decade. Carney also met senior executives from prominent Chinese businesses, including an EV battery maker and an energy giant. He made several agreements on energy and trade cooperation, which he said were designed to help Canada “build its own competitive EV sector,” by following opportunities to “learn from innovative partners, access their supply chains, and increase local demand.”

Strengthening ties with Asia and Europe is a critical piece of Carney’s strategy to wean Canada from dependence on the U.S. and shield itself from the weight of Washington’s tariffs. The prime minister has repeatedly said he wants to reduce barriers to trade with Asia and Europe as a self-protection mechanism, and to take away “the cards” the U.S. holds against Ottawa in negotiations on economic matters and other issues.

“Getting rid of barriers east, west … You know that alone, if it’s fully done — we’ve done the federal part — but if all our provinces reduce their barriers, the estimates are that is a bigger return to the Canadian economy than the worst case trade outcome with the U.S.,” he said during September 2025 remarks at a Council on Foreign Relations conference.

“Who has all the cards? There are other games. There’s not just one game,” the prime minister warned during an interview with the Economist the following month, referencing an analogy President Donald Trump has used regarding foreign relations. “That’s the point. There are other games, and yes, we’re going to spend more time, to extend the analogy, in the game with the United States, but we’re going to play other games with other players.”

TRUMP TELLS SUPREME COURT STRIKING DOWN TARIFFS WOULD ‘DISARM’ HIM ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE

“Part of the reason why countries end up in, quote, ‘having’ to do one or negotiating from the position they’re in is their degree of dependence on the United States. So the logical thing … is, well, we should take care of ourselves, do the stuff at home, and we should build up relationships abroad … really focusing on building up that outside option,” he added.

On Friday, Carney said his new deal with China would unlock nearly $3 billion in export orders for Canadian farmers, fish harvesters, and processors. Partnerships for natural gas exports were announced as well. Carney promised the Canadian production of 50 million annual metric tonnes of liquefied natural gas destined for Asian markets by 2030, said Canada will double its energy grid over the next 15 years, and expressed confidence in opportunities for Chinese partnership on offshore wind investments.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26016117181906.jpg?resize=1200,683",N,,2026-01-17 00:58:43.445276

A 25% surge in LNG purchases by European countries was a key highlight and raised hopes among gas sellers that further growth in gas use in economies such as Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom is in store for 2026 and beyond.

On the other hand, lower imports by three of the five largest LNG buyers – all in Asia – have raised profit concerns, especially among exporters banking on selling the even greater volumes of LNG expected to hit the market this year.

As 2026 gets underway, here are some of the growth markets and soft spots that will be closely eyed by the LNG sector.

EUROPE’S STAYING POWER

The steep climbs in LNG purchases by several European countries in 2025 beg the question whether the region can sustain such a voracious appetite.

On the plus side, Europe’s generation of electricity from gas-fired power plants posted its first annual rise last year since before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine snarled regional gas flows in 2022.

Total European gas-fired electricity output during January to November was 1,009 terawatt hours (TWh), according to think tank Ember, up 3.4% from the same months in 2024 and the first year-over-year increase for that period since 2021.

Further increases in gas-fired power generation will obviously trigger further LNG import demand, especially in markets with shortages of alternative power sources.

Europe’s broader industrial economy, however, remains hobbled by weak manufacturing and consumer demand, and output among gas-intensive sectors such as chemicals and fertilizers remains near historic lows in top regional producer Germany.

Until a synchronised upturn in consumer and business activity takes root, it’s likely that Europe’s overall demand for natural gas may remain patchy, which may cap any further increases in LNG import interest over the near term.

Another question for LNG exporters is whether Europe’s LNG purchases in 2025 were artificially inflated as several countries attempted to narrow their trade gaps with the United States during trade talks with the Trump administration.

European imports of LNG from the U.S. last year jumped by close to 60% from 2024 levels, data from commodities intelligence firm Kpler shows.

That outsized jump in U.S. purchases – well above the increase in Europe’s total LNG imports – suggests the region may have been trying to curry favour with President Donald Trump as European and U.S. policymakers discussed trade deals.

With international focus now turning more to geopolitical concerns – such as the U.S. interest in acquiring Greenland – it is possible that European countries may prove less keen to please President Trump in 2026.

If that’s the case, volumes of U.S. LNG imports aimed at reducing trade deficits in 2025 may get curbed in 2026.

ASIA’S PLATEAU?

LNG exporters also have questions about the state of demand in Asia, which accounted for around 64% of all LNG imports last year, data from Kpler shows.

Total shipments to Asian buyers last year were just over 613 million cubic meters, marking a nearly 5% fall from 2024.

While a 5% volume slip was not much of a concern through 2025 given the steep growth in sales to Europe, LNG exporters will be anxious if Asia’s overall appetite remains weak this year and Europe’s buying pace also slows.

The top two overall LNG importers – China and Japan – registered LNG import cuts of 15% and 2% respectively in 2025.

The synchronized dip in imports by such critical markets will remain a cause for concern in 2026, especially if China’s economy remains sluggish and trade relations with the United States and other markets remain chilled.

Rapidly expanding renewables power generation in China and steadily recovering nuclear power generation in Japan are further causes for concern as those power sources squeeze gas out of generation mixes.

LNG purchases by number four importer – India – also dropped by 7% last year, yet another source of worry among LNG exporters who had hoped India would be a steady growth market.

Higher global gas prices have resulted in a steady decline in gas-fired electricity generation in India so far this decade, bringing as well a sharp slowdown in spending on gas distribution and storage infrastructure.

Bullish forecasters argue the steady swell in planned LNG exports will drive global prices lower and reignite demand for the fuel in fast-growing but cost-sensitive economies like India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

They may be right, but with benchmark natural gas prices near three-year highs and rising in the United States – the top global gas producer – it may be hard for LNG exporters to drive sale prices lower over the near term.

That may leave LNG exporters in 2026 focusing on already established markets, struggling in Europe to grow sales much from last year’s levels and hampered in Asia by patchy demand as China’s economy struggles for growth.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.

The distance between governments and firms is associated with firms’ economic activities, while the association of geographic proximity to environmental agencies with industrial pollution emissions is unclear. To explore the effects of geographic distance on firms’ pollution emissions, we use the fixed-effect models with data from the China Industrial Enterprise Database. Our results show that the firms located further away from environmental agencies release more SO2 (β = 0.102, p < 0.01) than those close to those environmental agencies. Subsequent investigations reveal that geographic distance has a positive correlation with the short-term performance of firms (total production value and fixed investment) but a negative correlation with firms’ long-term performance (green innovation, technological updates and clean energy use). Heterogeneous checks show that the influence of geographic distance on SO2 emissions is mainly found in non-local firms, suggesting a possibility of collusion between proximate firms and local government.

Hybrids as a solution to EV sales growth

EVs are seen as a crucial climate solution. In the U.S., transportation accounts for the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, and switching to electric vehicles cuts those emissions and reduces air pollution.

Notice of Intent to Revise the State Implementation Plan for Air Quality:

Attainment Demonstration for the 2008 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)

Contingency Measures and Motor Vehicle Emissions Budgets

The Commissioner of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) hereby gives notice of intent to revise the State Implementation Plan (SIP) to comply with the 2008 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for Ozone. This plan revision is necessary to fulfill the requirements under sections 172 and 182(d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) for severe nonattainment areas. This revision addresses the attainment demonstration for Connecticut’s Southwest Connecticut nonattainment area, which is part of the New York- Northern New Jersey- Long Island (NY-NJ-CT) Nonattainment Area and includes Fairfield, New Haven, and Middlesex Counties. While the full impact on future year ozone levels associated with deregulatory efforts by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are yet to be determined, DEEP concludes, based on the photochemical grid modeling previously conducted by EPA in 2023, which took into account then currently adopted emissions control programs, that Southwest Connecticut may plausibly attain the 2008 ozone NAAQS by the July 20, 2027, attainment date.

This SIP revision also includes motor vehicle emissions budgets (MVEBs) for Southwest Connecticut.

As required under CAA section 172(c)(9), the SIP revision must include contingency measures to take effect upon a finding of failure to attain the ozone NAAQS by the attainment date. DEEP proposes to reduce MVEBs as contingency in the event of a finding of failure to attain the 2008 NAAQS by the severe attainment date of July 20, 2027. As described in the SIP, the MVEBs proposed for attainment in Table 1 will, after July 20, 2027, be reduced to the levels in Table 2 if the area fails to attain the standard by the attainment date. The levels in Table 2 provide one year’s worth (OYW) of progress toward attainment and results in additional reductions of 1.8 tons/day and 1.9 tons/day of nitrogen oxide (NOx) and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, respectively. Upon a finding of failure to attain, the budgets in Table 2 would take effect without further comment.

Safer Drinking Water

A Healthier San Joaquin River

Safer Drinking Water

Access to safe drinking water is a major challenge for small communities. In 2012, EPA and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) convened a series of stakeholder and inter-agency meetings to identify the needs of small systems that fail to meet safe drinking water standards. More than 50% of them – 140 systems – were in the San Joaquin Valley. The state agency’s goal is to bring at least 21 systems in the valley into compliance each year for the next three years.

EPA is helping to meet that goal by providing essential funding for technical assistance to these small drinking water systems through nonprofits like the California Rural Water Association. In partnership with CDPH, local stakeholders, and four nonprofits, EPA continues to work with these communities to identify barriers to compliance and develop long-term sustainable solutions.

EPA has also worked with communities to improve water quality by providing funding for education and training to more than 200 valley residents about preventing pollution of drinking water.

A Healthier San Joaquin River

Some of the most promising signs of progress to protect surface waters have recently come from the San Joaquin River. First, a 50-mile stretch that formerly went dry part of every year due to dams and water diversions was re-watered. In November 2012, the state Department of Fish and Wildlife captured adult salmon and trucked them upstream to spawning areas, in hopes of restoring a San Joaquin salmon run for the first time in more than 60 years.

EPA is participating in the review of modifications to water quality standards in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta proposed by the State Water Resources Control Board. The first phase of the new standards will address freshwater flows for the protection of aquatic life in the lower San Joaquin River and three of its tributaries, the Stanislaus, Merced, and Tuolumne Rivers.

In June 2012, EPA awarded $59,000 in grant funds to Revive the San Joaquin, a nonprofit in Fresno, to establish a citizen-based water quality monitoring and pollution prevention education program in the city’s 15 miles of neighborhoods lining the riverbank. This effort is now underway.

Also notable is the success of a 20-year effort to reduce levels of the pesticide diazinon in two stretches of the river, totaling 17 miles. Diazinon was being used on orchards, and runoff was washing the pesticide into the river.

This historic initiative marks a decisive step toward reinforcing the nation’s energy infrastructure, maintaining low energy costs and securing American leadership in innovation.
That’s why President Trump asked governors across the Mid-Atlantic to come together and call upon PJM to allow America to build big reliable power plants again.
Our directives will restore affordable and reliable electricity so American families thrive and America’s manufacturing industries once again boom.
President Trump promised to unleash American energy and put the American people first.","WASHINGTON — Today, National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC) Chairman and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, alongside Vice Chairman and Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, announced a landmark agreement with a bipartisan group of governors to expand the nation’s energy supply, safeguard affordability and support the rapid expansion of data-center development.

For years, electricity prices within the PJM market, which serves the Mid-Atlantic and parts of the Midwest, have risen faster than almost anywhere else in the country, in part, because of the previous administration’s war on American energy. To reverse this, President Donald J. Trump and the NEDC have secured an agreement with several states to advance more than $15 billion in new power-generation projects. These projects are designed to strengthen grid reliability and meet the surging energy demands of the digital economy.

In a first-of-its-kind partnership, a coalition of leading technology companies has committed to funding this new generation capacity. This ensures that the costs associated with increased data-center demand are carried by tech companies, not taxpayers. This historic initiative marks a decisive step toward reinforcing the nation’s energy infrastructure, maintaining low energy costs and securing American leadership in innovation.

""For too long, the Green New Scam has left families in the dark with skyrocketing bills,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. “Today, under President Trump’s leadership, the National Energy Dominance Council has come up with a solution to end these high costs, roll back the Biden administration’s policies of energy scarcity and ensure we are powering the Mid-Atlantic and parts of the Midwest’s future without charging its citizens a cent. This initiative will ensure we usher in the age of artificial intelligence with new power plants funded by the technology companies, not taxpayers, securing the steel of Pennsylvania, the manufacturing of Ohio and the ships of Virginia. The Trump administration is keeping the lights on, the factories humming and the American Dream affordable.""

“High electricity prices are a choice,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright. “The Biden administration’s forceful closures of coal and natural gas plants without reliable replacements left the United States in an energy emergency. Perhaps no region in America is more at risk than in PJM. That’s why President Trump asked governors across the Mid-Atlantic to come together and call upon PJM to allow America to build big reliable power plants again. Our directives will restore affordable and reliable electricity so American families thrive and America’s manufacturing industries once again boom. President Trump promised to unleash American energy and put the American people first. This plan keeps that promise.""

This announcement is a direct response to the national energy emergency declared by President Trump on Day One of his administration, following years of President Biden’s energy subtraction agenda that left the American grid vulnerable to blackouts and record-high prices. This initiative aims to:

Restore Energy Affordability: Lower the burden on residential customers who have faced skyrocketing monthly bills.

Strengthen Grid Reliability: Deploy $15 billion toward baseload power to ensure the lights stay on and the heat stays on, regardless of weather conditions.

Protect Regional Industry: Secure the energy-intensive manufacturing hubs of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Virginia that serve as the backbone of the American economy.

President Trump is shifting the focus back to reliable power generation, this agreement ensures that America remains an industrial powerhouse, powered by American resources and protected from the failed policies of previous administrations.

Additionally, a feasibility study on the White Mesa Mill upgrades will provide economic details on the rare earth processing expansion.","Energy Fuels delivered exceptional performance in 2025 as the best-performing uranium stock, outpacing its closest competitor by more than double, whilst building a diversified critical minerals hub centred on uranium, rare earths, and heavy mineral sands.

The company is ramping uranium production towards 2 million pounds annually, processing 350,000 pounds in December alone - a significant milestone when many US producers struggle to achieve 100,000 pounds quarterly.

White Mesa Mill provides unique competitive advantages with demonstrated rare earth processing capabilities, heavy mineral separation, and recent addition of an MREC circuit, positioning Energy Fuels to process material from diverse sources including ionic clays.

The Toliara project in Madagascar remains a world-class, low-cost heavy mineral sands and monazite deposit with feasibility studies showing NPV exceeding $1.5 billion at 10% discount rate, with final investment decision expected by Q1 2026.

Strong balance sheet with approximately $1 billion in cash, reinforced by a $700 million convertible note at an exceptionally low 0.75% coupon - significantly below the 4-5.5% rates competitors are paying - demonstrates market confidence and provides capital flexibility.

Energy Fuels (NYSE: UUUU) has emerged as a standout performer in the critical minerals sector, delivering returns in 2025 that position it as the year's best-performing uranium stock - outpacing its nearest competitor by more than 100%. With a current market capitalisation of $5 billion and share price around $21, the company has executed a strategic vision that CEO Mark Chalmers first articulated two and a half years ago. As the United States intensifies its focus on critical mineral security and energy independence, Energy Fuels stands uniquely positioned at the intersection of uranium production, rare earth processing, and heavy mineral sands development.

The company's strategy centres on leveraging its 50-year uranium processing heritage at the White Mesa Mill in Utah to create a diversified critical minerals platform. This approach addresses a fundamental challenge facing Western economies: reducing dependence on foreign - particularly Chinese - supply chains for materials essential to clean energy, defence, and advanced manufacturing. With a workforce that has grown from 100 employees in the United States a few years ago to 260-270 domestically and 600-700 globally, Energy Fuels has achieved critical mass that few competitors can match.

Uranium Production: Delivering on Core Operations

Energy Fuels' uranium operations provide the foundation for its broader critical minerals strategy. The company mined approximately 1.6 million pounds of uranium in 2025 and processed over 1 million pounds whilst stockpiling additional feed. For 2026, management targets mining production exceeding 2 million pounds annually, with processing planned for at least the first six months depending on rare earth processing activities.

The scale of operations became particularly evident in December 2025, when the White Mesa Mill processed 350,000 pounds of uranium in a single month. As Chalmers emphasised, this stands in stark contrast to competitors:

""350,000 pounds in a single month when a lot of people are trying to get to 100,000 pounds in a quarter."" This production capability directly addresses criticism that Energy Fuels had deprioritised uranium. ""The naysayers that were saying, 'Oh, we've got out of the uranium business. We don't care about uranium.' Well, we're doing pretty good,"" Chalmers noted.

The company's production economics remain highly competitive, with costs at the Pinyon Plain mine ranging between $23-30 per pound. At current uranium prices hovering around $83 per pound, this generates substantial margins. Chalmers built the Pinyon Plain mine 38 years ago, and it continues to anchor the company's cost-competitive position. The company secured long-term contracts covering 600,000 - 800,000 pounds in 2026, whilst maintaining flexibility to capitalise on spot market opportunities. In 2025, Energy Fuels realised average prices in the mid - $70s per pound across contract and spot sales.

Rare Earth Processing: Technical Capabilities Setting Energy Fuels Apart

Energy Fuels has developed rare earth processing capabilities that Chalmers describes as unmatched in the United States. The White Mesa Mill can process rare earth feedstocks through to separated oxides, with output already pre-qualified by multiple potential customers. Recent technical additions have expanded the facility's versatility, including the installation of an MREC (ionic clay processing) circuit that enables processing of cracked material from ionic clays and other sources before separation.

""We are so advanced when it comes to feed processing capabilities demonstrated that we can get to oxides that oxides can be has been pre-qualified with a number of outside parties,"" Chalmers explained.

The company's ability to recover heavy rare earth elements particularly distinguishes its offering, as these materials command premium pricing and face the most acute supply constraints.

The mill's flexibility allows Energy Fuels to balance uranium and rare earth processing according to market conditions and customer demand signals. For 2026, uranium processing is planned for at least six months, but this could extend depending on rare earth opportunities. The company submitted Phase 2 separation plant upgrades that would scale the facility to match the capacity of Lynas Rare Earths' operations whilst maintaining separated heavy rare earth capabilities - a technical achievement few Western facilities can claim.

Interview with Energy Fuels Inc's President & CEO, Mark Chalmers

Technical Team and Operational Scale

Energy Fuels has assembled what Chalmers characterises as ""the strongest technical team in all critical minerals of anybody in the United States that I know of."" This team's breadth spans uranium, vanadium, and rare earth elements - a combination that reflects the company's diversified approach. The technical expertise extends globally, with a Perth office supporting Australian operations, teams in Madagascar and Kenya for African projects, and personnel managing the Australian joint venture.

This operational scale provides Energy Fuels with advantages that extend beyond processing. The company maintains uranium-vanadium mines at La Sal and Pandora, and whilst vanadium recovery is currently suspended, the element remains in solution and can be recovered from tailings at a later date when economics justify it. ""You got to be in the game to capitalise on the game,"" Chalmers noted, highlighting the optionality this creates.

Toliara Project: World-Class Heavy Mineral Sands

The Toliara project in Madagascar represents one of Energy Fuels' most significant development assets. The recently released feasibility study confirmed previous economic assessments, showing net present value exceeding $1.5 billion at a 10% discount rate. Chalmers describes Toliara as ""the lowest cost undeveloped heavy mineral sand and monazite deposit in the world"" with long life and large scale characteristics.

The project has faced some political uncertainty following a change in Madagascar's government, but Energy Fuels maintains significant in-country presence and continues working closely with government officials. ""We see it as a very important project in Madagascar for the region for the government as a whole and we plan to work very very closely with them to deliver that project as soon as possible,"" Chalmers stated.

Capital costs have increased somewhat from previous estimates but remain reasonable in the context of the project's economics. Energy Fuels targets a final investment decision by the end of Q1 2026, which would represent a significant milestone in advancing the company's heavy mineral sands strategy. The project would provide monazite feedstock for the White Mesa Mill's rare earth processing operations, creating vertical integration within Energy Fuels' critical minerals platform.

Donald Project and Multiple Feasibility Studies

Alongside Toliara, Energy Fuels is advancing the Donald project, with a feasibility study anticipated by the end of Q1 2026. Additionally, a feasibility study on the White Mesa Mill upgrades will provide economic details on the rare earth processing expansion. This confluence of studies will enable investors to understand the integrated economics of Energy Fuels' strategy and how the company compares to global peers.

""We will have these multiple studies coming out that provides people the ability to connect the dots on what the economics look like and where we kind of fit into the world pecking order and we're really excited about that,"" Chalmers explained. The studies will cover economics across the value chain - from mining through processing to separated products - giving a comprehensive view that few competitors can offer.

Capital Structure, Competitive Dynamics and Industry Positioning

Energy Fuels' financial position has strengthened considerably, with approximately $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet. The company's capital markets success became particularly evident with a $700 million convertible note offering featuring a coupon of just 0.75% - dramatically below the 4-5.5% rates other uranium companies have paid for similar instruments. This financing was arranged with Goldman Sachs and attracted significant investor interest.

""I had number of investors say that was the big event for energy fuels for the year is being able to raise that quantum at those kind of terms,"" Chalmers noted. The favourable terms reflect market confidence in Energy Fuels' execution capabilities and strategic positioning. This capital provides flexibility for both organic development and potential acquisitions or partnerships as opportunities emerge in the consolidating critical minerals sector.

Energy Fuels' diversified approach addresses investor concerns about single-project risk whilst creating synergies competitors cannot easily replicate. The company's 50-year uranium processing history provides operational expertise that has proven difficult for others to restart. Multiple projects globally have faced challenges restarting or initiating uranium production, whilst Energy Fuels continues expanding output.

The company increasingly receives inbound interest from parties seeking processing partnerships, acquisition opportunities, and strategic investments. ""The phone keeps ringing with people that want to deal with us in different things,"" Chalmers noted. Upstream producers lacking access to processing facilities see value in partnering with Energy Fuels, whilst investors recognise the company's critical mass and balance sheet strength.

Looking Forward: Execution and Catalysts

Energy Fuels enters 2026 with momentum following a year in which the stock appreciated approximately 45% through mid-January alone. The company focuses on revenue growth and moving towards profitability, with uranium production providing near-term cash generation whilst rare earth and heavy mineral sands projects advance towards commercial production.

Key catalysts for 2026 include final investment decisions on both Toliara and Donald, the White Mesa Mill upgrade feasibility study, continued uranium production ramp-up, and potential government support programmes. The company's flexibility to balance uranium and rare earth processing according to demand signals and market conditions provides tactical advantages as both markets develop.

Chalmers acknowledges the challenges inherent in the business: ""This is a hard business. We always look over our shoulder and make sure we're not overconfident."" However, after 50 years in the industry, he expresses confidence in Energy Fuels' ability to deliver: ""We're experienced and we deliver and we do what we say we're going to do.""

Government Alignment: Critical minerals security focus of Trump administration creates supportive policy backdrop for domestic producer with demonstrated capabilities versus development-stage competitors

Multiple Near-Term Catalysts: Q1 2026 feasibility studies on Donald project and White Mesa upgrades, Toliara final investment decision, continued uranium production ramp, and potential government programme participation

Optionality and Flexibility: Ability to modulate between uranium and rare earth processing, suspend/restart vanadium recovery, and pursue acquisitions provides management with tactical and strategic flexibility

Macro Thematic Analysis: Critical Minerals and Western Supply Chain Independence

The United States and allied Western nations face a strategic vulnerability in critical minerals supply chains, with China dominating processing of materials essential to clean energy transition, defence systems, and advanced manufacturing. Rare earth elements exemplify this challenge - China controls over 90% of global processing despite representing less than 40% of mining. This concentration creates national security risks and economic dependencies that recent geopolitical tensions have brought into sharp focus. The Trump administration's renewed emphasis on critical mineral security, combined with bipartisan recognition of supply chain vulnerabilities, has created unprecedented policy support for domestic production and processing capabilities.

Energy Fuels occupies a unique position as the only company with operational uranium production and rare earth processing capabilities in the United States, providing optionality across multiple critical materials. As CEO Mark Chalmers stated:

""We are like no other company in the critical mineral space where we're building a critical mineral hub using our longstanding uranium processing capabilities but also the ability to mine and recover rare earth into oxides.""

This positioning becomes increasingly valuable as governments prioritise resilient, diversified supply chains.

TL;DR: Executive Summary

Energy Fuels delivered the highest returns of any uranium stock in 2025 whilst building America's only integrated critical minerals platform spanning uranium production (targeting 2+ million lbs annually), rare earth processing to separated oxides, and world-class heavy mineral sands development. The company's $1 billion balance sheet, strengthened by a $700 million convertible at just 0.75% coupon, funds multiple Q1 2026 catalysts including feasibility studies and final investment decisions. With proven production generating cash at attractive margins ($23-30/lb costs versus $83/lb uranium prices) and unmatched processing capabilities at White Mesa Mill, Energy Fuels offers investors exposure to critical minerals security themes with operational validation few competitors can match.

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) Commissioner Amanda Lefton today announced that more than $5 million is now available through the fifth round of the Regenerate NY Forestry Cost Share Grant Program. This grant program provides financial assistance to private landowners establishing new forests, improving the health of existing forests, and restoring forests that are heavily impacted by factors such as deer browse, invasive pests, or fragmentation. The funding for this round is made possible by the State Environmental Protection Fund’s (EPF) Climate Change Mitigation and Adaption Program, the Forest Landowners Support grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service, and the Arbor Day Foundation. New trees planted as a result of funded projects will contribute to Governor Hochul’s 25 Million Trees Initiative.

“Regenerate NY reflects commitments by Governor Kathy Hochul and DEC to protecting and strengthening New York’s forests for future generations,” said Commissioner Lefton. “Private landowners own approximately 75% of our state’s forestland, so it is essential that we support and invest in their ability to manage their forests sustainably. This round of funding will empower landowners to expand and restore their forests, support green jobs and local economies, and ensure these lands continue to provide clean air and water, habitat for wildlife, and resilient landscapes.”

Private landowners may apply for grants ranging from $10,000 to $1 million to conduct one or more of the following practices on their property:

Planting trees to restore or create new forests,

Creating young forest habitat to initiate natural regeneration and improve wildlife habitat,

Thinning to remove unhealthy or close-growing trees and to promote forest health or regrowth,

Removing competing or invasive vegetation, and

Installing tree protection to prevent deer browse of young tree seedlings.

Eligible applicants include any individual, trust, corporate entity or other for-profit organization that owns between 5 and 2,500 acres of undeveloped land that is forested or can become forested through tree planting or associated practices to encourage forest regeneration. Not-for-profit organizations and Indian Nations or Tribes with 5 or more acres of undeveloped land are also eligible and are not subject to the 2,500-acre maximum requirement. Projects must be at least 5 acres and must be guided by a private forester or natural resource professional. There is no limit to the number of applications/bids that a landowner or organization may submit; however, they cannot be for the same land area. Projects must be completed by December 15, 2029.

DEC Director of Lands and Forests and New York State Forester Fiona Watt said, “This grant opportunity offers a flexible toolkit for landowners to create new forest habitat on open land, and to nurture young and struggling forests to greater health and resilience. Regenerating New York’s private forests is a key pathway to supporting working lands, nature’s benefits, and addressing climate change.”

Portions of the grant funds will be reserved until March 11, 2026, for priority applicants, including new forest landowners, active military service members and veterans, and State or federally recognized Tribes and Indian Nations. Funds will also be reserved for priority projects, including planting trees on a large scale or restoring forests significantly impacted by invasive pests or diseases. Any funds not awarded by that date will then be available to all eligible applicants.

DEC will host a webinar on Tuesday, February 3, 2026, to provide information and answer questions about this funding opportunity. Register for the webinar here(link is external).(link is external)

Applications will be accepted until Thursday, August 27, 2026, and must be submitted through the Statewide Financial System (SFS). Applicants must register for an SFS account before they can apply, and not-for-profits must also prequalify by the deadline or their application will not be evaluated.

“It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China–Canada relations toward improvement,” China’s top leader said.

Carney made the announcement after two days of meetings with Chinese leaders. He said there would be an initial annual cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports to Canada, growing to about 70,000 over five years. China will reduce its total tariff on canola seeds, a major Canadian export, from 84% to about 15%, he told reporters.

Carney said China has become a more predictable partner to deal with than the U.S, the country’s neighbor and longtime ally.

“Our relationship has progressed in recent months with China. It is more predictable and you see results coming from that,” Carney said.

Carney hasn’t been able to reach a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump to reduce some tariffs that are punishing some key sectors of the Canadian economy and Trump has previously talked about making Canada the 51st state.

The prime minister, speaking outside against the backdrop of a traditional pavilion and a frozen pond at a Beijing park, said meetings in China have been historic and productive.

Earlier Friday, he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged to improve relations between their two nations after years of acrimony.

Xi told Carney in a meeting at the Great Hall of the People that he is willing to continue working to improve ties, noting that talks have been underway on restoring and restarting cooperation since the two held an initial meeting in October on the sidelines of a regional economic conference in South Korea.

“It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China–Canada relations toward improvement,” China’s top leader said.

Carney looks to improve global governance

Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China in eight years, told Xi that better relations would help improve a global governance system that he described as “under great strain.”

Later, he said at the news conference that the system may give way at least in part to country-to-country or regional agreements rather than the global ones that have underpinned economic growth in the post-World War II era.

“The question is: What gets built in that place? How much of a patchwork is it?” he said.

The new reality reflects in large part the so-called America-first approach of Trump. The tariffs he has imposed have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies. Carney, who has met with several leading Chinese companies in Beijing, said ahead of his trip that his government is focused on building an economy less reliant on the U.S. at what he called “a time of global trade disruption.”

A Canadian business owner in China called Carney’s visit game-changing, saying it re-establishes dialogue, respect and a framework between the two nations.

“These three things we didn’t have,” said Jacob Cooke, the CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, which helps exporters navigate the Chinese market. “The parties were not talking for years.”

Canada had been aligned with US on tariffs

Canada had followed the U.S. in putting tariffs of 100% on EVs from China and 25% on steel and aluminum under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Carney’s predecessor.

China responded by imposing duties of 100% on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood. It added a 75.8% tariff on canola seeds last August. Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said. Overall, China’s imports from Canada fell 10.4% last year to $41.7 billion, according to Chinese trade data.

Carney tried to address the concerns of Canadian automakers and auto workers by saying the initial cap on Chinese EV imports was about 3% of the 1.8 million vehicles sold in Canada annually and that, in exchange, China is expected to begin investing in the Canadian auto industry within three years.

More than half of the Chinese EVs exported to Canada would have an import price of less than 35,000 Canadian dollars ($25,000) within five years, he said, making them accessible to consumers.

“We’re building (a) new part of our car industry, building cars of the future in partnership, bringing affordable autos for Canadians at a time when affordability is top of mind, and doing it at a scale that allows for a smooth transition in the sector,” he said.

“For the exchange of a small piece of the Canadian market, we have a commitment. We are waiting for an investment commitment in Canada. The real leaders of the new industry. So it’s an agreement that will create the future for our industry.”

China sees an opening under

Trump

China is hoping Trump’s pressure tactics on allies such as Canada will drive them to pursue a foreign policy that is less aligned with the United States. The U.S. president has suggested Canada could become America’s 51st state.

Carney, though, noted Canada’s relationship with the U.S. is much more multifaceted, deeper and broader. Canada and China have different systems and disagree on issues such as human rights, he said, limiting the scope of their engagement even as they seek ways to cooperate on areas of common interest.

The Canadian leader leaves China on Saturday and visits Qatar on Sunday before attending the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland next week. He will meet business leaders and investors in Qatar to promote trade and investment, his office said.

An essential guide to the week’s key developments relating to climate change.

This week

Hottest hat-trick

STATE OF THE CLIMATE: Scientists have announced that 2025 was either the second or third hottest year on record, with close margins between last year and 2023, reported the Associated Press. The newswire noted that “temperature averages for 2025 hovered around – and mostly above – 1.4C of industrial era warming”. Bloomberg said that this happened despite the natural weather phenomenon La Niña, which “suppresses global temperatures”, meaning “heat from greenhouse gases countered that cooling influence”. Carbon Brief’s comprehensive analysis of the data found cumulative global ice loss also “reached a new record high in 2025”.

OVERHEATING OCEANS: Separately, the world’s oceans “absorbed colossal amounts of heat in 2025”, said the Guardian, setting “yet another new record and fuelling more extreme weather”. It added that the “extra heat makes the hurricanes and typhoons…more intense, causes heavier downpours of rain and greater flooding and results in longer marine heatwaves”.

FIRE AND ICE: Wildfires in Australia have destroyed around 500 structures, said the Sydney Morning Herald, with a “dozen major fires” still burning. A wildfire in Argentinian Patagonia has “blazed through nearly 12,000 hectares” of scrubland and forests, according to the Associated Press. Meanwhile, parts of the Himalayas are “snowless” for the first time in nearly four decades, signalling a “climatic anomaly”, reported the Times of India.

Around the world

EMISSIONS REBOUND: US emissions rose 2% last year after two years of declines” due to a rise in coal power generation, said Axios, in coverage of research by the Rhodium Group.

‘UNINVESTABLE’ OIL: US president Donald Trump may “sideline” ExxonMobil from Venezuela’s oil market after its comment that Venezuela is “uninvestable”, reported CNBC. TotalEnergies is also “in no rush to return to Venezuela”, said Reuters.

PRICE WARS: The EU issued guidelines that will allow tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles to be removed in exchange for minimum price commitments, said Reuters.

‘RECORD’ AUCTION: The UK government has secured “8.4 gigawatts of new offshore wind power” in a “record” auction, said Sky News. Although the auction saw some price rises, this will likely be “cost neutral” for consumers, Carbon Brief said – contrary to the “simplistic and misleading” narratives promoted by some media outlets.

COP STRATEGY: The Guardian reported that Chris Bowen, the Australian minister appointed “president of negotiations” for COP31, plans to use his role to lobby “Saudi Arabia and others” on the need to phase out fossil fuels.

Captured

Both China and India saw coal power generation fall in 2025, in the “first simultaneous drop in half a century”, found new analysis for Carbon Brief, which was widely reported around the world. It noted that, for both countries, the decline in coal was driven by new clean-energy capacity additions, which were “more than sufficient to meet rising demand”.

Spotlight

What are China experts watching for in 2026?

The year 2026 will be pivotal for China’s climate policy. In March, the government will release key climate and energy targets for 2030, the year by which China has pledged to have peaked its emissions.

At the same time, with the US increasingly turning away from climate policy and towards fossil fuel expansionism, China’s role in global climate action is more important than ever.

Carbon Brief asks leading experts what they are watching for from China over the year ahead.

Shuo Li, director of the China Climate Hub, Asia Society Policy Institute

After decades of rapid growth, independent analyses suggest China’s CO2 emissions may have plateaued or even begun to decline in 2025.

The transition from emissions growth to stabilisation and early decline will be the key watch point for 2026 and will be shaped by the forthcoming 15th five-year plan. [This plan will set key economic goals, including energy and climate targets, for 2030.]

However, the precise timing, scale and enforceability of these absolute emissions control measures remain under active debate. Chinese experts broadly agree that if the 2021-2025 period was characterised by continued emissions growth, and 2031-2035 is expected to deliver a clear decline, then 2026-2030 will serve as a critical “bridge” between the two.

Yan Qin, principal analyst, ClearBlue Markets

First, the 15th five-year plan inaugurates the “dual control of carbon” system. This year marks the first time industries and local governments face binding caps on total emissions, not just intensity.

Second, the national carbon market is aggressively tightening. With the inclusion of steel, cement and aluminum this year, regulators are executing a “market reset” – de-weighting older allowances [meaning they cannot be used to contribute to polluters’ obligations for 2026] and enforcing stricter benchmarks to bolster prices ahead of the full rollout of the EU’s carbon border adjustment mechanism.

Cecilia Trasi, senior policy advisor for industry and trade, ECCO

China’s solar manufacturing overcapacity is prompting Beijing’s first serious consolidation efforts. At the same time, its offshore wind technology is advancing rapidly [and there are] signals that Chinese wind companies are pursuing entry into European markets through local production, mirroring strategies adopted by battery manufacturers.

Together, these dynamics suggest that the next phase of cleantech competition will be shaped less by trade defense alone and more by the interaction between Chinese supply-side reforms and global market-absorption capacity.

Tu Le, managing director, Sino Auto Insights

China’s electric vehicle (EV) industry has been the primary force pushing the global passenger vehicle market toward clean energy. That momentum should continue. But a growing headwind has emerged: tariffs. Mexico, Brazil, Europe and the US are just a few of the countries raising barriers, complicating the next phase of global EV expansion.

One new wildcard: the US now effectively controls Venezuelan oil. If that meaningfully impacts global oil prices, it could either slow – or unexpectedly accelerate – the shift toward clean-energy vehicles.

,Detroit and Evs,2026-01-17 03:46:19+00:00,www.bbc.com,Canada's deal with China signals it is serious about shift from US - BBC,Nadine Yousif,,,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm24k6kk1rko,"Some experts said the electric vehicle provisions in the trade deal would help China make inroads into the Canadian automobile market.
""If you can get a deal with China, you should do that,"" he told reporters outside the White House.
""There's a reasonable chance that we could end up in 2026 without a meaningful, workable trade deal with the United States,"" he said.
The deal with China drops Canada's levies on Chinese EVs from 100% to 6.1% for the first 49,000 vehicles imported each year.
For Carney, though, Friday's deal may just be the first step in a ""recalibration"" of Canada's trade relations.","Prime Minister Mark Carney's new approach to Canada's foreign policy can perhaps be distilled in one line: ""We take the world as it is, not as we wish it to be.""

That was his response when asked about the deal struck with China on Friday, despite concerns over its human rights record and nearly a year after he called China ""the biggest security threat"" facing Canada.

The deal will see Canada ease tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles that it imposed in tandem with the US in 2024. In exchange, China will lower retaliatory tariffs on key Canadian agricultural products.

Experts told the BBC the move represents a significant shift in Canada's policy on China, one that is shaped by ongoing uncertainty with the US, its largest trade partner.

""The prime minister is saying, essentially, that Canada has agency too, and that it's not going to just sit and wait for the United States,"" said Eric Miller, a Washington DC based trade adviser and president of the Rideau Potomac Strategy Group.

China and Canada announce tariffs relief after high-stakes meeting

Carney faces delicate balancing act in China visit

Four things the US wants from Canada on trade

In Canada, as daylight broke on Friday, reaction to the deal was swift.

Some, like Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, hailed it as ""very good news"". Farmers in Moe's province have been hard hit by China's retaliatory tariffs on Canadian canola oil, and the deal, he said, would bring much needed relief.

But Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose province is home to Canada's auto sector, was sharply critical of the deal. He said removing EV tariffs on China ""would hurt our economy and lead to job losses"".

In a post on X, Ford said Carney's government was ""inviting a flood of cheap made-in-China electric vehicles without any real guarantees of equal or immediate investment in Canada's economy"".

Some experts said the electric vehicle provisions in the trade deal would help China make inroads into the Canadian automobile market.

With the lower EV tariffs, approximately 10% of Canada's electric vehicle sales are now expected to go to Chinese automakers, said Vivek Astvansh, a business professor at McGill University in Montreal.

The expected increase in Chinese EV sales could put pressure on US-based EV makers like Tesla which are seeking to expand their market share in Canada, he said.

""Carney has signalled to the Trump administration that it is warming up to China,"" Astvansh added.

Reaction from the White House, meanwhile, has been mixed.

In an interview with CNBC on Friday morning, US trade representative Jamieson Greer called the deal ""problematic"" and said Canada may come to regret it.

President Donald Trump, however, hailed it as ""a good thing"".

""If you can get a deal with China, you should do that,"" he told reporters outside the White House.

Since taking office for a second time last year, Trump has imposed tariffs on Canadian sectors like metals and automotives, which has led to swirling economic uncertainty. He has also threatened to rip up a longstanding North American free trade agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico, calling it ""irrelevant"".

That trade agreement, the USMCA, is now under a mandatory review. Canada and Mexico have both made clear they want it to remain in place.

But the decision to carve out a major new deal with China is a recognition by Carney that the future of North American free trade remains unclear, Miller of the Rideau Potomac Strategy Group told the BBC.

""There's a reasonable chance that we could end up in 2026 without a meaningful, workable trade deal with the United States,"" he said. ""And Canada needs to be prepared.""

The deal with China drops Canada's levies on Chinese EVs from 100% to 6.1% for the first 49,000 vehicles imported each year. That quota could rise, Carney said, reaching 70,000 in half a decade.

Canada and the US put levies on Chinese EVs in 2024, arguing that China was overproducing vehicles and undermining the ability of other countries to compete.

China is the world's largest producer of EVs, accounting for 70% of global production.

In exchange, China will cut tariffs on Canadian canola seed to around 15% by 1 March, down from the current rate of 84%. Carney said Beijing had also committed to removing tariffs on Canadian canola meal, lobsters, crabs and peas ""until at least the end of the year"".

China also committed to removing visa requirements for Canadian visitors, Carney said.

Beijing did not corroborate the details in a separate statement, but said ""the two reached a preliminary joint agreement on addressing bilateral economic and trade issues"".

The introduction of Chinese EVs to Canada's market will likely mean cheaper prices for Canadian consumers, said Gal Raz, an associate professor of Operations Management and Sustainability at Western University and an expert on the EV supply chain.

But Raz acknowledged that the deal Canada struck could hurt Canadian car manufacturers if it comes without further action from the Carney government to help the domestic sector.

He said it was the result of an ""unfortunate"" deterioration of the Canada-US trade relationship, which he noted has also hurt Canada's automotive industry.

""The US has really put Canada in a corner,"" he said.

Asked why Canada is giving China access to its automotive market, Carney said that China produces ""some of the most affordable and energy-efficient vehicles in the world"". He said he expects the deal will spur Chinese investment into Canada's auto industry, though he did not provide further details.

Trump himself has signalled openness to China building plants in the US if it means creating more jobs for Americans, despite his tough-on-China stance.

""If they want to come in and build a plant and hire you and hire your friends and your neighbours, that's great, I love that,"" Trump said at the Detroit Economic Club on Tuesday. ""Let China come in, let Japan come in.""

The US president is notably headed to Beijing for his own meeting with President Xi Jinping in April. He has also invited Xi for a state visit to Washington.

For Carney, though, Friday's deal may just be the first step in a ""recalibration"" of Canada's trade relations.

TOP NEWS IN ENERGY UN/AFFORDABILITY

STATE NEWS

NEW YORK GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES WINS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND FOR NEW YORKERS: In her State of the State address, New York Governor Kathy Hochul proposed a historic $3.75 billion investment into clean water infrastructure and a $425 million investment in the state Environmental Protection Fund. She also proposed various energy reforms such as improving programs to help New Yorkers lower their energy bills and promoting clean electric vehicles, as well as climate resilience initiatives, including helping communities be more prepared for flooding. Notably, Hochul also announced plans to establish critical ratepayer protections against large energy users, especially AI data centers, by requiring them to pay their fair share for the energy they use or generate their own power to lower the cost burden on New York residents.

NYLCV TAKE: New York LCV said, “Governor Hochul’s State of the State underscores New York’s commitment to energy affordability, consumer protection, and advancing public health through critical infrastructure upgrades. We applaud the Governor’s historic $3.75 billion investment in water infrastructure and a $425 million EPF, as well as her commitment to energy affordability programs like Empower+ and the deployment of funds to make our communities more resilient to flooding. We appreciate the need to streamline environmental review and permitting to support affordable housing and other critical infrastructure but it must be done carefully; we look forward to seeing the details and working together to ensure that solutions do not compromise on environmental protections. We urge the administration and Legislature to build on these measures by investing another $1 billion in the Sustainable Future Fund including $200 million for thermal energy networks, advancing the Accelerate Solar for Affordable Power (ASAP) Act and automated solar permitting, and delivering permitting reform and increasing support for battery storage – proven solutions that align with the Governor’s agenda of cutting burdensome red tape and delivering clean, affordable energy for New Yorkers.”

TAKE 2: New York LCV said on X, “@GovKathyHochul announces in her #StateOfTheState that data centers will pay their fair share for the power they use & they’ll ultimately generate their own clean energy. We hope the final budget requires them to add 100% renewable energy to the grid to power their operations.”

SOUTH CAROLINA REGULATORS APPROVE RATE HIKE: While the cost of living is at an all-time high in South Carolina, regulators have approved an electricity rate hike that will further increase energy bills for families. While the approved rate hike is smaller than the utility’s original proposal, South Carolinians can’t afford to keep seeing their energy bills go up.

NATIONAL NEWS

GOVERNORS DEMAND ELECTRICITY GRID REFORM: Governors of all 13 states in the nation’s largest electricity grid signed onto a bipartisan document with President Trump calling on regional grid operator, PJM, to enact significant reforms to address high energy prices in the wake of rapid data center buildout. LCV and our state affiliates are continuing to push PJM to bring more renewable energy, the cheapest, clean, and fastest form of energy to deploy, online to meet rising energy demand.

OUR TAKE: LCV Senior Director of State Climate and Equity Policy Lashelle Johnson said, “Today’s announcement shows that public pressure still works, but what happens next will determine whether people enjoy lower prices and cleaner communities sooner, or if they are locked in to waiting for dirtier and more expensive energy. We have been calling for data centers and tech companies to pay their fair share and to power with clean energy because sources like solar, wind, and battery storage are the cheapest and fastest ways to get more electricity onto the grid.

“Governors should use their authority to ensure data centers power operations with cheap solar and batteries and meet state clean energy goals. People understand data centers are one of the reasons electricity prices are skyrocketing and are rightly demanding solutions that can address this problem as quickly as possible. Today’s announcement only underscores why the Trump administration’s war on clean energy needs to end.”

CVPA TAKE: Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania Executive Director Molly Parzen said, “This action, supported by a bipartisan group of regional governors, follows the lead of Governor Shapiro’s previous steps to protect Pennsylvanians from out of control electric bills by negotiating a price cap on the PJM capacity auction. While this deal represents meaningful progress, we must continue to push for long-term solutions. Bringing more clean, renewable energy online will counter rising prices from increased demand, particularly from data centers. And while we agree that data centers must bring their own energy to Pennsylvania in order to keep our rates from further skyrocketing, that energy must be from clean and renewable sources that are the cheapest and fastest to bring online. We applaud this attempt to get PJM to do right by their customers, and strongly encourage Governor Shapiro and the state legislature to keep pushing for additional protections for workers, impacted communities, and our environment.”

OEC TAKE: Ohio Environmental Council CEO Carol Kauffman said, “Though this is meaningful progress, these actions alone will not achieve the affordable, reliable, and clean energy grid Ohioans deserve. The next critical step is clear: PJM must accelerate interconnection for existing clean energy projects stuck in its bureaucratic process. The bottom line? We urgently require more energy at an accelerated pace. Fortunately, market-driven solutions are already available. We must address the energy affordability crisis for millions of people living in the PJM territory by deploying cheap, clean energy as fast as possible.”

OFFSHORE WIND TRIUMPHS OVER TRUMP IN COURT: Federal courts ruled against the Trump administration to allow construction to resume on three offshore wind projects off the East Coast, Revolution Wind, Empire Wind, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind. The court rulings come after the president froze construction in late December. This is a huge win for the offshore wind industry and clean, affordable energy on the East Coast. Two additional offshore wind projects halted by the Trump administration are also challenging the order in court.

NYLCV TAKE: New York LCV said, “Today’s court ruling is a clear victory for New York workers, families, and our clean energy future. NYLCV applauds the decision allowing Empire Wind to resume construction, and we urge swift and similar action for Sunrise Wind and the other projects across the East Coast… We look forward to workers returning to the job without further delay and to the courts ultimately rejecting the Trump Administration’s unlawful attempt to kill clean energy jobs and halt fully permitted projects.”

VALCV TAKE: Virginia LCV Director of Advocacy and Campaigns Blair St. Ledger-Olson said, “Virginia needs more, not less, affordable clean energy and today’s ruling helps make that happen. When complete, this offshore wind project will be the nation’s largest, powering hundreds of thousands of Virginia homes with clean, renewable energy, while creating hundreds of jobs and billions of dollars of investment in our economy. The Trump Administration’s continued obstruction of clean energy projects may be good for his fossil fuel donors, but it hurts Virginians, saddling us with higher energy bills and dirtier air while killing good-paying jobs. We are pleased that CVOW has been allowed to proceed and look forward to continuing to unlock more clean energy off our coast, and securing offshore wind as an economic driver well into the future.”

MEMBERS OF CONGRESS INTRODUCE BICAMERAL PROTECTING TAXPAYERS FROM RISKY INVESTMENTS IN VENEZUELA ACT: Senator Jeff Merkley (OR) and Representative Mike Levin (CA-49) introduced the Protecting Taxpayers from Risky Investments in Venezuela Act in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The legislation aims to ensure taxpayers aren’t on the hook for the cost of building dirty, expensive fossil fuel infrastructure in Venezuela for the benefit of Trump’s fossil fuel donors.

OUR TAKE: LCV Senior Federal Advocacy Campaigns Director Leah Donahey said, “Taxpayers in the U.S. shouldn’t be forced to pay for Big Oil infrastructure — period. Trump’s proposal to invest taxpayer dollars subsidizing overseas oil and gas projects will help line the pockets of his Big Polluter friends and do zero to lower everyday expenses for families here at home. Energy prices are up 13% under President Trump and yet he is abusing his power and banning clean energy projects to give handouts to wealthy oil executives, when what we need is to invest in the fastest and cheapest energy to bring online — clean energy — and the good-paying jobs it creates. We applaud Senator Merkley and Representative Levin for introducing these bills and urge Congress to pass this legislation that helps to protect taxpayer dollars from funding Big Polluters.”

CLIMATE ATTACKS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

EPA TO PRIORITIZE PROFITS OVER HUMAN LIFE: EPA announced it will stop considering the monetary value of health effects from air pollution (e.g. human lives saved or lost) when setting pollution limits. This is a reversal of decades of precedent in which the agency has used the benefits to human health, including fewer asthma attacks and premature deaths, to show the value of setting rules to limit pollution. This means they won’t tell the public how many more people will die and be sickened by their lax air pollution limits, which contradict EPA’s mission to protect public health and the environment, and prioritizes polluting industries’ profits while making our air dirtier.

OUR TAKE: LCV said on Bluesky, “This administration makes it abundantly clear every single day that they have zero regard for the health and well-being of the American people.”

EPA MOVES TO LIMIT STATE AND TRIBAL ABILITY TO SAFEGUARD CLEAN WATER: EPA proposed a rule to limit the scope of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which gives states and Tribes the authority to veto large projects that could result in more pollution in their water.

OUR TAKE: LCV Healthy Communities Government Affairs Advocate Lizzy Duncan said, “The Trump administration has proven time and time again that they will say and do whatever it takes to eliminate environmental safeguards and pad the pockets of their polluter allies at the expense of the health and safety of our communities. This latest proposal would strip states and Tribes of their right to protect their waterways from health harming pollution. The proposal is especially galling after the administration pointed to states’ rights as a key reason to undermine the Waters of the United States’ rule. This administration’s continued assault on the Clean Water Act threatens our communities and economic growth. It will make our waters dirtier and families sicker at a time when healthcare costs are already going up for millions. Protecting access to clean water is popular among families and communities across the country and communities need stronger clean water safeguards, instead of handouts to corporate polluters. The Trump administration should abandon this horrible proposal.”

HOUSE PASSES SHOWER ACT: The House passed the SHOWER Act, lifting water efficiency regulations for showerheads. People across the country are already struggling to pay their utility bills, and this legislation will drive bills even higher. Prior to the vote, LCV sent a letter to members of the House urging them to oppose the bill.

OUR TAKE: From the letter, “[This bill] would effectively eliminate already-attained federal showerhead efficiency standards by changing the legal definition of a showerhead to allow higher overall water use. This will result in higher household water and energy costs, place additional strain on water and energy infrastructure, and shift costs onto consumers and utilities, with disproportionately high burdens on renters and low income households.”

DOE REALLOCATES $500 MILLION FROM BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE LAW TO BOLSTER COAL: The Department of Energy (DOE) announced its illegitimate plans to use more than half a billion dollars in funding Congress had earmarked for programs to improve energy resiliency and environmental protection in rural America to instead prop up outdated and obsolete coal plants.

ICYMI: STATE NEWS

NEW JERSEY GRANTS $32 MILLION FOR ELECTRIC BUSES, CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE: New Jersey has issued $32 million in grants to fund 53 electric school buses, 41 fast chargers, and 26 public charging stations for electric vehicles. This investment will reduce pollution from transportation in the state.

NEW JERSEY LCV ANNOUNCES INTERIM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR: Following Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill’s announcement that New Jersey LCV Executive Director Ed Potosnak will serve as the commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, New Jersey LCV named Allison McLeod as the organization’s interim executive director. McLeod has served as the organization’s deputy director.

ICYMI: NATIONAL NEWS

SENATE PASSES THREE BILL APPROPRIATIONS MINIBUS: The Senate has passed a three bill minibus including the Interior-Environment, Energy-Water, and Commerce-Justice-Science bills. These bills avoided the worst of the cuts to environmental programs and poison-pill riders Republican lawmakers sought to attach. The legislation is now on the president’s desk.

OUR TAKE: Ahead of the bills’ passage in the House last week, LCV Legislative Director David Shadburn said, “This hard-fought compromise is a crucial step forward in blocking dozens of the worst partisan attacks. Congress must rein in Donald Trump and Russell Vought’s continued abuse of power and ensure that agencies are doing the work of the people as mandated by Congress. Quickly passing bipartisan funding bills is our strongest defense against the attacks on our core institutions of environmental protection. We are grateful to the members of Congress and their staff for working overtime to negotiate truly bipartisan funding bills that will help protect our air, water, and public lands.”

ONE YEAR OF TRUMP’S COSTLY SECOND TERM: Next week marks the first full year of Trump’s second term. Over the past year, Trump has consistently prioritized his polluter cronies over people and the planet, jacking up our energy costs and jeopardizing the health and safety of our communities and environment. LCV released a memo detailing how Trump and congressional Republicans have increased our costs over the last year.

OUR TAKE: From the memo, “Across the country, families are paying more. For electricity, for insurance, for health care, for housing…the list goes on. These rising costs aren’t abstract, and they aren’t accidental. They are the result of a series of policy choices that have shifted the costs of dirty energy, pollution, and climate damage onto families, workers, and taxpayers, while handing out gifts and giveaways to polluters.”

That has had competitors concerned even before Canada this week agreed to cut its tariffs on Chinese EVs in exchange for concessions on Canadian farm products.

Experts now say an easier path into Canada could be a big boost for Chinese carmakers looking to dominate the global market — particularly as their domestic market weakens. That poses a threat to other auto manufacturers, particularly American companies.

U.S. officials acknowledged that in remarks at an assembly plant for Jeep-maker Stellantis in Toledo, Ohio on Friday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Chinese Communist Party invests in its auto industry to “control this industry.”

“Why? They want to take over the auto industry. They want to take away these jobs,” Duffy said. As far as the Canadian trade deal, he added: “They will live to regret the day they partner with China and bring in their vehicles.”

Others say the shift is inevitable.

“This is telling us that Chinese automakers continue to be really popular, and are doing better and better, and not just something that’s sold in global markets that are more marginal or less important to U.S. automakers,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

What makes Chinese vehicles stand out?

Chinese-made vehicles are high-quality, stylish and inexpensive, experts say.

“It’s clear that the vehicles made by Chinese brands come at a very competitive cost, but are also technologically quite desirable,” Mazzocco said. “They tend to be connected vehicles, so they have a lot of additional software capabilities that consumers seem to like. But the price point and the competitiveness are really big selling points.”

These vehicles can cost as little as $10,000 to $20,000; in the U.S., new vehicles are running close to $50,000 on average, and EVs even more so.

Chinese companies also have unique advantages as far as auto manufacturing and production, efficiency and making vehicles lighter, which helps extend an electrified vehicle’s driving range.

“They’ve found a way to make small and mid-sized cars — cars that people want — at a reasonable price,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “These are the segments where GM and Ford and almost everybody else have abandoned.”

Many automakers have discontinued smaller vehicles in favor of higher-margin, large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that are far more profitable.

So why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?

Much of the global auto market is electrifying, an ideal opportunity for advanced Chinese automakers to capitalize on. China saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles in 2025, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week, and Europe saw a 33% increase.

Meanwhile, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year. As the rest of the world advances, U.S. automakers have weakened their once-ambitious, multibillion dollar electrification plans, instead opting for more efficient hybrid electric and gasoline vehicles amid the Trump administration’s shift away from EV-friendly policy.

That shift threatens U.S. automakers’ competitive edge in the coming years. As is, Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker last year, delivering only 1.64 million vehicles in 2025 to Chinese rival BYD’s 2.26 million.

Trump administration policy slashing emissions rules at a time when Chinese companies are advancing quickly has experts worried for the future of American car manufacturers.

Chinese automakers will have to meet standards required for the Canadian auto market for the latest trade arrangement to be successful — standards that are similar to those in the U.S. — which is likely to incentivize Chinese auto manufacturing investment in Canada.

They’ll also have to establish which segment of the market they are targeting there: Higher-end vehicles, or less-expensive ones that sell at higher volumes.

Regardless, “It brings it home to what is needed to compete globally,” said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at AlixPartners. The firm predicts Chinese brands will account for 30% of the global market by 2030.

“They’ve already started in Europe. They started in South America. Now Mexico and Canada,” Wakefield said. American carmakers “don’t want to end up as a Brazil with your ethanol-based cars that aren’t sellable anywhere else in the world and … like Britain or Australia that used to matter in the auto world, and no longer really matter.”

Why have others sought to regulate Chinese EV-makers’ expansion?

Countries have attempted to regulate Chinese EVs from entering their markets for several reasons.

“China has become this overwhelming machine making inexpensive vehicles. And the fear is that if you give them an inch, they’re going to take a mile,” Fiorani said. “The other issue is technology. These vehicles are data centers… and the idea that a state-owned company in China could have access to where a high portion of drivers are going gives them leverage for all kinds of outlets.”

The European Union hiked tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, though the two have been resolving that at the start of this year.

In 2024, former President Joe Biden set a 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars. Canada matched that import tax on the vehicles until this week. And even with an annual import cap, Canada cutting its tariffs this week means those companies are another step closer to U.S. soil. The Mexican auto market has welcomed Chinese EVs, with massive growth last year.

“The advance of Chinese manufacturers is inevitable. It will happen eventually. Everybody is negotiating to put up the roadblocks to figure out: What data is being processed, how much market share you’re going to allow Chinese manufacturers to have?” Fiorani added.

“There are a lot of guardrails that have to be put up, but eventually they’re going to make their way into all Western markets.”

Musk's artificial intelligence startup created a kind of off-grid power plant for its Colossus facility by using a cluster of gas-burning turbines. The company was able to avoid air pollution permitting by classifying the turbines, which were mounted on trailers, as ""non-road engines.""

The EPA's updated rule clarifies that those kinds of turbines can't be designated as non-road engines and companies must also obtain Clean Air Act permits before installing them, particularly if their aggregate emissions will go above ""major source thresholds"" of pollution.

The Shelby County Health Department in Memphis previously allowed xAI to designate its turbines as non-road engines, and to start using them without any public comment and environmental impact review, as would have been required in a standard permitting process.

Representatives from the county's health department and xAI didn't respond to requests for comment.

The move by the federal regulator could slow xAI's expansion in the Memphis area as it builds out facilities, packed with Nvidia's graphics processing units, to develop AI models and services in a booming generative AI market currently led by OpenAI and Google .

At the Memphis data center, which first opened in 2024, xAI conducts inference and training for its Grok models and apps, including a chatbot and image generator tightly integrated into the company's social network X.

While xAI had previously told Memphis regulators that its turbines would include state-of-the-art pollution controls, known as selective catalytic reduction technology, its supplier, Solaris Energy Infrastructure told CNBC in June that it did not install such controls in xAI's ""temporary"" turbines.

SEI, a Houston-based energy services provider, has seen its stock price soar in recent months, partly due to xAI's expansion plans. SEI didn't respond to a request for comment.

Pollution from the turbines has been a major source of local contention.

Last year, residents in the majority-Black community of Boxtown in South Memphis testified at public hearings about a rotten egg-like stench in the air, and the impact of worsening smog on their heart and lung health.

Research by scientists at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville also found that xAI's turbine use added to air pollution woes around Memphis.

Environmental advocates, including the NAACP, said they would sue to stop xAI's unpermitted use of the turbines. However, they didn't file a complaint after the county allowed xAI to treat the turbines as temporary, non-road engines, and issued them permits.

Canadian company TransAlta’s coal-burning power plant in Centralia, Washington, shut down Dec. 19, according to grid data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The plant has not re-started since then, despite a Dec. 16 emergency order from U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright to keep operating.

Washington state officials are challenging the Trump administration’s emergency order.

A state law enacted in 2011 required the Centralia plant to shut down by Dec. 31, while a 2019 law prohibits utilities from selling coal-based power in the state after 2025.

“There's no emergency,” said attorney Kelly Wood with the Washington Attorney General’s Office. “The authority that they're drawing upon here is reserved for times of war and times of actual, imminent emergency situations. So think of things like hurricanes, earthquakes.”

The Washington AG’s Office has requested the U.S. Department of Energy revoke the emergency order.

“The notion that there's some imminent threat of power loss in the Northwest is just false,” Wood said. “It's been a very wet season so far, and our reservoirs are all above capacity, and so hydropower is very abundant currently.”

The energy department has 30 days to reply before the state can sue to overturn the order.

Six environmental groups have filed a separate request with the Department of Energy seeking to revoke the emergency order.

Trump administration officials claim the coal power is needed because much of the country is at elevated risk of blackouts if extreme weather simultaneously hits broad stretches of the nation.

The energy department’s press office declined an interview request.

“The Trump Administration is committed to preventing the premature retirement of baseload power plants and building as much reliable, dispatchable generation as possible to achieve energy dominance,” Energy Department spokesperson Caroline Murzin said by email.

Officials with TransAlta, headquartered in Alberta, did not respond to interview requests.

Under the Federal Power Act, the secretary of energy can issue emergency orders effective for up to 90 days to stabilize the power grid.

The Trump administration has forced a coal-burning plant in Michigan to keep running since May by issuing three consecutive 90-day orders.

Sponsored

The TransAlta emergency order expires March 16.

Lauren McCloy with the Northwest Energy Coalition, one of the nonprofit groups challenging the emergency order, said the Centralia plant is typically idled each spring, when high flows on the Columbia River produce an abundance of cheap hydropower.

McCloy said the plant appears to be in “cold standby” mode—shut down but able to be switched back on again.

“They have been planning for the shutdown of this plant for a long time, and so they've deferred maintenance at the plant,” she said. “They have not been out shopping for a new coal contract. We don't really know what the status is of the ability for them to get more coal or to keep the plant operating.”

On Dec. 9, TransAlta announced it had reached a deal with Puget Sound Energy, Washington’s largest utility, to convert the Centralia plant and run it on natural gas for another 16 years. If that conversion takes place, the plant would become Washington’s largest gas-burning power plant.

Sponsored

The company’s website says the coal-to-gas conversion project “remains a priority for TransAlta.”

Natural gas produces less carbon dioxide and other pollutants when burned than coal does, but upstream leaks of methane, a climate super-pollutant, can make gas as harmful to the climate as coal.

Though the Centralia plant was considered a “baseload” source of electricity — more reliable than intermittent sources like wind or solar power — grid data shows it had shut down entirely for the first week of December before shutting down again on Dec. 19.

“The plant is affected by market conditions,” McCloy said. “Presumably, the reason the plant wasn't running during that time was because Puget Sound Energy didn't need the power, and the plant was not competitive with the other power that was available on the market.”

Sponsored

Puget Sound Energy and TransAlta had a long-term purchase agreement that expired Dec. 31.

Competition has pushed many coal plants out of business nationwide and replaced them with cheaper, gas-fired plants and wind turbines.

Blocking the nation’s aging coal plants from retiring would cost electricity consumers between $3 billion and $6 billion annually over the next three years, according to a report commissioned by environmental groups.

A Department of Energy fact sheet on Thursday said the Trump administration was “ending the war on beautiful, clean coal”— President Trump’s preferred term for the dirtiest of fossil fuels — by preventing the closure of five coal power plants.

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but it is patently false to call coal “clean.”

In 2023, despite having only one of its two boilers running, the Centralia plant was Washington’s largest source of heat-trapping carbon dioxide and of health-threatening pollutants including particulates, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and mercury, according to the Washington Department of Ecology.

On Dec. 29, TransAlta Centralia Vice President Mickey Dreher signed an agreement with the Washington Department of Ecology to clean up hazardous waste from 55 years of burning coal at the site.

Combustion of fossil fuels is the primary cause of the earth’s warming climate.

According to the Washington State Climate Office, 2025 was the state’s second-warmest year on record, with December 2025 its warmest December on record.

International scientific organizations reported in January that the last 11 years have been the hottest 11 years on record, with the pollution-induced warming accelerating in 2023, 2024, and 2025.

Wright said in a statement that President Trump had ""asked governors across the Mid-Atlantic to come together and call upon PJM to allow America to build big reliable power plants again.""

He promised that the directives would ""restore affordable and reliable electricity so American families thrive and America's manufacturing industries once again boom.""

JOHN, Associated Press",,,,,https://whnt.com/business/ap-business/ap-chinese-evs-are-making-inroads-in-north-america-that-worries-industry-experts/,"DETROIT (AP) — Chinese automakers have been making inroads around the world with growing sales of their high-tech, stylish and affordable electric vehicles.

The Mexican auto market has welcomed Chinese EVs, with massive growth last year.","DETROIT (AP) — Chinese automakers have been making inroads around the world with growing sales of their high-tech, stylish and affordable electric vehicles. That has had competitors concerned even before Canada this week agreed to cut its tariffs on Chinese EVs in exchange for concessions on Canadian farm products.

Experts now say an easier path into Canada could be a big boost for Chinese carmakers looking to dominate the global market — particularly as their domestic market weakens. That poses a threat to other auto manufacturers, particularly American companies.

U.S. officials acknowledged that in remarks at an assembly plant for Jeep-maker Stellantis in Toledo, Ohio on Friday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Chinese Communist Party invests in its auto industry to “control this industry.”

“Why? They want to take over the auto industry. They want to take away these jobs,” Duffy said. As far as the Canadian trade deal, he added: “They will live to regret the day they partner with China and bring in their vehicles.”

Others say the shift is inevitable.

“This is telling us that Chinese automakers continue to be really popular, and are doing better and better, and not just something that’s sold in global markets that are more marginal or less important to U.S. automakers,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

What makes Chinese vehicles stand out?

Chinese-made vehicles are high-quality, stylish and inexpensive, experts say.

“It’s clear that the vehicles made by Chinese brands come at a very competitive cost, but are also technologically quite desirable,” Mazzocco said. “They tend to be connected vehicles, so they have a lot of additional software capabilities that consumers seem to like. But the price point and the competitiveness are really big selling points.”

These vehicles can cost as little as $10,000 to $20,000; in the U.S., new vehicles are running close to $50,000 on average, and EVs even more so.

Chinese companies also have unique advantages as far as auto manufacturing and production, efficiency and making vehicles lighter, which helps extend an electrified vehicle’s driving range.

“They’ve found a way to make small and mid-sized cars — cars that people want — at a reasonable price,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “These are the segments where GM and Ford and almost everybody else have abandoned.”

Many automakers have discontinued smaller vehicles in favor of higher-margin, large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that are far more profitable.

So why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?

Much of the global auto market is electrifying, an ideal opportunity for advanced Chinese automakers to capitalize on. China saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles in 2025, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week, and Europe saw a 33% increase.

Meanwhile, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year. As the rest of the world advances, U.S. automakers have weakened their once-ambitious, multibillion dollar electrification plans, instead opting for more efficient hybrid electric and gasoline vehicles amid the Trump administration’s shift away from EV-friendly policy.

That shift threatens U.S. automakers’ competitive edge in the coming years. As is, Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker last year, delivering only 1.64 million vehicles in 2025 to Chinese rival BYD’s 2.26 million.

Trump administration policy slashing emissions rules at a time when Chinese companies are advancing quickly has experts worried for the future of American car manufacturers.

Chinese automakers will have to meet standards required for the Canadian auto market for the latest trade arrangement to be successful — standards that are similar to those in the U.S. — which is likely to incentivize Chinese auto manufacturing investment in Canada.

They’ll also have to establish which segment of the market they are targeting there: Higher-end vehicles, or less-expensive ones that sell at higher volumes.

Regardless, “It brings it home to what is needed to compete globally,” said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at AlixPartners. The firm predicts Chinese brands will account for 30% of the global market by 2030.

“They’ve already started in Europe. They started in South America. Now Mexico and Canada,” Wakefield said. American carmakers “don’t want to end up as a Brazil with your ethanol-based cars that aren’t sellable anywhere else in the world and … like Britain or Australia that used to matter in the auto world, and no longer really matter.”

Why have others sought to regulate Chinese EV-makers’ expansion?

Countries have attempted to regulate Chinese EVs from entering their markets for several reasons.

“China has become this overwhelming machine making inexpensive vehicles. And the fear is that if you give them an inch, they’re going to take a mile,” Fiorani said. “The other issue is technology. These vehicles are data centers… and the idea that a state-owned company in China could have access to where a high portion of drivers are going gives them leverage for all kinds of outlets.”

The European Union hiked tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, though the two have been resolving that at the start of this year.

In 2024, former President Joe Biden set a 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars. Canada matched that import tax on the vehicles until this week. And even with an annual import cap, Canada cutting its tariffs this week means those companies are another step closer to U.S. soil. The Mexican auto market has welcomed Chinese EVs, with massive growth last year.

“The advance of Chinese manufacturers is inevitable. It will happen eventually. Everybody is negotiating to put up the roadblocks to figure out: What data is being processed, how much market share you’re going to allow Chinese manufacturers to have?” Fiorani added.

“There are a lot of guardrails that have to be put up, but eventually they’re going to make their way into all Western markets.”

“Today’s announcement that DENSO is making a long-term $69 million investment in our community is great news for Wilson County,” said Wilson County Mayor Randall Hutto.","Laser Isotope Separation (LIS) Technologies plans to invest $1.38 billion to expand in Roane County, Tennessee. The company will create 203 jobs in Oak Ridge, on the formerly named Duct Island. The project is the third-largest nuclear-related investment since the creation of Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development’s (TNECD) Nuclear Energy Fund.

Upon completion, the Oak Ridge facility, which will locate on the historic K-25 uranium enrichment site, is intended to become the first U.S.-origin commercial laser uranium enrichment plant in the world, supporting U.S. utilities, next-generation reactor developers and national defense requirements while helping to reestablish a resilient domestic nuclear fuel supply chain.

“Selecting Oak Ridge is both a strategic and symbolic decision for LIS Technologies,” remarked Jay Yu, executive chairman and CEO, LIS Technologies. “This community represents the foundation of America’s enrichment capability and the future of its clean energy and national security mission. Our laser enrichment technology fundamentally changes the economics of enrichment, enabling faster deployment, lower capital intensity and long-term cost advantages. With our NRC licensing process underway, we are moving deliberately toward construction readiness and positioning the U.S. to lead the world in commercial laser enrichment.”

“This investment represents more than the construction of a single facility,” said Christo Liebenberg, president and co-founder, LIS Technologies. “It reflects a commitment to restoring a critical domestic capability, advancing peaceful nuclear technologies and strengthening the U.S.’ competitiveness in an evolving global energy landscape. As global demand for nuclear fuel grows and existing supply tightens, the opportunity – and responsibility – to act is clear. This project is a meaningful step toward reestablishing U.S. enrichment capacity and rebuilding the nuclear fuel cycle.”

The project underscores Oak Ridge’s role in America’s nuclear enterprise and reinforces Tennessee’s position at the forefront of the nation’s efforts to rebuild domestic uranium enrichment capacity critical to U.S. energy and national security.

The announcement follows recent funding LIS Technologies received from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). In 2024, the company was selected by the DOE as one of six domestic companies to participate in the Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU) Enrichment Acquisition Program. This initiative allocates up to $3.4 billion in funding, with contracts anticipated to last up to 10 years.

Founded in 2023 with its office and laser enrichment research and development headquartered in Oak Ridge in the recently renovated K-1330 building, LIS Technologies is the seventh company to locate in Tennessee for its commercial operations utilizing the Nuclear Energy Fund.

The $50 million fund was in Gov. Lee’s recommended 2023-2024 budget and approved by the Tennessee General Assembly. An additional $10 million was allocated and approved in the state’s budget during both the 2024 and 2025 legislative sessions, bringing the fund’s total to $70 million since its inception.

“Tennessee is leading the nation in advancing American energy independence, which is why innovative companies like LIS Technologies are choosing to do business here,” commented Governor Bill Lee. “By creating the Nuclear Energy Fund, we have uniquely positioned our state at the forefront of cutting-edge research and development, and I look forward to the opportunity this expansion will create for Tennesseans.”

“This investment reflects the continued momentum of Tennessee’s nuclear sector and builds on a strong year for nuclear energy in our state,” said Deputy Gov. and Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development (TNECD) Commissioner Stuart C. McWhorter. “LIS Technologies’ nearly $1.4 billion investment is a major win for Tennessee, and we believe Oak Ridge is uniquely positioned to support this project’s success. I am grateful to the leadership of LIS Technologies and to our partners in Oak Ridge for helping bring today’s announcement to fruition.”

DENSO To Invest $69M In New Lebanon Manufacturing Facility

Mobility supplier DENSO will invest $69 million to build an advanced logistics center in Lebanon, TN. The project will retain 100 jobs in the area and position DENSO to optimize its operations, enhance competitiveness, and better serve customers across North America.

The new 280,000-square-foot facility, targeted to break ground in summer 2026 and open in spring 2027, will replace DENSO’s current operation in Wilson County with a larger, more technologically advanced space. All current team members in Wilson County will have the opportunity to transition to the new location in a phased timeline, ensuring continuity for DENSO’s workforce and operations.

The project is supported by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the Joint Economic & Community Development Board of Wilson County (JECDB).

“We thank TVA and our local Wilson County partners for their support of our investment in Lebanon, which marks a significant milestone for DENSO and our Tennessee operations,” said Tomoyuki “Tom” Arakawa, CEO of DENSO in North America and an executive officer of DENSO Corporation. “Through this new, cutting-edge facility, we’ll not only improve how we deliver to customers but also create new opportunities for our team to work with the latest robotics and automation technologies. It’s a win-win that sets up our customers and team for future success.”

Marty Deschenes, North America chief manufacturing officer and an executive vice president at DENSO, added, “The transformation of our Wilson County operation is about more than a new building. It’s about empowering our team members, improving our speed and flexibility and, ultimately, advancing DENSO into a new era of operational excellence.”

“Congratulations to DENSO on its decision to expand operations in Wilson County. TVA, Middle Tennessee Electric, JECDB, along with its many partners have a shared commitment to supporting economic growth in the communities we serve,” said Heidi Smith, senior vice president of Economic Development, TVA. “We are proud to celebrate this announcement today and look forward to DENSO’s continued success in the region.”

The new facility will feature advanced safety and security systems, a climate-controlled environment, dedicated locker rooms, and expanded break areas, reflecting DENSO’s ongoing efforts to enhance the workplace experience for its team members. The update advances DENSO’s broader strategy to standardize and strengthen its manufacturing operations while aligning its distribution network with the company’s long-term priorities. This approach will be continuously refined to ensure it meets the evolving needs of customers and team members.

“Today’s announcement that DENSO is making a long-term $69 million investment in our community is great news for Wilson County,” said Wilson County Mayor Randall Hutto. “We work hard to recruit and retain world-class employers in Wilson County, and when a company like DENSO, which has never laid off a full-time associate in their over 35-year history in Tennessee, commits to not only retain but elevate already high-quality jobs, it shows that we’re succeeding.”",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/lis-technologies.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 20:59:27.935270

Louisiana Impact Fund Launched

Louisiana Impact Fund I, LLC (LIF, or the Fund) announced its initial closing and launch of a Louisiana-based, lower middle-market private equity fund dedicated to investing in companies located in or meaningfully connected to Louisiana. Led by Co-Founders and Managing Partners Joseph Seremet, Jared Quoyeser and Joshua Cummings, LIF is targeting $100 million in total capitalization focused exclusively on acquiring and growing businesses located in the state.

“Our purpose is simple: help founders and owners scale or transition their companies without handing ownership and decision making to out-of-state buyers,” said Jared Quoyeser, Co-Founder and Managing Partner. “We will measure success ﬁrst by returns, and second by how we grow and keep headquarters, wealth, jobs, and next-generation leaders here at home.”

The Fund’s anchor limited partners include leading Louisiana employers, family offices and civic institutions committed to keeping ownership and jobs in-state. The limited partners include Acadian Ambulance Service; John E. Atkins; Business First Bancshares; Scott Ballard; Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana; Rock Bordelon; Bradley and Henry Busch; Daryl Deshotel; JJPF Investments; North Louisiana Economic Partnership; Ochsner Health; Reilly Family; Stream Family; Bryan Schroder; and Heidi Raines (Redmond).

Though not an investor, Louisiana Economic Development (LED) is a key partner that will also help the fund support and identify promising companies and deal opportunities.

“The Louisiana Impact Fund reflects our commitment to helping businesses grow, expand and remain a part of our state’s economy,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “When ownership and decision-making stay here at home, we create quality jobs, attract new investment and strengthen community leadership across the state. This partnership shows the power of Louisiana-led growth and our shared focus on creating lasting opportunity for our people.”

LIF will invest in established Louisiana businesses through majority or significant minority positions — especially founder transitions, recapitalizations and growth capital — where the Fund and its network can unlock contract-backed expansion and operational upgrades without relocating headquarters. Primary areas of focus include industrial services, engineering & construction, distributed power solutions, infrastructure/EPC, energy technology and innovation, advanced manufacturing, healthcare, logistics and software.

Jones Walker LLP serves as fund formation counsel to LIF and Bennett Thrasher serves LIF’s third-party fund administration advisor.

Site Readiness In New Mexico

Less than a year after the Site Readiness Act became law, the New Mexico Economic Development Department has evaluated 47 development sites statewide, launched a public site readiness map, and established a new board to certify sites for business expansion.

Following the passage of SB 169 (Site Readiness) and SB 170 (Utility Pre-deployment) during the 2025 legislative session, EDD moved to put the framework into action. The program focuses on preparing land for development by identifying infrastructure needs, utility access, and site conditions that support timely project delivery and job creation.

“New Mexico is ready to compete for economic development projects that create opportunities for our families,” said EDD Cabinet Secretary Rob Black. “Our site readiness program is setting the stage, so it’s easier for companies to choose New Mexico and easier for our state to win.”

EDD partnered with Global Location Strategies (GLS) to evaluate, or “characterize,” sites across the state. Working closely with local governments and tribal communities, the department assessed industrial properties and produced site-specific recommendations related to infrastructure, utilities and development readiness.

Several sites have already been identified as immediately or near-term competitive for industrial investment. In addition to the 47 sites that have been evaluated, inquiries for 12 more sites have already been submitted for the next round of evaluations.

To support transparency and business recruitment, EDD also contracted with GIS WebTech, a site selection technology company, to develop a new public site-readiness map. The map allows companies, site selectors and community partners to explore evaluated sites and better understand development opportunities across New Mexico. The map can be found on EDD’s website at EDD.NewMexico.gov/sites.

The newly created Strategic Economic Development Site Advisory Committee will oversee the grading and certification of sites as “strategic economic development sites,” making them eligible for pre-development funding and technical assistance. The committee held its first meeting earlier this month.

The next round of evaluations is scheduled to begin in February 2026 and submissions can be made online at edd.newmexico.gov/site-submit.

Arlington, Texas: Supporting Small Business

An industry-specific small business cohort, the latest free offering from the Arlington Economic Development Corporation (EDC) in Texas, connects Arlington-based small businesses to subject matter experts through programming that directly addresses their sector.

Since September 2025, there have been two cohorts — Professional Services and Construction — serving 20 Arlington businesses. The program is geared towards established companies looking to take their business to the next level.

“We strive to offer a range of programs for different levels of entrepreneurship, and thought it was especially important to provide tangible, industry-specific insights as well as information beyond just startup basics,” said Kay Brown-Patrick, Assistant Executive Director of the Arlington EDC.

“In addition to class content, the program gives participants access to networking with like-minded professionals, potential clients and key industry experts,” she said.

Bwana Thurman, CEO of financial education and technology company BluPrint Worldwide, is a graduate of the professional services cohort. “My experience was informative and enlightening. One piece that has been extremely useful to me was how to improve my client experience and do a deep dive into my analytics,” Thurman said.

For Juan F. De Leon, CEO of De Leon’s Designs and graduate of the construction cohort, the experience went a step beyond the useful information provided in sessions — it made him feel seen. “There are a lot of programs and services for more white-collar professions, but construction folks are not often well-represented. This is something that I’ve been looking for, and it felt so good that it catered to our community,” said De Leon. “I’m proud to have the certificate hanging in my office.”

The cohorts received a proclamation from Arlington Mayor Jim Ross on January 6, 2026 to recognize their work in the community and commitment to entrepreneurship.

The next cohort, geared toward the Food & Beverage industry, will take place in March 2026. To learn more about the program, visit the Business Resources page at ArlingtonTxEDC.com.

In Wyoming, AI Infrastructure Moves Forward

In July 2025, Crusoe Energy LLC, an AI infrastructure provider, announced a partnership with Tallgrass to develop a 1.8 gigawatt (GW) AI data center campus located in southeast Wyoming, in Cheyenne. Designed to scale up to 10 gigawatts, the AI data center campus was stated to leverage a diverse and robust power strategy, integrating multiple energy sources fueled by natural gas and future renewable energy developments in the region.

Last week, the Laramie County Board of Commissioners approved facilities site plans for the data center campus and power plant. Referred to as the BFC Power and Cheyenne Power Hub Project, the endeavor is led by Tallgrass Integrated Logistics Solutions LLC, a sustainable energy infrastructure company based in Denver. The power plant will provide power for the Crusoe data center campus.

Originally announced for a 1.8 gigawatt generation, the most recent news has said the initial development of the power plant will generate up to 2.7 gigawatts of electrical power.

The company’s portfolio of AI data centers includes its flagship 1.2 GW data center under construction in Abilene, Texas, and the company has broken ground on another 1+ GW campus at a new site.",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/incentives-infrastructure-update_icon.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 20:59:32.639391

Douglas explained that today’s primary short-term use in smaller manufacturers involves data aggregation to track quality and vibration analysis to extend machine motor lifespans. Even simpler, cheaper solutions include pointing a camera at an analog dial and having AI log the data.

“AI is very good at going through that data and finding correlations, telling us when things are drifting off the mean, and how to re-center them. It’s a lot of opportunity, but it creates a whole amount of other things we have to do,” Douglas said.

Douglas and Kelly also explained that large manufacturers tend to use the cloud, which raises cybersecurity and connectivity risks, requiring stronger protections around software as AI gets better at encoding process knowledge in these machines.

Kelly specifically advised those in manufacturing to “own your own destiny” by owning their own intellectual property (IP) in designs and patents, and by digitizing it for easier, more profitable distribution and production, similar to how Apple created FairPlay to monetize MP3 files.

“If we can figure out a way to protect IP so that I can have a widget and I can have it as a digital drawing in a CAD file … send you that CAD file … and you’re allowed to make one … or maybe you’re allowed to make 100,” he said, “then you get the margin, and I get the royalty, and the customer gets the product … I’ve now Amazon’ed manufacturing. And what does manufacturing become? An IP plan.”

The trio also discussed the workforce development issues in the industry. Despite what some might say, there is a lot of opportunity for apprenticeships and upskilling for new and existing workers to use AI as an efficiency tool rather than just a job replacement. Douglas and Kelly suggested that removing repetitive work for some machinists and technicians can help them become more creative and engage in higher-value problem-solving and innovation, which supports IP creation for companies.

“We have lots of apprenticeships that we’re pushing people into to try to get more and more skilled trades and upskilling,” Douglas said. “Even the people we do have, we have had to do some retraining [from multimeters to IO-links for diagnostics].”

Further, the three experts implored the audience to improve the industry’s reputation among young people by showing them that these aren’t the messy, antiquated facilities “that their parents told them about,” but instead are filled with robots and automation on a much larger scale, beyond smart lights around the house. Kelly also specifically advised older employees and leaders to be open to learning from young people, as the young adults that are coming out of school are digital natives more so than not.

“The auto industry is one of the few places where you can use AI and software and see the fruits of your labor physically manifest,” Kelly said. “It’s really cool and really powerful, and that hooks kids.”",https://michauto.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-Detroit-Auto-Show_5-feature.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 21:59:02.403393

“On one hand, the one-time commitment to support electric vehicle incentives for light-duty drivers is welcome, as it helps offset the lack of federal incentives.","Electric utilities are taking a leading role in addressing the daily affordability of electric vehicles (EV), offering direct-to-consumer subsidies and other incentives at a time when the federal government has pulled back on initiatives to bring down the cost of the vehicles.

Companies in California are planning to launch programs that would make funding available for needy households to use public EV charging networks. Meanwhile, an electricity provider in the state’s Bay Area is helping to subsidize its customers in their purchase of hundreds of electric bikes (e-bikes).

“This supports our mission to deliver clean and affordable energy by reducing the financial barriers to EV charging,” Jeff Monford, senior adviser for Corporate Communications at Edison International, parent company for electric utility Southern California Edison (SCE), said. Doing so, he added, “is the same thing as reducing the barriers to EV adoption.”

SCE, in partnership with San Diego Gas and Electric and Pacific Gas and Electric, will launch a program later this year making pre-loaded debit cards available to income-qualifying households that can prove they do not have access to home EV charging. The debit cards would provide $50 a week, up to $2,600 a year, to be used at public charging locations.

The income qualifications align with SCE’s Pre-Owned EV Rebate credit program and are based on enrollment in public assistance programs like Medi-Cal — the state’s version of Medicaid — or the CalFresh food assistance program, among others.

The program will work in partnership with utility providers in the Bay Area and the San Diego metro region, making millions of low-income households eligible for the $21.8 million, three-year initiative.

In Northern California, Ava Community Energy, a nonprofit electric utility serving about 600,000 customers in Alameda and San Joaquin counties, has issued 9,400 rebates to San Joaquin customers who purchased e-bikes. Rebates start at $400 and can reach $1,000 for income-qualified participants. Rebates for electric cargo bikes bring a higher return; they start at $900 and reach $1,500 for needy qualifiers.

So far, about 2,750 rebates have been redeemed, Lisbeth Gallegos, a marketing associate at Ava Community Energy who heads up the program, said.

“Participants report using e-bikes not just recreationally, but for everyday transportation, such as commuting, errands, and replacing short car trips, helping make biking more accessible and reducing car dependence,” Gallegos said in an email.

The EV bike rebate program launched in June, and more than 14,900 residents applied. Roughly 22 percent of those who did have been qualified based on their income. Funding is still available, and Ava intends to continue the program through December, as part of a longer-term transportation and emissions-reduction strategy, with the final random drawing currently planned for September.

These programs and others center on addressing the affordability of EVs, targeting their overall cost of ownership, a strategy advocates and policy leaders have offered as an updated talking point as the EV movement stalls or retreats in the U.S. in the face of diminished federal support.

California, the state with the largest share of EVs on the road, hopes to blunt any slowdowns in their adoption by its nearly 28 million drivers. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s latest proposed budget would allocate $200 million for EV incentive programs, largely targeting the light-duty market, a move that received mixed reviews from advocates.

“On one hand, the one-time commitment to support electric vehicle incentives for light-duty drivers is welcome, as it helps offset the lack of federal incentives. On the other hand, the budget falls woefully short when it comes to incentives for zero-emission trucks, buses, and community mobility options,” Michael Berube, CALSTART CEO, said in a statement.

The governor’s budget, Berube said, “effectively zeros out” $750 million in discretionary funding to support clean-transportation programs.

“Their size and the risks they pose to resource adequacy make today’s data centers unique,” it said.
As an incentive, the governors and Trump administration officials said the builders of new plants should be provided “revenue certainty” for 15 years.
“Reliable baseload power” is a code phrase for fossil fuel and nuclear plants for Trump administration officials, who dismiss solar and wind power as inherently unreliable.
Yesterday, elected officials held a rally in Pittsburgh denouncing the Trump administration for its failure to lower energy costs for consumers.","Rising electricity costs and the rapid build-out of energy-hungry data centers across the mid-Atlantic region brought a bipartisan group of governors to the White House Friday for an agreement on a joint action plan meant to “ensure data centers pay their fair share.” The proposal also would extend a wholesale price cap that is now in place, possibly shielding consumers from further increases.

The Trump administration laced the announcement with jabs at the Biden administration, and the plan amounted to a nonbinding deal the parties are urging the region’s grid operator, PJM Interconnection, to adopt. Environmental advocates worry that the proposal will prioritize natural gas plants over renewable energy resources that have been stuck in a bottleneck waiting for PJM’s approval to be connected to the regional grid.

Thirteen governors, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum signed a “statement of principles” saying that PJM must extend for two years a price cap that the grid operator last year agreed to place on costs related to making sure the region has enough power plant capacity to meet demand. (Mayor Muriel Bowser of the District of Columbia, also part of PJM’s region, did not participate.) It was not clear how many of the governors came to the White House meeting, and President Donald Trump himself was not scheduled to participate.

The governors’ and Trump administration’s statement said PJM should accelerate the build-out of new power plants by holding an “emergency” special auction for new capacity by September. The costs of any new capacity to serve data centers in those auctions should be allocated to the data centers, the joint statement said. “Their size and the risks they pose to resource adequacy make today’s data centers unique,” it said.

As an incentive, the governors and Trump administration officials said the builders of new plants should be provided “revenue certainty” for 15 years. Such a revenue guarantee has the potential to upend the basics of PJM’s market, which has long relied on market forces and competition to set prices.

It will be up to PJM, the nation’s largest grid operator, to decide whether to implement the plan. The governing board of PJM discussed the issue at a previously scheduled meeting in the afternoon. Late in the day, the board announced some steps that were in line with the proposal from the governors and Trump administration, including that it would initiate a “backstop generation procurement” process to address its short-term needs for more power.

PJM also said it would begin a “holistic review” of incentives throughout its market, acknowledging that it was not seeing adequate resource investment under the current framework of short-term contracts. But the grid operator said it would be seeking more feedback from stakeholders before deciding whether to extend the wholesale price cap.

“PJM is reviewing the principles set forth by the White House and governors,” the grid operator said in a prepared statement, adding the board had been deliberating on the issue for months with input from market participants. “We will work with our stakeholders to assess how the White House directive aligns with the Board’s decision.”

PJM spokesperson Jeff Shields said in an email that the grid operator was not invited to the White House meeting.

PJM manages the flow of electricity on a grid serving 67 million customers in 13 states and the District of Columbia. Electricity rates have been soaring nationwide as demand has been rising. The mid-Atlantic states have been among the hardest hit, with residential prices up 22 percent in Maryland, 16.5 percent in Pennsylvania and Virginia and 14.6 percent in New Jersey in the period from January to October 2025, the most recent data available from the Energy Information Administration.

Electricity prices were a top issue in the November election, with both New Jersey and Virginia choosing Democratic governors who pledged to get a hold on prices.

In announcing the agreement with the governors, however, the Trump administration sought to shift the blame for the prices to its predecessors and states that have voted for Democrats.

“High electricity prices are a choice,” said a fact sheet the Department of Energy issued. “Regions that aligned themselves with the Biden administration’s energy subtraction agenda and shut down reliable baseload power are paying the price.”

“For too long, the Green New Scam has left Mid-Atlantic families in the dark with skyrocketing bills,” Burgum said in a prepared statement.

But the three states that saw the highest electricity price increases—of more than 30 percent—from January to October were Oklahoma, Wyoming and North Dakota, all of which voted for Trump and all of which are fossil fuel-reliant states. “Reliable baseload power” is a code phrase for fossil fuel and nuclear plants for Trump administration officials, who dismiss solar and wind power as inherently unreliable.

The administration’s anti-renewable energy policies are adding to PJM’s woes, the grid operator indicated in a legal brief filed earlier this month. PJM said the Trump administration’s move to block offshore wind projects off the Atlantic coast was harming its ability to provide sufficient reliable power in its region.

On Friday, the federal judge in that case ruled that the project in question—Dominion Energy’s $11 billion Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project—could resume construction while the legal battle on offshore wind continues. It was the third federal court ruling against the Trump administration’s offshore wind policy in a week.

Environmental and climate action advocates said that by side-stepping any discussion of renewable energy in their statement of principles, the governors and the Trump administration were missing a major solution to the region’s electricity problems.

“The omission of clean energy from this announcement is glaring,” Julia Kortrey, director of strategic initiatives for the advocacy group Evergreen Action, said in a statement. “Clean energy sources are the fastest and cheapest way to get power online to meet skyrocketing data center demand. Without fixing PJM’s broken interconnection process and allowing ready-to-build clean energy resources onto the grid, this deal could amount to little more than a band aid over a mortal wound.”

David Masur, executive director at PennEnvironment, an environmental organization in Pennsylvania, said the agreement was not likely to “move the needle” in terms of helping Americans pay their energy bills.

“If that was the goal, I don’t think people should expect that,” he said. Even if data centers are required to build their own power plants, they will still cause major strain on grid infrastructure that was already struggling to meet rising demand and dealing with costs related to climate change and severe weather before the advent of AI.

“Holding data centers accountable and making them responsible for their own costs is a big step in the right direction,” said Elowyn Corby, the mid-Atlantic regional director at Vote Solar, an affordable-solar advocacy group.

But she cautioned that “details matter.” PJM’s absence and the non-binding aspect of the deal raise questions about how it would actually be implemented.

Corby and other clean energy advocates are concerned that by establishing a special emergency process tailored to the data center problem, the agreement could incentivize the construction of more natural gas power plants at the expense of renewable energy projects that have languished in PJM’s queue for years. Increasing the region’s reliance on natural gas would likely add to electricity costs, particularly as gas prices are set to soar in the near future because of several factors, including an increase in exports of U.S. liquified natural gas.

Claire Lang-Ree, a climate and energy advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said it was important that the fast-track process that the agreement outlined for powering data centers did not displace resources already in PJM’s interconnection queue, especially those designed to help meet state clean energy standards.

With thousands of clean energy resources waiting to join PJM, she said, “it would be really unfair to let an onslaught of things like gas plants cut in front of those resources just to privilege data centers.”

In addition to its attacks on renewable energy projects and advocacy for coal, oil and gas, the Trump administration has championed the rapid build-out of data centers. In July, Trump hailed $90 billion in private investments for artificial intelligence in Pennsylvania, calling it “a really triumphant day for the people of the Commonwealth and for the United States of America.”

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who spearheaded the litigation against PJM that led to the temporary price ceiling the grid operator put in place last year, agreed to participate in Friday’s event at the White House only if extension of that cap would be part of the principles articulated by the group, said a source familiar with the governor’s plan.

In September, Shapiro convened a conference in Philadelphia about PJM, where representatives from 11 of the 13 states that make up the membership in the grid agreed to work together to find solutions. At the time, Shapiro threatened to leave PJM if the operator did not “get serious about making significant reform.” Because Pennsylvania is the largest energy producer in the grid, leaving PJM would have serious repercussions for the states left behind.

Among the reforms Shapiro has pushed for are state influence over who serves on PJM’s board, a faster and more streamlined process for approving new power projects in PJM’s queue and changes to its capacity market.

“If PJM refuses to change, we will be forced to go in a different direction,” Shapiro said in September.

Shapiro filed his complaint against PJM in 2024 over its price hikes. The settlement reached in January 2025 lowered the capacity auction price cap by 35 percent. Shapiro said that the deal would save electricity consumers more than $21 billion over the next two years.

“The Shapiro administration can and should point to the extension of the price cap that is part of this plan as a big win that honestly wouldn’t have happened without them,” Corby said.

Affordability issues are likely to play a key role in the elections this fall, and Shapiro recently announced his campaign for reelection. In his first campaign speech in Philadelphia, Shapiro said “we’ve got to hold those companies that are trying to raise our electric bills accountable.”

Some residents have criticized the governor for his support for building more data centers in the state, arguing it’s at odds with his focus on affordable energy bills. Artificial intelligence is fueling the enormous spike in electricity demand that has sent prices skyrocketing.

Politicians like Shapiro, facing pressure from energy companies, tech corporations, labor unions and members of the public who are angry about their bills, may find it increasingly difficult to manage these competing demands. “I’m not sure that at the end of the day, they can have their cake and eat it too,” Masur said.

Yesterday, elected officials held a rally in Pittsburgh denouncing the Trump administration for its failure to lower energy costs for consumers.

“Donald Trump promised working people he would cut energy bills in half, yet what families got instead was a coordinated assault by him and congressional Republicans on the clean energy investments that lower costs, create good union jobs and protect our future,” said U.S. Rep. Summer Lee (D-Pa.), in a press release about the event.

Masur said the governors’ proposal was taking one step forward and one step back. Progress on the fundamental problem of PJM’s unapproved backlog of electricity projects would be key.

“Advocates have been flagging it for years that there’s a train coming down the track, and we can all see it coming,” and PJM hasn’t done anything about it, he said. “If we could put a man on the moon 60 years ago, PJM should be able to figure out how to get these projects moving rapidly out of their queue.”

Corby agreed with Masur’s assessment.

“This alone is not going to be enough,”Corby said. “We need structural reforms at PJM.”

On Friday, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright and US Interior Secretary (and former Microsoft exec) Doug Burgum met with mid-Atlantic governors to pressure PJM Interconnection - one of the largest grid operators in the country - to hold an emergency auction to address rising energy demand from AI datacenter developments to the tune of $15 billion.

PJM is home to the largest concentration of datacenters in the US. Many new bit barns now exceed 100 megawatts of power capacity, with the likes of OpenAI and Meta already eyeing multi-gigawatt campuses.

These buildouts have sparked fears of higher power bills for local residents, something that hasn't sat well with politicians on either side of the aisle.

Last month, a trio of Democratic senators launched a probe into why consumers were seeing higher rates despite datacenter operators' claims otherwise.

Rising energy prices haven't been popular with the US president either. On Monday, Trump used his personal echo chamber Truth Social to declare ""I never want Americans to pay higher electricity bills because of datacenters.""

The initiative launched on Friday seeks to secure new baseload power generation, with US tech titans putting up the cash for 15-year contracts.

The DoE argues such an auction is justified after PJM's decision to take 17 gigawatts of capacity offline between 2020 and 2025. Much of the capacity which was already retired or slated for retirement was produced by coal-fired steam generators, for which Trump has shown a particular affinity.

""In the coming years, America's reindustrialization and the AI race will require a significantly larger supply of around-the-clock, reliable, and uninterrupted power,"" an Energy.gov fact sheet reads. ""The United States cannot afford to continue down the unstable and dangerous path of energy subtraction previous leaders pursued, forcing the closure of baseload power sources like coal and natural gas.""

In response to the Trump administration's demands, PJM's board of managers released a plan Friday directing the grid operator's staff to ""develop a proposal to both accelerate and execute"" a backstop procurement to supplement the company's last capacity auction.

The idea of datacenters bringing their own power has gained momentum in recent months, as operators have grappled with both long-term and immediate energy demands.

These efforts have included commissioning new gas generator plants along with portable generators to serve as stopgaps. Meanwhile, hyperscalers have placed bets on nuclear power startups like Oklo or X-Energy to satisfy their long-term power demands.

In a blog post on Tuesday, Microsoft formalized its commitments to ""pay its way"" to ensure local utility customers didn't end up footing the bill.

In spite of these initiatives, supply chain challenges continue to dog operators. Gas generators offer an easy path to addressing demand, but the equipment necessary to build and deploy them is locked up, with waitlists stretching out to 2030.

Meanwhile, even the most optimistic forecasts won't see the first commercial small modular reactors come online until the end of the decade.",https://regmedia.co.uk/2016/11/15/donald_trump_arm_raised_photo_via_shutterstock.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 20:59:04.145989
