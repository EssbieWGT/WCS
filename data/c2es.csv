A climate competitiveness strategy that sidestepped emission reduction mandates for fossil fuel producers and set the stage to repeal a hard-fought cap on the industry’s carbon pollution was a centrepiece of the federal budget released in November by Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne.

The budget, titled Canada Strong, is the first produced by the government of Prime Minister Mark Carney. It reprises past promises to fast-track controversial new infrastructure projects, speed up new housing construction, and diversify the country’s trading relationships, increases military spending by $81.8 billion over five years, puts limits on the government’s commitments to sustainable finance and anti-greenwashing rules, and curtails the Trudeau government’s 2 Billion Trees program. It also lays out the broad lines of public service cutbacks that will slash $60 billion in federal spending and 40,000 jobs over five years, according to a memo issued Wednesday by the country’s top bureaucrat, Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Sabia.

The budget places those changes in the context of the “profound transformation” sweeping the global economy.

“Industrial policy, once seen as secondary to market forces, is returning to the forefront,” the budget states. “In 2024 alone, governments worldwide introduced more than 2,500 industrial policy measures reflecting a transition in how governments are protecting national security interests and securing long-term competitiveness.”

In the United States, the Trump administration “is fundamentally reshaping all of its trading relationships and putting up trade barriers, with its average tariffs across all countries rising from around 2% at the end of 2024 to 17% today.” While the budget asserts repeatedly that Canada is faring better than other countries in its on-again, now off-again negotiations with the U.S., the impact of Trump’s tariff wars is still “profound—hurting companies, displacing workers, disrupting supply chains, and causing uncertainty that is curbing investment.”

As an antidote, the budget pitches an industrial strategy that pledges new infrastructure projects, public investment in research and development, lighter regulation, and tax deductions to trigger $500 billion in private sector investment over the next five years.

Competitiveness Over Climate?

The government’s climate competitiveness strategy was originally expected in mid- to late October, then delayed and folded into the budget announcement, prompting speculation that it wasn’t as fully defined as Carney had implied in his public statements. The published version cites climate action as an “economic necessity” as well as a “moral obligation”, at a time when “the world economy is undergoing a historic transformation towards low-carbon energy and clean technology.”

The document notes that global clean energy investments hit $2 trillion last year, nearly double the total poured into fossil fuels, and cites the Canadian Climate Institute’s warning that climate change will cut household incomes by nearly 20% by century’s end if it isn’t brought under control.

The strategy acknowledges that “buyers of Canada’s resources—oil and gas, steel, and aluminum—are increasingly looking for low-carbon sourcing.” It adds that “lowering our emissions is critical to protecting the competitiveness of Canada’s oil and gas and steel sectors. Reducing emissions is not only essential for environmental reasons, but also a key factor in securing access to markets that prioritize sustainability.”

But to meet that expectation, it sets sights on limiting the carbon intensity of Canadian industry—the emissions per barrel of oil or tonne of steel—rather than achieving actual reductions in climate pollution. In a sector like Canada’s oil sands, the difference matters—if production rises faster than emissions per barrel fall, the industry’s climate footprint will continue to grow. In September, the Climate Institute reported that the Canada’s progress on emissions flatlined in 2024, largely due to rising oil sands emissions, and the industry is planning on continuing production increases into the next decade.

The budget also:

• Allocates about $1 billion in tax incentives for “low-carbon liquefied natural gas facilities” that go into operation before 2030;

• Finalizes a clean electricity investment tax credit that was first introduced in the 2023 federal budget, but anticipates no spending at all through 2030;

• Extends the existing tax credit for carbon capture and storage by five years, to an end date of 2040 instead of 2035, but schedules no spending through 2030;

• Meets longstanding calls to expand the existing Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) tax incentive system in ways that may disproportionately benefit early-stage clean technology companies;

• Cites the Darlington nuclear project outside Toronto, which will rely on uranium from the United States, as an example of “investing where it counts” in a new Buy Canada policy.

Trading Out the Emissions Cap

The budget stops short of eliminating the government’s watered-down, long-delayed cap on oil and gas emissions, but appears to trade it off for a stronger system of industrial carbon pricing and other measures meant to reduce the industry’s climate pollution.

The document says effective industrial carbon pricing is “essential to providing certainty to businesses looking to invest and compete internationally.” Already, it adds, that system “is expected to deliver more emission reductions than any other policy, with negligible impacts on affordability for Canadians.”

The budget pledges to “improve the effectiveness of carbon markets to provide confidence that credit prices will be predictable and sufficient to support clean growth investments without adversely affecting competitiveness or leading to carbon leakage.” Elements of that plan include:

• A multi-decade trajectory for industrial carbon pricing from 2030 through 2050, to be developed through engagement with provincial and territorial governments;

• Better federal benchmarks to ensure a consistent industrial carbon price across the country;

• Contracts for difference to give investors greater certainty about future carbon prices.

And to complement the industrial carbon price:

• Carrying on with the final, delayed version of federal Clean Electricity Regulations;

• Finalizing “enhanced” methane regulations for oil and gas operations and landfill sites, while allowing provincial and territorial governments to negotiate equivalency agreements based on their own control programs, with no reference in the document to serious, persistent problems in monitoring methane emissions;

• Future updates on electric vehicle mandates and clean fuel targets.

“Effective carbon markets, enhanced oil and gas methane regulations, and the deployment at scale of technologies such as carbon capture and storage would create the circumstances whereby the oil and gas emissions cap would no longer be needed as it would have marginal value in reducing emissions,” the budget states.

More New Homes, No Efficiency Target

The budget repeats Carney’s commitment of $13 billion over five years to launch the new Build Canada Homes agency and build up to 45,000 new housing units on existing federal lands. The program is meant to focus primarily on non-market housing and includes $423 million, already announced earlier this year, for eight new co-operative housing buildings.

Build Canada Homes aims to “catalyze maximum investment while mainstreaming advanced methods of construction, with the potential to cut building timelines by up to 50%, reduce costs by as much as 20%, and lower emissions by approximately 20% during construction,” the budget states. With that activity, “Canada can significantly increase its supply of affordable homes and become a global leader in housing innovation, including in construction techniques, sustainable materials, and leading-edge manufacturing.”

The budget makes no mention of energy efficiency or heat pump deployment targets for Build Canada Homes. Within 24 hours of the federal announcement, green building practitioners were worrying that the new units will become part of a huge backlog of homes awaiting energy retrofits to improve their performance and address heating and cooling costs that are an important factor in housing affordability.

Sustainable Finance Taxonomy: Target Date Set, Details Missing

The budget promises to complete its long-awaited sustainable finance taxonomy in 2026 and identify an arm’s length organization to develop sustainable investment guidelines by the end of this year. Canada’s taxonomy is an overdue response to a continuing international effort—in the field of finance, not biology—to set common definitions of sustainable investments that reduce emissions or support climate adaptation, and counter greenwashing around those activities.

“These investment guidelines will become an important, voluntary tool for investors, lenders, and other stakeholders navigating the global race to net-zero, by credibly identifying ‘green’ and ‘transition’ investments,” the budget states.

Those definitions have been the subject of fierce debate over more than three years, with some sustainable finance experts arguing it would be better to have no taxonomy at all than a system that allowed too much latitude for fossil fuel investment. Now, “the reconfirmed sustainable investment taxonomy, in moving forward, has to be fossil-free and centre independent experts outside of the financial sector. That’s foundational for it to be credible,” Julie Segal, senior program manager, climate finance at Environmental Defence Canada, said in an email.

“While it’s good that this government is paying attention to sustainable finance policies as it courts greater private sector investment, advancing solely on a taxonomy remains insufficient,” Segal added. “As Prime Minister Carney has said himself in previous roles, a cohesive package of mandatory transition plans, disclosure, and credible taxonomy is what’s needed. Until the full package of policies is delivered, it remains a missing piece of Canada’s climate plan.”

‘More Investor Risk’ with Weakened Greenwash Rules

The budget has also raised alarms by proposing to eliminate provisions in federal greenwashing legislation that require companies to verify environmental claims based on internationally recognized guidelines, and allow third parties to bring complaints to the federal Competition Tribunal.

In June, the Competition Bureau assured firms that the existing legislation, adopted by Parliament in June 2024, allows any marketing claims that aren’t false. But the budget still aims to offer “more certainty to the marketplace” by removing provisions that prompted fossil fuel companies and their lobby groups to not just update their websites, but burn them to the ground when the legislation was first adopted.

“The government’s proposal to weaken greenwashing provisions means more investor risk, particularly given the reluctance of provincial securities regulators to enforce accurate and complete disclosure in climate matters,” Matt Price, executive director of Investors for Paris Compliance, responded in a release.

“Removing the Competition Act amendments lets polluters mislead people in Canada and undermines truly sustainable businesses,” added the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment, one of the lead advocates for the legislation.

“Such needless retreat on climate and sustainable finance policy from a government led by Mark Carney is not something many experts would have expected,” said Adam Scott, executive director of Shift Action for Pension Wealth and Planet Health. “With the future stability and competitiveness of Canada’s economy on the line, we need much stronger leadership in the face of relentless industry lobbying. Canada needs credible guardrails in place to ensure the stability of our financial system and the climate.”

Cancelling the 2 Billion Trees Program

The budget signals a decision to wind down the Trudeau government’s commitment to plant two billion trees over 10 years, originally cast as “a significant step forward in Canada’s approach to tackle the dual crises of climate change and biodiversity loss.” Now, with nearly a billion trees committed, “existing contribution agreements and commitments will be honoured, and uncommitted funds will be returned,” the budget says.

With the Clean Economy Investment Tax Credits in place to drive investment, “the government remains committed to sustainable forest management practices,” the document adds.

The Canadian Tree Nursery Association countered that tree planting should receive “major project status, not cuts”, after the country lost an estimated 8% of its forest cover to wildfires between 2023 and 2025.

“This abrupt move not only threatens the long-term environmental recovery of Canada’s forests—which have already been devastated by recent wildfires—but also jeopardizes the livelihoods of workers, critical infrastructure, and the entire forest restoration sector,” Executive Director Rob Keen said in a release.

A Foot in the Door for the Youth Climate Corps

The budget earmarks $40 million over two years to launch a Youth Climate Corps, in which young Canadians “will be trained to quickly respond to climate emergencies, support recovery, and strengthen resilience in communities across the country. The skills training and work experience opportunities created through a Youth Climate Corps support reducing youth unemployment, increasing innovation, and strengthening adaptation and mitigation projects.”

Climate champions received the news as a lone ray of hope after years of coast-to-coast advocacy to get the idea funded.

“This is a win for hundreds of young activists and allies who have pressed hard for this idea, especially in the context of a budget that is significantly retreating on climate and decreasing overall program spending,” Climate Emergency Unit Team Lead Seth Klein said in a release. “But notably, $20 million a year will only produce about 350 full-time jobs for the whole country, which is not terribly consequential for tackling skyrocketing youth unemployment or addressing the climate crisis.”

The budget allocation “is a far cry from the $1 billion annual investment our campaign has called for, but it gets our foot in the door to prove the YCC’s worth,” Klein added. “So we will roll up our sleeves and work with the government to up the ambition for a Youth Climate Corps that matches the generational challenge.”

In November 2023, polling commissioned by the Emergency Unit indicated that even 20,000 spots per year would barely scratch the surface of the potential demand for the program. Some 65% of youth aged 18-35 said they would consider joining, and 15% said they would “definitely” consider. Interest was highest on the Prairies and in Atlantic Canada, followed by Quebec.

With nine million people across the country in the 18-35 age group, the 15% figure added up to 1.3 million potential applicants, Klein noted.

“They’re not saying maybe. They’re saying ‘definitely. I get it. If this exists, sign me up’,” he said. “1.3 million Canadians are saying, ‘where’s my goddamn invitation?’”

Potential problems with this bill Although passing this bill comes with some advantages, households might encounter some challenges in the future.","Inspecting your backup power at home might require a bit of patience. This is often because the city might be attending to a queue of people at the time, and you are probably behind a very long list. However, this might no longer be an issue following a recent government meeting.

The recently passed SB1252 and SB1202 bills.

Two Senate bills, Texas Senate Bill SB1252 and SB1202, were passed during the 89th Texas Legislative Session. But what are the benefits of these two bills? These two bills allow third-party professionals to inspect residential backup power systems in place of a city’s building department, also known as the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ). But how exactly does this work?

The installer can choose to use either the local AHJ or a qualified third-party for plan review, inspection, or both. If a third-party is used, then the local codes must be requested from the AHJ. If the codes are not provided within two business days, the third-party would have to refer to the International Residential Code. As soon as the inspection is complete, the third party reaches out to AHJ and submits the documentation. The AHJ, however, has three witness days to issue the permit. Also, they don’t have the power to change the plan review for work done by a third party.

With this bill, projects can be done much more rapidly in just a few hours. Households no longer have to wait for city permitting offices for a long period of time. Also, it’s going to cost less to pay for these projects. This is because municipalities will not be able to request inspection fees for third-party reviews.

Why were these bills introduced?

One of the reasons why this bill was passed was to reduce the control cities have over energy projects. With third-party reviewers now available, local government no longer decides how quickly an application must be reviewed. Therefore, this makes cities have less influence over projects, giving more room for the third-party reviewers.

Potential problems with this bill

Although passing this bill comes with some advantages, households might encounter some challenges in the future. One of the biggest problems they might face is the low quality of inspection. A third-party might not follow due protocols like a city inspector, and this will lead to inconsistent application of safety standards. Also, because the third party is mostly hired and paid by the installer, they often give biased results just to keep their jobs. Therefore, they rush the inspection, give positive reviews, and approve plans quickly, even when things are not looking good.

Another major problem they might encounter is the work timeline. Normally, the city is often given three complete days to respond as soon as the documentation has been submitted. However, a third-party review has no set deadline and can take advantage of it. They might end up becoming lackadaisical and doing their job past the time households have set for them. Also, if a poorly reviewed system fails or is damaged, the households suffer the consequences, as they might not be covered by insurance, similar to this ground-breaking renewable energy project in New York.

What this bill means for the future of solar in Texas

By shifting responsibilities from the city to installers and households, the quality of services received depends on the choice made. This bill can be a gateway to faster and more affordable solar installation if the right decisions are made. And by removing long permitting delays, Texas is in a position to expand clean energy more quickly among users in the state. However, the success of this bill is heavily dependent on the reliability of the third-party guys to ensure that they provide the best quality of services to each household.",https://www.eldiario24.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/photo-1741188630852-e3151c41c80d.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 16:57:20.717953

“Looking into 2026, demand for new energy batteries will drop drastically from the end of this year, so battery makers should cut production and take some rest to cope with the fluctuations,” Cui Dongshu, the industry body’s secretary general, said in a personal social media post.

China is the global leader in battery technology manufacturing and exports, and is benefiting from a worldwide boom in demand for batteries used in EVs and power networks.

A big drop in demand will hurt battery makers including Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL) and EVE Energy.

Cui said green passenger vehicle sales will fall at least 30 per cent early next year, from the fourth quarter, as tax incentives for car purchases are being phased out.

In addition, electric vehicles for commercial use will “definitely” slump in early 2026 after buyers rushed to buy vehicles by year-end for subsidies and tax breaks, Cui said.

The loss in domestic demand is unlikely to be offset by exports, he said.

China’s lithium battery exports to the European Union, its biggest overseas market, rose 4 per cent in 2025 from a year ago, while exports to the United States tumbled 9.5 per cent.

The drop in US-bound exports suggests rising demand for energy storage from the US artificial intelligence boom is not lifting demand for Chinese batteries, Cui said.

UBS analyst Yishu Yan said this month that Chinese manufacturers face risks from US restrictions on projects receiving investment tax credits that involve designated “foreign entities of concern”.

These secondary minerals are not the main target of mining operations, so they are often separated out and discarded during processing. According to the researchers, recovering even small amounts of these overlooked materials could have a major impact on U.S. supply chains.

The researchers found that if 90 percent of these byproducts were recovered, they ""could meet nearly all U.S. critical mineral needs; one percent recovery would substantially reduce import reliance for most elements evaluated."" This means that even modest improvements in recovery technology could significantly reduce dependence on overseas sources.

What Are Critical Minerals and Why They Matter

Critical minerals are materials that are essential to the economy and national security but face supply risks due to limited domestic production or geopolitical instability. In the United States, this category includes minerals such as cobalt, nickel, manganese, lithium, tellurium, germanium, and many others.

These elements play key roles in modern technology. They are used in rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles, magnets for wind turbines, semiconductors for electronics, and solar panels for renewable energy. Some are also vital for defense systems, medical devices, and communications equipment.

Demand for these materials is growing rapidly as clean energy technologies expand. At the same time, many critical minerals are currently imported from regions affected by political tension or trade uncertainty. Developing entirely new mines can take decades, making alternative domestic sources especially attractive.

How Researchers Measured Untapped Mineral Potential

To estimate how much of these minerals could be recovered inside the United States, Holley and her colleagues combined two large datasets. One database tracked the main commodities produced at federally permitted U.S. metal mines. The other included detailed geochemical measurements showing the concentrations of 70 critical minerals found in ore samples across the country.

By pairing production data with mineral chemistry data, the team was able to estimate how much of each critical mineral is already being mined and processed, but not recovered. Instead, these materials end up in mine waste, also known as tailings, which must be stored and monitored to prevent environmental harm.

In many cases, the study found that recovering less than 10 percent of these byproducts would generate a higher total dollar value than the primary metals currently being sold by U.S. mines. This suggests that what is treated as waste today could become a major economic resource.

Economic, Strategic, and Environmental Benefits

The potential benefits of recovering critical mineral byproducts extend beyond economics. Reducing import dependence would strengthen supply security for industries tied to energy, technology, and defense. It could also help protect the U.S. from supply disruptions caused by international conflicts or trade restrictions.

There are environmental advantages as well. Recovering valuable minerals instead of discarding them would reduce the volume and long term impact of mine waste. It could also create new opportunities to reuse processed materials in construction and other applications.

Despite the promise, challenges remain. Recovering small amounts of minerals from complex ore mixtures requires advanced technology, additional processing steps, and supportive policies. As Holley has explained, the difficulty lies in making recovery practical and cost effective at scale.

Still, the findings point to a largely untapped opportunity. Active U.S. mines are already handling the materials needed for batteries, clean energy systems, and high tech manufacturing. With targeted investment, research, and policy incentives, these hidden byproducts could become a powerful domestic resource rather than a discarded one.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/colorado-climax-mine.webp,N,,2025-12-28 14:57:34.398091

The United States has been developing a new foundation to advance the nuclear energy market through several projects and initiatives that were mandated by the current administration. It would appear that New Jersey is the latest state to plan a substantial investment to revive the US nuclear energy market.

New Jersey has passed new legislation regarding the revival of the US nuclear market

New Jersey recently passed the latest legislation that incentivises operators to develop new nuclear energy projects in the Garden State. The bill, known as the New Jersey Energy Security and Affordability Act, cleared the Senate Environment and Energy Committee easily.

The proposed legislation would promote the development of the nuclear energy sector in the state through several new initiatives, such as:

The Act will direct New Jersey’s Board of Public Utilities (BPU) to establish an Advanced Nuclear Development Fund that will require New Jersey rate payers to subsidise construction of 1,200 megawatts of power at the very least from qualifying nuclear generation projects in the Garden State.

The Act will require the state to establish an Advanced Nuclear Energy Certificate (ANEC) program, which will require basic generation service (BGS) providers and electric power suppliers to purchase new certificates generated by qualified nuclear projects in New Jersey.

The new proposed Advanced Nuclear Energy Certificate (ANEC) program will aim to promote the nuclear energy sector advancement by mandating that basic electricity providers in New Jersey deliver a percentage of kilowatt hours from nuclear energy produced in New Jersey.

The aim of the bill is to promote the use of nuclear energy in New Jersey as energy providers and utilities develop new nuclear projects that meet the state requirements to qualify for the new incentivised initiative, potentially transforming New Jersey into a hub for the nuclear energy revival in the United States.

The United States is fostering a new era of clean energy production from the nuclear sector

While the federal government rolls back wind energy project permits, the new Act aims to develop an investment framework for the nuclear energy market in New Jersey. A concern has been raised by rate payers organizations as the bill allows for basic electricity providers to pass on the costs to rate payers in the Garden State.

Any qualified nuclear energy project in the state may receive Advanced Nuclear Energy Certificates for each kilowatt of nuclear energy produced and sold in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) region. However, any power sold out of state may not receive the accreditation.

As Los Angeles has developed the first-ever hydrogen-ready power plant, New Jersey is aiming to become a hub for the nuclear energy revival in the United States. Through the new bill that has passed muster with state lawmakers, New Jersey is one step closer to its ambitions being realised.

“There is no question we need an energy policy overhaul in America. A key part of that overhaul must include moving forward aggressively with expanding nuclear energy as a renewable energy source.” – Erik Paulsen

The US is entering a new era of nuclear energy generation

The new bill in New Jersey is just the latest initiative proposed to advance the nuclear energy revival in the United States. The US Energy Department has reported that the progress of increasing nuclear energy generation is picking up traction, as it has selected 11 potential advanced reactor demonstration projects that will position the US as the market leader in nuclear energy generation across the international energy market. Nuclear energy is making a triumphant comeback in the US.

The California Energy Commission recently approved over $40 million in grants to ""improve waterfront facilities at state ports for floating offshore wind projects,"" Riviera reported.

The funding will be divided among several projects, including pier evaluations and planning efforts at Port of Long Beach, upgrades to Humboldt Bay Harbor's offshore wind terminal, and the development of a wind terminal at the Port of San Luis Harbor, according to Riviera.

These infrastructure initiatives will accelerate California's transition to renewable energy sources and support the state's goal of complete carbon neutrality by 2045. The construction, support, and maintenance of the new and improved wind hubs will also create thousands of jobs.

Adam Stern, executive director of Offshore Wind California, said the grant approval is ""good news for Californian workers and residents who will benefit from gigawatts of reliable, clean offshore wind power. These grants … are a welcome milestone for deploying floating turbines 32-48 km off California's coast,"" per Riviera.

Besides creating jobs and increasing energy security, wind power offers environmental benefits, like improving air quality and preserving natural resources. The most significant environmental benefit of wind power and other forms of renewable energy is the reduced reliance on finite dirty fuels.

Burning fossil fuels, which include coal, oil, and gas, releases planet-warming gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. The resulting air pollution is responsible for millions of premature deaths each year.

For California residents, these projects will increase homeowners' access to reliable, safe, clean electricity. The plan is to produce 148,000 megawatts of energy through renewable means — enough to power 25 million homes.

The state is making great progress. In 2024, California's solar, wind, and water produced enough power to meet the state's electricity demand for nearly 100 days.

These projects are a significant stepping stone in California's commitment to clean energy.

""California is demonstrating its continued determination to be a clean-energy leader, despite federal headwinds,"" Stern stressed.

While it’s tapping the brakes on its EV ambitions for the time being, Ford is putting more weight behind a different kind of battery, the kind built to power entire grids.

Read: Ford Kills Major Battery Deal As EV Plans Rapidly Unravel

The company signed a licensing deal in 2023 with Chinese battery heavyweight CATL to use its lithium iron phosphate (LFP) technology. The original plan was to manufacture EV batteries using CATL’s chemistry, bringing production in-house with a technical edge from one of the world’s largest battery makers. That plan has changed.

Shifting Power to the Grid

Instead of funneling CATL’s LFP chemistry into cars, Ford will now use it to produce large-format batteries designed for energy storage. These units, built at scale, are intended for use by utilities and grid operators.

“Given the fact that we already had a license to build that technology in the US, you couple that with our manufacturing experience, over a century of high-scale manufacturing, it just made a lot of sense as a natural adjacency for us,” Ford vice president of technology platform programs and EV systems, Lisa Drake told Bloomberg.

Ford has had to walk through a political minefield to bring its deal with CATL to life. Virginia’s Governor rejected Ford’s plans to build a battery plant there using CATL technology due to its Chinese ties. Ford is now building its plant in Michigan and expects to open it next year.

As the Trump administration pushes to reduce America’s reliance on Chinese products, Ford believes its approach is better than continuing to import the Chinese-made batteries that have already become common in the U.S. energy sector.

The Case for Building at Home

“Given the ongoing needs of US energy producers, it seems like a no-brainer to support efforts to produce batteries in America instead of importing more of them from China,” Ford added.

The carmaker has also revealed that it spoke with potential customers to see if there was demand for it to sell energy storage cells. It “received resounding affirmation.” Not only are LFP cells great for EVs, but they’re also well-suited for energy storage, hence why Ford’s move makes sense.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ford-Factory-j-copy.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 14:57:27.324955

“Making electric heat technologies more affordable lets more facilities swap out dirty fossil fuel boilers for clean electric options.” Energy efficiency upgrades, meanwhile, are a no-brainer according to the duo.","In a virtual launch on December 16, UC Santa Barbara’s 2035 Initiative unveiled a detailed roadmap for a seemingly obvious target of climate action: cleaning up the industrial sector.

Titled The Clean Heat Climate Opportunity, the new report maps out a pathway for electrifying low- and medium-temperature industrial heat — the kind used in making everything from paper and plastics to beer and frozen pizza. And the findings are clear: This shift could slash U.S. climate pollution by as much as 26 percent in key sectors while unlocking nearly half a trillion dollars in public health benefits by 2050.

“To hit our climate goals, it’s not just cars and buildings that need to go electric — it’s also big factories,” said Leah C. Stokes, one of the report’s principal investigators and an Associate Professor at UCSB. “Most of what we eat, drink, and use every day gets made with heat from burning fossil fuels. Fortunately, we can swap out dirty technologies with clean alternatives like electric heat pumps that can cut pollution, improve air quality, and modernize U.S. manufacturing.”

As stated early on in the presentation, industrial operations account for roughly a quarter of America’s greenhouse gas emissions, and the U.S. is second only to China as the world’s largest emitter.

Enter the 2035 Initiative, UCSB’s own “think-and-do tank,” which blends engineering models, public policy research, and on-the-ground engagement to accelerate climate solutions. This particular project was co-led as principal investigators by Stokes and Professor Eric Masanet, who holds the Mellichamp Chair in Sustainability Science for Emerging Technologies.

“The industrial sector is complex, which often makes smart policy hard to design,” Masanet said. “Our engineering models cut through that complexity to pinpoint opportunities that are both realistic and actionable in real-world plants.”

According to the report, electrifying heat processes in three energy-intensive sectors — chemicals, pulp and paper, and food and beverage — could cut cumulative emissions by 930 to 1,320 million metric tons of CO₂-equivalent through 2050. That’s up to 26 percent of the climate pollution from major facilities in these sectors.

And there is financial incentive. The analysis estimates $288 billion to $475 billion in avoided public health costs from reduced air pollutants like nitrogen oxides and fine particulate matter. These emissions are linked to respiratory illness, heart disease, and cancer.

“These programs are the future of our country,” said Senator Martin Heinrich (D-NM), who spoke during the launch event alongside Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI). “People want hot showers and cold beer — same approach to the industrial sector.” Heinrich expanded that to mean that we can get the same output with a cleaner, and more cost-effective, setup.

Whitehouse didn’t mince words about the stakes. “Don’t buy the lie that clean energy is expensive,” he said. “The Trump administration lies about the cost.”

The report lands at a time when federal climate policy is being sharply reversed. Since returning to office, President Trump has cut billions from key clean energy programs, including the $7 billion “Solar for All” initiative aimed at low-income households, and canceled hundreds of Department of Energy awards that had supported battery production, hydrogen hubs, and EV manufacturing. The administration has also paused new approvals for wind energy — including offshore — while ramping up fossil fuel development on federal lands. Lawsuits challenging these moves are now playing out in courts across the country.

“States can unlock progress on industrial electrification today,” said Stokes. “Making electric heat technologies more affordable lets more facilities swap out dirty fossil fuel boilers for clean electric options.”

Energy efficiency upgrades, meanwhile, are a no-brainer according to the duo. Measures like steam system optimization and process controls can shrink electricity demand while boosting savings for businesses.

This work is part of a growing portfolio at the 2035 Initiative, which is also developing global climate opinion maps, working on grid resilience for vulnerable communities, and tracking climate concern in small island nations.

Though headquartered on UCSB’s campus, the Initiative’s work aims to reach Washington, D.C. “This roadmap is meant to show policymakers where the low-hanging fruit is,” Stokes said. “There are facilities across the country that should start looking at swapping out their fossil fuels ASAP because it might save them money.”",https://www.independent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-32-Large.jpeg?fit=1200%2C514,N,,2025-12-28 13:58:08.176307

The state has attracted an estimated $25 to $30 billion in EV-related investment, far more than any other Midwest state, supported by the nation’s deepest automotive supplier base and decades of R&D expertise.
Programs such as Michigan’s Supplier Conversion Grants aim to help traditional auto suppliers pivot toward EV and battery components rather than exit the market.
Ohio’s model offers a contrast: fewer OEMs, fewer suppliers, but clearer alignment between manufacturing, batteries, and workforce retraining.
For Ohio, it means proving a focused EV hub can scale beyond one automaker.","COLUMBUS — Honda’s transformation of Ohio into its primary North American EV hub underscores an intensifying competition across the Midwest — one that puts Michigan’s long-held automotive dominance under pressure, even as the state continues to pour billions into electric vehicle development.

Honda is investing $700 million to retool three Ohio plants and partnering with LG Energy Solution on a $3.5 billion battery facility, positioning Ohio as a focused, vertically aligned EV manufacturing center with production slated to begin in late 2025. The strategy mirrors a broader industry shift toward fewer, more centralized EV hubs as automakers manage slower-than-expected consumer adoption.

Michigan, by contrast, is pursuing a scale-and-ecosystem strategy.

The state has attracted an estimated $25 to $30 billion in EV-related investment, far more than any other Midwest state, supported by the nation’s deepest automotive supplier base and decades of R&D expertise. Programs such as Michigan’s Supplier Conversion Grants aim to help traditional auto suppliers pivot toward EV and battery components rather than exit the market.

But Michigan’s advantage comes with complexity.

Unlike Ohio’s Honda-centered approach, Michigan’s EV footprint is spread across multiple OEMs — GM, Ford, and Stellantis — each adjusting timelines and production plans amid shifting federal policy and market demand. Several high-profile projects have been delayed or scaled back, fueling debate over incentives, land use, and community acceptance.

Still, Michigan remains the center of gravity for Midwest mobility.

The state’s supplier density, engineering workforce, testing facilities, and charging infrastructure goals — including a plan to deploy 100,000 EV chargers by 2030 — give it structural advantages competitors struggle to replicate. More than 27% of Michigan’s economy remains tied to automotive and mobility industries, anchoring its long-term relevance even as EV growth slows.

Ohio’s model offers a contrast: fewer OEMs, fewer suppliers, but clearer alignment between manufacturing, batteries, and workforce retraining. Indiana and Illinois occupy middle ground, with Indiana leaning on cost competitiveness and Illinois relying heavily on Rivian as a single EV anchor.

Industry analysts say the Midwest’s EV race is entering a second phase — less about announcements and more about execution.

“The early EV boom was about who could land the biggest press release,” said one Midwest auto analyst. “The next phase is about who can actually build profitably, train workers, and survive slower adoption.”

For Michigan, that means translating its massive ecosystem into durable EV production — not just investment commitments. For Ohio, it means proving a focused EV hub can scale beyond one automaker.

Either way, the Midwest remains central to America’s EV future — but the balance of power inside the region is still very much in flux.",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Michigan-EV-workforce-map-overview.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 11:58:48.909548

Global green bond and loan issuance has reached a record $947 billion so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. That's as stock market gauges for renewables are set for their first annual gains since 2020, outperforming the S&P 500 by a wide margin, while shares of power-grid technology companies remain in favor.

The flows are notable in a year when US President Donald Trump backed fossil fuels and dismantled clean-energy subsidies and legislation. Europe also has rolled back some of its toughest environmental rules amid concerns about growth and competitiveness.

Still, clearer policy signals and an almost 4% expected increase in global electricity demand, driven by AI, cooling and electrification needs, are lifting investor optimism.

""Green investments are increasingly becoming viewed as core infrastructure and industrial plays, not just niche ESG trades,"" said Melissa Cheok, associate director for ESG investment research at Sustainable Fitch. ""Capital is likely flowing toward areas with clear revenue visibility, policy backing and structural demand such as grid upgrades and renewables tied to electrification.""

Asia-Pacific companies and government-linked issuers raised $261 billion from green debt, up about 20% from a year earlier, with China and India backing the rollout of renewables, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. China had a record $138 billion in green bond issuance, led by its biggest lenders. It also debuted a sovereign offering in London earlier this year.

The so-called greenium - the lower borrowing costs on green bonds - is most evident in Asia-Pacific, with some issuers getting more than a 14-basis-point discount for using a green label in November, according to BloombergNEF. Green bonds are often used by companies to raise money for switching to renewable energy or lower-carbon transportation.

BNP Paribas SA and Credit Agricole SA are this year's leading underwriters of green bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The amount of outstanding green bonds has grown at a 30% compound annual rate over the past five years and issuance now accounts for about 4.3% of the global total, LSE Group researchers said last month.

Easing US interest rates and refinancing needs may boost global green bond sales to as much as $1.6 trillion next year, said Crystal Geng, environmental, social and governance research lead for Asia at BNP Paribas Asset Management.

Green stocks have been a market leader this year. Clean-energy indexes from S&P Dow Jones Indices and WilderShares have surged 45% and 60%, respectively, though both remain below their 2021 peaks.

US solar and battery storage stocks, including SolarEdge Technologies Inc., have been among the top performers, while wind turbine makers have led gains in China and Germany. India has emerged as a hotspot for renewable-energy initial public offerings, with 11 listings raising more than $1 billion and another six companies seeking more than $3 billion. Last year, 14 renewable energy companies raised $2.4 billion through IPOs.

Not all markets are benefiting. US green debt issuance fell 7% to $163 billion this year and supranational bond sales declined by a similar amount. Fundraising in Germany was steady at roughly $79 billion.

While India saw record green loan volumes of $7 billion, strong interest from foreign banks has intensified competition, squeezing financing margins by 5% to 10% on renewable energy and other projects, said Jeanne Soh, head of structured finance for Asia at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.

Sales of sustainability-linked debt slumped about 50% this year to $165 billion amid greenwashing concerns, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. Transition bond issuance more than halved to $10.9 billion for hard-to-abate sectors.

The trends are likely to reverse over the next two years, said Xuan Sheng Ou Yong, a client portfolio manager for sustainable investing at Robeco in Singapore. Changes to European fund rules will let asset managers define what qualifies as a sustainable investment, opening the door to emissions-cutting investments in higher-polluting sectors, he said.

Overall, global sustainable debt volumes stood at about $1.6 trillion this year, down more than 8% from 2024, the Bloomberg Intelligence data show. Separately, more than $500 billion of social bonds were sold in the US tied to the Government National Mortgage Association, known as Ginnie Mae, which guarantees principal and interest on mortgage-backed securities.

The move will see the company shift US EV battery production lines to ESS output ahead of 2027.
“It is a significant opportunity for Samsung SDI to expand into the US ESS market with the first long-term contract for LFP supply,” said a Samsung official.

Each Samsung Battery Box (SBB) unit is packaged into a standard 20-foot container that incorporates a number of battery racks, battery management systems, and thermal management systems (both cooling and fire safety) for quick, easy deployment.","In what appears to be significant strategic pivot, Samsung SDI will begin supplying prismatic lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for energy storage systems under a fresh US contract worth more than 2 trillion won (~$1.35 billion). The move will see the company shift US EV battery production lines to ESS output ahead of 2027.

Michigan-based Samsung SDI America will begin manufacturing battery energy storage system (BESS) cells at the company’s Indiana facility, where the manufacturer has been shifting some its production lines from cell production for EVs to prismatic LFP cell production for BESS units – a move the company claims will allow it to more closely align with domestic market demands.

“It is a significant opportunity for Samsung SDI to expand into the US ESS market with the first long-term contract for LFP supply,” said a Samsung official. “Through the first supply of SBB 2.0 for ESS installation in the US, Samsung SDI will start providing US customers with ESS batteries to meet their needs not only for high-performance but also for enhanced safety and price competitiveness, enabling them to stabilize power supplies in the era of renewable energy and AI.”

What’s in the box

Prismatic LFPs are encased in rigid aluminum housings that give them greater resistance to external shocks and impact damage, while promising lower heat and improved thermal safety compared to more familiar, pouch format cells. That construction, along with other proprietary anti-thermal propagation (read: fire safety) designs that limit heat spread between cells, make prismatic LFPs an attractive option for utility-scale BESS deployments where fire risk and system reliability are top priorities for utilities and data centers.

Samsung’s prismatic LFP cells are also attractive for utility- and grid-scale distributed energy resource (DER) projects because of their packaging. Each Samsung Battery Box (SBB) unit is packaged into a standard 20-foot container that incorporates a number of battery racks, battery management systems, and thermal management systems (both cooling and fire safety) for quick, easy deployment.

The company also pointed out that Samsung SDI is regarded as the only non-Chinese manufacturer of prismatic batteries currently operating in the US, a position the company believes strengthens its competitive standing as it expands its presence in North America.

Electrek’s Take

Samsung kicked off the launch of its SSB 2.0 at RE+ earlier this year with the words, “All-American, Proven, and Ready,” emphasizing the company’s role as a creator of American jobs with statements like, “Samsung SDI aims to strengthen competitiveness in the US market …” which reads, to me, like the company is trying to ride a wave of Sinophobia as it positions itself for leadership in the data center BESS market, just as the big Chinese and American tech players continue to separate from one another.

The only problem I see there is that the kind of American voters who buy into that particular brand of anti-China propaganda probably can’t tell the difference between China and Korea. Change my mind, in the comments.

Previously, Milei's government extended the 2023 budget without passing a bill in Congress, resulting in inflation across sectors.

What do we know about the newly passed budget?

The Senate passed the budget with 46 votes in favor, 25 voting against and one abstention. The vote came after the lower Chamber of Deputies gave its approval.

The budget includes spending of $102 billion (€86.7 billion) and projected growth of 5%, with inflation of 10.1%. It aims to secure a zero deficit mostly through spending cuts.

""We are not going to spend more than we make, we are going to get our accounts in order,"" said Senator Ezequiel Atauche, a member of Milei's party.

Last week, thousands took to the streets in Buenos Aires to protest against the Argentine leader's proposed reforms involving the country's labor laws.

Milei responded by promising ""a lot more reforms.""

The leader's party, La Libertad Avanza, made significant gains in the newly elected Congress, with the government hoping this will help in pushing forward its reforms to Argentina's labor and tax systems.

Japan is seeking greener pastures with a 15-year, 500,000-ton bet Just like the world, Japan is also seeking greener pastures, especially as the deadline for its climate goals is looming around the corner.

The biggest power-producing company in Japan, JERA, has made a 15-year government-supported bet on ammonia imports from America.
This subsidy will help cover the difference between coal and ammonia expenses, as imports are planned to commence by 2029.","One of the most technologically advanced countries in the world is facing significant challenges in reducing its carbon footprint. Japan has set a ‘linear pathway’ to achieving its 2035 climate goals, but reliance on fossil fuels remains an obstacle. This is why Japan is turning to America for hydrogen, hoping that a 15-year, 500,000-ton bet will help the country move past coal and gas as primary fuels for power. Discover how these two countries’ collaboration will help Japan go green.

Japan is seeking greener pastures with a 15-year, 500,000-ton bet

Just like the world, Japan is also seeking greener pastures, especially as the deadline for its climate goals is looming around the corner. The country is aiming to achieve the following:

A 60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 2013 levels by 2035, and

By 2040, a 73% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 2013 levels

Convinced that these specific goals will help the country meet the global mission of achieving net-zero by 2050, Japan is now actively investing in alternative fuels and energies to decrease its coal and gas dependency. According to Reuters, over 50% of Japan’s power was generated by fossil fuels during 2024/2025, of which coal and gas were the primary sources.

Fortunately, Japan is turning to America for hydrogen in its venture to greener pastures, which will play a significant role in the country’s transition away from fossil fuels.

Japan turns to America for hydrogen

All eyes have been on Japan since the 2025 Japan Summit & Exhibition, where Japan’s Energy for a New Era (JERA) hinted at new LNG Agreements.

The biggest power-producing company in Japan, JERA, has made a 15-year government-supported bet on ammonia imports from America. This subsidy will help cover the difference between coal and ammonia expenses, as imports are planned to commence by 2029. Earlier this year, JERA partnered with CF Industries and Mitsui for the Blue Point project.

The Blue Point project is a nearly $4 billion project, which will boast one of the biggest low-carbon ammonia facilities in the world. The Blue Point project is situated in Louisiana, and Mitsui will be responsible for supplying the project’s partners, which is planned to commence by 2030. The project will provide 280,000 tons of ammonia each year to the following partners (among others):

Hokkaido Electric Power

Mitsubishi UBE Cement

Tosoh

This is how Japan will benefit from U.S. imports

JERA itself plans on benefitting from nearly 500,000 tons annually from the Blue Point project, as ammonia and hydrogen are key to the country’s venture into greener pastures. According to Anri Nakamura, principal hydrogen research analyst at S&P Global Energy Horizons, the decision is an exciting development for the country’s hydrogen policy, which has remained quiet until now. Nakamura added:

“These agreements also strengthen ammonia cofiring plans at power plants supported by long-term decarbonized power auctions. While burning ammonia in coal plants is costly, we expect this volume can be supported by the CFD budget, especially if higher-value industrial applications are also developed.”

According to a JERA spokesperson, the ammonia imports will be extremely vital for Japan, as JERA will commence 20% ammonia cofiring at the 1 GW No. 4 Hekinan coal-fired unit starting 2029/2030. The ammonia will also be used at the Tomata-Atsume thermal power plant, as well as a fuel for Mitsubishi UBE Cement. Tosoh will use it as raw material.

This project is only the first step towards Japan’s better, greener future, a step that will significantly lower the country’s carbon footprint while helping it achieve its climate goals in no time. Ammonia is exceptional as a low-carbon fuel or feedstock, which is most likely why Japan has also been focusing on ammonia-powered ship engines. The country has completed its first factory trials, proving how valuable its U.S. ammonia import investment is for the future.

The research “confirms that an employment transition away from fossil fuel jobs is occurring, and occurring quickly,” said report co-author and centre director Jim Stanford.
“Building a pipeline creates medium-term construction, he said—but no more than equivalent amounts spent on other energy investments” in renewable energy, transition, energy retrofits, or public transit.

We’ll be back to our regular schedule in the new year.

Fossil fuel employment has fallen to less than 1% of the Canadian work force, while growth in global energy jobs outpaced the wider economy for the third year in a row, according to two back-to-back reports released earlier in the year.

In Canada, the fossil industry has dropped 38,000 jobs in the last five years, mostly in upstream oil and gas, even though production increased 35% for oil and 24% for natural gas over that period, the Centre for Future Work reported Monday.

“This long-term decline is set to continue for many reasons, not solely or mostly climate policy. New technologies, economic forces, resource depletion, and corporate outsourcing strategies are all eliminating fossil fuel jobs,” the Vancouver-based organization said in a release. The 95-page report concludes [pdf] that:

• The job transition out of fossil fuels is taking place in spite of any efforts in national climate policy, not because of them.

• The pace of the decline is consistent with a full phaseout of fossil fuels by 2050.

• Most of today’s fossil fuel workers will have reached normal retirement age by then.

• Interviews with workers showed that most of them expect to see the industry decline, but are reasonably confident the transition can be managed without mass displacement.

• Federal “just transition” efforts to date have been “long on aspiration and consultation, and short on implementation and effective guarantees.”

• Transition planning in Canada “is made even more nebulous by the fact that no general transition away from fossil fuel production and use is in fact occurring,” except for the 2030 federal mandate to phase out coal.

The research “confirms that an employment transition away from fossil fuel jobs is occurring, and occurring quickly,” said report co-author and centre director Jim Stanford. “Regardless of the twists and turns of climate policy debates, that decline will continue, driven by deeper economic and technological factors.”

But when it comes to just transition planning, “most policies emphasize consultation and dialogue, not binding agreements and entitlements,” the report states. “Instead of clear guarantees of employment and income for affected workers, workers are typically offered retraining subsidies and career counselling. In a labour market defined by chronic insecurity and fierce competition for decent work, this does not convince fossil fuel workers that their employment and incomes will be protected.”

Stanford added that a new oil pipeline megaproject, like the one envisioned in last month’s sweeping memorandum of understanding between Canada and Alberta, won’t reverse the trend. “Building a pipeline creates medium-term construction, he said—but no more than equivalent amounts spent on other energy investments” in renewable energy, transition, energy retrofits, or public transit.

On a global scale, many of those job categories are soaring, the International Energy Agency reported Friday, with the energy sector outpacing the global economy in 2024 for the third year in a row and increasing its work force to 76 million.

“Strong investment in energy infrastructure drove a 2.2% rise in energy jobs last year, nearly double the rate of employment growth for the wider global economy,” the Paris-based agency said in a release, with electricity surpassing fuel supply as the biggest industry employer for the first time.

The IEA reports that:

• Photovoltaic solar has been a “principal driver of demand, accounting for half of the job additions in the electricity sector since 2019.”

• Almost all the jobs in the power sector were in low-emitting power generation, grids, or storage, with only a small percentage in unabated fossil generation.

• Nuclear power, grids, and storage have provided 25% of the new power sector jobs.

• Offshore wind saw layoffs in turbine manufacturing and other “persistent challenge”, leading to a 6% job decline last year.

• Jobs in electric vehicle manufacturing grew by 800,000, with EVs and batteries now accounting for about 40% of automotive employment in China.

• Oil and gas has recovered most of the jobs it lost in the COVID-19 pandemic. But “it now appears that many firms are entering a new period of retrenchment in the face of lower oil prices and revenues, with a number of major oil companies announcing job cuts in 2025.”

• Coal jobs have increased in India, China, and Indonesia, growing 8% between 2019 and 2024.

Skilled worker shortages emerged as a key concern in the IEA’s annual Energy Employment Survey, with more than half of respondents reporting critical hiring bottlenecks and an aging work force compounding the problem.

“Most of the top energy occupations facing constraints within energy are considered applied technical roles, including electricians, pipefitters, electrical power line workers, and engineers, particularly in nuclear,” the IEA wrote. “Many of these broader categories are already in short supply across the wider economy.”

We’ll be back to our regular schedule in the new year.

Energy and Natural Resources Minister Tim Hodgson drew praise from fossil industry supporters in August and set off alarm bells in the climate community with his statement that there’s sure to be a market for new Canadian liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, in spite of a looming global gas glut.

“I know there are buyers,” Hodgson told CTV host Vassy Kapelos last week.

“Our production is much closer to Asian markets. Our production is much cleaner than the American in terms of carbon footprint,” he said. “And what I can tell you from the conversations that the prime minister has been having, the minister of foreign affairs has been having, the minister of international trade has been having, the conversations I’ve been having, our allies are very interested in Canadian LNG.”

Canadians can “expect to see projects announced in the early fall,” Hodgson added, via a “rolling set of announcements” as proponents pitch projects that respond to the five criteria set out in the government’s controversial major projects legislation.

“More customers, more shipments, more LNG export facilities, means more jobs for Canadians, more opportunities for Indigenous partnerships, and certainly a more economically secure country,” responded Lisa Baiton, president and CEO of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, notwithstanding staunch opposition emerging from many Indigenous organizations and communities.

CTV recounts a long exchange in which Kapelos tried to pin Hodgson down on whether the government will abandon its emission reduction targets or environmental assessment rules to get LNG projects done. Hodgson maintained Canadians should “be proud” that its LNG has the “lowest carbon footprint of any produced in the world.” But Canadian Climate Institute principal economist Dave Sawyer said even that “cleaner” LNG will still produce “a lot of emission,” so that “the math is inescapable.”

“The challenge has always been to balance out economic growth, and really, emission-intensive resource growth, with policy that sort of bends the emission curve down,” he told CTV. “And when you’re putting in these big, large, lumpy emission projects, you need some pretty strong policy to counter the emissions.”

The government’s initial list of “nation-building” megaprojects doesn’t include LNG. But that didn’t stop Alberta Energy and Minerals Minister Brian Jean from praising the statement on his Facebook page.

“Excited to see these approvals move forward!” Jean wrote. “Alberta is ready to seize new opportunities and help Canada reach its full potential as a true energy superpower.”

Calgary Herald columnist Chris Varcoe says Hodgson’s remarks rippled through the fossil industry “like a stone skipping across calm water.”

“The fact we’re hearing that from our own government now, the federal government, is a very positive sign. It’s a long way from, ‘There’s no business case for LNG,’ which we heard from the previous government,” said Peyto Exploration and Development CEO Jean-Paul Lachance. “That gives me some confidence that there’s going to be some support for LNG projects within Canada… It sends the right signal to the capital markets that we’re open for business here.”

“People in other countries have been waiting to hear the federal government of Canada speak in this way,” Shannon Joseph, chair of Energy for a Secure Future, told Varcoe.

But others were listening, too. “Minister Hodgson believes there is an international appetite for LNG—but with a global gas glut looming, this could not be further from the truth,” Climate Action Network Canada Executive Director Caroline Brouillette said in a statement. “The Minister should be focusing exclusively on the projects with the highest likelihood of success—ones that are based on inexpensive technologies and that will make our country resilient in the long run. Renewable energy, storage, and electricity transmission projects are all no-brainers.”

Investors for Paris Compliance Executive Director Matt Price had a more visceral take on Hodgson’s remarks.

“Our son just got home from fighting the 588-hectare Cameron Lake fire, only to hear about the new 1,391-hectare (and growing) fire south of Port Alberni,” he wrote last week on LinkedIn. “And we’re still talking about new fossil fuel infrastructure?”

Last week, Hodgson was back in the news announcing $13.2 million in funding for five new smart projects in Mississauga, Toronto, Waterloo, and M’Chigeeng, on Manitoulin Island. Today, he’s scheduled for an announcement at the Bruce nuclear station near Tiverton.

It states: “Lowering our emissions is critical to protecting the competitiveness of Canada’s oil and gas and steel sectors.
The budget has left many wondering about the future of the emissions cap, which the government hints could become unnecessary down the road, but doesn’t outright eliminate.
He said polling shows there’s nothing to suggest the emissions cap is truly controversial in Canada and there is a lot of support for climate action.
We’re still waiting,” Caroline Brouillette, executive director of Climate Action Network Canada, said in a statement shared with the chat.","Disappointment and frustration were common themes among climate champions and experts who joined The Energy Mix for an online chat this afternoon and evening about the new federal budget or shared their comments from elsewhere with us.

“My first take is that neither the tone nor the measures reflect a sense of urgency with regard to climate change, except to the extent there are business opportunities that might be missed,” said Ralph Torrie, research director of Corporate Knights.

Catherine Abreu, director of the International Climate Politics Hub and member of Canada’s Net-Zero Advisory Body, referred to “the dumpster fire that is Carney dismantling Canada’s climate architecture while talking about ‘bargains.’ It’s not a bargain when one side—in this case, the climate—loses everything it has, and the other side—fossil fuel shareholders—gets everything it wants.” Abreu was unable to join the group today, but replied to The Mix’s invitation earlier this week from Rio, where she is already onsite for pre-COP30 meetings.

“We were looking for much-needed clarity on how Ottawa would diversify the economy away from volatile fossil fuels, meet our international climate obligations, and steer Canada towards a safer and more affordable clean energy future. We’re still waiting,” Caroline Brouillette, executive director of Climate Action Network Canada, said in a statement shared with the chat.

“This budget shows that ‘austerity’ applies to efforts to protect people and the planet—but that more money can always be found for military spending and polluting industries,” Brouillette continued. “It fails to make any reference to emissions reductions commitments or Canada’s next international climate finance contribution, announces plans to water down anti-greenwashing legislation, takes another step away from the cap on oil and gas emissions, and cuts international assistance.”

“Today’s budget exposes a missed opportunity for Canada to invest in local economies and urban climate action,” added Bryan Purcell, vice-president of policy and programs for The Atmospheric Fund. “While the federal government reaffirms support for clean electricity and other broad climate measures, the budget offers limited funding or tools to help cities reduce emissions, adapt to climate impacts, or build local resilience. A lack of funding or policy signals to support electric vehicles or energy efficiency leaves struggling domestic industries even more uncertain, and climate targets further out of reach.

“Budget 2025’s Climate Competitiveness Strategy recognizes the economic growth potential of clean energy and the investments needed to bolster Canada’s clean energy sector. While it reaffirms the importance of the Investment Tax Credits, the strategy lacks the ambition needed to keep Canada competitive with leading clean economies. It does little to advance key technologies that could reduce costs for Canadians, such as electric vehicles, heat pumps, and rooftop solar.”

The 14-page document starts with an unequivocal statement: “Climate action is not just a moral obligation—it’s an economic necessity.”

Beyond that, the strategy “shows no commitment to the government’s legal obligation to meet its 2030 GHG reduction targets” said sustainability expert Bob Willard.

Even given Carney’s emphasis on “results, not targets”, the strategy falls short, Willard said. “For an economist and businessman, Carney should know better.”

In fact, the strategy includes plenty of references to targets, Willard said—they’re just thinly disguised as results, without dates attached.

“They provide a lot of wiggle room and room for interpretation, especially the emphasis on carbon ‘intensity’ reductions rather than on absolute reductions.”

The strategy acknowledges the need to cut emissions. It states:

“Lowering our emissions is critical to protecting the competitiveness of Canada’s oil and gas and steel sectors. Reducing emissions is not only essential for environmental reasons, but also a key factor in securing access to markets that prioritise sustainability. By becoming a global leader in clean technology and clean energy, Canada can strengthen its competitive advantage and expand its exports, particularly in sectors where low-carbon solutions are increasingly seen as a requirement rather than a bonus.”

At the same time, it paints an at-times conflicting picture of Canada’s global status, claiming “Canada’s natural resources, workforce, and commitment to fighting climate change position us to surpass economies that fail to adapt,” while including data that seems to reflect a less positive position. GHG emissions from oil and gas production in Canada, according to this chart from the report, are among the highest globally, contrary to the title of the chart.

The budget has left many wondering about the future of the emissions cap, which the government hints could become unnecessary down the road, but doesn’t outright eliminate.

The budget statement reaffirmed the government’s commitment to “bringing down the emissions associated with the production of oil and gas.”

“Effective carbon markets, enhanced oil and gas methane regulations, and the deployment at scale of technologies such as carbon capture and storage would create the circumstances whereby the oil and gas emissions cap would no longer be required as it would have marginal value in reducing emissions.”

Conor Curtis, head of communications at Sierra Club Canada said “people want clear regulations on big polluters.”

“The framing of the emissions cap by the government is straight from the oil and gas corporations, and it’s both wrong and bad communications,” he said.

He said polling shows there’s nothing to suggest the emissions cap is truly controversial in Canada and there is a lot of support for climate action.

“Following the Alberta Government’s unsuccessful campaign against the emissions cap, polling showed the majority of Canadians were aware of the policy, and 67% thought the emissions cap would either make a significant or some impact on climate goals,” Curtis said

He said this is actually a “strength it has versus carbon pricing.” Sierra Club Canada’s position is that “Canadians want a well implemented policy and it’s time to put aside divisions and perfect the emissions cap.”

Curtis said even Albertans say it’s how the cap is implemented that’s important, with as many as 51% of support hinging on the implementation. In Atlantic Canada, 78% either support or say it’s a matter of implementation.

Joe Vipond of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE) quipped, “is there any chance the cancelling of the emissions cap will be offset by strengthening the Industrial carbon price? or am I in dream lala land.”

The Mix received a heartening message from Seth Klein and Bushra Asghar of the Climate Emergency Unit:

“After many years of campaigning, we are relieved and heartened to see the Youth Climate Corps (YCC) established in Budget 2025, with a commitment of $40 million over two years. This is a win for hundreds of young activists and allies who have pressed hard for this idea, especially in the context of a budget that is significantly retreating on climate and decreasing overall program spending. But notably, $20 million a year will only produce about 350 full-time jobs for the whole country, which is not terribly consequential for tackling the skyrocketing youth unemployment or addressing the climate crisis. Today’s announcement is a far cry from the $1 billion annual investment our campaign has called for, but it gets our foot in the door to prove the YCC’s worth. So we will roll up our sleeves and work with the government to up the ambition for a Youth Climate Corps that matches the generational challenge.”

George P.R. Benson, senior manager for economic development at the Zero Emissions Innovation Centre said he was nervous to see what’s in store for Canada’s greenwashing rules. “They’re saying they will remove some of the “confusing” aspects of the Competition Act that they just went through the whole process of updating,” Benson said, adding he’ll be tracking what the government removes from the guidelines.

“Today’s weakening of greenwashing rules is more than just a problem for the climate, it is a problem for the security of our democracy,” Conor Curtis, head of communications at Sierra Club Canada, said in a statement he posted to the chat.

Curtis said that the spread of disinformation and climate denial—purposely spread by oil and gas corporations—is contributing to a breakdown of democratic processes in the United States.

“Canada needs strong regulations to ensure that oil and gas corporations—who have large sums of money to spend on influence—are held to the highest possible standard of truthfulness.”

The Energy Mix publisher shared a missive from the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE), highlighting its key budget takeaways, including one on the Competition Act.

Greenwashing Risks: Removing the Competition Act amendments lets polluters mislead people in Canada and undermines truly sustainable businesses.

Matt Price, Executive Director, Investors for Paris Compliance said in a statement: “The government’s proposal to weaken greenwashing provisions means more investor risk, particularly given the reluctance of provincial securities regulators to enforce accurate and complete disclosure in climate matters.”

Ecojustice’s Karine Peloffy sent out a statement calling for the passage of the Climate-Aligned Finance Act reintroduced in Senate last week. “A failure to implement stronger rules to safeguard the financial and climate systems could open the door to litigation, as illustrated by the recent case against CPP Investments alleging climate-related financial risk mismanagement,” Peloffy said.

“The government should not remove the ability for Canadians to bring allegations of greenwashing directly to the Competition Tribunal, as is proposed in the budget,” Ecojustice lawyer Tanya Jemec said in a statement. “This would leave anti-greenwashing enforcement to the Competition Bureau, which has limited capacity, expertise, and resources.”

Gordon More, executive director of Southeast Techhub in Estevan, Saskatchewan was looking for new funding specifically targeting rural Canada and found none.

He commented that this is “where every single one of these nation building projects will be built.”

“Where do they think the labour force will come from? How will people who don’t have any access to technology training be able to help build, maintain and operate these facilities?” asked More.

He added that it’s “far cheaper to provide rural Canada with the tech training, then to import the skills from elsewhere.”

Luisa Da Silva, executive director at Iron & Earth said she wass “waiting to hear what will move the needle on real affordability for individuals.”

More said the new $1 billion fund-of-funds program is “huge” and will help prevent companies from leaving Canada.

“It also announces a new intellectual property performance review aimed at finding ways to ‘increase domestic investment in leading and high-potential firms’ and ‘help firms protect and commercialise their intellectual property in foreign markets,’” he added, quoting from the budget document.

Bryan Watson, managing director, CleanTech North said he’ll be interested to see how this new program rolls out.

Da Silva asked how vulnerable persons would benefit from the budget. She said she was hoping to see real affordability that “trickles down” to those most vulnerable persons.

“A lot of what has been said here perhaps sounds good for those in urban areas, for those who specialize or for those with professional designations,” she said, “but what about the vulnerable people, or those having a broad set of skills benefits their communities?”

Da Silva is concerned about people in small communities, and rural communities who “wear several hats like sitting on their local council, being the town plumber, and/or holding other unofficial posts.”

“Community resilience is stronger than the individual,” Da Silva said.

Instead of just building more houses, the government must tackle how people access the funding to purchase a home, she suggested. “The government can create a multitude of affordability there that goes beyond the first time home buyers incentives that are completely out of touch with today’s housing prices.”

When the current affordability crisis isn’t mentioned, those experiencing hardships feel forgotten, she added.

More said he’s disappointed there’s “nothing for rural, nothing for Saskatchewan.”

“I hope I am missing something between the lines. I know there is more to it than this document. But I do worry that there is no ‘healing’ mechanism, we are once again left out.”

He said he was just hoping the prime minister would do something different and now wonders if the Conservatives will vote against the budget, adding, an election is “the last thing we need.”

Responding to the budget statement on “expanding the Union Training and Innovation Program to boost union-based apprenticeship training in the Red Seal trades,” Abhilash Kantamneni of the Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Institute of Canada (HRAI) pointed out “a lot of skilled trades in the clean economy are not unionized (HVAC contractors, for example)”.

And the mention of that support resulting from a 15% savings target over three years coming from a “targeted recalibration of its programs and its approach to delivering them” “sounds “ominous,” Kantamneni said.

Meanwhile, Gordon More, executive director of Southeast Techhub in Estevan, Saskatchewan noted that “funding for labour force development continues to go to urban centres” rather than rural.

“For example, SaskPolytech wants to build the Nuclear Training Facility in Saskatoon—a five-hour trip, one way, from where the actual reactors will be located. When it comes to innovation hubs, almost every budget dollar also goes to urban incubation centres.”

A more effective approach, More said, would be to give Rural Economic Development “an actual budget that can only be spent on economic development for rural regions”.

With major projects planned primarily in rural areas, communities will need funding, resources, and training to handle the massive changes they’ll experience.

“Who’s going to house, feed, police, and provide medical services when you drop 2,500 workers into a community of 10,000 to build one of these projects?”

Carney campaigned on using a new fiscal management framework that splits operational and capital expenditures, George P.R. Benson, senior manager for economic development at the Zero Emissions Innovation Centre, said earlier today. “It’s more or less what it says on the tin—split out more clearly the stuff we build versus the stuff we operate.”

The Parliamentary budget office (PBO) likes this format, Benson added, but it is nervous about the breadth the government is proposing.

It wrote: “Finance Canada acknowledges the breadth of its definition and noted its intent to focus on spending classified as capital investments that would meet conditionality and identifiability criteria.

Finance Canada also identifies 6 categories of federal government spending that would be classified as capital investment.Finance Canada’s definition and categories expand the scope of capital investment beyond the current treatment of capital spending in the Public Accounts of Canada.1 Based on our initial assessment, we find that the scope is overly expansive and exceeds international practice such as that adopted by the United Kingdom.

Specifically, the inclusion of corporate income tax expenditures, operating (production) subsidies and measures to grow the housing stock likely overstate the actual contribution of federal government spending to non-residential capital formation in the economy. That is, federal spending under these categories represents the fiscal cost of related measures and not necessarily the amount of non-residential capital formation that will be undertaken in the economy because of these measures.”

Benson interprets the last line,as the PBO effectively saying: “building housing is good politics, and indeed stimulates investment, but that’s not the same as building wealth-generating infrastructure.”

“The ‘housing-as-investment’ mindset is still a tricky one to break, even if the government owns the assets at the end of the day, Benson said.

Ana Gonzalez Guerrero, an expert on climate finance for municipalities, responded to Benson saying that her concern is “where we are building houses and how much is resilience integrated as a key building principle, because building without resilience in mind is not only hard to justify as “wealth-generating”, but will become incredibly expensive.”

Disappointment and frustration were common themes among climate champions and experts who joined The Energy Mix for an online chat this afternoon and evening about the new federal budget or shared their comments from elsewhere with us.

“My first take is that neither the tone nor the measures reflect a sense of urgency with regard to climate change, except to the extent there are business opportunities that might be missed,” said Ralph Torrie, research director of Corporate Knights.

Catherine Abreu, director of the International Climate Politics Hub and member of Canada’s Net-Zero Advisory Body, referred to “the dumpster fire that is Carney dismantling Canada’s climate architecture while talking about ‘bargains.’ It’s not a bargain when one side—in this case, the climate—loses everything it has, and the other side—fossil fuel shareholders—gets everything it wants.” Abreu was unable to join the group today, but replied to The Mix’s invitation earlier this week from Rio, where she is already onsite for pre-COP30 meetings.

“We were looking for much-needed clarity on how Ottawa would diversify the economy away from volatile fossil fuels, meet our international climate obligations, and steer Canada towards a safer and more affordable clean energy future. We’re still waiting,” Caroline Brouillette, executive director of Climate Action Network Canada, said in a statement shared with the chat.

“This budget shows that ‘austerity’ applies to efforts to protect people and the planet—but that more money can always be found for military spending and polluting industries,” Brouillette continued. “It fails to make any reference to emissions reductions commitments or Canada’s next international climate finance contribution, announces plans to water down anti-greenwashing legislation, takes another step away from the cap on oil and gas emissions, and cuts international assistance.”

“Today’s budget exposes a missed opportunity for Canada to invest in local economies and urban climate action,” added Bryan Purcell, vice-president of policy and programs for The Atmospheric Fund. “While the federal government reaffirms support for clean electricity and other broad climate measures, the budget offers limited funding or tools to help cities reduce emissions, adapt to climate impacts, or build local resilience. A lack of funding or policy signals to support electric vehicles or energy efficiency leaves struggling domestic industries even more uncertain, and climate targets further out of reach.

“Budget 2025’s Climate Competitiveness Strategy recognizes the economic growth potential of clean energy and the investments needed to bolster Canada’s clean energy sector. While it reaffirms the importance of the Investment Tax Credits, the strategy lacks the ambition needed to keep Canada competitive with leading clean economies. It does little to advance key technologies that could reduce costs for Canadians, such as electric vehicles, heat pumps, and rooftop solar.”

The 14-page document starts with an unequivocal statement: “Climate action is not just a moral obligation—it’s an economic necessity.”

Beyond that, the strategy “shows no commitment to the government’s legal obligation to meet its 2030 GHG reduction targets” said sustainability expert Bob Willard.

Even given Carney’s emphasis on “results, not targets”, the strategy falls short, Willard said. “For an economist and businessman, Carney should know better.”

In fact, the strategy includes plenty of references to targets, Willard said—they’re just thinly disguised as results, without dates attached.

“They provide a lot of wiggle room and room for interpretation, especially the emphasis on carbon ‘intensity’ reductions rather than on absolute reductions.”

The strategy acknowledges the need to cut emissions. It states:

“Lowering our emissions is critical to protecting the competitiveness of Canada’s oil and gas and steel sectors. Reducing emissions is not only essential for environmental reasons, but also a key factor in securing access to markets that prioritise sustainability. By becoming a global leader in clean technology and clean energy, Canada can strengthen its competitive advantage and expand its exports, particularly in sectors where low-carbon solutions are increasingly seen as a requirement rather than a bonus.”

At the same time, it paints an at-times conflicting picture of Canada’s global status, claiming “Canada’s natural resources, workforce, and commitment to fighting climate change position us to surpass economies that fail to adapt,” while including data that seems to reflect a less positive position. GHG emissions from oil and gas production in Canada, according to this chart from the report, are among the highest globally, contrary to the title of the chart.

That commitment remained at the forefront in 2025 as Cornerstone and its site companies at Cornerstone Energy Park (CEP) invested in local schools and neighborhood initiatives designed to support both the local community and the regional economy.

Throughout the year, CEP focused on modernization, positioning the site for sustainable operations and continued investment. Alongside co-locating site companies, Cornerstone makes in-demand products that increase the longevity of everyday goods, including vehicles and lumber, and processes like water purification and diesel emission abatement. In creating these products, Cornerstone and its site companies aim to reduce their environmental footprint while prioritizing the health and safety of their employees and community.

One major milestone in 2025 was the groundbreaking for a $500 million manufacturing facility for the CEP site company UBE C1 Chemicals America (UCCA).

“UCCA is proud to work alongside cosponsors who share our commitment to community investment and to building relationships with our neighbors. Through this year’s activities, we had meaningful opportunities to strengthen connections within the Waggaman community and continue building relationships that deliver lasting value for the region,” said UCCA President and CEO Tom Yura.

During the groundbreaking ceremony, Yura also announced $50,000 in continued community investments to local organizations.

“UCCA represents exactly the kind of thoughtful, long-term investment we work to attract to Cornerstone Energy Park,” said Jacques Byrd, vice president of site development at Cornerstone. “By announcing direct community investments at the groundbreaking, UCCA underscored that this facility is committed to being a responsible and engaged neighbor in the communities where we live and work.”

That community commitment from Cornerstone and its CEP co-locating companies was seen time and again in tangible ways. When there was a major holiday on the calendar, the companies were there – distributing Easter goodie bags at the Waggaman Community Foundation Easter Egg Hunt, participating in neighborhood Halloween celebrations and providing more than 800 goodie bags to local organizations, restocking shelves with food donations to the South Kenner Food Bank ahead of Thanksgiving, providing meals for the Little Zion Baptist Church Community Thanksgiving Luncheon, contributing to the Waggaman Community Foundation’s River Road Christmas Party and supporting the Live Oak Fire Department Christmas Parade and Party.

Beyond seasonal events, CEP site companies also supported broader civic and community-building efforts in 2025, including:

Through its Cornerstone Scholarship Program, the company awarded 10 eligible local students with $1,000 scholarships to pursue STEM-related degrees at accredited institutions. Another three students received sponsorships to attend the Louisiana Youth Seminar, a weeklong summer camp for high schoolers to develop skills in leadership, communication, goal-setting, team-building, problem-solving and more. And, female high school students were able to connect with women currently working in industrial careers thanks in part to Cornerstone’s participation in the Women in Industry Forum hosted by the New Orleans Region Industry Alliance.

As Cornerstone leaders look ahead to 2026, they view responsible corporate citizenship as an ongoing commitment to listening to community needs and taking meaningful action to strengthen the place where its employees live and work.

He has approved a 90-day pause in offshore wind projects off Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York and Virginia.
Katharine Kollins, president of the nonprofit Southeastern Wind Coalition headquartered in Chapel Hill, is skeptical about the Trump administration’s claim that national security issues are behind the sudden stoppage of wind power projects.
Josh Stein should push to continue the extensive planning and testing needed to expand wind power in North Carolina.
By the time Trump leaves office, North Carolina should be ready to go with the wind.","President Donald Trump’s move this week to pause five major offshore wind power projects won’t affect North Carolina directly, but it represents another setback for tapping one of the greatest wind energy resources on the East Coast.

North Carolina should be among the nation’s leaders in harnessing its strong coastal winds offshore and onshore to generate electricity. Getting there has been stymied by opposition from coastal communities, military and environmental concerns, and a lack of commitment from the state’s largest utility, Duke Energy.

But those issues can be overcome. Offshore wind turbines would be so far off the coast as to be barely visible. Turbine locations can accommodate military concerns about flight paths and radar interference. Offshore turbines elsewhere have not presented environmental threats. Duke Energy, facing growing demands for electricity and pressure to reduce carbon emissions, could see the value of adding more wind power.

That potential turnaround is now further off as Trump has declared war on wind power. He has approved a 90-day pause in offshore wind projects off Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York and Virginia. Some were near completion and all are badly needed.

The pause, ostensibly ordered out of national security concerns, may lead to an extended stoppage. That would not only cost developers of the existing projects, but it would scare off potential investors in future projects.

Katharine Kollins, president of the nonprofit Southeastern Wind Coalition headquartered in Chapel Hill, is skeptical about the Trump administration’s claim that national security issues are behind the sudden stoppage of wind power projects.

“I can’t imagine there’s any validity to it, given the extensive process all these have gone through,” she said. “There are no surprises like that that just come up.”

Kollins noted that China has erected extensive fields of offshore wind turbines without concerns about interference with its defense systems.

Companies that have invested in wind power will go to court to end the stoppage, Kollins said. “I have no doubt that lawsuits will follow,” she said. “There is $30 billion in investment on the line. Companies aren’t going to say, ‘OK.’ ”

Dominion Energy, the utility developing a large wind farm off Virginia, has already filed a complaint in federal court.

What’s really driving the shutdown is Trump’s support of the fossil fuel industry and his personal dislike for wind power. He unsuccessfully sought to block wind turbines near one of his golf courses in Scotland and has repeatedly attacked the “windmills” as unsightly and a hazard to birds.

Trump is letting his bias undermine what should be his first concern – reducing the cost of living. The rapid growth of data centers to support AI development has ramped up the demand for electricity and is putting upward pressure on electricity rates. Adding new sources of electricity would help utilities meet that rising demand and while holding down rates.

While wind power has long been heralded as a way to reduce the use of fossil fuels in power plants, it’s now being recommended as an additional source under an “all the above” approach to electricity generation.

“What has happened is that utilities find themselves in a place where they need every electron they can get,” Kollins said.

Wind power complements solar power among renewable energy sources. While solar power is at its best during sunny days, wind blows stronger at night and during stormy weather.

Beyond its fit among energy sources, wind power also generates construction jobs and has spurred the building of specialized large ships to carry huge turbine parts and lay cable.

The benefits of land-based wind farms are already being realized in North Carolina. The Timbermill wind farm has 45 turbines spread over 6,000 acres in Chowan County in the state’s northeastern corner. It is now the county’s largest single taxpayer even as its presence allows most of the land to still be used for crops.

Trump’s tantrum against wind power means more counties won’t be seeing its benefits. But Gov. Josh Stein should push to continue the extensive planning and testing needed to expand wind power in North Carolina. By the time Trump leaves office, North Carolina should be ready to go with the wind.",https://www.newsobserver.com/public/latest-news/dd583c/picture6761589/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/cdlPB.So.156.jpeg,N,,2025-12-28 11:00:16.681718

Among the most influential, and often most confusing of these rules, is the definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS). Over the past decade, frequent regulatory changes and court decisions have left many farmers questioning what WOTUS really means for their operations. From the start of this debate, the American Farm Bureau Federation has been the leading voice across industry sectors, consistently advocating for clear, practical regulations that protect farmers while ensuring environmental stewardship.

EVOLVING DEFINITION

Under the Clean Water Act, the term WOTUS serves as the threshold that determines which water bodies fall under federal jurisdiction. Unfortunately, the statute offers little clarity on where that jurisdictional line should be drawn. Over the years, the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the agencies) have exploited this ambiguity, expanding their authority far beyond what Congress intended when drafting the law.

From the mid-1980s onward, the agencies operated under a regulatory definition that broadly interpreted WOTUS to include many waters. This expansive interpretation repeatedly ran up against judicial scrutiny. The Supreme Court’s decisions on the limits of the federal government’s regulatory reach, in cases such as Riverside Bayview Homes, Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County, and Rapanos, often created more questions than answers.

For example, the Supreme Court’s 4-1-4 split in Rapanos created conflicting standards for federal jurisdiction. Justice Antonin Scalia’s plurality introduced the “relatively permanent waters” test, while Justice Anthony Kennedy’s concurrence advanced the “significant nexus” test. With no majority opinion, this fractured guidance left regulators and courts without a clear rule, fueling years of litigation and inconsistent interpretations as successive administrations struggled to define WOTUS.

Beginning in 2015, the regulatory uncertainty was exacerbated as different presidential administrations attempted to make sweeping changes, creating a swinging pendulum of regulations. Consequently, the definition of WOTUS became a legal and regulatory maze — one in which wetlands, ditches, seasonal streams, drainage features or even ephemeral streams (low spots in a farm field) could be regulated. Over the last decade, there have been five different rulemakings on WOTUS. The ping-ponging of definitions has produced anxiety and uncertainty for farmers and ranchers whose decisions on the farm depend heavily on clear rules.

SACKETT V. EPA: A TURNING POINT

The 2023 Supreme Court decision in Sackett v. EPA marked one of the most consequential shifts in federal water regulations since the passage of the CWA. This decision greatly narrowed the types of water features and wetlands regulated as a WOTUS and simplified compliance for landowners. The Supreme Court accomplished this by unanimously eliminating the troubling “significant nexus” test, which allowed the federal government to set up a case-by-case regulatory regime that expanded their jurisdictional reach beyond legal boundaries.

Additionally, the ruling greatly restricted the types of wetlands that fall under federal authority by providing proper guardrails for “adjacent wetland.” Farmers and ranchers across the country praised the court’s decision because it is the clearest, most decisive legal standard for WOTUS in decades and appropriately reigns in the federal government’s authority.

UNDERSTANDING THE PROPOSED WOTUS RULE

On Nov. 17, 2025, the Trump administration proposed a new WOTUS definition that implements the Sackett decision and upholds congressional intent under the CWA. The rule represents the greatest narrowing of the federal government’s jurisdictional reach over private property. As directed by the Supreme Court, the proposal only regulates water bodies that are “relatively permanent” — meaning surface waters that flow or stand year-round or those that flow throughout the wet season — and wetlands that are directly abutting a regulated tributary and have a continuous surface connection.

As an example, features like isolated ponds, field-edge depressions, disconnected wetlands, groundwater and many ditches or prior-converted cropland would be excluded. The rule also proposes to define key terms (like “tributary,” “ditch,” “prior converted cropland,” etc.) to bring consistency and predictability to what is “in” and what is “out.” This also reduces the amount of land subject to the regulation, cutting down regulatory costs across the industry.

Most importantly, this rule shifts the burden of proof away from the landowner and places this responsibility squarely on the federal government, meaning a farmer no longer must prove that they do not have a WOTUS on their property to use their land.

It is critical to recognize that this rule upholds the cooperative federalism objective of the CWA by allowing states to serve as the primary authority in regulating water. State governments can regulate far beyond the definition of WOTUS and impose their own, more stringent rules. In many states, just because a water feature is not regulated by the federal government, does not necessarily mean that it goes unregulated.

While this rule is an important step forward in creating a legally durable definition of WOTUS, implementation of the rule may present some challenges. One potential hurdle for some landowners will be determining if there is sustained flow throughout the wet season. In some instances, field-level data may need to be collected, which could significantly slow down the jurisdictional determination process. This also impedes farmers’ ability to use their land, potentially cutting their production and revenue capacity.

COST OF COMPLIANCE

Ensuring compliance under WOTUS for farmers can include several major components that impact a farmer’s cost of production:

Obtaining Clean Water Act federal permits for activities like fencing, drainage or pond construction;

Hiring consultants and technical experts for wetland determinations;

Experiencing operational delays while waiting for permit approvals; and

The cost of mitigation activities which can often be substantial.

Because Clean Water Act compliance carries significant civil and criminal liabilities — up to $64,000 per day or even jail time — it is critical that farmers fully understand the rules to avoid inadvertent violations.

Farmers care about the definition of WOTUS because it determines which ditches, wetlands and water features on their land fall under federal regulation — and therefore which everyday activities may require permits, carry compliance obligations or expose them to legal risk and regulatory costs to ensure compliance. Whether they are installing tile, building a fence, cleaning out a ditch, expanding cropland or managing drainage after heavy rains, the scope of WOTUS directly influences what farmers can do without federal oversight.

European authorities have eased requirements for the transition to electric vehicles, providing much-needed relief to local businesses and thousands of families whose livelihoods depend on the city’s factories. Mayor Jesús Julio Carnero openly expresses his satisfaction: these changes have arrived just as the region is launching major projects to introduce new technologies in the automotive sector.

In recent months, Valladolid has seen several major investment proposals. Chinese company Gotion plans to build a massive battery manufacturing plant here, while Horse has already announced a €71 million investment to develop hybrid systems at its facility. Regional authorities have declared this project a priority to safeguard more than 9,000 jobs, with nearly 2,300 at the plant itself and the rest in related industries.

Investment and jobs

The European Union’s decision to relax environmental requirements from 2035 followed lengthy discussions. Valladolid officials had insisted from the outset on a flexible approach to prevent mass layoffs and the erosion of industrial potential. In September, the city took the initiative to support competitive climate neutrality in the automotive sector, and this approach has now received endorsement at the European level.

In the coming years, not only electric vehicles but also other low-emission technologies will develop in Valladolid: hybrid engines, hydrogen, biofuels, and synthetic fuels. This will preserve market diversity, offer consumers more choices, and give businesses time to adapt.

Industrial potential

The automotive industry is key to the economy of Castilla y León. It accounts for 10% of the region’s GDP and half of its exports. In addition to Valladolid, major car plants operate in Burgos and Ávila. In recent years, the region has actively attracted investments, including from Germany, where demand for Spanish cars and components is rising.

Renault’s Valladolid facility has already started producing new models, including hybrid versions. A new car rolls off the production line every minute, and expansion plans focus on further introducing eco-friendly technologies. Regional authorities have extended Renault’s priority investment project status through 2026 to support modernization and jobs.

Policy and competition

European Parliament member Raúl de la Hoz attended the meeting with auto industry representatives, noting that European decisions are opening new opportunities for the sector. He said previous strict requirements could have triggered a crisis and hurt competitiveness, but now companies have a chance for a smoother transition to new standards.

At the same time, disagreements persist in Spain between the central government and regional authorities. Madrid continues to push for a complete ban on internal combustion engines by 2035, while regional governments and industry leaders are calling for a more flexible approach. Valladolid and Castilla y León advocate for protecting jobs and industrial capacity without giving up on environmental goals.

The Future of the Automotive Industry

The easing of European requirements has served as a call to action for Valladolid. New investments in hybrid technology development have already been approved, and battery production and plant modernization projects have been granted priority status. This will not only support jobs but also enable the region to maintain its leading position in the Spanish and European automotive sectors.

In the coming years, Valladolid will become one of the key sites for testing new technological solutions in the automotive industry. Here, traditional manufacturing facilities will be combined with innovative approaches to reducing emissions, giving the city and region a chance for sustainable development in a changing market.",https://russpain.com/wp-content/smush-webp/2025/12/f.elconfidencial.com_original_a5e_376_246_a5e376246e50d577587e0ed183869bc6-1-1-780x470.jpg.webp,N,,2025-12-28 10:59:45.165172

• Leader & Times

The Liberal City Commission and some members of the community got to hear about an exciting economic development opportunity making its way to Liberal from overseas.

Seward County Development Corporation Executive Director Eli Svaty gave an update to the commission at its most recent meeting last Tuesday evening.

“I actually first would like to apologize for it taking so long to get to this point, I feel like this announcement could have come many months ago – in fact, this was announced in Taiwan back in September,” Svaty began with a chuckle. “If you'll recall, we had a couple projects ready to go last spring, but then they fell apart, so forgive me for being slightly gun-shy with this project and making sure everything was actually in place. This project is a really unexpected opportunity for Liberal. For more than a year now, Scarlette [Diseker] and Jose [Lara] and I have been working with a company out of Taiwan, and in early conversations, we were sitting there thinking 'Why would THIS come to Liberal?' and then as time kept going and the visits kept happening, there was that sense of this project being a great opportunity for the community. In that part of the world, they manufacture pretty much everything, and right now, there's a big push in Taiwan to get some of that manufacturing out for a number of reasons. One reason is tariffs, and another reason is the threat of China, and another reason is that need to be made in the U.S. and a desire to access our markets. As it so happens, we came into contact with one of those companies a little more than a year ago, and we've since been working with them to make that a reality. What's really remarkable is one of the first visits the company's leadership team made was at Pancake Day, which was cold and cloudy and super windy – however, that did not deter them, and they've since made multiple visits when the weather's been much more agreeable.”

Svaty then gave more of the logistical information about where everything will be set up.

“1600 W. Pancake Blvd. is going to be the home of Apogee Power, and they are an advanced manufacturing company for batteries and energy storage systems. Liberal will be the company's first U.S.-based manufacturing of that, and things will happen in three different phases – a Hybrid Power Unit (HPU), a Ground Power Unit, and then the big-scale energy storage systems,” Svaty said. “The building at 1600 W. Pancake Blvd. will be the operations center where they'll do all the marketing, promotion/sales, warehousing and logistics, and the actual cell components will still be manufactured in Taiwan and then sent here, and then the manufacturing base will be where everything is compiled and assembled into the different units. Those operations will be run out of the building at 1600 W. Pancake Blvd. The building has some significant upgrades it will need to undergo like static-free floors and clean rooms and upgrades to the ventilation systems and all of that. I'm really excited to get that building filled and in use and provide them with the space they need.”

Apogee is also certainly no stranger to the energy world, Svaty continued.

“Apogee has been around a long time, and they have locations in Taiwan, Vietnam, and they have sales operations out of Japan, Cambodia, Indonesia, and multiple other parts of Asia. They supply batteries for agricultural equipment from Kubota and other machinery in Asia,” Svaty said. “This company has been contracting in the U.S. for more than 20 years, primarily with the Department of Defense, and because of the quality of their products, they have technology that helps keep them explosion-proof and fireproof, and they also work significantly with the mining industry. I greatly appreciate City of Liberal leadership from the past year, it's been a great opportunity because so much of this is built on that relationship. This is not a typical project for Southwest Kansas, and I know the state is excited because they've been trying to get something out of Taiwan for a while, and we're leading that charge. The initial plan is 20 to 30 jobs and expanding to around 70 within the first couple years, and those jobs will come from our base and bring in people from around the area. Their engineers will come over and train the people and bring everyone up to speed. This is a great way to start showing even somewhere like Liberal can have a global impact and work with companies from around the world. Even more exciting is from the beginning, they said they know of other companies who want to set up operations in the U.S. We are happy to provide that home for this company in Liberal – they need to move some of their manufacturing and need a protected place in the U.S., and we're very excited. We're excited to see this project come to life and see what else they could bring to the table.”

Others also praised the project.

“Liberal definitely has some helpful attributes, such as being centralized, and we've always discussed how we could sell that. This company really liked that, and we also have a bit of security from the coast, which they noticed,” Liberal Mayor Jose Lara said. “At the end of the day, we also get something from the eastern side of the state and the relationships we've fostered there. Having the building available was also very beneficial, and that could lead to other conversations with other potential businesses to set up.”

“There's one of the guys on the Taiwan team I've only met once, but you could really sense the strength of the relationship that was built, and all of this came together because of that relationship,” Commissioner Jeff Parsons added. “Also, we really seemed to be in just the right situation for everything to come together, and I think the strength of this relationship is what's going to help us with attracting other companies that might come after Apogee. It was also really gratifying to see the excitement they have about coming to this part of the world, so kudos to everyone involved with this and all the hard work it took to get everything going.”

“I really think this reinforces the spirit of Liberal and how this truly is the friendliest city in the U.S., and I also have to thank everyone involved for all of their hard work,” Commissioner Janeth Vazquez said.

In other new business, the commission approved a contract and changes with French Construction for the Doll Addition, and also approved Resolution No. 2447 concerning the adoption of the Kansas Homeland Security Region D Local Hazard Mitigation Plan.

The commission also approved minor updates to the Housing Grant Programs funded by the 1-Cent Sales Tax and updated 2026 Facade Grant guidelines, and concluded the meeting’s new business by approving utility billing waivers for Stepping Stone Shelter in the amount of $2,079.98.",https://liberalfirst.com/images/2025/December/Apogee%20Liberal%20location%20courtesy%20photo.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 11:13:28.129723

The partnership in developing renewable energy-based power plant projects is aimed at ensuring that green projects not only obtain financing but are also developed in a planned, integrated manner that is in line with the needs of the national electricity system.

Chief Executive Officer of Danantara Indonesia, Pandu Sjahrir, on Monday, 22 December, emphasised that Danantara’s role in this collaboration goes beyond that of a mere fund provider. According to him, Danantara is also actively involved in identifying various challenges in the development of renewable energy projects, ranging from financing aspects and project readiness to integration with the electricity system.

According to Pandu, this approach is necessary so that the development of new and renewable energy (NRE) does not proceed sporadically, but rather has a clear and sustainable framework. With targeted investment support, green power plant projects are expected to be realised on schedule and have a broad economic impact.

“With this approach, we want to ensure that the development of renewable energy can proceed in a more structured and timely manner, and be integrated with the needs of the national electricity system,” he said.

From the perspective of the electricity system operator, PLN Director-General Darmawan Prasodjo believes that collaboration with Danantara is a key factor in ensuring the sustainability of the energy transition. He emphasised that the transformation towards a clean energy system cannot be achieved by one institution alone, but requires synergy across stakeholders and long-term financial support.

“The energy transition cannot be done alone. Strong collaboration and solid, sustainable financial support are needed,” said Darmawan.

According to him, Danantara’s involvement strengthens PLN’s ability to realise renewable energy power plant projects listed in the Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL). With more structured investment support, PLN is optimistic that the construction of green power plants can proceed according to target and support the reliability of the national electricity supply.

“The presence of Danantara Indonesia strengthens PLN’s efforts to develop renewable energy in a more structured manner, while ensuring that the green projects listed in the RUPTL can run on schedule and provide long-term benefits for the community and the national electricity system,” said Darmawan.

This collaboration is expected to become a model for financing and developing clean energy projects in the future, especially amid increasing investment needs to achieve national renewable energy mix targets. In addition to supporting emission reduction, the development of green power plants is also seen as an opportunity to create new jobs and strengthen Indonesia’s energy security in the long term.

While people living near these toxic coke oven facilities are breathing in poison every day, corporate polluters get another pass.","On Monday, multiple organizations filed a lawsuit challenging exemptions from President Donald Trump’s administration that would allow coke ovens to spew chemicals that lead to hazardous air pollution.

Involved organizations include the Environmental Law and Policy Center, EarthJustice, Just Transition Northwest Indiana, Hoosier Environmental Council and Sierra Club.

“This latest proclamation for coke ovens continues the Trump administration’s year-long practice of undermining industry’s compliance with toxic air pollutant standards by issuing meritless exemptions and delays,” Brian Lynk, senior attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center, said in a news release. “The communities who live with these plants and depend on clean and healthy air, in Northwest Indiana and around the country, deserve better.”

Coke ovens are used in steelmaking, heating coal to produce coke, which is used as a fuel. The ovens are a “major source of hazardous pollution,” according to the Environmental Law and Policy Center, which includes toxic chemicals and metals, including lead, mercury and benzene.

In November, Trump issued a proclamation providing regulatory relief for coke ovens nationwide, according to the White House, claiming that a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency coke oven rule places “severe burdens on the coke production industry” and affects American infrastructure, defense and national security.

“Many of the testing and monitoring requirements outlined in the coke oven rule rely on technologies that are not practically available, not demonstrated at the necessary scale, or cannot be implemented safely or consistently under real-world conditions,” the proclamation said. “Due to the coke oven rule’s onerous implementation and compliance schedule for these standards, many coke production facilities are in the impossible position of designing and engineering novel systems with unproven technology within a short time frame.”

It allows a two-year exemption to the coke oven rule because Trump claimed the technology doesn’t exist commercially and cannot allow corporations to comply with the rule. The Environmental Law and Policy Center claims that the exemption applied to more than 180 facilities across six industries, including Cleveland-Cliffs’ Indiana Harbor steel facility in East Chicago.

“The Trump administration is delivering another tough blow to local communities,” Tosh Sagar, senior attorney at EarthJustice, said in a news release. “These unlawful exemptions have real consequences for real people. While people living near these toxic coke oven facilities are breathing in poison every day, corporate polluters get another pass. Corporate profits should not come at the expense of public health.”

According to the Environmental Law and Policy Center, the EPA finalized revisions to the Clean Air Act that introduced the 2024 coke ovens rule, which “introduced a fenceline monitoring requirement, stricter limits on leaks from coke oven battery doors, lids and offtakes, and new emission standards for several hazardous air pollutants.”

Compliance deadlines were staggered between July 2025 and January 2026.

“Communities living near steel industry coke ovens advocated for many years for common-sense federal regulations to protect them from hazardous air pollution,” Haley Lewis, senior attorney for the Environmental Integrity Project, said in a news release. “The EPA’s 2024 rule requiring air monitoring and cleanup of dangerous levels of pollution from coke ovens would have provided meaningful improvements, had President Trump not granted an exemption last month. This exemption should be thrown out by the courts for the sake of the health of all the workers and families living near the industry.”",https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ctc-l-CO2-Lippert019_218509974.jpg?w=1024&h=767,N,,2025-12-28 11:00:08.103461

A nearly $20 billion bombshell from Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) might have been the shoe drop the automotive industry was waiting to see.

The Trump administration has been busy introducing tariffs, reducing support for electric vehicles (EVs), and of course, removing the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV purchases. In part due to that, among other factors, the U.S. EV industry is expected to see a significant slowdown during the fourth quarter that will almost certainly extend into next year.

Because of these drastic shifts in demand and market potential, Ford just announced a $19.5 billion bombshell about its future ambitions. Here's what investors need to know.

What's going on?

It's tough to make a living selling EVs in the current environment, and after touting massive EV investment figures in recent years -- like much of the industry -- the Detroit automaker decided it was better to redistribute some of that investment to higher-return opportunities. This week, Ford announced a number of actions that are intended to refocus its Ford+ plan and drive profitable growth.

To take these actions, Ford expects to record roughly $19.5 billion in special items related to a restructuring and a pullback in its full-electric vehicle investments. For investors, it's important to note that most of the charges will take place during the fourth quarter, followed by $5.5 billion to be charged through 2027, with most of that to be paid next year.

These charges will impact the automaker's net results, but it won't alter the company's adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), the figures Wall Street estimates are based on.

""This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient, and more profitable Ford,"" said Ford president and CEO Jim Farley in a press release. ""The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids, and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business.""

What's in it for investors?

Ford's new plans include an increased focus on hybrid vehicles, including plug-in models, rather than full-electric vehicles, and canceling a next generation of large all-electric trucks in exchange for smaller and more affordable EVs. By the end of this decade, Ford expects about 50% of its global volume to be hybrids, extended-range EVs, and fully electric vehicles, up drastically from 17% in 2025.

Here's what's of interest to investors hoping Ford can quickly reverse its billions in losses driven by its Model e EV business. These changes are expected to provide a path to profitability for Model e by 2029. According to Ford, investors can expect to see annual improvements beginning in 2026. Remember that in 2024, Ford's Model e losses topped $5 billion, and simply breaking even would boost the bottom-line.

Ford also threw a little curveball to investors with its next move. The automaker expects to repurpose its EV battery factory in Kentucky to build batteries to power data centers and energy infrastructure. As the artificial intelligence (AI) boom continues, and the strain on the electric grid from data centers and infrastructure, Ford sees opportunity to capture demand for battery energy storage systems (BESS) and plans to invest roughly $2 billion over the next two years to scale the business.

What it all means

Investors can't know for certain if this huge pivot is the right move, especially considering the next presidential administration could make substantial changes of its own, but they are logical with the market at the moment. These decisions from Ford are massive, and if executed as intended, should pay off for years.

Perhaps the largest takeaway for investors is the change in mindset. Decades ago -- whether you want to call it arrogance, stubbornness, or something else -- Ford likely wouldn't have adjusted its strategy, and could have even doubled down on EVs at the wrong time. Now, however, it's clear Ford is adjusting to land its business where the markets are going, not where we hoped it would be -- and that is a big win.

Bill Gates recently made headlines by suggesting that climate change is no longer a priority, but the American public begs to differ.

In this last election, climate change was a defining issue in states like Virginia and Georgia, where voters grappled with rising energy costs. And no matter how much tech billionaires try to distract us, increasing power costs and our worsening climate are directly connected to corporations like Google, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon racing to dominate the AI landscape.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the price of energy has risen at more than twice the rate of inflation since 2020, and Big Tech’s push for more power-hungry data centers is only making it worse.

The data centers proliferating across the country drive up energy costs by powering energy-ravenous generative AI, cloud storage, digital networks and other energy intensive programs — much of it fueled by coal and natural gas that exacerbate climate change.

In some cases, data centers consume enough electricity to power the equivalent of a small city. The wholesale price of electricity in areas housing data centers is up a whopping 267% from five years ago — and everyday customers are eating those costs.

Americans are also shouldering increasing costs of an extreme climate.

The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard noted that insurance prices rose 74% between 2008 and 2024 — and between 2018 and 2023, nearly 2 million people had their policies canceled by insurers because of climate risks.

Meanwhile, home prices have gone up 40% in the past two decades — meaning the cost of home repair and recovery from climate disasters has also grown, all while wages remain stagnant.

Data centers aren’t just putting our wallets at risk. Power grids across the country are already strained from aging infrastructure and repeated battering during extreme weather events.

The additional pressure to feed energy-intensive data centers only heightens the risk of power blackouts in emergencies like wildfires, deep freezes and hurricanes. And in some communities, people’s taps have literally run dry because data centers used all the local groundwater.

Worse still, Big Tech’s AI energy demand has triggered a resurgence in dirty energy with the construction of new gas-powered energy plants and delayed shutdowns of fossil fuel-powered plants. The tech industry is even pushing for a revitalization of nuclear energy, including the planned 2028 reopening of Three Mile Island — site of the worst nuclear power plant disaster in U.S. history — to help power Microsoft’s data centers.

Everyday people bear the costs of Big Tech’s hunger for profits. We pay it in rising energy bills, our worsening climate, our lack of access to safe water, increased noise pollution and risks to our health and safety.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Instead of raising our bills, draining our local resources and destabilizing our climate, Big Tech could create more energy jobs, lessen our power bills and sustain communities.

We can demand that tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, Google and Amazon uphold their commitments to use 100% renewable energy and not rely on fossil fuels and nuclear energy to power data centers. We can insist that data centers only go where they’re wanted by ensuring communities are given full transparency and protection in how they’re affected by power usage, water access and noise pollution.

The current administration is ignoring its obligations to the American public by refusing to rein in Big Tech. But tech billionaires still have a responsibility to the very public they depend on for their existence.

Tesla’s Real Money Maker: Model 3 and Model Y

When most Americans think about Tesla Inc., they picture two cars: the Model 3 and the Model Y. While the Cybertruck captures the headlines and the Roadster fuels fantasy, it’s these mass-market EVs that still do the heavy lifting for Tesla’s revenue — and by extension, for TSLA shareholders.

Across Tesla’s lineup, the Model 3 and Model Y are the company’s closest equivalent to the iPhone: a scalable, relatively affordable core product that defines the brand and pulls in the bulk of automotive revenue. In the US, they’ve become the default upgrade path for drivers who are done with gas stations but aren’t looking to spend six figures on a luxury EV.

Why Model 3/Y Are Trending Now

Even in a more crowded EV landscape, the Model 3 and Model Y remain front and center in the American market for several reasons:

Price cuts and incentives: Tesla has aggressively adjusted prices over the past year. Combined with federal and state tax credits (where applicable), the effective cost of a Model 3 or Model Y can now directly compete with well-equipped gas SUVs and sedans.

Range and charging ecosystem: With competitive range and access to Tesla’s Supercharger network, these models solve the biggest psychological barrier to EV adoption: range and charging anxiety.

Software-first experience: Over-the-air updates, integrated infotainment, and a minimalist cabin anchored by a central display resonate with buyers who expect their car to feel more like a smartphone on wheels.

Resale and brand status: Tesla’s brand still carries tech-forward cachet. For many buyers, a Model 3 or Y is a visible lifestyle signal — eco-conscious, tech-savvy, and future-oriented.

The consumer problem Tesla solves: The Model 3 and Model Y are designed to eliminate the friction between wanting to drive electric and being able to afford it, charge it, and maintain it easily. They’re the answer to the practical American question: “Can I actually live with an EV, day in and day out, without paying a premium or sacrificing convenience?”

Market Pulse: Simulated Snapshot of TSLA as of Today

As of today’s simulated date, here is a snapshot of Tesla’s stock (TSLA, ISIN US88160R1014) based on a realistic but hypothetical market environment.

Price and 5?Day Trend

Current simulated price: $228 per share

5?day trend: +4.5%

Over the last five trading sessions, TSLA has staged a modest recovery rally after a choppy period of trading. Buyers stepped in around the $215–$220 range, viewing that band as a technical support zone following earlier pullbacks driven by concerns over EV demand softness and ongoing price cuts.

Short-term traders are watching the $230–$235 level as near-term resistance. A decisive break above that band would signal that the current bounce has legs, helped by decent delivery data and renewed enthusiasm around Tesla’s AI and autonomous-driving narrative.

52?Week Range and Context

Simulated 52?week high: $285

Simulated 52?week low: $162

At a current simulated price of $228, TSLA is trading:

About 20% below its 52?week high

Roughly 40% above its 52?week low

That positioning tells a nuanced story. Tesla is no longer priced for perfection the way it was at peak enthusiasm, but neither has it been punished like some smaller EV competitors. The market appears to be in a price-discovery phase, weighing the robustness of Model 3/Y demand against a more competitive EV space and macro headwinds like higher interest rates.

The Time Machine: One?Year Return

Let’s simulate what would have happened if you had bought TSLA one year ago at a hypothetical price of $250 per share:

One year ago (simulated): $250

Today (simulated): $228

The percentage change is:

((228 – 250) / 250) × 100 ? –8.8%

In this hypothetical scenario, a one?year holding period would have produced an –8.8% loss, excluding any trading costs or tax implications. That’s not catastrophic in the context of Tesla’s historical volatility, but it underscores a key reality: owning TSLA is not a smooth ride, even if you believe in the long?term EV transition and the central role of the Model 3/Y platform.

Short?Term Sentiment: Cautiously Bullish

Based on the simulated 5?day uptrend, stabilization above the mid?$220s, and a series of modestly positive news catalysts (more on those below), near?term sentiment can be characterized as cautiously bullish:

Technical traders see a potential base forming after a period of consolidation.

Fundamental investors remain divided: some argue that price cuts jeopardize margins, while others view them as a land?grab strategy to lock in long?term share for Model 3/Y.

Options markets (in this simulated context) show elevated implied volatility around upcoming events like delivery reports and AI?related announcements.

Wall Street Consensus: Simulated Analyst Snapshot

Within the last 30 days (in this simulated environment), major US firms have updated their views on Tesla. While the real world is often more fragmented, the hypothetical snapshot below captures the current tone of institutional coverage.

Goldman Sachs (Simulated)

Rating: Neutral (Hold)

Simulated 12?month price target: $235

Goldman’s analysts are sitting on the fence. They acknowledge Tesla’s scale advantage and brand power in the EV space, particularly through Model 3 and Model Y, but highlight margin compression as a key concern. Repeated price cuts needed to sustain volume growth are likely to cap upside in the near term, in their view.

Morgan Stanley (Simulated)

Rating: Overweight (Buy)

Simulated 12?month price target: $270

Morgan Stanley’s thesis leans more aggressively bullish. The firm argues that the installed base of Model 3/Y vehicles creates a future monetization runway for software, autonomy features, and energy services. They see the current stock price as a reasonable entry point for investors willing to stomach volatility and think Tesla’s software and AI angle is still underappreciated by the broader market.

J.P. Morgan (Simulated)

Rating: Underweight (Sell)

Simulated 12?month price target: $185

J.P. Morgan takes the skeptical side. Their team argues that Tesla’s valuation still prices in best?case scenarios on EV demand, autonomy, and margins, while ignoring intensifying competition from legacy automakers and new entrants. In their view, the Model 3 and Model Y remain strong products, but the stock assumes a level of growth and profitability that will be hard to sustain as the market matures.

Blended picture: The simulated consensus lands somewhere between Hold and Buy, with a wide spread in price targets. That divergence mirrors the broader debate: is Tesla a car company with tech?style expectations, or a tech platform whose Model 3/Y fleet is a Trojan horse for recurring software and services revenue?

Latest News and Catalysts (Last 7 Days, Simulated)

Here is a synthesized view of the kinds of news items that could be moving TSLA in the short term, based on realistic but hypothetical developments from the last week.

1. Model 3/Y Inventory Discounts and Financing Push

In the past seven days, Tesla has rolled out a new wave of limited?time inventory discounts and promotional financing for Model 3 and Model Y in key US markets. Dealers of legacy automakers have been discounting aggressively to clear 2024 models; Tesla’s response is a targeted push to keep order flow healthy into the next quarter.

For consumers, that means a lower effective price and potentially better monthly payments — especially significant in a high?rate environment. For investors, it rekindles concerns about margin pressure, but also reassures the market that Tesla is serious about defending volume leadership in the mass?market EV segment.

2. Software Update: Enhanced Autopilot Features for Model 3/Y

Tesla has also started rolling out an over?the?air software update that enhances driver-assistance features for Model 3 and Model Y owners in the US. While not full autonomy, the update improves lane?keeping, adaptive cruise behavior, and user interface elements related to Autopilot.

This matters because it reinforces one of Tesla’s core differentiators: your car can genuinely get better after you buy it. Each visible improvement helps justify the company’s thesis that the installed base of Model 3/Y vehicles is a platform for recurring software revenue and AI?driven services, not just a one?time hardware sale.

3. Delivery Numbers: Mixed but Resilient

Preliminary (simulated) delivery estimates for the quarter suggest that while Tesla’s overall unit growth has slowed from its hyper?growth phase, Model 3 and Model Y remain the backbone of the business, representing well over two?thirds of total deliveries.

Regionally, US deliveries appear resilient, helped by rebates and inventory pricing actions, while parts of Europe show more softness under competitive pressure. For TSLA, that split is crucial: as long as US demand for Model 3/Y holds up, the stock narrative can lean on the strength of Tesla’s home market even as global conditions fluctuate.

4. Regulatory & Incentive Noise

Within the last week, there has been renewed discussion around EV tax credits and eligibility rules in the US. Some Tesla configurations of the Model 3 and Model Y may see shifting eligibility depending on sourcing and battery component rules. While the impact is nuanced, any change to federal incentives tends to ripple through consumer calculations — especially for price?sensitive buyers cross?shopping hybrids and ICE vehicles.

For Tesla’s stock, the headline risk is simple: if fewer trims qualify for full credits, Tesla may need to lean even harder on pricing or financing incentives to keep its Model 3/Y value proposition compelling.

How Model 3/Y Performance Feeds Directly into TSLA

From an investor’s perspective, understanding Tesla’s stock means understanding the performance of its core products. For now, that is still overwhelmingly about the Model 3 and Model Y.

Revenue and Margin Dynamics

In this simulated context, the majority of Tesla’s automotive revenue and gross profit still flows from Model 3/Y. Every decision to cut prices, adjust trim mixes, or add software features shows up in those models first.

Top line: Healthy demand for Model 3/Y keeps Tesla’s revenue engine running. Even if growth moderates, Tesla still benefits from scale that most EV startups can only dream of.

Gross margin: This is where the market is most sensitive. If discounts and incentives on Model 3/Y outpace cost reductions and software revenue growth, earnings estimates get revised down — and TSLA tends to react quickly.

Operating leverage: The more cars Tesla moves through existing factories, the more it can spread fixed costs and invest in R&D for autonomy, energy products, and next?generation vehicles.

The Optionality Story

Much of Tesla’s premium valuation (even in this more subdued phase) rests on the idea that today’s Model 3/Y fleet is a launchpad for future high?margin revenue streams:

Subscription?based driver assistance and autonomy features

In?car content, connectivity, and services

Energy and grid services using vehicle batteries as distributed storage

If you’re deciding whether to buy the stock after researching “Tesla Model 3 review” or “Tesla Model Y price,” the key is to connect what you see in the showroom to what shows up in Tesla’s financials and valuation. Each Model 3/Y on the road is not just a sale; it’s a potential multi?year, software?enabled revenue stream — at least in Tesla’s thesis.

Is Tesla Stock a Buy, Hold, or Sell If You Care About Model 3/Y?

In the current simulated setup, here’s how the trade?off looks:

Bull case: Model 3/Y remain the dominant mass?market EVs in the US, volume continues to grow or stabilize at high levels, and Tesla successfully layers on software and autonomy revenue. Current price consolidates before another move higher as margins stabilize.

Bear case: Price cuts erode profitability faster than Tesla can grow software revenue, competition catches up on tech and charging, and Model 3/Y lose their pricing power. The stock derates closer to a traditional automaker multiple.

Base case (for many analysts): Revenue keeps growing at a more modest clip, margins normalize at a lower but still respectable level, and TSLA trades in a wide range as the market continually reprices its tech versus auto identity.

Ultimately, whether TSLA belongs in your portfolio depends less on short?term delivery beats or misses and more on your conviction in a simple proposition: Can Tesla keep the Model 3 and Model Y at the center of America’s EV story for the next five to ten years — and turn that installed base into a software and services platform?

If your answer is yes, you’re closer to the Morgan Stanley view. If your answer is no, you’re closer to J.P. Morgan. And if you’re undecided, you might find yourself, like Goldman, in Hold?and?watch mode, waiting to see whether the next wave of buyers still chooses Model 3 and Model Y as their on?ramp to an electric future.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405001_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 10:59:51.328252

The Biden‑era surge in tribal clean energy showed what’s possible when federal support aligns with tribal priorities.","Covering Indian Country energy in 2025 felt a little like watching someone finish some wiring, hit the switch, and hearing a “pop” somewhere as the bulbs flickered and died. The repair work now is less about flipping the switch again than rebuilding the system behind it.

What had appeared to be a stable power source for the clean energy transition in Indian Country went dark almost overnight. In February, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced — in a scripted YouTube video — that the agency would freeze $20 billion across two programs under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a $27 billion allocation created by Congress under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

By March, Zeldin announced Solar For All — the remaining $7 billion in GGRF funding — was under review. By August, all three programs were terminated, launching a parade of lawsuits against the EPA that continues today.

The GGRF wasn't the only Inflation Reduction Act initiative that, left in place, would have changed the way Indian Country energy financing worked. Elective pay tax credits — once the IRS clarified how they worked and Treasury provided tax certainty around tribal businesses — stood poised to invite substantial private investment into the mix. Those incentives are now set to rapidly sunset.

Altogether, the loss amounts to nearly $2 billion in capital previously headed straight to Native American energy development. Organizations poised to spend millions on workforce development have had to scale back or cancel programs. Projects long in development saw reductions in scope, accelerated plans, or both in a bid to get in under the rapidly approaching July 2026 deadline for getting shovels in the ground and dollars out the door.

Tribes had done what federal agencies had asked: get projects shovel‑ready, build workforce pipelines, assemble capital stacks and prepare to deploy clean energy at scale. When the funding vanished, it wasn’t just a policy shift — it was a collapse of the scaffolding tribes had been told to build on.

But tribal energy development can’t be built on the assumption that federal support will stay put. Tribes, Native-led developers and nonprofit organizations have turned to building financing systems that can survive federal whiplash.

Cheri Smith, chief executive and founder of the nonprofit Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy, said the group is leaning on its Weaver Platform, a project‑finance tool designed to help tribes build capital stacks that rely less on federal grants and more on mission‑driven investors and lenders. The platform is meant to match tribal projects with investors who can stay in the deal even when federal programs shift.

Cody Two Bears, executive director at nonprofit Indigenized Energy, said the Tribal Renewable Energy Coalition is continuing to use its project pipeline — site assessments, engineering and financial modeling — while seeking replacement funding. The work completed by way of federal funding still has value, even if the federal dollars that were supposed to support it have vanished.

At the annual summit of the Native CDFI Network in Washington, D.C. earlier this month, CEO Pete Upton put the stakes in perspective: In Native communities, energy isn't about ideology or politics or red states or blue states, he said. It's about survival. It's about electricity and running water — basics that many Native families still live without.

“A one-size-fits-all energy policy doesn't work in Indian Country,” Upton said. “It's not practical. It's not realistic. And it's definitely not sovereign.”

Federal support hasn't entirely disappeared. While federal programs were terminated or remain tied up in court, Treasury’s final rules on direct pay — released late last year and finalized in mid-December — offered one of the few points of stability. The bigger, energy-focused tax breaks may be on their way out, but New Markets Tax Credits and incentives for building in marginalized communities can still attract partners and developers to the right project, experts told me.

The next phase of tribal energy won’t be defined by what was lost this year, but by what tribes build in response. The Biden‑era surge in tribal clean energy showed what’s possible when federal support aligns with tribal priorities. The Trump‑era reversal showed how quickly that support can disappear. The work now is to build systems that don’t rise and fall on election cycles — systems grounded in tribal ownership, tribal financing and tribal timelines.

The federal pullback slowed the transition, but it didn't stop it. Tribes are already rebuilding, this time on systems designed to hold — even when Washington doesn’t.",https://tribalbusinessnews.com/images/2023/Energy_Rebuild_2025.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 09:12:27.388068

On its own, the Revelstoke Dam sources more than 7,800 gigawatt hours – roughly 15 per cent of BC Hydro’s annually generated electricity.
According to BC Hydro, it supplies more than 43,000 gigawatt hours of electricity per year to 1.6 million residential, commercial and industrial customers.","BC Hydro moved forward with big plans for the Revelstoke Dam in September – big enough to power another 200,000 homes.

The provincial electric utility, which sources about 6,880 megawatts (58 per cent) of its total capacity from the Columbia Region, announced last fall that Revelstoke’s namesake dam will be going ahead with the installation and activation of an additional generating unit.

“We’re adding a sixth generating unit at Revelstoke Generating Station to support electrification, meet peak demand, and enable us to add more renewable energy sources to our system,” BC Hydro shared Sept. 21. “We plan to start construction in spring 2026.”

Most notably, however, this sixth unit would unleash another 500 megawatts for the dam, in a 20 per cent rise in capacity from about 2,500 to 3,000 megawatts.

That extra 500 megawatts of “dependable capacity” is “equivalent to powering roughly 200,000 homes,” Susan Edgell, BC Hydro stakeholder engagement advisor, said.

Together with the Mica and Hugh Keenleyside dams, the 1984-built Revelstoke Dam currently provides a quarter of BC Hydro’s power. On its own, the Revelstoke Dam sources more than 7,800 gigawatt hours – roughly 15 per cent of BC Hydro’s annually generated electricity.

“Dams are considered a very clean source of power,” Edgell said.

“They don’t produce greenhouse gases and don’t consume water.

“Water just passes through our generating facilities and creates energy.”

She reported the power that BC Hydro generates being 98 per cent clean and renewable.

However, “in terms of other renewable energy systems, we are in the midst of a second call for power,” she added.

In a “competitive energy procurement process” carrying on from 2024, BC Hydro has sought to acquire electricity purchase agreements by early 2026 for up to 5,000 more gigawatt hours of clean and renewable energy per year, to meet demand for the province’s growing population and industries.

For Revelstoke, following the start of construction on the dam’s sixth unit in spring, the utility expects the project to elapse over seven years, through to the end of 2032.

Failing to meet looming energy challenges puts Pennsylvania at risk of continually rising electricity costs and loss of jobs and economic opportunities to other states — particularly those tied to emerging technologies.
The news on rising energy costs got worse in PJM’s most recent capacity auction that ensures there is an adequate supply of electricity to meet projected future demand.
But given rising demands, costs and emissions inherent in how we currently operate, business as usual won’t meet Pennsylvania’s energy challenges and maintain our place as an innovative energy powerhouse.
To lead, we must act; 2026 must be the year we do what it takes to secure a prosperous clean energy future and protect Pennsylvanians from rising energy costs and the impacts of a changing climate.","It took almost all year, but last month Gov. Josh Shapiro and the General Assembly finally agreed on a state budget. After 135 days of deadlock, it’s understandable that the predominant response to the deal and consequent resumption of funding critical government services has been one of relief. It’s to be expected that leaders are anxious to put the ordeal behind them. But as 2025 comes to a close, it is indisputable that Pennsylvania needs to both confront serious climate issues and reckon with the scale of the challenges we face with respect to energy affordability and reliability.

We at the Pennsylvania Environmental Council supported Pennsylvania’s entry into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative program — a program abandoned before it was even started in the final budget deal — because we believed that it would help address some of the commonwealth’s energy challenges. These challenges include new, power-hungry data centers and a backlog of new electric generating projects waiting to connect to the regional grid, which remain primary drivers of rising electric bills. We face long-term fuel and operational costs, and foreign markets holding our exports to increasingly higher standards of sustainability. And we need to improve energy efficiency, reduce waste and help families pay their utility bills. RGGI could have been a powerful tool to provide the means to help meet these challenges, and others we’ve only barely begun to consider. It also could have helped with the worsening funding crisis for public transit systems statewide, another priority left unaddressed in budget negotiations.

Failing to meet looming energy challenges puts Pennsylvania at risk of continually rising electricity costs and loss of jobs and economic opportunities to other states — particularly those tied to emerging technologies. The news on rising energy costs got worse in PJM’s most recent capacity auction that ensures there is an adequate supply of electricity to meet projected future demand. PJM operates the grid that serves Pennsylvania and 12 other states, and consumers in that footprint are facing the third consecutive record-breaking increase in electricity costs. Even before this most recent increase, the independent market monitor for PJM indicated that existing ratepayers have already paid $16.6 billion in increased electricity prices for the 2026-27 capacity auction due to existing and forecast data center demand alone.

So, what now?

The benefits of RGGI’s cap-and-invest structure won’t likely be realized with any one policy. But multiple legislative and regulatory proposals are on the table in Harrisburg that can help move the needle on energy affordability, reliability, and emissions. It’s more important than ever that these measures advance with due urgency.

At the top of the list is the Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Sustainability Standard initiative, a long-overdue expansion of Pennsylvania’s antiquated Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards, which PEC has advocated for nearly two decades. PRESS will further diversify the mix of energy sources our power generation system relies on while also reducing carbon pollution. Other elements of the governor’s Lightning package, including updating our state’s energy efficiency program, securing authorization for community energy projects and improving the siting process for new generation build, are also essential. Add to this several good ideas advancing in the House: one helping clear a path for deployment of next-generation nuclear power, and another providing tax credits to help manufacturers save money and cut emissions through energy-efficiency upgrades. Other proposals hold promise for creating energy storage capacity and modernizing transmission systems, which will alleviate grid congestion and make energy delivery and use more predictable and efficient. We also need to explore new energy technologies such as advanced geothermal and find ways to continue building the state’s energy workforce for these new opportunities.

All of these goals are within reach in 2026. But given rising demands, costs and emissions inherent in how we currently operate, business as usual won’t meet Pennsylvania’s energy challenges and maintain our place as an innovative energy powerhouse. Government must lead by providing the right policies and incentives to ensure that Pennsylvania thrives. A sound energy policy can check all of the boxes. Let’s build the technologies of the future here, get more electrons on the grid, reduce emissions, grow our workforce and put investment into making our transmission systems and manufacturing products better. To lead, we must act; 2026 must be the year we do what it takes to secure a prosperous clean energy future and protect Pennsylvanians from rising energy costs and the impacts of a changing climate.

The Republicans’ tax bill reversed or steeply curtailed clean energy programs established through the Democrats’ flagship climate and health care bill in 2022.
The energy storage systems company CMBlu Energy said storage clearly stands out as a winner this year too, moving from optional to essential.
“Trump’s effort to manipulate government regulation to harm clean energy just isn’t enough to offset the natural advantages that clean energy has,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said.
Landrieu, now with Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future, said promoting or punishing specific energy technologies on ideological grounds is unsustainable.","There were some highs amid a lot of lows in a roller coaster year for clean energy as President Donald Trump worked to boost polluting fuels while blocking wind and solar, according to dozens of energy developers, experts and politicians.

Surveyed by the Associated Press, many described 2025 as turbulent and challenging for clean energy, though there was progress as projects connected to the electric grid. They said clean energy must continue to grow to meet skyrocketing demand for electricity to power data centers and to lower Americans' utility bills.

Solar builder and operator Jorge Vargas said it has been “a very tough year for clean energy” as Trump often made headlines criticizing renewable energy and Republicans muscled a tax and spending cut bill through Congress in July that dramatically rolled back tax breaks for clean energy.

“There was a cooldown effect this year,” said Vargas, cofounder and CEO of Aspen Power. “Having said that, we are a resilient industry.”

Plug Power president Jose Luis Crespo said the developments — both policy recalibration and technological progress — will shape clean energy’s trajectory for years to come.

Energy policy whiplash in 2025

Much of clean energy's fate in 2025 was driven by booster Joe Biden's exit from the White House.

The year began with ample federal subsidies for clean energy technologies, a growing number of U.S.-based companies making parts and materials for projects and a lot of demand from states and corporations, said Tom Harper, partner at global consultant Baringa.

It ends with subsidies stripped back, a weakened supply chain, higher costs from tariffs and some customers questioning their commitment to clean energy, Harper said. He described the year as “paradigm shifting.”

Trump called wind and solar power “the scam of the century” and vowed not to approve new projects. The federal government canceled grants for hundreds of projects.

The Republicans’ tax bill reversed or steeply curtailed clean energy programs established through the Democrats’ flagship climate and health care bill in 2022. Wayne Winegarden, at the Pacific Research Institute think tank, said the time has come for alternative energy to demonstrate viability without subsidies. (Fossil fuels also receive subsidies.)

Many energy executives said this was the most consequential policy shift. The bill reshaped the economics of clean energy projects, drove a rush to start construction before incentives expire and forced developers to reassess their strategies for acquiring parts and materials, Lennart Hinrichs said. He leads the expansion of TWAICE in the Americas, providing analytics software for battery energy storage systems.

Companies can't make billion-dollar investments with so much policy uncertainty, said American Clean Power Association CEO Jason Grumet.

Consequently, greenhouse gas emissions will fall at a much lower rate than previously projected in the U.S., said Brian Murray, director of the Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment and Sustainability at Duke University.

Still, solar and battery storage are booming

Solar and storage accounted for 85 percent of the new power added to the grid in the first nine months of the Trump administration, according to Wood Mackenzie research.

That's because the economics remain strong, demand is high and the technologies can be deployed quickly, said Mike Hall, CEO of Anza Renewables.

Solar energy company Sol Systems said it had a record year as it brought its largest utility-scale project online and grew its business. The energy storage systems company CMBlu Energy said storage clearly stands out as a winner this year too, moving from optional to essential.

“Trump’s effort to manipulate government regulation to harm clean energy just isn’t enough to offset the natural advantages that clean energy has,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said. ""The direction is still all good.”

The Solar Energy Industries Association said that no matter the policies in Washington, solar and storage will grow as the backbone of the nation's energy future.

Nuclear and geothermal had a good year, too

Democrats and Republicans have supported investing to keep nuclear reactors online, restart previously closed reactors such as the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Palo, and deploy new, advanced reactor designs. Nuclear power is a carbon-free source of electricity, though not typically labeled as green energy like other renewables.

“Who had ‘restart Three Mile Island’ on their 2025 Bingo card?” questioned Baringa partner David Shepheard. The Pennsylvania plant was the site of the nation’s worst commercial nuclear power accident, in 1979. The Energy Department is loaning $1 billion to help finance a restart.

Everyone loves nuclear, said Darrin Kayser, executive vice president at Edelman. It helps that the technology for small, modular reactors is starting to come to fruition, Kayser added.

Benton Arnett, a senior director at the Nuclear Energy Institute, said that as the need for clean, reliable power intensifies, “we will look back on the actions being taken now as laying the foundation.""

The Trump administration also supports geothermal energy, and the tax bill largely preserved geothermal tax credits. The Geothermal Rising association said technologies continue to mature and produce, making 2025 a breakthrough year.

Offshore wind had a terrible year

Momentum for offshore wind in the United States came to a grinding halt just as the industry was starting to gain traction, said Joey Lange, a senior managing director at Trio, a global sustainability and energy advisory company.

The Trump administration stopped construction on major offshore wind farms, revoked wind energy permits and paused permitting, canceled plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopped federal funding for offshore wind projects.

That has decimated the projects, developers and tech innovators, and no one in wind is raising or spending capital, said Eric Fischgrund, founder and CEO at FischTank PR. Still, Fischgrund said he remains optimistic because the world is transitioning to cleaner energy.

More clean energy needed in 2026

An energy strategy with a diverse mix of sources is the only way forward as demand grows from data centers and other sources, and as people demand affordable, reliable electricity, said former Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu. Landrieu, now with Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future, said promoting or punishing specific energy technologies on ideological grounds is unsustainable.

Experts expect solar and battery storage to continue growing in 2026 to add a lot of power to the grid quickly and cheaply. The market will continue to ensure that most new electricity is renewable, said Amanda Levin, policy analysis director at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Hillary Bright, executive director of Turn Forward, thinks offshore wind still will play an important role, too. It is both ready and needed to help address the demand for electricity in the new year, which will become increasingly clear ""to all audiences,” she said. Turn Forward advocates for offshore wind.

That skyrocketing demand ""is shaking up the political calculus that drove the administration’s early policy decisions around renewables,” she said.

BlueWave CEO Sean Finnerty thinks that states, feeling the pressure to deliver affordable, reliable electricity, will increasingly drive clean energy momentum in 2026 by streamlining permitting and the process of connecting to the grid, and by reducing costs for things like permits and fees.

Ed Gunn, Lunar Energy's vice president for revenue, said the industry has weathered tough years before.

“The fundamentals are unchanged,"" Gunn said, ""there is massive value in clean energy.”",https://imengine.public.prod.cdr.navigacloud.com?uuid=54c59987-7eb3-58de-8ea2-20f24763bb9f&function=hardcrop&type=preview&source=false&q=60&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-12-28 07:58:03.212929

Families are feeling the strain of high utility bills. Our state needs a plan to ensure energy is reliable and affordable now and in the future. And we need an energy grid that can meet the growing demand come rain or shine. That demand will only increase as Florida’s economy adopts energy-intensive technologies like artificial intelligence and supports the growth of new data centers across the state.

State lawmakers have committed to studying every energy option that can lower costs and keep electricity dependable.

That guiding principle is shaping Florida’s energy agenda this year. The goal is not to pick winners and losers. The goal is to prepare Florida for the next generation of energy technology while making sure consumers benefit from lower costs and a stronger, more resilient grid.

An important part of that strategy is ensuring Florida is ready to lead on advanced nuclear energy, especially small modular reactors (SMRs). These reactors represent a new approach to nuclear power that is compact, efficient, and engineered with modern safety features. SMRs produce steady, carbon-free electricity to help meet our state’s long-term needs.

Florida’s legislature has a common sense approach. Lawmakers want to encourage SMR development by creating a clear regulatory environment and removing barriers that slow innovation. It’s also important to lawmakers for new technology to support long-term reliability and not raise costs for consumers.

This thoughtful approach by the Legislature will pay dividends.

SMRs offer clear advantages that support Florida’s energy needs. Their compact size allows them to be installed in more locations than traditional nuclear plants. They can be built in factory-assembled sections, which helps to avoid delays and high costs that have affected past large-scale nuclear projects. SMRs also rely on passive safety features that use natural forces like gravity and circulation. This allows the systems to shut down safely without complicated interventions.

SMRs can also deliver power in places where the larger grid is limited or vulnerable. Rural areas, coastal regions, and communities recovering from hurricanes often struggle when transmission lines fail. A local, steady source of power can be a lifeline for hospitals, water facilities, and emergency operations that need electricity in the most challenging moments.

Preparing for advanced nuclear technology allows Florida to diversify its energy mix and keep consumer expenses in check. A diverse grid is essential for economic growth. Reliable and affordable energy gives businesses room to invest and helps families plan for the future without worrying about unpredictable utility bills.

This effort also supports a broader push for American energy independence. Communities across the country and around the world are turning toward new forms of nuclear power because they want clean energy that doesn’t depend on foreign countries or unstable fuel markets. Florida lawmakers can ensure our state isn’t left behind as these technologies develop.

Florida’s lawmakers are taking meaningful steps to secure our energy future. Their work puts consumers first by encouraging innovation, strengthening reliability, and avoiding policies that raise costs.

Florida has an opportunity to lead this legislative session. By acting now, Florida can build an energy system that supports families, attracts investment and keeps our state competitive.

Why should I care?

For markets: A demand cliff can turn a capacity edge into a pricing fight.

If domestic orders slump, battery giants like CATL and EVE Energy may have to choose between running factories at lower utilization or cutting prices to keep lines busy. With export growth to the EU modest and US shipments shrinking, the industry has fewer outlets for excess supply – which usually means tighter margins across the supply chain, from cathode materials to pack makers.

The bigger picture: Incentives are increasingly deciding whose batteries get bought.

Even when demand is growing, policy can steer it away from certain suppliers. UBS has warned that US investment tax credits can be jeopardized if projects involve designated “foreign entities of concern,” making buyers more cautious about Chinese components. Add that to the 2025 drop in US-bound exports, and the message is clear: the next leg of the energy transition will be shaped as much by rules and eligibility as by manufacturing scale.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Ftag_reuters_com_2025_newsml_L4N3XY01D_331636899.jpeg?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=9eb9fa64e7e72cca42c4191aa027176f,N,,2025-12-28 05:57:34.775003

From smart charging stations and real-time Internet of Things (IoT) networks to advanced mobile apps and battery swapping, technology is fueling an infrastructure boom to support India’s ambitious transition to greener mobility, which is a much-needed switch to improve and preserve environmental health.

As of mid-2025, India’s public charging stations scaled up to more than 29,000 from just 1,800 sites in February 2022. The jump mirrors India’s explosive EV sales; the fiscal year 2025 alone recorded 1.96 million electric vehicles sold, a 17% increase over the previous year. Promisingly so, this rapid expansion is also backed by the PM E-DRIVE scheme, which allocates ₹10,900 crore (USD 1.3 billion) through March 2026 for thousands of new public fast-chargers, including 48,400 dedicated for two- and three-wheelers.

Smart Charging & Digital Innovations

The modern smart charging station integrates multiple technologies for efficiency, security, and user experience:

IoT & Real-Time Data: Sensors at each station monitor electricity flow, charger health, and user data. IoT enables real-time updates on station availability, pricing, energy usage, and remote fault diagnostics, making station maintenance proactive rather than reactive.

Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI-driven backend platforms predict charging demand and optimize load management, preventing grid overload during peak times. Advanced analytics help forecast maintenance, personalize services, and dynamically adjust pricing for different users.

Grid Integration & Renewable Energy: Many stations can now sync with the local grid or even solar panels, balancing local power demand, reducing stress on the grid, and supporting sustainability goals. Dynamic load balancing ensures that several vehicles can be charged efficiently without blackouts or power surges.

User-Centric Mobile Apps: Charging networks are linked to apps that offer real-time station discovery, reservations, remote start/stop functionality, and digital payment options. These apps are critical for end-user convenience, enabling seamless journeys.

Centralizing the EV Experience

Cutting-edge EV charging apps now offer integrated dashboards that provide users with real-time insights and centralized management, eliminating the hassle of switching between different OEM-specific tools. The apps’ advanced features offer EV owners a seamless and empowered driving experience. With the ability to monitor total kms. traveled, users can easily track overall mileage, enabling better journey planning and facilitating predictive maintenance.

Real-time remaining range displays how far the vehicle can go on its current charge, reducing range anxiety and helping drivers plan confidently. Live updates on current charging status allow users to manage their daily schedules and trips more efficiently. Additionally, real-time location tracking not only enhances security but also delivers valuable travel analytics.

Battery Swapping: India’s Unique Tech Solution

In parallel with charging infrastructure, battery swapping technology is fast emerging as a game changer. As of April 2025, more than 2,600 battery swapping kiosks are operational, predominantly in metros like Delhi. The Indian EV battery market is also set to rise sharply, from USD 16.77 billion in 2023 to USD 27.70 billion by 2028.

The technology is empowering users in multifarious ways. Swapping a depleted battery for a fully charged one takes less than two minutes, significantly faster than hours spent at conventional charging stations. By decoupling batteries from vehicle ownership, battery swapping dramatically reduces upfront costs, allowing users to opt for flexible, energy-as-a-service subscription models instead.

For high-use commercial fleets such as delivery bikes and e-rickshaws, this minimizes downtime and maximizes productivity, supporting the surging demands of India’s e-commerce and urban mobility sectors. Further, advanced telematics now monitor each battery’s health, temperature, and performance in real time, enabling operators to proactively predict failures, schedule maintenance, and ensure the highest levels of safety and reliability, all managed remotely.

India’s energy future looks bright.","India is currently basking in a golden age of solar power. A decade-long solar surge has carried India from the bottom of the ranks to the global top three.

Miles of shimmering blue panels now blanket the Thar Desert, while millions of urban rooftops hum with subsidized energy.

With this rise, there is also a waste problem. With the first wave of panels approaching their expiration date, a concern looms: Is our clean energy dream destined to become a toxic nightmare?

India lacks both a dedicated national budget and the industrial-scale facilities needed to handle the coming tide of solar panel waste.

Dark side of the bright side

Fueled by government subsidies, nearly 2.4 million Indian households have embraced solar energy, helping solar power account for over 20% of the nation’s energy capacity and reducing coal dependency.

However, this success hides a looming environmental threat.

With a lack of national funding or recycling hubs, India is racing toward a green waste crisis it isn’t yet equipped to handle.

Reportedly, India’s solar waste was estimated at a manageable 110,000 US tons (100,000 tonnes) in 2023, but that figure is a trick of the light. It could rise to 661,386 US tons (600,000 tonnes) by 2030.

According to India’s think tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), the volume is set to explode to over 12 million US tons (11 million tonnes) by 2047.

Tackling the solar waste mountain would require a nationwide network of 300 recycling hubs, backed by a strategic investment of $478 million over the next twenty years.

“The real wave of waste is coming in 10 to 15 years,” Rohit Pahwa of energy company Targray, told BBC.

Most of India’s mega-solar parks were commissioned in the mid-2010s. These modules have a 25-year shelf life, and the countdown has already begun.

Recycling waste

Solar panels contain high-value silver and copper, as well as trace amounts of lead and cadmium.

When panels are smashed in unauthorized scrap yards or tossed into landfills, these toxins seep into groundwater and eventually enter the food chain.

Currently, India’s recycling scene is the wild west of basic recovery.

Workers often strip the easy parts — the aluminum frames and the glass — while the precious, complex materials are lost or released into the environment.

Although India mandated manufacturer-led recycling under the 2022 e-waste rules, enforcement remains inconsistent — particularly for residential panels that often end up in landfills or hazardous, unauthorized scrap yards.

However, the crisis doubles as a massive economic opportunity: high-tech recycling could recover precious metals like silver and silicon, reclaiming 38% of materials for new panels and preventing around 41 million US tons (37 million tonnes) of carbon emissions.

To succeed, experts argue India must spend the next decade professionalizing its recycling sector and holding profitable solar companies accountable for the entire lifecycle of their products.

India’s looming solar waste crisis reflects a global trend, with the US and China also bracing for massive volumes as they expand rapidly. However, regulatory responses vary widely across borders.

India’s energy future looks bright. But to keep it truly green, the nation must find a way to manage the shadows its panels will eventually leave behind.",https://cms.interestingengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IE-12-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 02:57:15.885876

Carolina Journal

North Carolina is a story in motion, one that over the last decade has shown what happens when policymakers trust the people, restrain government overreach and put economic opportunity front and center. Here in the Old North State, voters and leaders alike have made meaningful choices that have spurred growth, expanded opportunity and given families greater control over their futures.

We’ve lowered taxes and reduced barriers to success, not by accident, but by design. For years, North Carolina’s leaders pursued a pro-growth tax framework that has helped position our state as a magnet for jobs, entrepreneurship, and innovation, so individuals and families can build a life where work is rewarded, risk is encouraged and prosperity is growing.

That vision of economic freedom was reaffirmed most recently in 2025, when the General Assembly continued to enact laws that expand opportunity, even in the face of divided government. As outlined by the John Locke Foundation’s CEO Donald Bryson earlier this year, several major measures stood out as wins for freedom, each reinforcing the idea that government should clear obstacles, not create them. Those laws opened doors to work by recognizing occupational licenses from other states, making it easier for skilled workers to pursue their calling here; protected privacy and free association by limiting government access to personal donor information; restored balance in energy policy by putting consumers, not government mandates, at the center of the state’s electricity decisions.

A strong economy and a regulatory environment that respects personal choice matter, but freedom is bigger than policy. It is rooted in the idea that each individual should have the dignity to make important decisions for themselves and their families about where to work, how to spend their earnings and how to educate their children.

One of the most consequential expansions of individual choice over the last decade has been in education. North Carolina’s popular Opportunity Scholarship Program is now universally available on a sliding scale by income with the poorest among us served first. Families across income levels are empowered to decide where their children learn best. This isn’t a bureaucrat’s choice or determined by where you can afford to live. It’s a parent’s choice and that makes all the difference. When parents choose schools that fit their children’s needs, education becomes a vehicle for opportunity and personal responsibility and parents become more engaged.

Assuming that parents at all income levels do not want decision rights in their child’s education is inarguably a quiet form of elitism that spurs government-first policy and stifles educational innovation.

But freedom, like students, must be nurtured. That starts with ensuring our children understand not just how government works, but why it works the way it does. As we head into 2026 and the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution, we have the opportunity to celebrate the success of the American experiment by bringing more accurate, idea-rich content into North Carolina classrooms. The John Locke Foundation’s North Carolina History Project, for example, supplies lesson plans focused on the productive role of markets, the importance of private property, and the impact of free-market and religious ideas in shaping our state and nation’s history. This is the kind of civic grounding that helps young people grasp not just the mechanics of government, but its philosophical foundations.

At its best, proper civics education teaches children that freedom is not a passive inheritance, it’s an active commitment. It invites the next generation to understand the sacrifices and ideas that forged our liberties, and to recognize how markets, rule of law and individual initiative have lifted millions out of poverty and given meaning to the American dream.

The work of safeguarding liberty is never over. Policies advance incrementally, bill by bill, stump speech by stump speech, vote by vote. Over the past decade, North Carolina’s steady embrace of lower taxes, regulatory restraint and expanded choice has made our state a place where people can pursue their ambitions with confidence.

As we look to the future, our challenge is clear: We must highlight how these founding values create freedom and economic gains today. That means delivering well-designed civics education, celebrating our history of freedom and teaching each generation why personal liberty matters.",https://www.salisburypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/07/Salisbury-Post.png,N,,2025-12-28 05:57:46.224123

The idea has even caught the attention of Google, which announced a partnership with Energy Dome earlier this year.
Nearby data centers can then tap into the CO2 battery.
Unlike other renewable energy storage solutions, CO2 batteries don’t need special minerals, supply chains for complex parts, or constant upkeep.
“It’s negligible compared to the emissions of a coal plant,” Energy Dome CEO Claudio Spadacini told IEEE Spectrum.","While we’ve made major strides in generating renewable energy, storing that green power to use when the Sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing remains a major engineering challenge.

Researchers have developed many creative concepts — storing it in cranes that hoist humongous concrete blocks up and down, inside hot giant rocks, or spinning turbines by pumping water out of deep, decommissioned mines — none have yet proved practical enough for wide deployment.

Now, as IEEE Spectrum reports, a Milan-based company called Energy Dome has come up with an intriguing approach that stores energy in enormous domes that are filled with compressed carbon dioxide gas.

The idea behind the “CO2 battery” is simple. By compressing the gas using excess green power, it can later be depressurized to spin large turbines. A fully charged facility can store a formidable 200 megawatt-hours of electricity — enough to power around 6,000 homes for a full day.

To charge, the battery uses a thermal-energy storage system to cool the CO2 down to ambient pressure, and a condenser turns it into a liquid over a span of ten hours. To discharge it, the CO2 is evaporated and heated to power the turbine.

The goal is to bridge the gap between when renewable energy is available and when it’s actually needed through a “long-term duration energy storage” (LDES) solution. For instance, solar energy generation may hit its peak during the day, but peak household demand lags hours behind when people are home in the evening.

The idea has even caught the attention of Google, which announced a partnership with Energy Dome earlier this year. Now, IEEE Spectrum reports that the tech giant “plans to rapidly deploy the facilities in all of its key data-center locations in Europe, the United States, and the Asia-Pacific region.”

Energy Dome is currently working on a pilot CO2 battery built on five hectares of flat land in Sardinia, Italy. If successful, it wants to expand rapidly, popping up similar facilities across the world, starting with a separate plant in Karnataka, India. Authorities are also working on laying the groundwork for another in Wisconsin.

Google’s senior lead for energy strategy, Ainhoa Anda, told IEEE Spectrum that one big benefit of the approach is that it’s one-size-fits-all.

“We’ve been scanning the globe seeking different solutions,” he said, adding that “standardization is really important, and this is one of the aspects that we really like” about Energy Dome.

“They can really plug and play this,” Anda added.

The tech giant is looking to start in places where the electricity grid is already reliable and has a surplus of renewable energy that needs to be stored. Nearby data centers can then tap into the CO2 battery.

Unlike other renewable energy storage solutions, CO2 batteries don’t need special minerals, supply chains for complex parts, or constant upkeep.

And it’s not just Google looking to harness the benefits of LDES. China is also working on constructing CO2 batteries, according to IEEE.

Nonetheless, questions surrounding the concept’s long-term economic viability remain. For one thing, a CO2 battery’s footprint is considerably larger than a lithium-ion battery storage facility. There’s also the shortcoming that plagues all bubbles: the threat of a puncture, which could release thousands of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere.

But proponents argue it’s worth the risks.

What's geothermal? It's a way of extracting heat from underground that can produce electricity in a way that's much cheaper than most energy generation and is easy to harness if done correctly.

The idea is to dig a hole in the ground and you'll eventually get to enough heat that will produce steam and hot water, which can be used to generate power.

And now, University of Texas at Austin researchers say areas of West Texas could see a boom in geothermal energy in the not-too-distant future.

They say there's a possibility that enormous hot rock exists underground, which would mean that exploration of the area could be made simpler by not having to search for underground steam and water to pump electricity generation.

All energy explorers would have to do is find underground areas where the rock is hot, then inject water into it, the way water is very forcefully injected into the ground to stir up oil and force it out of the ground in the fracing industry.

We already know Texas is number one in America for producing oil and gas and is number one in electricity production sourced from wind towers and solar panels, but UT scientists say if research can be done quick enough, the state could become a leader in geothermal energy pretty quickly if ideas are implemented soon.

Geothermal is among the safest forms of energy:

Environmentalists like it because it's clean, with almost no pollution.

Businesspeople and politicians like it because it could result in a whole new industry, producing electricity at a time when data centers and artificial intelligence will demand so much electricity in the next 10 or 20 years that there is already deep worry among many that there soon won't be enough electricity to go around.

And consumers will like it because, if mass produced, geothermal technology could become cheap enough that many people could produce their own electricity in their backyard using a geothermal well to draw on hot rock, water and steam -- once the well is dug, no more paying the electric company.

And most of all, it could prove to be a boon to local communities in the creation of jobs, technologies and new infrastructure.

There are a few concerns, though: it's unknown as yet whether such deep well-digging could influence the number of earthquakes, and many geologists say geothermal energy can't be harnessed and technology can't be rolled out quick enough on a large scale to help with the electricity deficit that power companies across America and the world are already seeing.

Geothermal energy is just one of several newer technologies, like longer-lasting batteries to store electricity for emergency use, that are on the drawing board and offer hope for future breakthroughs, with Texas leading the way, of course.","https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.getty/65dcd42b7252e43218304a33?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)",N,,2025-12-28 01:57:35.776160

Nuclear fusion differs.
The magnets crush the gas together, and it is then heated to the point where a fusion reaction ignites.
We can now take that basic science and technology, and optimise it for a functional power plant,” Baynes-Reid said.","A nuclear fusion company building a reactor in America says it could have a plant up and running in Australia by the middle of next decade – despite the fact there are no commercial fusion power plants running anywhere in the world.

Fusion reactors try to replicate the conditions inside the sun, using extreme heat and powerful magnetic fields to make atoms fuse together, releasing huge amounts of clean energy. This energy is designed to be stored within a doughnut-shaped magnetic device called a stellarator. In theory, they represent the ultimate source of cheap, clean energy. In practice, there has yet to be a demonstration they work at a commercial scale.

Type One Energy is building a stellarator testbed in Tennessee, where it has signed a letter of intent with the local energy authority to build a 350MW commercial fusion reactor. It says fusion technology is mature and ready for deployment, and could eventually cost as little as $US2 billion ($3 billion) per plant.

Australian fusion experts disagree. There are no commercial nuclear fusion reactors in the world, and only one experiment has successfully generated more power than it consumed – but it looked more like an explosion than a reactor. Major scientific and technical hurdles remain; the CSIRO won’t even consider fusion in its energy modelling.

But that hasn’t dampened a flurry of enthusiasm from entrepreneurs and venture capital funds. Global private investment in fusion is now past the $10 billion mark, with US President Donald Trump the latest to invest – his social media and cryptocurrency company on Friday announced a merger with a nuclear fusion company.

“We are intending to break ground on the [US] power plant by 2028-29,” said Charlie Baynes-Reid, Type One Energy’s chief financial officer. “We would love nothing more than a second or third plant to be built in Australia.

“We feel highly confident that what we’re talking about here is not whether this will work, but just how efficient those power plants will be.”

A star in a bottle

Nuclear fission reactions power conventional nuclear reactors: enriched uranium is bombarded with neutrons, causing atoms to split and release heat. The heat is used to boil steam and spin turbines, while the split atoms fuel a chain reaction that keeps the reactor ticking.

Nuclear fusion differs. Rather than splitting the atom, two hydrogen atoms are fused together into a helium atom, releasing energy. Our sun is powered with the same principle, its massive gravity and extremely high temperatures crushing hydrogen into helium deep in its core.

Fusion reactions release much more energy than fission. There are no greenhouse gases. To quote the International Atomic Energy Agency: “It could provide virtually limitless clean, safe and affordable energy to meet the world’s demand.”

Achieving nuclear fusion itself is a solved problem. In 2018, 12-year-old Jackson Oswalt did it on a homemade reactor in his bedroom.

The real challenge can be boiled down to a simple statement, from emeritus professor John Howard, who oversaw the Australian National University’s experimental fusion reactor for many years: “You are keeping a star inside a magnetic bottle.”

This is as difficult as it sounds. The fusion reaction must be sustained, steady and reliable to provide baseload power.

Loading

Fusion scientists start with plasma – a super-hot swirling gas of atoms that have been stripped of their electrons. The plasma is sensitive to magnetic fields, so huge magnets are used to contain it and send it swirling through the reactor chamber.

Type One is proposing to build stellarators, which look like twisted hollow donuts wrapped in coils of superconducting magnets. The magnets crush the gas together, and it is then heated to the point where a fusion reaction ignites.

The technical challenges are enormous. Stellarators need to survive temperatures exceeding a hundred million degrees kelvin, while keeping the superconducting magnets that surround the chamber below zero.

It can work. The German W7-X stellarator set a record this year for the longest controlled fusion reaction. All that is needed now, says Baynes-Reid, is to scale up the German model to grid-size. One Energy proposes repurposing old shuttered coal plants, which already have grid connections.

Loading

“The fundamental science and technology has been proven. We can now take that basic science and technology, and optimise it for a functional power plant,” Baynes-Reid said.

Other scientists are less optimistic. The W7-X set a record by running for a grand total of 47 seconds.

“I hate being a naysayer. Huge progress has been made. But there’s a few fairly deft tech challenges yet to be solved,” said Howard.

Two stand out. First, for fusion to work, engineers need to prove up tritium breeding.

Fusion reactors run by fusing two special types of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium. Deuterium can be easily extracted from water, but tritium is rare – and radioactive.

A commercial fusion reactor needs to make its own tritium as a byproduct of the reaction, which can then be reused as fuel. This technology is theoretically possible, but scientists are yet to prove it works.

Second, neutrons created as part of the reaction can degrade the components of the reaction chamber. Can you quickly and economically swap them out, while still providing a reliable power supply?

“Their prospectus is fairly optimistic. I’d love to say it was grounded in demonstrated achievements, but that’s not quite the case yet,” said Howard. “Would I put my money into it, if I had any? Probably not.”

Then there’s the timescale problem. Type One believes it could have a working plant up in Tennessee by 2034, replacing the coal plants scheduled to reach the end of their working life over the next decade.

Australia has committed to cutting emissions by between 62 and 70 per cent of 2005 levels by 2035 – a dramatic increase in the pace of emissions reduction, likely requiring 95 per cent of all electricity generation to be renewable within a decade.

ITER, the world’s largest and most powerful experimental fusion reactor, conceived in 1985, has been under construction since 2013 and is projected to cost $US66 billion.

It is designed to reach breakeven, and will test out tritium breeding. But it won’t achieve first plasma until 2034 at the earliest, and won’t be connected to the grid.

“I am a believer. But there is the problem at hand. We’re cooking ourselves alive, and setting up the conditions for crazy rainfall and flooding and sea-level rises. First things first, deal with that with the tech that is available and proven,” said Dr Nathan Garland, a fusion researcher at Griffith University.",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7874%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_54%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/420256724b6d90603c0eefff98b1c3e88e2061bd,N,,2025-12-27 20:57:06.390497

Ramping up production would also help the EU reduce its reliance on China, the current global market leader in rare earths. Norway is leading the region in rare earth production, as other EU countries begin to invest in new production operations.

Several rare earth elements, alongside critical minerals, are needed to produce a wide range of renewable energy equipment, including wind turbines, solar panels, and electric vehicles (EVs), as well as the magnets used in artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and other electronics. At present, Europe relies heavily on imported minerals to meet its demand. China dominates the global rare earths supply chain, producing around 95 percent of the world’s rare-earth oxides and supplying 70 percent of Europe’s imports.

The EU’s domestic rare-earth production is almost non-existent at present. Therefore, China provides around 98 percent of Europe’s rare-earth magnet demand, as well as similar proportions of magnesium, gallium, and germanium, used in semiconductors and defence technologies. This year, China made export licenses stricter, reducing magnet exports by around 75 percent, leading automakers across Europe to halt production. This demonstrates the heavy reliance the EU has on China for rare earth imports.

Europe recently introduced the EU Critical Raw Materials Act, aimed at reducing reliance on foreign supply chains for extraction, processing, and recycling rare earths. In December, the EU also introduced an Economic Security Doctrine, with the aim of making Europe’s industry more self-sufficient. The strategy includes a plan for critical raw materials, entitled ResourceEU.

As the EU looks to expand its rare earths production capacity, several countries are investing in operations. The Belgian-French firm Solvay, which has been processing all 17 rare earths in its plant on France’s west coast for around 80 years, plans to expand its facility to respond to the growing demand. The French government is investing around $23 million in tax credits to support the expansion.

“This is a market that is growing fast, and, also, there is a greater demand for shorter supply chains,” said Solvay’s CEO Philippe Kehren. “When you have a material that is coming almost 100 percent from one specific location, if you are dependent on this, you want to diversify your sourcing. This is what we can offer,” explained Kehren.

Solvay’s facility is one of only two facilities in Europe that process rare earths, alongside another plant in Estonia. Until now, Solvay has processed rare earths for catalytic converters. However, as the demand for magnets across several of Europe’s rapidly expanding industries grows, the investment in the facility will help meet this demand.

Solvay plans to focus on recycling rare earths that are already in Europe and expects to be able to produce around 30 percent of the rare earths needed in the region solely from recycling end-of-life motors and other equipment. However, eventually it is expected to need to source the rare earths from mineral-rich regions of the world, such as Brazil, Canada, and Australia, as there are currently no operational rare earth mines in Europe.

In Norway, Rare Earths Norway is supporting the ResourceEU strategy with a new project in the south of the country. In June 2024, the company announced the discovery of Europe’s largest known rare earths deposit, giving hope for potential self-sufficiency. It’s Fen Carbonatite Complex is thought to hold 8.8 million metric tonnes of total rare earth oxides, and around 1.5 million tonnes of these are thought to contain the most vital magnet-related rare earths.

The company is currently pursuing approval for development and hopes to deliver its first rare earths by the first half of the 2030s. The firm has also appealed to domestic and EU policymakers to consider fast-track permitting. Rare Earths Norway aims to extract the resources using an “invisible mine” technique, which requires the drilling of a long, narrow tunnel diagonally underneath the village of Ulefoss and refilling extracted voids with waste materials, to reduce the environmental impact.

Meanwhile, in Sweden, the state-owned mining firm LKAB is developing its own rare earths project in the Arctic Circle in the city of Kiruna. In January 2023, the firm announced that it had discovered what it thought to be Europe’s largest known deposit of rare earths, close to the world’s largest underground iron ore mine. LKAB plans to move thousands of residents to a newly developed city centre to expand its conventional mining operations, so long as the expansion of the mine is deemed economically viable.

The recent discovery of rare earth deposits in Norway and Sweden offers hope to Europe, which aims to become more self-sufficient in rare earths mining and processing and reduce reliance on foreign powers such as China. The expansion of a processing facility in France will help quickly alleviate the supply-demand gap while the Nordic facilities are being developed, although the EU will also likely need to invest in mining operations in other parts of the world to boost its supply.

The Chinese have been developing an ultimate green facility to secure the country’s position as a leader in the global hydrogen production market. As China shifts its focus to the future capacity of 1,500,000 tonnes of green energy in the desert, one cannot help but be in awe of the benefits it has in store not only for China but also on a global scale. Discover more about China’s historic breakthrough in the desert below.

Goodbye to hydrogen after China’s historic discovery

China has shown that achieving long-term carbon neutrality is not an impossible feat, especially with the assistance of short-term climate targets. According to the World Resources Institute, China has set the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, and has updated its 2035 climate targets to include the following:

Have EVs become mainstream in sales

Boost forest stock volume

Boost wind and solar capacity to more than 6 times the 2020 capacity

Decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 7-10% compared to peak levels

>30% non-fossil fuel share in energy consumption

By late 2025, China managed to boost its green hydrogen capacity to surpass 220,000 tonnes annually. Now, thanks to an ultimate green facility and a future capacity of 1,500,000 tonnes of a hydrogen carrier in the desert, China can easily achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, if not earlier. Find out more below.

1,500,000 tonnes of this green energy in the desert

A Chinese company called Envision Energy has developed the ultimate green facility in the Net-Zero Industrial Park located in Inner Mongolia’s Chifeng City, near the Gobi Desert. This facility will be the biggest green ammonia and hydrogen production facility in China. Envision Energy’s facility will be a milestone in the country’s large-scale decarbonization.

The Chifeng facility is unique compared to others of its kind, as all production is powered solely by renewable energy sources, solar and wind energy, which is stored in batteries. Exports of green ammonia were planned for the final quarter of 2025, with the entire facility set to expand over three phases to achieve 1,52 million tonnes of green ammonia annually.

Expanding in three phases

Phase 0

Launching 20,000-ton pilot phase in March 2024

Phase 1

Produce 300,000 tonnes of green ammonia annually by September 2025

Phase 2

Start construction by August 2025

Increase annual production by 320,000 tonnes, starting in November 2026

Phase 3

Increase annual production by 900,000 tonnes

Reach full-scale production of 1,52 million tonnes annually by 2029

China will greatly benefit from this green energy

Beyond the Chifeng facility operating with zero emissions thanks to renewable energy sources, it is also the world’s ‘smartest’ facility. AI plays a vital role in operations management, balancing energy supply and demand in real time. The facility will also be beneficial for China’s export market, as Envision Energy has already secured an offtake deal with Japan’s Marubeni Corporation.

In this deal, green ammonia is exported for sectors such as:

Chemicals

Fertilizers

Shipping

According to the China Hydrogen Bulletin, other export purposes include transporting green ammonia by railway to Envision’s 80,000 cubic meter liquid ammonia storage and processing facility in Jinzhou port. This facility’s construction started in June 2024 and is still under development. Inner Mongolia is also planning to construct a 4,400 km green hydrogen pipeline network along with a 299 km ammonia transportation pipeline between Chifeng and Jinzhou.

The economic and environmental benefits for China are thus endless. Most importantly, this pioneering facility will significantly boost China’s energy security and play a major role in global decarbonization, bringing the world one step closer to achieving the global mission of achieving net-zero by 2050. While Envision Energy continues to develop the Chifeng facility, China is also juggling more than 20 other hydrogen ventures in its refreshed clean energy expansion.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gobi_amo_2009073_lrg.jpg,N,,2025-12-27 21:12:29.732120

Armed with the necessary equipment, she was hunting energy vampires in the western Pennsylvania library.

What she found — two aging dehumidifiers —were quietly sucking up the electricity in the basement, costing the library hundreds of dollars each month.

“I knew we were spending a lot on electricity,” Dan Slozat, executive director of the library, said. “I did not know where we stood in comparison to comparable buildings and organizations our size.”

It turns out, they were on the high end, which Searle-White found using her voltage meter to track electricity usage.

As the discussion around energy resources heats up, states and municipalities are taking action. From classrooms to city halls, practical solutions are emerging, and for many Americans, the urgency is financial.

The library’s outdated heating and cooling system generates excessive humidity, creating an environment unsuitable for books. While they don’t have the money to finance a new system, they were able to immediately replace the dehumidifier that seemed to be driving up energy consumption.

Within weeks of replacing them, the library’s electric bill dropped nearly $300 a month, paying for the new $200 dehumidifier instantly. Now, the library has the humidifier hooked up to a drain in the basement so it’s self-sufficient.

Slozat is hopeful because the unit doesn’t constantly run the way the old one did, it will also have a longer lifespan and won’t need to be replaced as soon, saving the library more money.

Searle-White, the Green Building Alliance’s Director of Outreach and Technical Assistance, has walked through 17 buildings in the Meadville area in the past year. The Green Building Alliance, a nonprofit based in Pittsburgh, works across sectors and communities to create efficient and high-performing spaces that are healthy for people and the surrounding environment.

GBA strategically chose to work with the city of Meadville due to its surrounding rural area, low-socioeconomic population per the U.S. Census tract, aging infrastructure and important health care and higher education partners.

It received a three-year grant from Pennsylvania electric utility settlements to work with one municipality. In its first year, the alliance partnered with 14 local organizations to improve 98 buildings in Meadville.

The GBA is an example of how communities are finding their own paths forward as federal support shifts. At the end of November, the U.S. Department of Energy announced a reorganization of the agency to prioritize oil and nuclear resources over renewable energy sources.

Low-hanging fruit

The average American is facing higher utility bills, with households paying 9.6% more from 2024 to 2025, according to the Center for American Progress. That rate outpaces wage growth and inflation, reminding people that the cheapest energy is energy not used.

In Meadville, GBA’s simple dehumidifier fix is an example of a simple solution with an immediate impact.

Ashley DiGregorio, GBA’s senior director of energy and communities, said infusing resources into rural areas with historic buildings benefits the local economy and, in turn, its residents.

Sitting in a three-floor building that houses an art gallery, cafe and coworking space, DiGregorio is positioned in front of a hanging lamp that bobbed up and down.

“I don’t know about you guys, but I feel a cold draft on my right leg, and I’m watching — do you see that lamp shade?” GBA’s Searle-White said. “This is a total example of building science.”

In the 1890s structure, cold air leaking through gaps is drawn toward the heater in the corner, creating a current that makes the lamp bob.

Searle-White moved through the building, pointing out the unsealed roof, exposed brick walls and lack of proper ventilation. She suggested simple fixes: Add a filter slot cover to the furnace, or install weather stripping, door sweeps and proper insulation.

“Insulation is a really important thing,” she said. “Things you can do as a homeowner would be weather strips and sweeps on your doors, making sure your windows are shut all the way and locked in the wintertime, because they all become little chimneys.”

Those are the low-hanging fruit solutions, so to speak, along with replacing incandescent light bulbs with LED ones, insulating an attic hatch and replacing aging appliances with EnergyStar ones, Searle-White said.

“You’ve got to think about the common places — the air leaks, the attic floor, the attic hatch, the ventilation, the roof — then you can think about having triple-pane windows,” Searle-White said, emphasizing that there are simple solutions before moving to expensive ones.

Although EnergyStar appliances cost more upfront, Searle-White said they’re worth it. “A new fridge uses like $5 a month instead of $20 or $25, so over the life of the unit, it really makes a big difference.”

For those who have already installed the basics, passive house construction offers a roadmap for ultra-low-energy, high-comfort buildings, using extreme insulation, air tightness and high-performance windows. In Meadville, two contractors from local construction company Sturdy Boots received passive house training and certification in Pittsburgh thanks to GBA, bringing expertise back to a community where many buildings predate modern energy codes.

Passive house uses a fabric-first approach, especially important during the construction of new houses. They are built with energy efficiency in mind. It is becoming increasingly relevant as people in the West use insulation not only to keep heat and cool air inside but to keep wildfire smoke outside.

Education as infrastructure

In Ada, Oklahoma, educator Doug Weirick is harnessing a different sort of energy — one that could move green initiatives forward for generations to come. Along with two other retired science teachers and one current teacher, the group is known as the Oklahoma Renewable Energy Education Program.

OREEP hosts workshops for K-12 public teachers up to four times a year thanks to its partnership with the Oklahoma chapter of the Sierra Club, an environmental nonprofit.

“We give them kits — a solar kit and a wind energy kit — that have solar panels and a wind turbine, so we do experiments with the teachers during the workshops so they’re comfortable doing the same concept experiments with their students,” Weirick said.

Oklahoma has abundant wind and solar resources, making it ideal for renewable energy education. Weirick hopes students will think positively about technical fields and take knowledge home to their families. As someone who installed 18 solar panels on his own roof using tax incentives, he understands that economics matter — but education creates a ripple effect beyond individual households.

In Daleville, Indiana, the Daleville Community Schools are taking a different approach to educating students. In 2024, Daleville Elementary started up its new solar field.

The solar field, three rows of solar panels located next to a nearby church, covers about 50% of the school’s electricity usage. Dr. Greg Roach, who was superintendent before retiring this year, was instrumental in installing the solar field.

“Two reasons prompted us to pursue a solar field for our school corporation,” he said. “The first was to allow us to reduce our electric bill, which in turn would reduce expenditures. Second, there was a rebate that provided about one-third of the costs back to us.”

The school district used its Rainy Day Fund to cover the $364,000 project. The district’s monthly electric bill before the solar field was $9,912. The monthly average now is about $6,713 — nearly a 33% reduction — which means the unit field should pay for itself within a decade.

While individual schools and educators plant seeds for the future, some communities have taken a more comprehensive approach, dedicating staff and multimillion-dollar budgets to transforming their municipalities now.

Municipalities in action

While federal support has shifted — with tax credits for electric vehicles ending Sept. 30 and residential clean energy credits set to expire Dec. 31 — some states are taking matters into their own hands.

Top states leading in clean energy mandates and adoption include California, New York, Washington, Oregon, Illinois, Colorado and Massachusetts.

The city of Salem, Massachusetts, created a Sustainability and Resiliency Department in 2021 to meet the state’s carbon neutrality goal by 2050.

Neal Duffy, director of the department, said in addition to administering programs and policies to help them reach that goal, the city has set its own goals. The city uses taxpayer dollars to update technologies in city-owned schools, buildings and its vehicle fleet.

The department’s four-person team includes an energy manager, a project manager focused on coastal flooding adaptation and an outreach coordinator.

“That person is very focused on the residents and helping them get connected to programs and policies that are available to them, whether it’s through the utility companies or the state, and just does a lot of handholding and assisting people navigate that world, which can be confusing and often changing,” Duffy said of the outreach coordinator.

He said a majority of its funding comes from the state and utility companies. The city explores federal options, but said those resources have lessened with the change of administration.

With consistent leadership in the state, though, community buy-in and support have not been an issue. Climate goals have been a top priority for the city, leading to improved weatherization for buildings, conversion to LED lightbulbs and installation of electric vehicle charging stations.

From 2022 through the end of 2026, it’s estimated that Salem’s Sustainability and Resiliency Department will have been awarded about $2.8 million in grants and nearly $1 million in utility incentives. The municipality is expected to have 10 electric vehicles in its fleet by the end of 2026, with 25 charging stations for those vehicles and 99 charging station permits granted in the community.

Two fast-charge stations were installed at the police headquarters last year for the new electric vehicles, enabling them to charge up to 80% in 15 minutes so they can continue operating on a 24/7 schedule.

To measure the energy efficiency savings, Duffy pointed to Salem Power Choice, a program that grants participating residents access to sustainable alternative energy sources off the national grid. Since its inception in 2016, Salem Power Choice participants have saved more than $22 million in electricity costs. Its energy savings are the equivalent of removing 43,379 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles from the road for one year.

But state support isn’t everything. Sometimes it comes down to individual commitment.

Home investments that pay off

For some people, the green energy argument is personal. Mankato, Minnesota, residents Kathy Brynaert and Tony Filipovitch exemplify what happens when personal commitment meets practical payback.

“We’re aging former hippies,” Filiipovich said. “Energy conservation, growing our own food, those things have been part of our lives going back 40 or 50 years.”

The “Reduce, Reuse, Recycle” campaign of the 1970s became their motto in life.

Previously, Filipovitch taught urban studies at Minnesota State University; Brynaert served in the Minnesota House of Representatives.

While other people save up for grand vacations and nice cars, they were saving up for a geothermal system.

“We see energy use as part of reducing the use of nature as much as you can,” Brynaert explained.

They live in a Victorian-era farmhouse built in the 1880s with various additions. They explored solar panels, but were told they’d have to cut down trees on the property, which they were not willing to do.

At the beginning of this century, they began to save for geothermal energy. Geothermal energy works by harnessing the Earth’s underground temperature and transforming it into usable energy within the home.

After a decade of saving, the system was installed in 2009. They faced some obstacles on the way, as there were multiple additions with varying foundations, and sat on top of a slab of limestone.

Crews drilled five wells across the couple’s property and ran ducts up between the studs of the house.

Prior to the installation of the whole-home heating and cooling system, the couple had one window unit in the living room and would sleep on the floor under it during hot summer days.

With the whole-home geothermal system, they spent about the same amount on heating and cooling the whole house as they did when they were just running the one window unit.

At the time, heat exchangers weren’t ideal for Minnesota winters, requiring a backup source. The technology has since improved, making it viable in cold climates.

“There was a lot of learning for us and the company that installed the unit,” Brynaert said.

They learned to seal air leaks first — insulation is cheaper than buying a larger system to compensate for heat loss.

Brynaert believes lower-income residents need help spreading costs over time. Filipovitch suggests ‘district geothermal,’ where neighbors share laterally dug systems. Since streets require replacement every 50 years, upgrades could be phased in.

The couple also subscribes to a solar farm, which allows them to pay a monthly fee and have access to an off-site solar farm for energy without having to install solar panels of their own.

The couple was able to use incentives to install their geothermal system, which Brynaert said are not as readily available.

“At the point we did our geothermal (unit), there were federal credits and state credits for various forms of alternative energy, including geothermal, so that was part of the incentive that actually moved us to make that decision,” she said. “I do think we have lost focus. I mean, when you say policy changes, return some awareness of the value of insulating people’s homes, helping people at all levels.”

The couple continually upgrades their system and advocates for environmental stewardship through renewable energy. In energy consumption audits, they’re typically on the very low end of energy usage. Last year, they were in the top 10% in energy efficiency in the state.

Whether it’s a teacher with a solar kit, a superintendent watching utility bills drop, or a city department coordinating green energy efforts, solutions exist at every level. The question isn’t whether to act, but where to start. Education, accessible financing, and efficiency basics are all part of the equation, but maintaining focus is key to ensuring green energy makes a difference.

As Brynaert noted, “Alternative energy isn’t a partisan issue. It’s really an issue for humanity’s survival in the long run.”",https://www.cnhi.com/wp-content/themes/cnhi/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-28 10:13:26.078083

Also lagging behind in terms of EV adoption and incentives is West Virginia, another state that offers no incentives for EV buyers.
A likely reason for this could be that Mississippi also doesn't offer much in terms of EV incentives, as there isn't any state-wide EV rebate or tax credit.
Arkansas, like the states before it on this list, offers no tax incentives or rebates for electric vehicles.
Regardless, seeing as how the state is a coal-producing one, EV incentives are a pretty unlikely development anyway.","Electric vehicles are said to be great for the environment and a good way to cut down on gas and maintenance costs. All around the world, countries have introduced policies to help phase out gas-powered vehicles for electric ones. In the United States, there have also been deliberate efforts to encourage everyone to invest in electric vehicles through tax credits and rebates, both at the federal and state levels. A recent federal incentive that offered $7,500 tax credit on new EVs and $4,000 on used ones has effectively come to an end, but many states still have similar benefits in place for residents.

The politics surrounding electrification are one factor that has some states continuing to preserve their gasoline-focused car market, offering zero tax credits or rebates. EVs also struggle to gain sufficient demand in certain areas due to environmental factors or state-specific driving habits. With that said, here are the U.S. states with the worst EV incentives.

To start things off, North Dakota has been recognized as one of the least friendly states for electric vehicles. Vehicle owners don't get tax incentives or rebates for buying the best new EVs or even installing home charging stations. Instead, the state actually imposes an additional registration fee of $120 a year, which further discourages EV use in the state. That's probably why it has the second-lowest amount of EV chargers available to use among all other U.S. states.

When it comes to EV market shares, North Dakota ranks 50th in the country, and adoption of this technology in the state has been noticeably slow. Given that it's a rural state, the aversion to electric vehicles in North Dakota is not unexpected. It also has a cold climate, which means residents often have to travel long distances under weather conditions that EVs generally don't have the capability to perform well in.

Also lagging behind in terms of EV adoption and incentives is West Virginia, another state that offers no incentives for EV buyers. As you might expect, the state has one of the lowest EV adoption rates in the country, with just 143 EVs per 100,000 people. In 2020, West Virginia placed 44th among US states in terms of EV sales.

Apart from its lack of incentives, you'll also need to pay $200 as an EV user each time you want to renew your registration in West Virginia. This approach is partly due to the state's rural geography, as well as its political stance on electric vehicles; the governor of the state once described EV mandates as harmful to the state's energy production.

The good news is that there have been recent efforts to improve EV infrastructure in West Virginia. These projects were initiated and funded by the federal government. From 2021 to 2023, the number of DC fast-charging ports in the state went up by 81%, and from 2022 to 2023, its EV sales grew by 46%, indicating that the embrace of EVs may improve.

Mississippi is stereotyped for its underdevelopment, ranking low in many national comparisons on socioeconomic issues. Turns out, it doesn't fare well with EV technology, either. It has a very poor EV adoption rate compared to other states. A likely reason for this could be that Mississippi also doesn't offer much in terms of EV incentives, as there isn't any state-wide EV rebate or tax credit.

However, in addition to that, Mississippi has restricted EV manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to customers in person. While this move has been justified for the protection it affords businesses, it counts as a setback for the growth of the EV market. Unsurprisingly, Mississippi has the lowest proportion of EVs in the country, with 110 vehicles per 100,000 people.

On the bright side, residents seeking incentives may be able to access municipal-level rebates from utility companies. In particular, Mississippi Power, which operates in some cities within the state, offers rebates on EV chargers.

Arkansas, like the states before it on this list, offers no tax incentives or rebates for electric vehicles. The state was also noted as one of the worst for electric vehicle infrastructure. Recently, a bill was also introduced in Arkansas to repeal its EV infrastructure program, which could potentially worsen the EV-friendliness of the state.

In addition, purchasers have to pay expensive registration fees when purchasing both EVs and hybrid vehicles, with a cost of $200 for the former and $100 for plug-in hybrids. However, even though the state doesn't provide any of its own, residents do have incentive options. Groups like Entergy, Ozarks Electric Cooperative, and Southwestern Electric Power Company all provide EV charger rebates for their customers and communities.

Despite the aforementioned roadblocks and Arkansas continuing to have one of the lowest adoption rates in the country, EV registrations in the state have still increased in recent times, going from 6,895 in 2024 to 8,807 as of April 2025.

Wyoming has very low EV adoption, which is unsurprising, seeing as how the state has failed to create an enabling environment for this technology. There are no state-level tax credits or rebates for EV purchases, and to worsen matters, the political climate serves as an obstacle to EV development. In 2024, a Wyoming senator introduced a bill seeking to eliminate the federal tax credit, citing that unwilling families should not have to shoulder the costs of a ""climate agenda,"" as mentioned by Buckrail. Other politicians have also raised concerns regarding the threat that EVs pose to the oil, gas, coal industries in the state.

But apart from the political pushback, Wyoming's environment is just not the best fit for EVs. The harsh winters and rural landscapes mean that EV investments won't provide much benefit here. Regardless, seeing as how the state is a coal-producing one, EV incentives are a pretty unlikely development anyway. However, there are still utility companies in the state that offer EV charger rebates to their customers.

Next on the list is Kentucky. Although this southeastern state has been a force in America's vehicle market, it is easily among the toughest places for EV owners to live in throughout the U.S. To start with, it has one of the worst infrastructures for electric cars. Charging stations are sparse, laws are unfavorable, and adoption is low. There are only about 820 chargers in the entire state, which amounts to 5,520 residents per charger.

As you might have guessed, there are no state-sponsored tax credits or rebates offered to EV purchasers in Kentucky. Although some utility companies offer rebates of $25 when owners enroll and an additional $5 a month, this amount is unlikely to seriously influence purchase decisions. With all these barriers in place, it appears Kentucky residents are largely reluctant to buy EVs. But for those who choose to, they will have to pay an annual registration fee of up to $25 along with a $120 annual supplemental license fee.

In Alabama, any incentives or rebates available to residents are either those sponsored by the federal government or by utility companies such as Alabama Power. There's also a local utility provider known as Central Alabama Electric Cooperative, which allows its members to qualify for a $100 rebate on their EVs.

On the other hand, the state government imposes a fee of $203 annually for EV buyers and $103 for plug-in hybrid purchasers. This amount is separate from the registration fees, and it also increases by $3 every year. The absence of incentives, coupled with the high fees and lack of adequate infrastructure, means owning an EV in this state can pose heavy financial burdens.

Alabama has also taken some political steps against EVs. In August 2025, it joined 26 other states to challenge California's EV mandate. The states collectively opposed a waiver that allowed California to limit the sale of gas-powered vehicles. With that in mind, it seems unlikely that Alabama would seek to support an electric-powered future for the automotive industry.

As previously mentioned, cold temperatures are known to have some impact on EV range, so it's not unusual for regions with harsh climates to be less friendly towards EVs. For Alaska, this is very much the case. It is a remote and sparsely populated state, and that makes the use and development of EV infrastructure quite difficult — especially considering its large land area.

There are no EV rebates or tax credits sponsored by the Alaska state government. However, unlike some other states, Alaska doesn't impose penalties for purchasers in the form of registration fees or annual ownership fees. Essentially, the state is pretty passive when it comes to EV regulation. Residents may, however, benefit from the Alaska Power and Telephone utility company, which grants a $500 rebate simply for purchasing an EV. And from the look of things, EV popularity may be growing in the state, as ownership numbers have doubled from 2018 to 2020.

Idaho also refuses to embrace EVs, which should be a given when considering its status as a rural state. For many residents, gas is a cheaper and more accessible option, and it doesn't help that there are no incentives for those making the switch to electric. In fact, if you own an EV, you have to pay an annual fee of $140. A few years ago, there was an attempt to raise this fee even higher to $300 through a bill that was never passed.

Ironically, Idaho is one of the states that could benefit the most from a fuller embrace of EVs. It, along with Wyoming, has one of the highest rates of private vehicle ownership in the country, and this contributes negatively to the rate of traffic congestion and greenhouse emissions. EVs would lower the negative environmental impacts while simultaneously saving some money for residents that would normally be buying gasoline.

Currently, the only incentives available to Idaho residents are the rebates offered by Kootenai Electric Cooperative, which go to the purchase of a level 2 home charger. Idaho Power also offers savings for its customers when they charge their vehicles during specific hours.

Although the interest in EVs has significantly increased in South Dakota, the state has still been lagging behind in embracing them. With increasing gas prices coupled with increases in electrical vehicle range, there's more reason for people to invest in these cars. However, South Dakota offers no state-wide incentives for individual EV purchasers while also imposing a $50-per-year for owners.

Generally, the state still has much to do in terms of EV infrastructure. Chargers, for instance, are just over 100 in number, despite the state being home to nearly a million residents. But that's not to say the state government has done nothing to improve it. A while ago, the South Dakota Department of Transportation introduced an EV Fast Charging Plan to create more available chargers for EV owners.

The state has also provided rebates through the Volkswagen EV Charging station rebate program, which emerged from a lawsuit against Volkswagen in 2016. However, this project is limited to state bodies, organizations, and businesses, not individual consumers.

Unlike many states that have made it to this list, Hawaii appears generally receptive to the use of EVs. The tropical island state actually has one of the highest rates of EV adoption in the country. However, the state itself still doesn't offer any incentives for EV users or purchasers. In fact, aside from registration fees, owners of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids are expected to pay $50 annually.

The reason EV adoption has been so high in the state is actually due to several other reasons. Firstly, gasoline prices, which cost $4.72 on average, are high for most residents. Also, the state doesn't have the challenge of long road trips that are common in most rural areas. To add to this, the warm weather in Hawaii is quite favorable for EV adoption.

In terms of the actual infrastructure and incentives, Hawaii still lags behind, leaving a gap between the demand for EVs and the structure to accommodate it. On the bright side, the state has a mission to fully embrace renewable energy by 2045 and has already taken steps toward achieving this goal.

Montana is sparsely populated, but it is a large state in terms of land area, and this makes EV adoption quite a challenge. The state government does not help much either, offering zero incentives or tax credits for going electric. If you choose to invest in an EV, you're required to pay $260 if your car weighs less than 6,000 pounds. If it's heavier, that fee goes as high as $380. The state also imposes annual fees for EV owners, which are also dependent on the vehicle's weight and can reach up to $1,100.

Unlike many other states, Montana residents don't have access to rebates provided by utility companies either. The only form of incentive residents could have been entitled to were those provided by the federal government. Montana's challenge with EVs can also be partly attributed to its poor energy sector.
