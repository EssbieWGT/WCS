Car sellers expect these final weeks to be busy, especially in Colorado, where electric vehicles (EVs) tend to sell quicker than in other states, according to the report. For example, one of the best-selling EVs in that state has been Nissan’s all-electric Ariya SUV.

Writing about the impending expiration of the EV tax credits earlier this year, PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster highlighted analysts’ projections that the loss of the incentive will cause demand for electric cars to fall by 28% by the end of the decade.

“No incentives to defray higher purchase prices — even before potential tariffs raise the price of new cars — and fewer charging stations create an untenable market dynamic that could push the EV industry into reverse,” Webster wrote March 17. “This all paints a starkly different future for electric cars in America than previously imagined.”

After years of optimism about EV adoption, the U.S. electric vehicle revolution ended up snagged in a “potential platform misfire” not caused by any one flaw, but what seems to be “fundamental misalignments” in what’s needed to spark complex, multi-sided ecosystems, Webster wrote.

“At its core, the EV industry in the U.S. represents a classic multi-sided market — a business ecosystem that requires the right incentives for multiple distinct user groups to participate simultaneously, agree on standards and compete on features and products, not proprietary standards and government subsidies,” she wrote. “When these elements fail to align, the entire system sputters.”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/electric-vehicles-tax-credit.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 17:00:21.714819

That’s set to take place on September 30, though there’s still been some ambiguity around that deadline: would it apply to EVs purchased by the end of the month, or would they have to be delivered by then?

The IRS has opted to clarify just how the federal EV credit will end, which also illustrates a bit of wiggle room when it comes to the September 30 deadline. In an update on the agency’s website, it explained how the winding down of a number of credits will work — including what needs to be done in order to qualify for the EV credit.

“Acquiring a vehicle prior to the termination date is an initial step, but acquisition alone does not immediately entitle a taxpayer to a credit,” the IRS explained. There’s also the matter of when the vehicle is placed into service,. This is how the IRS explains it: “If a taxpayer acquires a vehicle by having a written binding contract in place and a payment made on or before September 30, 2025, then the taxpayer will be entitled to claim the credit when they place the vehicle in service (namely, when they take possession of the vehicle), even if the vehicle is placed in service after September 30, 2025.”

The agency also added a reminder of some essential paperwork that EV buyers should receive around their purchase. “Taxpayers should receive a time of sale report from the dealer at the time they take possession or within three days of taking possession of the vehicle,” the agency notes.

It’s About to Get Harder for Federal Employees to Charge EVs at Work

In an article for NPR on the IRS’s announcement, Camila Domonoske pointed out another essential element to getting the EV tax credit: buyers will need to make some sort of payment, whether that’s a downpayment on the new vehicle or a trade-in of an older car, truck or SUV. Will the end of the federal tax credits lead to an uptick in EV sales in the U.S. before the month ends?

Published: 9/1/2025, 2:35:48 PM EDT

Tesla’s sales slump in Europe extended into August, with sharp declines in key markets underscoring the U.S. electric-vehicle maker’s struggles against rising Chinese competition and a consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk.

Fresh data from France’s car industry group Plateforme automobile showed Tesla registrations down 47.3 percent year over year in August, while the overall French passenger car market rose by 2.2 percent to 87,850 vehicles. Over the first eight months of 2025, French new-car registrations were down by 7.1 percent, though Tesla’s 39.4 percent drop far outpaced the market.

The picture was even bleaker across the Nordic countries. In Sweden, Tesla registrations plunged by 84.4 percent, according to industry association Mobility Sweden, while overall sales climbed 6 percent. Denmark saw Tesla down 42 percent, and the Netherlands registered a 50 percent slide.

The only bright spots were Norway and Spain, though even there, Tesla lagged behind Chinese rival BYD. In Norway, where nearly all new cars sold are electric, Tesla gained 21.3 percent in August. But BYD’s sales soared by 218 percent, cementing its position as the fastest-growing EV brand in Scandinavia.

In Spain, Tesla’s sales jumped 161 percent to 1,435 vehicles, in part due to generous subsidies. BYD, however, outsold Tesla with 1,827 vehicles—a 400 percent increase. Year to date, BYD sales in Spain surged by 675 percent to 14,181 units, compared with Tesla’s more modest 11.6 percent rise to 9,303. Some analysts cautioned that Tesla’s August spike may have been inflated by the timing of shipments. Andy Leyland, co-founder of supply chain specialist SC Insights, said that when quarterly numbers that run through the end of September are published, a clearer picture of Tesla sales will emerge.

Broader Slide

Tesla’s August weakness in some key European markets followed steep declines in July in Europe’s two largest auto markets. The company’s UK sales fell by nearly 60 percent to 987 vehicles, while German registrations fell by 55 percent to 1,110, according to national industry bodies. For the first seven months of 2025, Tesla’s German sales were down by almost 58 percent to 10,000 units.

In the same period, BYD’s UK sales increased nearly fourfold to 3,184, and German sales jumped almost fivefold to 1,126.

Data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association show Tesla has now lost market share in Europe for seven consecutive months, with registrations down 42.4 percent year over year in July.

Analysts say Tesla’s problems in Europe reflect both market dynamics and brand perception. The company has not introduced a new mass-market model since the Model Y in 2020, while competitors have flooded the market with fresh offerings.

“One reason we are continuing to see disappointing Tesla volumes can partially be attributed to a more competitive market environment,” said Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive.

Tesla executives have previously expressed the view that declining sales reflected a production switch to the revamped Model Y, which was Europe’s best-selling car in 2023. Deliveries began in June, but the model has struggled: August sales of the Model Y fell by 46.5 percent in Denmark and by 87 percent in Sweden.

Tesla’s slump in Europe comes on the heels of weak quarterly results. The company reported a 12 percent year‑on‑year drop in total revenue to $22.5 billion, its steepest decline in a decade, and a 42 percent decline in operating income to $923 million.

Musk told investors on an earnings call that Tesla may face “a few rough quarters” amid shifting tariffs, expiring EV tax credits in the United States, and evolving regulatory frameworks for autonomous driving.

Oregon House Bill 3991, is a comprehensive transportation funding measure, introduced in the 2025 special session, that proposes to increase gasoline taxes, raise vehicle registration and titling fees, and double a payroll tax used for public transit. It also requires electric vehicle owners to pay new annual fees and makes other changes to transportation-related fees and taxes to fund road maintenance and operations.

The package is part of a broader effort to modernize Oregon’s transportation funding system.

Public written testimony leaned heavily against the proposal. Through the Oregon Legislature’s website, more than 1,000 written comments were submitted, with over 940, opposed. Only about 2–3% of written testimony supported the bill.

Despite the pushback, some local leaders voiced support, including Bend Mayor Melanie Kebler.

According to the letter below, Kebler supports the bill, seeing it as an urgent but temporary fix to protect city funding, transit, and road safety.

Deschutes County Commissioner Patti Adair told KTVZ News Sunday evening, she testified virtually, earlier in the day to oppose the bill.

She acknowledged the importance of keeping roads like Government Camp and Santiam Pass accessible in the winter, but said she doesn’t believe, raising the gas tax and other fees, which would be passed down to Oregonians, the right move for Oregon, who she says, is the 4th highest taxed state in the nation.

""Government Camp and Santiam Pass must be accessible this winter,"" Adair said.

Though members expressed concerns about the financial impact on Oregonians, ultimately the committee voted 7–5 to pass HB 3991.

Among amendments added to HB 3991, include:

The Act increases and adds taxes related to roads, cars, trucks and buses and says how revenue must be used.

Ford’s new EV strategy comes as Chinese automakers are quickly expanding across the globe, offering relatively affordable electric vehicles.","LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Ford Motor Co. will invest nearly $2 billion retooling a Kentucky factory to produce electric vehicles that it says will be more affordable, more profitable to build and will outcompete rival models.

The automaker’s top executive unveiled the new EV strategy at Ford’s Louisville Assembly Plant which, after producing gas-powered vehicles for 70 years, will be converted to manufacture electric vehicles.

“In our careers, as automobile people we’re lucky if we get to work on one, maybe two, projects that really change the face of our industry,” CEO Jim Farley told plant workers in Kentucky on Aug. 11. “And I believe today is going to light the match as one of those projects for all of us here.”

The Big Detroit automakers have continued to transition from internal combustion engines to EV technology even as President Donald Trump’s administration unwinds incentives for automakers to go electric.

Trump’s massive tax and spending law targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car.

Yet Farley and other top executives in the auto industry say that electric vehicles are the future and there is no going back.

The first EV to be produced by the revamped Louisville production process will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup truck in 2027 for domestic and international markets, the company said.

The new electric trucks will feature plenty of interior space to fit five adults and pack enough power to have a targeted 0-60 time as fast as a Mustang EcoBoost, but with more downforce, Ford said.

The electric trucks will be powered by lower-cost batteries made at a Ford factory in Michigan. The Detroit automaker previously announced a $3 billion investment to build the battery factory.

The automaker sees this as a “Model T moment” for its EV business — a reference to revolutionary changes on the production line led by the company’s founder, Henry Ford, when it began churning out vehicles from a factory more than a century ago.

Farley said the changes will upend how electric vehicles are made in the United States.

“It represents the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T,” he said.

The company said it will use a universal platform and production system for its EVs, essentially the underpinning of a vehicle that can be applied across a wide range of models.

The Louisville factory — one of two Ford assembly plants in Kentucky’s largest city — will be revamped to cut production costs and make assembly time faster as it’s prepared to churn out electric vehicles.

The result will be “an affordable electric vehicle that we expect to be profitable,” Farley said in an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the announcement. “This is an example of us rejuvenating our U.S. plants with the most modern manufacturing techniques.”

The new platform enables a lineup of affordable vehicles to be produced at scale, Ford said.

It will reduce parts by 20% versus a typical vehicle, with 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations dock-to-dock in the plant and a 15% faster assembly time, Ford said.

The traditional assembly line will be transformed into an “assembly tree” at the Louisville plant, the company said.

Instead of one long conveyor, three subassembly lines will operate simultaneously and then join together, it said.

Other specifications for the midsize electric truck — including its reveal date, starting price, Environmental Protection Agency-estimated battery range, battery sizes and charge times — will be announced later, the company said.

Farley revealed that the truck will have a targeted starting price of about $30,000.

Ford said its investment in the Louisville plant will secure 2,200 hourly jobs.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said that the automaker’s plans for the Louisville plant will strengthen a more than century-old partnership between Ford and the Bluegrass State.

“This announcement not only represents one of the largest investments on record in our state, it also boosts Kentucky’s position at the center of EV-related innovation and solidifies Louisville Assembly Plant as an important part of Ford’s future,” Beshear said.

Ford said its combined investment of about $5 billion at the Kentucky assembly plant and Michigan battery plant is expected to create or secure nearly 4,000 direct jobs between the two plants while strengthening the domestic supply chain with dozens of new U.S.-based suppliers.

Ford previously forecast weaker earnings growth for this year and further losses in its electric vehicles business as it works to control costs.

Model e, Ford’s electric vehicle business, posted a full-year loss of $5.08 billion for 2024 as revenue fell 35% to $3.9 billion.

Ford’s new EV strategy comes as Chinese automakers are quickly expanding across the globe, offering relatively affordable electric vehicles.

“We’re not in a race to build the most electric cars,” Farley told the AP when asked about competition from China. “We’re in a race to have a sustainable electric business that’s profitable, that customers love.”

“And this new vehicle built in Louisville, Kentucky, is going to be a much better solution to anything that anyone can buy from China,” he added.

Ford could have opted to launch its EV project overseas to reap lower-cost labor and currency advantages, but instead is “taking the fight to our competition” from the plant in Kentucky, Farley said at the Aug. 11 event. But the Ford CEO cautioned that “there are no guarantees” with the project.

“We’re doing so many new things I can’t tell you with 100% certainty that this will all go just right,” he said. “It is a bet. There is risk. The automotive industry has a graveyard littered with affordable vehicles that were launched in our country with all good intentions.

Stay tuned to Mountain Journal for Part 2 in our geothermal energy series, a historical look at how geothermal power extraction could impact surrounding features.","EDITOR’S NOTE: This is Part 1 in a three-part series on geothermal energy, its availability in the West and the implications in Greater Yellowstone.

As the land of fire and ice, Iceland is an arctic nation characterized by dynamic duality. With snowcapped mountain peaks stretching to an elevation of nearly 7,000 feet and ice flow-laden seas, Iceland, which measures roughly the size of Kentucky, holds a geologically rich power source: geothermal energy.

Today, the government of Iceland reports that geothermal power facilities generate 25 percent of the country’s electricity and nearly all of its domestic hot water.

Jason Kaiser, an associate professor of geology at Southern Utah University, notes that Iceland is a global leader in harnessing power and hot water through geothermal energy, partly due to its readily available resources. But in the United States, geothermal energy is concentrated in the West, where it is primarily located. And significant geothermal features exist in protected areas, such as Yellowstone National Park.

Large-scale geothermal energy harnesses power by taking advantage of natural heat sources found deep within the Earth’s crust, where hot water warms and seeps into underground reservoirs. When this water is hot enough, it can break through the Earth’s surface crust at specific regions, often where tectonic plates shift, producing hydrothermal features such as hot springs and geysers like Yellowstone’s Old Faithful.

Conventional geothermal energy has three key features: permeability in the bedrock, access to water, and shallow heat, all of which constrain where heat can be utilized from the Earth as a power source. Historically, geothermal energy was limited to areas of hot surface water, but now we can access this superheated water.

Modern technological advances today allow energy producers to drill as far as two miles below the Earth’s surface to access deep heat, which flashes hot water to steam at the surface, driving turbines and powering generators.

With low emissions, a small physical footprint, and around-the-clock power generation, experts like Kaiser say geothermal energy provides an opportunity to strengthen America’s energy grid, and while the number fluctuates “since new plants are being built all the time,” he estimates there are only around 31 geothermal power plants in the U.S.

Angela Seligman, senior geoscientist at the nonprofit environmental organization Clean Air Task Force, says geothermal energy in the U.S. is underutilized and underprioritized.

“It has not been put at the forefront for a long time in terms of an important source of electricity because, until recently, the focus has been on conventional geothermal energy,” Seligman said, referring to the latest advances in technology.

To date, most electricity from geothermal energy has come from conventional geothermal systems that rely on a shallow heat source, the permeability of the bedrock, and the ability to access and move water through the rock.

“When we have those three things together, we typically think of it as a conventional geothermal system, but there aren’t very many regions around the world that have those three features available and readily accessible,” she said.

In enhanced geothermal systems, drillers are now able to use advanced technologies to create fractures in hot, dry rock that may have previously been impermeable with older equipment, Seligman said, and pipe water into otherwise dry rock. The rock heats the fluid, generating electricity or to heat homes and businesses.

So, why isn’t the western U.S. producing more electricity through geothermal energy? Unlike Iceland, which has historically invested in infrastructure to support geothermal energy production, the U.S. power grid largely relies on natural resource extraction. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, fossil fuels generate 60 percent of U.S. electricity, whereas geothermal energy comprises just .4 percent. But that door may have recently cracked open.

It just might not be that easy.

Because America’s energy grid is based on fossil fuels, Kaiser says that to prioritize geothermal energy, new infrastructure would need to be built and existing infrastructure would need to be retrofitted.

“It’s pretty hard to retrofit, though not impossible, and it’s being done but [outdated infrastructure] is certainly a barrier we must overcome,” said Kaiser, adding that accessibility to geothermal features in places like the Rocky Mountains is complex and limited due to road access, weather conditions and proximity to the bigger electrical grid.

Most geothermal energy in the U.S. isare located in the western states, particularly in remote regions that are sparsely populated, such as the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Compared to fossil fuels, geothermal energy resources are isolated by environmental conditions such as the inaccessible terrain of the Rocky Mountains. Coal and oil, conversely, can be mined from the ground and transported by truck or train to a power station that’s already connected to the power grid.

John Metesh, director of the Montana Bureau of Geology and Mines, has been working in the field for three decades and notes that over the last few years, the western U.S. has experienced significant growth in the geothermal sector.

“It’s always been there, but it really comes down to the economics,” he said. “Just like any other energy source, there has to be a market for it. But as the cost of energy goes up, the interest in green energy is, of course, increasing.”

The other part of the issue, however, is the generation. For geothermal energy to be commercially successful, it must generate electricity. Unlike fossil fuels, which can be transported to plants and converted into energy, geothermal requires electricity to be generated at the site, restricted to where it can be created.

“With geothermal, we have to produce the energy in situ,” Kaiser said. “The power plant has to be right where the heat source is, which means transmitting that energy could be a long way to the grid, and there is energy loss with transmission. So we don’t want to transmit [the power] very far to get it on the grid. That means updating the grid itself [and] adding a lot of infrastructure.”

Water access may also be a barrier. In the western U.S., many geothermal heat sources exist, but water is limited. To protect both, Kaiser warns developers to be careful if they’re disrupting the water systems and their aquifers.

“We have to make sure there’s heat there, but also that whatever aquifer we’re drilling into, we’re not disturbing it,” Kaiser said, adding that geothermal power companies must ensure enough usable, uncontaminated water in nearby aquifers to maintain equilibrium.

“For as much as we’re exploring alternative, renewable or green energy, we also have to be very, very careful with how we’re using our water in the western U.S.,” Kaiser said.

In interconnected environments like the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the potential impacts of geothermal energy production may extend beyond the boundaries of a power production plant.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is throwing its support behind the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) newly proposed Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS)—a move seen as critical for the future of biofuels and commodity demand for corn and soybean farmers.

“We at USDA are very supportive of the Environmental Protection Agency and the proposed Renewable Volume Obligations. We think those numbers are wonderful and are where they need to be and meet the current ability of America to produce biofuels,” said USDA Deputy Secretary Stephen Faden.

The Renewable Volume Obligation sets the minimum amount of biofuels—such as ethanol and biodiesel—that must be produced and blended into the national fuel supply each year. These obligations are updated annually by the EPA.

“The Renewable Volume Obligation, that’s the amount of biofuels we need to produce at minimum and be blended into our fuels in this country every year. EPA sets that on an annual basis.”

However, a legal provision allows small oil refineries to apply for waivers that exempt them from blending requirements—something that in the past has led to a loss in total biofuel volume, which directly impacts demand for corn and soybeans used to produce these fuels.

“There’s a provision in the law which says for certain small oil refineries, they are entitled to receive a waiver from having to participate in this program. They don’t have to blend biofuels into the petroleum that they refine.”

“In the past, that has essentially been lost volume. If you had a Renewable Fuels Obligation of a billion gallons and 100 million of it were waived because of the small refinery, in reality, you’d only be producing 900 million gallons.”

But the EPA is changing that process to protect total biofuel demand.

“Now what EPA is talking about doing is, these small refineries, they won’t have to blend the 100 million in my example, but we’re going to redistribute the obligation to blend to larger refineries which do not get a waiver, instead of losing the 100 million gallons in sales for biofuels that go straight to corn and soybean farmers.”

The group of governors said on this federal holiday, where we honor the strength, skill and determination of America's workers, that labor is on the front lines in the offshore wind industry, noting that these projects represent years of planning, billions of dollars in private investment, and the promise of tens of thousands of additional jobs, while revitalizing our ports, strengthening our supply chains and ensuring that America leads in clean energy manufacturing and innovation.

It was announced Friday that the Trump administration had withdrawn $11.25 million in federal funds previously awarded to the Port of Davisville at Quonset Point in North Kingstown and terminated $33.8 million for the Salem Wind Port Project in Massachusetts.

The governors said Monday they are reaffirming their unwavering support for working people and the unions that represent them.

""We stand with America’s workers and strongly urge the Trump Administration to keep these projects on track—for our jobs, our families, our competitiveness, our energy security, and our future,” their statement concluded.

Trump administration's latest steps against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states’ climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans’ livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022.

They spoke with one voice to defend offshore wind jobs and US energy future. Their words were direct, their call clear, and their demand firm. They asked the Trump Administration to honour existing offshore wind permits and keep the projects alive.

Governors unite on American Labor Day to defend offshore wind jobs and US energy future, new update is here, and the timing could not be more important. Offshore wind is more than turbines turning at sea. It is thousands of jobs, billions in investment, and America’s chance to lead in clean energy. The governors warned that cancelling permits now would harm workers, risk investment, and hand leadership to foreign competitors. They stressed that workers need certainty, not sudden reversals. Their statement underlined that the backbone of the clean energy shift is the strength of American labour.

Governors unite on American Labor Day to defend offshore wind jobs and US energy future, new update is here, and it signals hope. Offshore wind means revitalised ports, stronger supply chains, and secure energy. It means families supported by union jobs. It means America leading in innovation and energy independence. On Labor Day, the governors reaffirmed that commitment. They chose unity, they chose action, and they chose workers first.

On Labor Day, five U.S. governors issued a joint statement defending offshore wind. They stressed the critical role of workers, unions, and energy independence. They urged the Trump Administration to uphold existing offshore wind permits. Their warning was clear: cancelling projects would cost jobs, risk investment, and weaken America’s global leadership.

Offshore Wind Workers at the Heart of the Economy

The governors highlighted that more than 5,000 workers are already engaged in offshore wind. Many are union members building this new American industry. Thousands more across 40 states manufacture the products needed to support clean energy growth. Offshore wind is not only about turbines at sea. It is about revitalising ports, factories, and supply chains. These jobs are shaping America’s energy independence and future prosperity.

Billions in Investment and Years of Planning

The statement explained that offshore wind projects represent years of planning. They also involve billions of dollars in private investment. The projects promise tens of thousands of additional jobs. They are designed to strengthen U.S. supply chains and make America a leader in clean energy. The governors emphasised that all this progress risks collapse if existing permits are withdrawn. Cancelling would waste effort and squander billions already invested.

Warning Against Sudden Policy Reversals

The governors raised concerns about the Trump Administration reversing already granted offshore wind permits. They stressed that businesses, workers, and communities need certainty. Sudden reversals would cost tens of thousands of jobs and undermine investor confidence. Investors expect stability. If projects are cancelled at advanced stages, financing for future projects will become harder. The cost of higher interest rates would ultimately fall on taxpayers.

Offshore Wind as Part of a Strong Energy Mix

The statement noted that offshore wind is central to a reliable and resilient grid. But the governors also underlined the need for a diverse mix of resources. Nuclear power, natural gas, hydropower, and other technologies must complement offshore wind. Together they will keep the energy system strong and secure. This balanced approach will also help attract major development projects and transform communities across America.

The Global Competitiveness of U.S. Clean Energy

The governors argued that offshore wind represents more than jobs. It is also about international competitiveness. If the U.S. backs away from offshore wind, foreign rivals will take the lead in clean energy innovation. The governors warned that cancelling permits sends a message that America cannot be trusted to follow through. This weakens the country’s appeal to global investors. The long-term result could be the loss of leadership in a growing industry.

Ports and Supply Chains Revitalised by Wind Projects

The statement highlighted how offshore wind projects are revitalising American ports. Shipyards, logistics centres, and coastal towns are seeing new activity. Supply chains are being strengthened with parts and components sourced from across the country. These projects do not just bring clean energy. They also drive wider economic development and opportunities for communities that once depended on older industries.

Unions and Workers at the Core of Offshore Wind

The governors strongly supported union members working in the offshore wind sector. They stressed that the industry depends on skilled workers on construction sites, factories, ports, and power plants. Offshore wind is creating stable and well-paid union jobs. The governors reaffirmed their commitment to unions and recognised workers as the backbone of this transformation. Their message was clear: workers must remain at the heart of the clean energy transition.

The Stakes for American Families

The governors framed offshore wind as a direct issue for American families. The projects promise jobs, stable incomes, and stronger local economies. Cancelling them threatens livelihoods. It also risks leaving communities without opportunities in the growing energy sector. Offshore wind is not just about turbines at sea. It is about secure futures for families across 40 states and beyond.

A Call for Certainty and Stability

The joint statement pressed the Trump Administration to maintain certainty. The governors said markets rely on predictability. Reversing decisions once projects are near completion is dangerous. It tells investors that U.S. projects can be halted at any time. Such uncertainty would discourage investment not only in energy but in other sectors too. Stability is critical for long-term growth.

Governors’ Commitment to Reliable Energy

The governors promised to deliver energy systems that are reliable, resilient, and affordable. They said offshore wind and renewables are central to this vision. But they also reaffirmed their support for nuclear, natural gas, and hydropower. They stressed that a diverse energy mix is the best way to keep costs low and ensure security. Their approach is pragmatic: clean energy first, but backed by a full range of resources.

Transforming Communities Through Energy Projects

The governors pointed out that offshore wind and related projects are helping attract major development. These include factories, logistics centres, and technology companies. Communities are being transformed into hubs of the 21st-century economy. New industries are replacing older ones. Offshore wind is not just about energy—it is also about creating a modern economy that works for all Americans.

Energy Security as a National Priority

The statement tied offshore wind to national security. Dependence on foreign energy weakens America. By building domestic clean energy industries, the U.S. strengthens its independence. Offshore wind is part of this strategy. It ensures that America—not its competitors—leads in innovation and energy. Energy security is not just about lights staying on. It is about keeping the country competitive and strong on the global stage.

Labour Day as a Platform for Action

Issuing this statement on Labour Day was symbolic. The governors wanted to honour America’s workers by showing real support. They connected the holiday’s focus on strength and determination with the offshore wind sector. They reminded the nation that workers are not only the past of America’s success but also the future of its energy leadership. Labour Day became a call to action for protecting jobs and investment in clean energy.

The Future of Offshore Wind in the U.S.

The governors made it clear that they will continue pushing for offshore wind. They will work with the Trump Administration to advance projects that meet reliability, resilience, and affordability goals. Their joint commitment sends a powerful signal. Offshore wind is not a temporary trend. It is a central part of America’s future energy system. The governors see it as key to jobs, families, competitiveness, and security.

The joint Labour Day statement by Governors Hochul, Healey, Lamont, McKee, and Murphy was a strong defence of offshore wind. They warned that reversing permits would waste years of progress and billions in investment. They stressed that workers, unions, and families depend on these projects. They reminded the nation that America must lead, not follow, in clean energy. Their message was simple but powerful: keep offshore wind on track to secure jobs, energy independence, and a stronger future.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Labor_Day_2025_Compressed-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 16:01:27.121931

So, she emphasized the essential need to combine several approaches. “We have never…been in such a pivotal time, in conversation as we are now. Our demand is going up, our generation that we have online is going down. We have to have truly integrated, resourced plans. It’s got to be every single tool that we have at our disposal and it’s going to be a suite of lots of different options and energy efficiency is definitely a piece of that puzzle.”

Waldrip cautions that Arkansas leaders cannot afford to simply throw out some potential energy production strategies, like the green technologies of solar and wind power, for example.

As for those two coal-fired power plants, White Bluff Generating Plant is a coal-fired electrical energy generating plant operated by Entergy Arkansas. In 1980, the plant became the first of its kind to be built in the state. It’s located near Redfield, about 24 miles southeast of Little Rock, Ark., and is scheduled to shut down in 2028.

The other facility is known as the Independence Power Plant, located near Newark, Ark, 98 miles northeast of Little Rock. It too is coal-fired and owned by Entergy Arkansas. In fact, these closures were all part of a legal settlement finalized in 2021 between Entergy and environmental groups to stop burning coal. For the Independence facility, coal burning is scheduled to cease in 2030.

But Entergy just made headlines in early August, when the power company announced its plans to build a new power plant, to be known as the Jefferson Power Station, close to the White Bluff plant. Entergy officials describe the proposed facility as a 754-megawatt combined cycle combustion turbine (CCCT) plant, burning natural gas with the potential to power more than 355,000 homes. Right now, they say the process is in the public comment period. If the Louisiana Public Service Commission (PSC) approves the project, Entergy says the plant could be up and running by 2029.

Entergy also said it is studying the feasibility of extending the lives of the existing units by burning gas instead of coal and transforming that site into an energy center.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bc11616/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4592x2411+0+599/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fae%2F5a%2F4a83afa04e14923f4c8a5bb5767b%2Fwhitebluffpp.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 15:03:17.199910

In Q2 2025, its market share fell below 9%, a stark contrast to its earlier dominance [1]. This decline is not merely a statistical anomaly but a symptom of deeper structural challenges. Chinese automakers like BYD have seized the opportunity, capturing 10.7% of the battery-electric vehicle (BEV) segment in the same period [1]. BYD’s localized production, aggressive pricing, and expansion into plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs)—which accounted for 52.3% of EV sales growth in July 2025—have made it a formidable competitor [1]. Tesla’s reliance on pure BEVs, meanwhile, has left it exposed to shifting consumer preferences.

The erosion of Tesla’s market share is compounded by a reputational crisis. Elon Musk’s controversial political affiliations, including public support for far-right parties in Germany and the UK, have alienated European consumers. Surveys indicate a 60% drop in favorable sentiment toward the brand in key markets [3]. This backlash has translated into tangible sales losses: Tesla’s European sales plummeted 40% year-on-year in July 2025, while BYD’s registrations tripled [2]. The brand’s association with Musk’s polarizing views has created a cultural rift, particularly in Germany and the UK, where buyers increasingly view Tesla as a political statement rather than a product [4].

Strategically, Tesla’s response has been reactive rather than proactive. The launch of the high-margin Model Y Performance and lower-cost variants aims to reinvigorate its premium positioning [1], but these efforts face headwinds. Regulatory hurdles, such as rising tariffs on Chinese imports and expiring U.S. EV tax credits, further complicate its cost structure [4]. Meanwhile, European automakers like Volkswagen and BMW have surged ahead, with combined BEV and PHEV sales rising 157% in Q1 2025 [1]. This underscores Tesla’s inability to adapt to a market increasingly dominated by local players who understand regional preferences and regulatory landscapes.

For investors, the risks are clear. Tesla’s market share in the EU has fallen to 0.8%, its lowest since 2020 [4], while its overall European market share dropped from 2.4% to 1.6% in the first half of 2025 [5]. These figures signal a long-term erosion of competitive advantage. The company’s reliance on a single product strategy, coupled with reputational damage and regulatory pressures, raises questions about its ability to sustain profitability in Europe.

In conclusion, Tesla’s struggles in Europe are not just a regional setback but a warning for global investors. The EV market is evolving rapidly, and Tesla’s failure to address shifting consumer sentiment, regulatory dynamics, and competitive threats could undermine its long-term value. As Chinese automakers and European incumbents close the gap, the question is no longer whether Tesla will lose ground—but how quickly.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-01 15:01:02.566160

Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal sounded the alarm this week about Trump’s decision to halt construction on a New England offshore wind project that is nearly complete.
The project was scheduled to be completed next spring and was expected to provide 2.5% of the electricity in Connecticut.","Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont and governors of four nearby states issued a statement on Labor Day urging President Donald Trump to uphold all offshore wind permits.

“On Labor Day, we honor the strength, skill and determination of America’s workers. From construction sites and factories to ports and power plants, working people are the backbone of our economy and the foundation of our shared prosperity,” Lamont, along with Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, said in the statement.

“Nowhere is that clearer than in the offshore wind industry, where labor is on the front lines,” the statement continued. “Today, more than 5,000 workers — many of them proud union members — are directly engaged with building this new American industry, with many thousands more manufacturing products across 40 states that will help lead to a new era of U.S. energy independence.”

The governors are looking for the Trump Administration to uphold all of the offshore wind permits that were already granted and to allow the projects to be constructed.

“Efforts to walk back these commitments jeopardize hardworking families, wasting years of progress and ceding leadership to foreign competitors. Workers, businesses, and communities need certainty, not reversals that would cost tens of thousands of American jobs and critical investment,” the governors said. “Sudden reversals would also impact countless other workers and taxpayers on scores of non-energy public projects.

“The U.S. markets operate on certainty. Canceling projects that have already been fully permitted — including some near completion — sends the worrisome message to investors that the work can be stopped on a whim, which could lead them to decide to either not finance different projects or impose higher interest rates that would ultimately place a bigger burden on taxpayers,” the governors added.

Trump admin cancels $679 million for offshore wind projects as attacks on reeling industry continue

The governors stated that they remain committed to ensuring that the electric grid is “reliable, resilient and affordable.”

“Offshore wind and other renewables are central to that effort, but it must be complemented by a diverse mix of resources — including nuclear power, natural gas, hydropower, and other technologies — that together keep our system strong and our energy sources secure. Doing so will also help us attract major economic development projects that will offer economic security for American workers and transform communities as we move to a 21st century economy.”

The statement comes in the wake of the U.S. Department of Transportation canceling $679 million in federal funding for a dozen offshore wind projects.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases, according to the Associated Press.

Connecticut lawmakers including Lamont and U.S. Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal sounded the alarm this week about Trump’s decision to halt construction on a New England offshore wind project that is nearly complete.

CT lawmakers make case for continuing work on halted wind project, calling Trump decision ‘dumb’

The lawmakers and other stakeholders, joined by several union workers, were critical of the decision to halt the Revolution Wind project, which will cost the state “millions of dollars per week” as well as jobs and will cause higher energy prices, they said at a news conference in New London on Monday.

“Let’s get us back to work,” Lamont said at the press conference. “Let us get back to work. Look at these guys. Look at what they’ve been able to accomplish right here. Let’s get these turbines spinning. They’re all scheduled to go next year. That’s going to bring down the price of electricity for each and every one of you.”

The $4 billion wind farm off the coast of Connecticut and Rhode Island is 80% built. It’s a 65-turbine project and had already obtained permits through the Biden administration. The project was scheduled to be completed next spring and was expected to provide 2.5% of the electricity in Connecticut. The Trump administration said the project was halted for national security concerns.

CHINA, September 1, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Multiple Drivers Behind Residential Energy Storage Demand

In the context of global energy transition and growing power shortages, residential energy storage is shifting from a “backup option” to an essential household necessity. Rising electricity prices, frequent extreme weather events, and consumers’ pursuit of energy independence are driving residential energy storage systems to become a core force behind market growth.

For example, during the 2024 Texas snowstorm, households equipped with residential energy storage systems were unaffected by the large-scale blackouts. This self-sufficient energy model has become a crucial solution to grid instability.

Meanwhile, government policies are accelerating adoption. Subsidies and incentive programs in Europe, the U.S., Japan, and across Asia are propelling residential storage from a niche to a mainstream market faster than ever.

Global Market: Expanding Across Regions

Europe: Germany and Italy remain the largest markets. By the end of 2024, Germany’s residential storage installations exceeded 2GW, accounting for nearly 40% of Europe, with consumers motivated by both high electricity costs and energy independence.

North America: California leads with high energy prices and frequent outages, making it one of the fastest-growing regions. In 2024 alone, California added around 500MW of residential energy storage, a year-over-year growth of more than 60%.

Emerging Markets: Brazil faces weak grid infrastructure but sees stable growth with government support. Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines have rapidly rising energy demand that storage systems help relieve. In Africa, South Africa and Kenya are also actively deploying residential solar batteries to enhance household power stability.

Technology Acceleration Driving Affordability

Since 2010, lithium battery costs have dropped by more than 80%, while cycle life has improved from a few hundred to several thousand cycles. This shift has transformed home energy storage from a high-end product into an affordable, mainstream solution, fueling global adoption.

Industry Leaders Powering the Transition

The rapid rise of residential storage would not be possible without the support of professional manufacturers. GSL ENERGY, a global leader in lithium and LiFePO4 battery manufacturing, has been deeply engaged in the energy storage sector for over a decade, completing thousands of residential and C&I energy storage projects across Europe, the Americas, Africa, and Southeast Asia.

GSL ENERGY’s residential energy storage product line covers 5kWh to 30kWh wall-mounted and Powerwall series batteries, designed for safety, long cycle life, and seamless compatibility with global mainstream inverters.

Leveraging factory-direct supply and strong R&D capabilities, GSL ENERGY provides OEM/ODM/OBM services, offering a full value chain solution from battery cells to complete energy storage systems—helping households worldwide achieve energy independence and green living.

Outlook

The surging demand for residential energy storage is expanding the entire energy storage market. In the future, home batteries will no longer be just a backup source of power, but an essential system for energy security, cost savings, and sustainable low-carbon living.

With advancing technologies and maturing markets, residential storage is poised for even greater growth. Companies like GSL ENERGY, with reliable products and innovative solutions, are leading the way in making residential energy storage mainstream worldwide, while contributing to global energy transition and sustainable development.

The technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets.

The bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes.

It doesn’t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what’s known as scientific breakeven, and while it’s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound.

Founders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace.

Commonwealth Fusion Systems

Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) has raised about a third of all private capital invested in fusion companies to date. Its latest round, which closed in August, added $863 million to its coffers, bringing its total raised near $3 billion.

CFS’s Series B2 came four years after its $1.8 billion Series B, which helped catapult the company into the pole position. Since then, the startup has been hard at work in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels.

Sparc’s reactor is a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape, which, when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. Heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors.

The Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Sparc operational in late 2026 or early 2027. Later this decade, the company says it will begin construction on Arc, its commercial power plant that will produce 400 megawatts of electricity. The facility will be built near Richmond, Virginia, and Google has agreed to buy half its output.

CFS is backed by a long list of investors, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others.

TAE

Founded in 1998, TAE Technologies (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine.

The company raised $150 million in June from existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. TAE has raised $1.79 billion in total, according to PitchBook.

Helion

Of all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft.

Helion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma’s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor’s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine.

The company raised $425 million in January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group.

Pacific Fusion

Pacific Fusion burst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will use coordinated electromagnetic pulses. The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target.

The company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion’s funding might be massive, but the startup hasn’t gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that’s common in biotech.

Shine Technologies

Shine Technologies is taking a cautious — and possibly pragmatic — approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it’s starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn’t picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it’s developing necessary skills for when that time comes.

The company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.

General Fusion

Now its third decade, General Fusion has raised $462.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital.

In General Fusion’s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine.

General Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, it laid off 25% of its staff. CEO Greg Twinney penned an open letter pleading for funding from investors.

In August, they delivered somewhat, injecting $22 million in an pay-to-play round that one investor called “the least amount of capital possible” to keep the General Fusion afloat.

Tokamak Energy

Tokamak Energy takes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs.

The Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup’s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company’s magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy raised $125 million in November 2024 to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business.

In total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook.

Zap Energy

Zap Energy isn’t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine.

Like Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel.

Proxima Fusion

Most investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany.

Proxima Fusion is bucking the trend, though, having attracted a €130 million Series A that brings its total raised to more than €185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures.

Stellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist — literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma’s quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions.

Marvel Fusion

Marvel Fusion follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel fires powerful lasers at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry’s decades of experience.

The inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $161 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, HV Capital, and Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels.

First Light

First Light dropped its pursuit of fusion power in March 2025, pivoting instead to become a technology supplier to fusion startups and other companies. The startup had previously followed an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite.

First Light, which is based in Oxfordshire, U.K., has raised $140 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent.

Xcimer

Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple, Xcimer takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that’s behind the National Ignition Facility’s breakthrough net-positive experiment, and redesign the technology that underpins it from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF’s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage.

Founded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $109 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.

Workplace EV charging networks were expected to triple by 2030, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation.
Continuing to push forward on network expansion and function, along with improving price structures to reflect the benefits of midday energy use, would go a long way.
Charging EVs midday would be a huge step toward utilizing that power.","With more than 1.9 million electric vehicles registered across its roads, accounting for more than a third of all EVs nationwide, California leads the U.S. in convincing drivers to switch away from internal combustion engines. Yet despite this success, the state is still failing to make the most of this important transition.

The cheapest and cleanest time to charge an EV is when the power grid is flush with solar energy — that is, when the sun is high in the middle of the day. This makes electric cars quite different from conventional gas-powered vehicles, whose pollution levels aren’t affected by when a driver pulls into the corner station.

In fact, while switching from gas-powered vehicles to EVs charged overnight can cut emissions by 80%, daytime charging can actually slash emissions a further 80%. But convincing Californians to change habits and fill their batteries midday isn’t easy.

Most EV owners now have chargers at home and can conveniently replenish their vehicles’ energy stores overnight. With our current energy mix, that means these cars are largely powered by natural gas that fuels the grid when the sun isn’t shining.

At UC San Diego, I’m part of the team running the world’s largest scientific experiments on human behavior when it comes to charging EVs at the workplace, meeting drivers where many are parked midday.

UCSD has created a great opportunity to study this emerging field by building a massive charging network — 550 ports today, with plans for 1,200 total by early 2026. These ports are spread across 42 parking lots, located on campus and at satellite locations such as hospitals and coastal labs. Although the typical lot hosts around 10 EV ports, some parking structures have space for more than 100. These are all “Level 2” stations, typically three to five times as powerful as a regular outlet charger and capable of replenishing more than half of a typical EV’s battery during a workday charging session of at least four hours.

We’ve leveraged this living laboratory to test how information shapes habits. It turns out that describing the benefits of daytime charging can effectively shift driver behaviors — albeit slightly.

Bigger changes in behaviors will require stronger incentives and more opportunity to refill batteries away from home. The best incentive could be for utilities to price electricity based on the real costs to provide it. Today, retail prices for electricity mostly vary based on grid infrastructure costs — that’s why retail rates are cheapest overnight, when our transmission and distribution lines have lots of unused capacity. In contrast, wholesale prices — what your electricity provider might pay a power generator — already demonstrate that electricity used midday usually costs less to generate and transmit to consumers.

Workplace EV charging networks were expected to triple by 2030, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation. However, the current pullback of federal support for more public EV stations will mean even greater need to add workplace ports.

Policymakers also need to focus more on the quality of the networks we’re building, not just on the number of chargers we can install. California has started addressing this issue by setting reliability requirements for EV stations to qualify for subsidies, but monitoring and enforcement have lagged. Continuing to push forward on network expansion and function, along with improving price structures to reflect the benefits of midday energy use, would go a long way.

The scale of this challenge — and the opportunity it represents — is vast.

Last year, California squandered enough solar and wind energy to supply more than half of all the EV charging needed in the state. We simply couldn’t use or store it all at the time it was generated. Charging EVs midday would be a huge step toward utilizing that power. Using the cheap, clean energy we’re already generating is an obvious win to reduce costs and emissions, and supportive policy can help us adjust our habits to get there.

Meanwhile, European incumbents such as Volkswagen and Renault have leveraged localized production and regulatory familiarity to regain ground.
Tesla’s European market share now sits at 0.8%, compared to BYD’s 1.2% [5].
If the company cannot address its brand erosion and pricing misalignment, Europe could become a cash drain rather than a growth engine.
The question is whether Musk’s political entangments and the company’s regulatory hurdles will outpace its ability to innovate.","Tesla’s European electric vehicle market share has become a cautionary tale for investors. In July 2025, Tesla sold just 8,837 vehicles in Europe—a 40% year-over-year decline—while Chinese rival BYD registered 13,503 units, marking the first time a non-Western automaker outpaced the EV pioneer [1]. This collapse is not merely a statistical anomaly but a symptom of deeper structural challenges: surging competition, reputational damage, and a misaligned product strategy. For investors, the question is no longer whether Tesla is losing ground in Europe, but whether it can recover its footing—or if this is a harbinger of broader long-term risks.

The erosion of Tesla’s dominance began with a perfect storm. Chinese automakers like BYD have weaponized affordability and innovation. BYD’s Sealion 7 and other models undercut Tesla’s pricing by up to 40%, while its hybrid offerings tap into European markets still wary of pure EVs [2]. Meanwhile, European incumbents such as Volkswagen and Renault have leveraged localized production and regulatory familiarity to regain ground. But the most insidious threat has been reputational. A recent survey found that 60% of European consumers associate Tesla with Elon Musk’s far-right political affiliations, a sentiment that has directly translated into lost sales [3]. In Germany and the UK, Tesla’s sales plummeted by 55% and 60%, respectively, in July 2025 [4].

Tesla’s strategic responses have been reactive rather than proactive. The company slashed prices on the Model Y Long Range by 15% in late 2024, a move that briefly stabilized sales but failed to reverse the trend [1]. Rumors of a budget E41 model, priced below $30,000, suggest an attempt to broaden accessibility, but such a product would need to integrate Tesla’s core technologies (e.g., Supercharger access) to justify its premium over BYD’s offerings [2]. Regulatory delays in deploying Full Self-Driving (FSD) in Europe have further hampered Tesla’s ability to differentiate, as competitors like BYD and BMW now tout advanced driver-assist systems as standard [4].

Analysts remain divided on Tesla’s long-term prospects. Optimists point to upcoming product launches, such as the Optimus humanoid robot and AI advancements, as potential catalysts for a stock rally [2]. Pessimists, however, warn of compounding risks: expiring U.S. EV tax credits, rising tariffs on Chinese imports, and the growing influence of local automakers in Europe. A Morning Consult survey found Tesla’s net favorability in Europe and North America has dropped by over 30 points since early 2024, with affluent consumers—Tesla’s traditional base—now favoring brands like BMW and Polestar [3].

For investors, the stakes are high. Tesla’s European market share now sits at 0.8%, compared to BYD’s 1.2% [5]. If the company cannot address its brand erosion and pricing misalignment, Europe could become a cash drain rather than a growth engine. Yet Tesla’s history of reinvention—whether through the Model 3 production miracle or the FSD beta rollout—suggests it is not out of the game. The question is whether Musk’s political entangments and the company’s regulatory hurdles will outpace its ability to innovate.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-01 17:00:38.831270

PJM Interconnection, the nonprofit that manages the country’s largest electricity grid region, is barely known by the general public and almost never mentioned by elected officials — except when something bad happens.

Well, something bad has happened. For two years in a row, PJM’s process for ensuring the grid has sufficient power plant capacity has resulted in record high prices, which will get passed on to consumers. The results are tied to rising electricity demand for data centers and a bottleneck in approving grid connections for new projects.

Almost everything about these events is bound up in layers of complexity.

Energy bills likely to tick up again in 2026 after electricity auction clears at maximum price

To explain what’s happening, my colleague Rambo Talabong put together some charts and I spoke with energy policy experts. Together, we aim to make this situation understandable.

PJM, based in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, oversees the grid and electricity markets in a territory that stretches from New Jersey to Chicago. The organization has roots in a 1920s partnership between utilities in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

“It’s a bunch of utilities who have come together and said, ‘We can provide more reliable, less expensive electric service to customers if we work together and have a mutual aid pact,’” said Abe Silverman, an energy research scholar at Johns Hopkins University who has a background working in utility regulation and the energy industry.

“When a customer in New Jersey can buy power from a power plant in New Jersey, or a power plant in Pennsylvania or a power plant in Ohio, it’s going to be cheaper than if they were just buying from power plants from New Jersey,” Silverman said.

One of the ways PJM manages its system is by holding an auction in which power plant owners compete to see who will offer the lowest prices to be available to the grid at all times.

The result is a “capacity price,” which is the price set to ensure that there are enough resources to meet the region’s needs on the hottest days of summer. The price sets the level of payments to participating power plants, which is an important income source for them in addition to what they make from selling electricity.

Here are the results of the last decade of auctions, and you can see why electricity consumers are feeling the sting.

Last year, the auction produced a result so unusual that this topic, usually reserved for the business press, became general news. The new price, which took effect two months ago, was $269.92 per megawatt-day, an increase from $28.92 per megawatt-day in the previous delivery year.

The most recent auction was last month, yielding an even higher price, $329.17 per megawatt-day. This price will take effect next June.

Since a megawatt-day (which is 24 megawatt-hours) is a unit that most people don’t use or understand, it’s easier to put these results in terms of how many billions of dollars power plant owners stand to receive in aggregate. The change from two years ago is dizzying, going from a low of $2.2 billion to the most recent result of $16.1 billion.

Governors across PJM territory have voiced their displeasure. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, said, “What PJM has laid out is a slap in the face.”

Why did costs go up so much? There are many reasons, but the main one is that electricity demand is soaring, largely due to the development of data centers. The upward curve in PJM’s long-term forecast is in contrast to the prior decade-plus of flat growth.

“Supply and demand,” said Daniel Lockwood, a PJM spokesman, when asked about the reasons for rising costs. “Unprecedented and continuing growth in demand from the proliferation of high-demand data centers in the region.”

Silverman from Johns Hopkins agreed that this is, by far, the leading factor.

When demand is flat, old and inefficient power plants often struggle to compete, leading plant owners to close the plants that are losing money or barely profitable. Since 2000, PJM has seen a shift as coal-fired power plants reached the end of their lives and were replaced by natural gas plants and some renewables.

The retirement of old coal plants was good for the environment, but the rapid loss of those plants has helped to intensify the supply crunch that’s now happening.

But plant retirements are only part of the picture.

One of the reasons PJM is struggling to secure enough power plant capacity is the organization’s challenges in connecting new plants to the grid.

PJM has an online queue in which owners of prospective power plants get in line to gain approval to hook up to interstate power lines. Ideally, this would be a fast process, but the queue has turned into a quagmire of long waits, meaning the grid isn’t getting some of the new power plants that would otherwise be ready.

Most of the affected projects are solar arrays, the results of a solar boom across much of PJM territory.

Some caveats: Some of the projects in the queue are highly speculative and unlikely to get built, so the numbers can be misleading. Also, some projects are held back by more than just PJM, with challenges getting local permits and other factors.

As of June, there were 63 gigawatts of projects waiting in PJM’s interconnection process that should be completed by the end of 2026, according to Lockwood, the PJM spokesman. He noted that there are 46 gigawatts of projects that have agreements to plug into the grid today, but some aren’t being built because of factors beyond PJM’s control, such as siting, permitting and financing.

Clean energy and consumer advocates have said PJM often acts as an obstacle to reducing dependence on fossil fuels.

“The power grid operator’s policy decisions too often favor outdated, expensive power plants and needlessly block low-cost clean energy resources and battery projects from connecting to the grid and bringing down prices,” said Sarah Moskowitz, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Illinois, in a statement. “This extended price spike was preventable.”

Here are some of the wait times broken down by technology.

So, how much is a household’s electricity bill rising because of all this?

I asked several of the largest utilities in PJM for specifics. Their answers had wide variations, which helps to show differences in rate structures, state regulations and other factors that affect how and when the PJM charges reach consumers.

PSEG, the largest utility in New Jersey, notified customers in February of an impending 17 percent rate increase that was largely due to the rise in PJM charges. As of June, a household using 650 kilowatt-hours per month now paid $183, which was $27 more than before.

ComEd, which serves the Chicago area, has increased its residential bills by roughly 10 percent because of the surge in PJM charges that took effect in June. A typical household, which uses 609 kilowatt-hours per month, is paying $117, which is $11 more than before.

Dominion, which is the largest utility in Virginia and also has PJM customers in North Carolina, said its customers were largely insulated from PJM costs because the company gets most of its electricity from power plants that it owns. This is different from most large utilities in PJM, which do not directly own power plants and use market-based systems to obtain electricity for customers.

The total monthly cost for PJM capacity, even after the increase, would be less than $2 per month, according to a Dominion spokesman.

Just like PJM’s capacity prices have gone up, they can come back down. But for that to happen, some of the market fundamentals will need to change. I don’t expect that to happen any time soon.

So you’re probably going to keep hearing about PJM in the context of explanations for high electricity prices.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-101/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_7706-2048x1536-1-1024x7681756749942.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=XR3fBJ_H,N,,2025-09-01 16:02:46.494227

Tesla models were close to 22% of new car sales in August, with Volkswagen making up about 13%, according to the Norwegian Road Federation. Chinese manufacturer BYD more than tripled the number of cars it registered in the country last month, while Toyota and Volvo monthly sales were well below where they were a year earlier.

Norway became the first country to see EV brands overtake fossil-fuel models in new car registrations in 2020, a surge that was underpinned by incentives ranging from reduced tolls to no or lower value-added taxes. With such a high penetration of electric cars, producers have flocked to the market with about 170 electric-powered models to choose from.

“It will be interesting to see how this develops in relation to the classic brands that Norwegians have traditionally chosen,” the OFV’s Solberg Thorsen said Monday.

For banks, sustainability is a blueprint for staying relevant in a rapidly transforming world.
For banks, ESG is not just a branding exercise or political statement, but rather a strategic imperative.
The financial sector is undergoing a profound transformation as climate risk, regulatory pressure and shifting customer expectations redefine the operating environment.
At the same time, regulators around the world are demanding greater transparency and accountability in how firms address sustainability and long-term risk.","In today's dynamic banking environment, sustainability has emerged as a critical focus area for banks looking to meet evolving regulations and requirements across the globe. Once a quiet corner of corporate policy, environmental, social and governance, or ESG, initiatives have gained prominence, leading to discussions about their relevance and implementation. As banks navigate changing market conditions and look for ways to drive efficiency improvements, they face a more immediate and unyielding truth: Sustainability is no longer about optics. It's about survival. Climate risk, digital disruption, and shifting customer expectations are converging, forcing the industry to confront a sobering reality: Evolve or be eclipsed. For banks, sustainability is a blueprint for staying relevant in a rapidly transforming world.

It's essential to recognize that ESG considerations are often perceived differently across the spectrum of stakeholders. The practical challenges facing banks, from rising climate risk to resource volatility and digital disruption, demand a strategic response that transcends partisan lines. This has been made evident by the fact that companies are not dramatically changing their ESG policies despite the heightened rhetoric around the topic. A recent report from the Conference Board found that only 6% of companies are making significant changes to their ESG policies.

The reality is that banks are being pulled in multiple directions. Investors demand long-term stability, regulators push for transparency and customers expect purpose-driven brands. Ignoring ESG imperatives may appease one audience but alienate others critical to future growth. For banks, ESG is not just a branding exercise or political statement, but rather a strategic imperative. Sustainability is not a belief system but a set of tools and practices that will help banks survive the next decade.

The financial sector is undergoing a profound transformation as climate risk, regulatory pressure and shifting customer expectations redefine the operating environment. Physical threats from climate change now pose tangible risks to banking infrastructure and loan portfolios, forcing institutions to reconsider how they assess and manage exposure. At the same time, regulators around the world are demanding greater transparency and accountability in how firms address sustainability and long-term risk.

Adding to the pressure, fintechs and neobanks, unburdened by legacy systems and built on agile, cloud-native architectures, are setting new benchmarks for ESG alignment and digital-first customer experiences. As these challengers gain traction, traditional institutions face a critical inflection point. Without meaningful integration of sustainability into their core strategy, they risk not only falling behind but becoming irrelevant in a market that increasingly rewards purpose-driven, forward-looking players.

Banks today must treat sustainability as an adaptive, strategic journey, not just a compliance checkbox. Investors, regulators and customers now expect measurable progress, not just promises. In practice, this means embedding resilience into core operations. For example, banks that invest in climate-resilient infrastructure (from robust IT platforms to green buildings) can shield assets against severe weather and capture long-term value. The World Bank even estimates that every $1 trillion invested in resilient infrastructure yields roughly $4.2 trillion in benefits. In short, forward-looking banks are turning climate risk into an opportunity by setting clear adaptation metrics and funding sustainable projects, building robustness while unlocking new revenue streams.

At the same time, modernizing infrastructure is a sustainability enabler. Migrating legacy systems to cloud-based, modular platforms greatly improves efficiency and lowers energy use. Banks that have adopted cloud platforms report up to 60% cost savings over old systems, freeing capital for innovation and greener initiatives. Similarly, deploying energy-efficient hardware and real-time monitoring tools, from servers to branch equipment, can cut power demand sharply. In practice, this means moving workloads to cloud data centers powered increasingly by renewable energy and using low-power edge devices, while tracking carbon footprints continuously. Such digital transformation not only shrinks the physical and carbon footprint (for example, through paperless processes and smart energy management) but also builds the data foundation for robust ESG reporting and risk analysis.

Looking ahead, adaptive risk and portfolio management should be among banks' key strategic priorities. They should incorporate climate and ESG factors into credit approvals, stress tests and capital planning. For example, by assigning clear resilience and transition metrics to loans and investments. Leading banks find that proactively funding climate-resilient projects and monitoring extreme-weather scenarios help safeguard portfolios and tap new lending opportunities.

Banks should also prioritize technology and operational transformation, modernizing IT and branch networks to be lean and energy efficient. Migrating to cloud-native architectures can drastically cut IT energy and costs, while digital channels reduce the need for energy-intensive branch infrastructure. They can also deploy low-energy hardware and real-time monitoring to track usage, and shift workloads to greener data centers. These steps both shrink the bank's carbon footprint and improve agility in launching innovative financial services.

Another necessity is a focus on governance and culture change by embedding sustainability in corporate governance. Banks should establish clear ESG targets (aligned with frameworks like the U.N.'s sustainable development goals or climate accords) and tie them to executive performance. According to industry surveys, the vast majority of C-suite leaders now see no conflict between business success and social purpose. Banks should view this as a mandate: Align product development, lending criteria, and reporting processes with ESG goals, reward long-term outcomes, and transparently communicate progress.",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/292e44d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+284/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsource-media-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Ff9%2F19%2F1ce40dfe4df986c4453de5e40db6%2F386517090-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 14:01:40.048047

“Taking incentives away isn’t pushing things in the right direction.” Still, she thinks most of the impetus behind EV adoption has been market ­driven.
“I think we’ll continue to see people buying EVs.” History of perks In an effort to boost the adoption of EVs, Hawaii passed a law in 2012 that offered a smorgasbord of perks.
Power last year ranked Hawaii third, behind California and Washington, in EV adoption based on an index weighing consumer preferences and availability.
—As of July Source : DBEDT, Hawaii EV Association","For electric vehicle drivers in Hawaii, there will soon be few, if any, perks left—as some of the most popular ones are set to expire this month.

Solo drivers with EV license plates have since 2012 been permitted to use the high-occupancy vehicle lane on Oahu highways, which are usually reserved for cars with at least two occupants during rush hour to encourage carpooling.

On Sept. 30, a federal code allowing states to set their own HOV lane requirements expires, and federal tax credits of up to $7, 500 for the purchase or lease of EV vehicles also end.

These changes come at a time when Hawaii is being held accountable for its ambitious, state-mandated goals of achieving 100 % clean energy and net-zero emissions by 2045, and are expected to hamper efforts to get more residents to drive electric in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

“It definitely doesn’t help, ” said state Rep. Nicole Lowen, chair of the House Energy and Environmental Protection Committee. “Taking incentives away isn’t pushing things in the right direction.”

Still, she thinks most of the impetus behind EV adoption has been market ­driven.

The HOV lane perk may have been an incentive for some drivers commuting on the H-1 freeway to go electric, but even without it, EVs remain a competitive choice for consumers, she said, because they cost less to own and operate in the long run.

There are fewer maintenance costs, such as a regular oil changes, and no more waiting in line at the gas station.

“From a consumer point of view, there’s still a really strong case for it, ” she said. “I think we’ll continue to see people buying EVs.”

History of perks In an effort to boost the adoption of EVs, Hawaii passed a law in 2012 that offered a smorgasbord of perks.

EVs were not only allowed to use the HOV lane with only one occupant, but granted free parking at street parking meters, in state and county parking lots, and at airport parking lots.

Those privileges sunsetted on July 1, 2020, but the state Department of Transportation extended the HOV perk for EV drivers.

DOT says it is complying with federal law come Sept. 30, but will retain language written into Hawaii’s administration rules should states be able to make their own rules once again.

Additionally, car consumers will no longer be eligible for a $7, 500 in federal tax credits for the purchase of new EVs as a result of President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill ” adopted in July. Hawaii does not offer tax credits or rebates for the purchase of EVs.

The Electric Vehicle Association called the rollback of incentives a step in the wrong direction and “a lane change we can’t afford to make.”

EVA board member Elaine Borseth called the HOV lane perk “one of the simplest, most effective ways to encourage clean transportation, ” and said it’s still necessary, given that EV adoption is still in a critical growth phase.

“We’re on our way, but we’re not there yet, ” she said in a recent blog post. “Removing low-cost, high-impact incentives like HOV access risks slowing the momentum just when we need it most.”

EVs on the rise Noel Morin, president of the Hawaii EV Association, said it is unfortunate to see these barriers to adoption, especially as sales are gaining momentum in the state.

The perks and tax incentives appear to have spurred the growth of EVs in Hawaii, with year-over-year increases over the past five years.

In July 2021 there were 15, 551 registered EVs in Hawaii, which more than doubled to nearly 33, 000 by July 2024. As of July this year, the state counted 38, 086 registered EVs in Hawaii, a 16 % increase from 2024.

EVs now represent 3.5 % of the more than 1 million registered passenger vehicles in the state.

“If you look at the trajectory, more people are adopting EVs, ” Morin said. “As people upgrade, and rental car companies dispense of EVs, it also means you have a pre-owned market.”

The range of EV batteries has improved, and there are an expanding number of EV options to choose from in the U.S., including ones that start at lower price points from brands such as Nissan, Chevrolet and Hyundai.

Locally, the expanding pre-owned EV market also offers consumers more affordable EV choices.

The and Matson’s recent announcement that it will no longer ship EVs to Hawaii complicate the market outlook, but the days in which EVs were considered a rarity in Hawaii are over.

The Tesla Model Y, despite a drop in sales, is the third-most-popular vehicle in the state, according to Hawaii Auto Outlook, two notches below the Toyota Tacoma, which has long taken the top spot.

Hawaii also has been recognized as a top state in the U.S. for EV adoption.

J.D. Power last year ranked Hawaii third, behind California and Washington, in EV adoption based on an index weighing consumer preferences and availability. Hawaii was also among the top five EV markets, with EVs making up nearly 12 % of new vehicle sales in the state.

Achieving EV equity “We see an increase in EV registrations, so it’s steadily heading in the right direction, but obviously, not fast enough, ” said Jeff Mikulina of Climate Hawaii. “The timing is very unfortunate for these new changes.”

While perks help get people in the door, he said, Hawaii needs a clean transportation program that works for everyone.

“So I think it’s on the state, now, particularly with this, to really focus on equity and infrastructure, and making those take center stage, ” he said.

That means making EVs more accessible for families, renters, and rural communities, he said, and investing in more charging stations, particularly for multifamily units—and doing everything possible to make clean transportation “the default as opposed to a luxury.”

DOT released a of its plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as part of a settlement of a lawsuit – Navahine vs. DOT—filed by a group of young climate activists.

Public comments on the draft were due by the end of Sunday.

As a legislator, Lowen has introduced bills seeking to expand EV charging infrastructure, including one offering rebates for EV-ready parking stalls in new affordable housing developments.

Morin agreed much more needs to be done to accelerate the adoption of EVs in the state if Hawaii is to reach its clean-energy goals.

Hawaii consumes nearly 40 million gallons of gasoline and diesel each month, and gas and diesel vehicles still make up 93 % of all registered passenger vehicles in the state.

“It’s not just about EVs, ” Morin said. “It’s about sustainable transportation. It’s about efficient transportation.”

That includes expanding other options like public transit, biking, walking, and rideshares.

“We want to be independent of fossil fuel imports, ” Morin said. “We don’t want to be dependent on ships coming in to turn on our lights, transport our kids, or do our jobs. One way to do that is to achieve these goals.”

While it’s going to “take a little longer to make it happen, ” he said, it doesn’t change the urgency of those aspirations.

Education is still a part of it, and Hawaii EV is hosting events locally from Sept. 12 to Oct. 12 to raise awareness on the numerous benefits of electric cars, trucks, and motorcycles as part of National Drive Electric Month.

Mikulina said the timing of the federal cutbacks is unfortunate, but is nevertheless confident that market demand for EVs will not go away, as global trends show the future is electric.

“Really, I think the momentum is so strong to electrify transportation and for clean energy, ” said Mikulina, “that this is this is just a speed hump.”

The order follows a conditional approval granted in February 2025 and comes after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) cleared the siting, construction, and operation of the facility in June. DOE also reaffirmed its earlier study supporting LNG exports, citing economic and energy security benefits.

“Finalizing this authorization moves us closer to delivering more American LNG to the world, advancing President Trump’s energy dominance agenda,” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said. “Expanding America’s LNG export capacity bolsters our economy, strengthens the energy security of our allies and trading partners and ensures the U.S. can continue to lead the world in the production of affordable, reliable and secure energy.”

Tala Goudarzi, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, added: “We are glad to do our part in Commonwealth’s recent progress toward its final investment decision and look forward to its contribution to our nation’s success.”

Commonwealth LNG, owned by Kimmeridge, has signed long-term supply agreements with Malaysia’s PETRONAS, Glencore, and Japan’s JERA. The developer also recently awarded an engineering, procurement, and construction contract to Technip Energies.

The agency will host public hearings on its national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for coke ovens and integrated iron and steel manufacturing facilities.
The iron and steel hearing will be Sept. 3, and the coke ovens meeting will be Sept. 4.
Integrated iron and steel manufacturing facilities include any facility engaged in producing steel from refined iron ore, according to the EPA.
Northwest Indiana facilities are included in the rule updates, including U.S. Steel’s Gary Works facility and Cleveland-Cliffs’ Burns Harbor facility.","Northwest Indiana residents are expected to speak in two U.S. Environmental Protection Agency virtual hearings on Sept. 3 and 4.

The agency will host public hearings on its national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for coke ovens and integrated iron and steel manufacturing facilities. The iron and steel hearing will be Sept. 3, and the coke ovens meeting will be Sept. 4.

Both meetings will be from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.

On June 30, the EPA issued an interim final rule for national emission standards for integrated iron and steel manufacturing facilities, which revises all 2025 and 2026 compliance dates for standards to April 3, 2027, according to EPA documents.

Pollutants addressed by national emission standards for air pollutants include particulate matter, a criteria pollutant and multiple hazardous air pollutants, including mercury and acid gases, according to the EPA.

Integrated iron and steel manufacturing facilities include any facility engaged in producing steel from refined iron ore, according to the EPA.

The coke oven compliance deadlines would change from July 2025 to July 2027 if the interim final rule goes into effect, according to the EPA.

Northwest Indiana facilities are included in the rule updates, including U.S. Steel’s Gary Works facility and Cleveland-Cliffs’ Burns Harbor facility. The Indiana Harbor facility, which is operated by Cleveland-Cliffs and has a partnership with SunCoke Energy, is also included.

Cleveland-Cliffs and SunCoke did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement Friday, a U.S. Steel spokesperson said the Gary Works facility doesn’t have coke ovens, but coke is produced at the Mon Valley Works’ Clairton plant near Pittsburgh.

The statement said the steel industry must rely on and play by rules that are well-grounded in science and law to preserve American jobs and domestic steel production.

“These rules are supported by neither science nor law and would impose significant costs while setting technically unachievable standards,” the Friday statement said. “U.S. Steel is supportive of revisions to regulations that are within EPA’s statutory authority, based on sound science, and are technically feasible. Implementation of the existing rules would have provided little, if any, environmental benefit while significantly impacting American jobs and the nation’s critical infrastructure. Any delay in compliance deadlines does not change our continued commitment to environmental performance and safety.”

The EPA hearings come on the heels of a recently released Environmental Integrity Project report titled “The Steel Industry’s Hazardous Air Pollution,” which shows how the proposed delay or elimination of 2024 air pollution controls for the steel industry will impact public health.

The study included various Northwest Indiana plants, including the Cleveland-Cliffs/SunCoke Indiana Harbor East location in East Chicago; Cleveland-Cliff’s Indiana Harbor West in East Chicago; Cleveland-Cliff’s Burns Harbor location; and U.S. Steel’s Gary Works plant.

In 2023, 20 steel mills and coke plants nationwide emitted nearly 2.4 million pounds of air toxics, 289,722 tons of criteria air pollutants and 43.3 million metric tons of greenhouse gases, according to the study.

The EIP study claims that in 2022, an air monitor at Gary Works registered levels of chromium at the fenceline that were more than double the chronic health threshold identified in the report, according to Post-Tribune archives.

A U.S. Steel spokesperson previously said in a statement that the EPA concluded existing rules from 2003 for integrated iron and steelmaking facilities are “protective of human health and the environment with an ample margin of safety.” Gary Works and the company’s Mon Valley Works facilities have achieved a compliance rate exceeding 99%, according to the statement.

“The 2024 rules were not risk driven but were developed based on a misinterpretation and application of the Clean Air Act,” the previous statement said. “Environmental stewardship is a core value at U.S. Steel, and we remain committed to the safety of our communities as do our more than 3,400 Mon Valley Works employees, and more than 3,400 Gary Works employees.”

In 1990, the Heckathorn site was placed on a list of Superfund national priorities, which ranks sites on their threat of releasing hazardous substances and pollutants.
The EPA was brought in to oversee the cleanup and hold the responsible parties accountable for funding the work.
Following an investigation and feasibility study, the EPA will recommend a cleanup plan in a document called the Proposed Plan, she said.
EPA Superfund section supervisor Omer Shalev said they cannot speculate on any settlements that EPA will have with any parties for this next cleanup.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is returning to Richmond Harbor for a second attempt in a second century to remove toxic mud at the bottom of the Lauritzen Channel.

The channel was first contaminated from 1947 to 1966 by the United Heckathorn Company. According to the U.S. Department of the Interior, no chemicals were manufactured on site. Heckathorn received raw pesticides from manufacturers, ground them in open-air mills, mixed them with solvents and packaged them for use in liquid or powder form.

In 1990, the Heckathorn site was placed on a list of Superfund national priorities, which ranks sites on their threat of releasing hazardous substances and pollutants. The EPA was brought in to oversee the cleanup and hold the responsible parties accountable for funding the work.

The first cleanup in 1994 started with the removal of marine sediment and surface soil and ended with the placement of a concrete cap around the ground area to prevent erosion. This time, they will have the added challenge of protecting human health and the environment from contaminants as rising sea levels saturate groundwater, potentially leaching pollutants into the Bay.

In a virtual public information session this past Wednesday, EPA representatives answered questions and laid out the steps toward a new plan of action. The site is now used as an industrial shipping port. It veers off the main shipping channel, which is also used by private boat owners.

In a 1994 evaluative report, called a Record of Decision, the EPA described the harm: “United Heckathorn employees apparently routinely washed out equipment containing pesticide residues. The wash water was permitted to either run through drains that discharged to the Lauritzen Channel or to seep into the ground adjacent to the site.”

The company tried to use tanks to capture pesticide residues from wash water, but the tanks frequently overflowed, leaked and spilled, the report said.

The chemicals of concern that are still present are dieldrin and DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane). Both are no longer used in U.S. pesticides, and both were classified by the EPA as probable human carcinogens.

The 1994 remedy also included a deed restriction that limited the property to nonresidential use and a commitment from EPA to conduct five-year reviews as long as contamination remains at the site.

Upland OK, channel not

According to the EPA’s Heckathorn Superfund site, the most recent review in 2021 concluded that the cleanup of the upland area was sufficient for the protection of human health and the environment, but the marine area of the site was not “because concentrations of total DDT and dieldrin in sediment, surface water, and tissue samples of marine organisms in the Lauritzen Channel exceed remediation goals.”

That brought the whole process back to step one, said EPA community involvement coordinator Hiruni Jayasekera in Wednesday’s meeting.

Following an investigation and feasibility study, the EPA will recommend a cleanup plan in a document called the Proposed Plan, she said. Then the EPA provides the public with an opportunity to comment on the plan in writing or in person. The agency will share the Proposed Plan with the public this winter.

In preparation for the public comment period, the agency has been hosting monthly meetings, which will be followed by several in-person meetings and an informal open house.

Who will pay for this new clean-up effort? United Heckathorn went bankrupt in 1966, and the facility buildings had been cleared from the site by 1970, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior.

EPA remedial project manager Karen Jurist shared a list of 14 companies that were held financially responsible for the 1994 cleanup. Several of them have ceased to exist. Those still operating in Richmond include Levin Richmond Terminal Inc., which runs a deep-water terminal, and Parr-Richmond Terminal Company, an industrial railroad operator.

Also on the list is Stauffer Chemical Company, which was liable for the cleanup of another contaminated site in Richmond and was later owned by the Zeneca company.

EPA Superfund section supervisor Omer Shalev said they cannot speculate on any settlements that EPA will have with any parties for this next cleanup.

“That’s what this Superfund was designated for,” he said. “There is a federal tax on chemical and petroleum products that helps to pay for cleanup where there is no viable responsible party.”

Reliability of concrete cap questioned

The concrete slab meant to contain the tainted soil on the Heckathorn site is not fully enclosed on all sides. Cheryl Patel, field investigator for San Francisco Baykeeper, an environmental advocacy nonprofit, asked about the dependability of the concrete cap.

“Could water still move through the upland soil and become a leach material that releases into the Bay?” Patel said.

“There’s a pretty robust stormwater collection system in place that wasn’t part of the original cleanup,” said Jurist with the EPA. “It does happen to treat DDT and dieldrin from the stormwater collection system. There are also seeps and other outfalls that we’ve identified in our source identification studies that would need to be addressed and managed as part of our cleanup.”

“There’s a pretty robust stormwater collection system in place that wasn’t part of the original cleanup. It does happen to treat DDT and dieldrin from the stormwater collection system. …”

Karen Jurist, EPA remedial project manager

Community member Katie Rodriguez expressed concern that as sea levels rise with climate change, the ground becomes permanently saturated, increasing the potential for contaminated soil to mix with seawater and enter the Bay.

Jurist said that the EPA completed a climate vulnerability assessment in 2023 that looks at the long-term effectiveness of remedies and their resilience to climate change, including the rise of groundwater tables with sea level rise and how any proposed cleanup technology should address that.

The Climate Vulnerability Assessment will be the topic of the next public meeting on Sept. 24. The public can register online.",https://i0.wp.com/localnewsmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/LNM-20250829-HECKATHORNSITE-01.jpg?fit=2000%2C1421&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-01 14:01:43.367318

What Questions Remain About Lithium Recovery Technologies?","What Makes Lithium Recovery from EV Batteries So Important?

The rapid expansion of electric vehicle adoption is creating unprecedented demand for lithium, with global needs projected to increase 40-fold by 2040 according to the International Energy Agency. As millions of EV batteries approach their end-of-life cycle, recovering lithium has evolved from an environmental concern into a strategic economic opportunity that's reshaping the battery supply chain.

With the average electric vehicle battery containing between 5-10 kg of lithium materials, the cumulative value locked in spent batteries represents billions of dollars in recoverable resources. Traditional mining operations alone cannot sustainably meet this surging demand, especially as manufacturing capacity continues to outpace raw material availability.

Environmental considerations further elevate the importance of efficient recovery technologies. Primary lithium extraction requires between 500,000-750,000 liters of water per tonne of lithium produced in traditional evaporative operations, placing immense pressure on water resources in already vulnerable regions.

The recycling imperative extends beyond environmental considerations to supply chain resilience. Recent geopolitical tensions have highlighted vulnerabilities in critical mineral supply chains, with over 90% of global lithium processing currently concentrated in China. Advanced recovery technologies represent a pathway to greater resource security for Western economies investing heavily in electric transportation.

The Scale of the Challenge

Industry forecasts suggest that by 2030, over 12 million tonnes of EV batteries will reach end-of-life status globally. Without effective recycling pathways, this represents both a waste management crisis and a missed opportunity to recapture valuable materials that could support manufacturing tens of millions of new vehicles.

Battery manufacturers and automakers are increasingly viewing recycling not merely as a sustainability initiative but as a fundamental component of their business models. Companies like Tesla have developed in-house recycling capabilities specifically designed to recover lithium and other critical minerals from their own battery systems.

How Do Traditional Lithium Recovery Methods Work?

Conventional Pyrometallurgical Processes

Pyrometallurgical recycling represents the first generation of battery recycling technology, employing high-temperature smelting that typically operates between 1,400-1,500°C. This process effectively recovers cobalt, nickel, and copper but comes with significant drawbacks for lithium recovery.

The extreme temperatures create a metal alloy containing valuable cobalt and nickel, while lithium typically migrates to the slag waste. This inefficient transfer results in lithium recovery rates of merely 5-10%, essentially wasting this increasingly valuable resource.

The energy intensity of pyrometallurgical processes presents another significant concern. These operations typically consume 5,000-8,000 kWh per tonne of processed material, contributing substantially to the carbon footprint of what should be a sustainability-focused operation.

Emissions management adds further complexity, as the high voltage battery recycling of organic battery components generates potentially hazardous compounds that require sophisticated abatement systems to prevent environmental contamination.

Standard Hydrometallurgical Approaches

Conventional hydrometallurgical methods represent an evolution in battery recycling technology, using chemical leaching rather than extreme heat to extract metals from battery materials. These processes typically employ acid or base solutions to selectively dissolve target metals into solution.

The process generally involves mechanical preprocessing (crushing and grinding), followed by leaching with agents such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, or nitric acid. Subsequent separation stages use precipitation, solvent extraction, and ion exchange to isolate individual metals.

While more effective than pyrometallurgy for lithium recovery, standard hydrometallurgical methods still achieve only 30-50% lithium recovery rates. This limitation stems from inefficient leaching kinetics and solution management challenges that allow significant lithium losses throughout the multi-stage process.

Chemical consumption represents another drawback, with typical operations using 2-3 tonnes of reagents per tonne of battery material processed. This creates substantial waste management challenges and increases operational costs, particularly as reagent prices fluctuate with broader chemical market dynamics.

The wastewater generated requires extensive treatment before release, adding another layer of operational complexity and cost that has limited widespread commercial adoption despite the theoretical advantages over pyrometallurgical approaches.

What Breakthrough Technologies Are Transforming Lithium Recovery?

University of Wisconsin-Madison's Electrochemical Innovation

A research team led by Professor Kyoung-Shin Choi at the University of Wisconsin-Madison has developed a groundbreaking electrochemical technology specifically targeting lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries. This innovative approach operates at room temperature and demonstrates significantly higher lithium recovery rates than conventional methods.

The two-stage process begins with a controlled chemical pretreatment using minimal reagents, followed by an electrochemical separation that selectively extracts lithium ions without degrading other materials. This selectivity represents a fundamental advancement over traditional methods that struggle with LFP chemistry.

The technology has demonstrated success with both commercial batteries and recycling ""black mass"" – the mixed material output from battery shredding operations. This versatility positions the technology for integration into existing recycling infrastructure rather than requiring entirely new processing facilities.

Perhaps most importantly, the process operates at ambient temperature with significantly lower energy requirements than conventional alternatives. This reduces both operational costs and environmental impact while improving recovery economics.

The researchers have formed a startup venture to scale and commercialize the technology, with initial pilot testing scheduled to begin within the next 24 months. Several major battery manufacturers have expressed interest in the battery recycling breakthrough as they seek to comply with upcoming recycled content requirements.

Microbial Electrochemical Technology (BES)

Scientists at the University of Surrey have pioneered a bioelectrochemical system that leverages microbial activity to recover lithium from spent batteries. This novel approach combines biological processes with electrochemistry to achieve remarkable efficiency improvements over traditional methods.

The BES technology utilizes specialized microorganisms that can catalyze electrochemical reactions at significantly lower energy levels than conventional chemical approaches. This biological assistance enables the system to operate with minimal external energy input while maintaining high recovery rates.

Performance metrics for the BES technology demonstrate its potential:

Feature Performance Recovery Rate 90-95% Output Purity Battery-grade Environmental Impact Minimal chemical usage Energy Requirements 60-80% lower than conventional methods Applicability Works across multiple battery chemistries

The system's versatility across battery chemistries represents a significant advantage as manufacturers continue to evolve their formulations. Where conventional methods often require reconfiguration for different battery types, the BES approach maintains effectiveness across a spectrum of lithium-containing batteries.

The technology also produces fewer secondary waste streams than chemical-intensive approaches, reducing the overall environmental footprint of the recycling operation. This aligns with increasingly stringent regulatory requirements for waste management in recycling operations.

Advanced Solvent Extraction Processes

A collaboration between recycling firm cylib and chemical company Syensqo has yielded impressive results using proprietary solvent extraction technology specifically designed for battery material recovery. Their approach focuses on producing battery-grade lithium hydroxide directly from spent EV batteries.

The process employs CYANEX® 936P extractant, which demonstrates enhanced selectivity for lithium ions even in complex solutions containing multiple metallic elements. This selectivity reduces the number of purification steps required to achieve battery-grade output.

A key innovation in their approach is the ability to process multiple battery chemistries on a single production line. This flexibility eliminates the need for segregation by chemistry type, which has been a significant operational challenge for many recycling facilities.

The output quality meets or exceeds the stringent purity requirements for battery manufacturing, allowing direct reintegration into the battery production supply chain without intermediate processing. This closed-loop capability improves overall system economics while reducing transportation and handling requirements.

The technology has progressed beyond laboratory testing to pilot-scale operations, with commercial implementation scheduled within the next 18-24 months. Initial economic assessments suggest the process could achieve production costs competitive with primary lithium sources at scale.

Why Are LFP Batteries Particularly Challenging to Recycle?

Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries present unique recycling challenges that have accelerated innovation in recovery technologies. These batteries have gained significant market share in the EV sector, with manufacturers like Tesla and BYD increasingly adopting them for their cost advantages and improved safety profiles.

The fundamental recycling challenge with LFP batteries stems from their material composition. Unlike nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) chemistries that contain valuable metals like cobalt ($30,000-50,000/tonne) and nickel ($15,000-25,000/tonne), LFP batteries contain primarily iron and phosphate—materials with minimal recycling value (less than $500/tonne).

This composition creates challenging economics for traditional recycling operations. When lithium is the only economically significant recoverable component, representing 5-7% of the battery mass, conventional recycling methods struggle to generate viable returns. Pyrometallurgical processes are particularly ill-suited, as they typically lose most lithium to slag waste.

The material properties of LFP compounds further complicate recovery efforts. The strong chemical bonds between lithium, iron, and phosphate make the material highly stable—a beneficial safety feature during use but a significant challenge during recycling. These bonds require more aggressive leaching conditions than other battery types, increasing process complexity and cost.

Despite these challenges, LFP batteries continue gaining market share due to their lower production costs (approximately 30% less than NMC alternatives) and reduced supply chain risks from avoiding cobalt and nickel. This growing market presence has intensified the need for LFP-specific recycling solutions that can economically recover lithium despite the absence of other valuable metals.

How Will Regulatory Changes Impact Lithium Recovery?

European Union Battery Regulations

The EU has established the world's most comprehensive regulatory framework for battery recycling through Regulation 2023/1542, which entered into force in August 2023. This landmark legislation will fundamentally reshape recycling economics and drive technology adoption across the industry.

Starting in 2031, all new batteries sold in the EU must contain minimum percentages of recycled content: 6% for lithium, 16% for cobalt, and 6% for nickel by weight. These thresholds increase further in subsequent years, creating guaranteed market demand for recycled materials that will drive investment in advanced recovery technologies.

The regulation also establishes mandatory collection targets for end-of-life batteries, ensuring that recyclers have sufficient feedstock to achieve economies of scale. These targets include:

45% collection rate by 2023

65% collection rate by 2025

70% collection rate by 2030

Extended producer responsibility provisions place the recycling burden directly on manufacturers, who must ensure their products meet end-of-life management requirements. This creates financial incentives for automakers to invest in recycling partnerships and technologies that can efficiently recover their specific battery materials.

The legislation also mandates standardized labeling and documentation of recycled content, creating transparency throughout the supply chain. This will allow consumers and regulators to verify compliance while encouraging market competition based on circular economy performance.

North American Policy Development

While less comprehensive than the EU framework, North American regulations are evolving rapidly. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act includes provisions that incentivize domestic battery production and recycling through tax credits and grants, with $335 million specifically allocated for battery material recycling programs.

The U.S. Department of Energy's ReCell Center represents a coordinated research effort to develop cost-effective recycling technologies, with particular focus on direct lithium extraction methods that could preserve the higher-value crystalline structure of battery materials rather than breaking them down to elemental forms.

Canada's Critical Minerals Strategy similarly emphasizes battery recycling as a key component of supply chain security, with federal and provincial funding supporting technology development and implementation. The proximity of manufacturing facilities in Ontario to emerging U.S. battery production creates potential for integrated recycling networks.

What Economic Factors Drive Lithium Recovery Innovation?

Market Dynamics and Supply Chain Resilience

The economic case for lithium recovery has strengthened dramatically as market conditions evolve. Primary lithium prices have demonstrated significant volatility, ranging from $7,000 to over $80,000 per tonne between 2020 and 2023. This price uncertainty creates financial risk for battery manufacturers and automakers with long-term production commitments.

Supply chain vulnerabilities have become increasingly apparent, with geopolitical tensions affecting traditional lithium mining regions. China's dominance in processing (controlling over 60% of global lithium refining capacity) has prompted Western economies to seek alternative sources, with recycling representing a domestically controllable supply stream.

Production bottlenecks continue to impact market stability. Recent operational challenges in Chinese production facilities and technical issues in Chilean extraction operations have highlighted the fragility of the global supply network. These disruptions ripple through the supply chain, affecting battery production schedules and ultimately vehicle delivery timelines.

Investor interest in battery metals investment has accelerated in response to these conditions. Companies developing advanced recycling technologies have secured over $3 billion in funding since 2020, with particular emphasis on processes that can achieve battery-grade output quality without excessive energy or chemical inputs.

Manufacturing independence has become a strategic priority for many automakers. Companies like Volkswagen, GM, and Ford have established direct partnerships with recycling technology developers to secure priority access to recovered materials, viewing this as essential to their long-term competitive positioning in the EV market.

Economic Competitiveness of Recycling vs. Mining

The economic comparison between recycled and virgin lithium continues to evolve with technology improvements. Current advanced recovery methods can produce battery-grade lithium at approximately $10,000-15,000 per tonne, approaching cost parity with traditional mining operations in many market conditions.

This cost structure improves further when considering the holistic economics of integrated recycling operations that recover multiple materials simultaneously. When combined with cobalt and nickel recovery from NMC batteries, the overall system economics become increasingly favorable, with some operations projecting profitability even at lower lithium price points.

The capital intensity of recycling facilities presents a significant advantage over new mining operations. A world-scale lithium recycling facility with 50,000 tonnes annual capacity typically requires $100-150 million in capital investment, compared to $500-800 million for a comparable primary extraction operation, with substantially faster time-to-market.

Location economics further advantage recycling operations, which can be situated near battery manufacturing facilities to minimize transportation costs and supply chain complexity. This proximity creates logistical advantages while reducing the carbon footprint associated with material movement through the supply chain.

How Do These Technologies Compare in Performance?

The performance characteristics of different lithium recovery technologies vary significantly across key operational parameters. This comparison highlights the evolutionary improvements achieved through recent innovations:

Technology Recovery Rate Energy Requirements Chemical Usage Scalability Economic Viability Pyrometallurgical 5-10% Very High (5,000-8,000 kWh/t) Moderate High Low for lithium Conventional Hydrometallurgical 30-50% Moderate (1,000-2,000 kWh/t) High (2-3t reagents/t battery) Moderate Moderate Wisconsin-Madison Electrochemical 70-80%* Low (300-500 kWh/t) Low (0.5-1t reagents/t battery) Developing High potential Microbial Electrochemical (BES) 90-95% Very Low (200-300 kWh/t) Minimal (< 0.5t reagents/t battery) Developing High potential Advanced Solvent Extraction 80-90%* Moderate (800-1,200 kWh/t) Moderate (1-2t reagents/t battery) High High

*Estimated based on available research data

Each technology presents distinct advantages and challenges that influence its suitability for specific applications. Pyrometallurgical processes, while limited in lithium recovery, offer excellent throughput capacity and robust handling of mixed feedstocks. This makes them suitable for processing batteries where cobalt and nickel recovery drive economics rather than lithium.

Conventional hydrometallurgical approaches provide a middle-ground solution with moderate recovery rates and established commercial viability. These processes have proven effective at commercial scale but struggle with efficiency and environmental performance compared to newer alternatives.

The emerging technologies—electrochemical, microbial, and advanced solvent extraction—demonstrate promising performance improvements but remain at earlier commercialization stages. Their economic viability projections are based on pilot-scale operations and will require validation at commercial scale.

The choice between technologies increasingly depends on specific factors including:

Battery chemistry mix in the feedstock

Regional energy costs and environmental regulations

Output quality requirements

Integration with existing infrastructure

Capital availability and investment timeline

What Are the Next Steps for Lithium Recovery Technology?

Commercialization and Scaling Challenges

The path from laboratory success to industrial implementation involves several critical challenges that technology developers must navigate. Moving from lab-scale to commercial operations typically requires multiple scaling stages, with each introducing new technical and operational considerations.

Prototype development represents the first major hurdle, as promising laboratory results must be validated in continuous operation rather than batch testing. This transition often reveals unexpected challenges in material handling, process control, and equipment durability that weren't apparent at smaller scales.

Process optimization becomes increasingly important as scale increases. Parameters that work effectively in controlled laboratory environments may require significant adjustment when dealing with the variability of real-world battery feedstocks. This optimization process typically requires 12-24 months of operational experience to achieve stable, predictable performance.

Economic validation remains perhaps the most significant challenge. While theoretical cost models suggest promising economics, actual operational costs—including maintenance, labor, and quality control—can only be accurately assessed at scale. Many promising technologies have faltered at this stage when real-world economics didn't match projections.

Industry partnerships have emerged as a critical accelerator for commercialization. Collaborations between technology developers, battery manufacturers, and recycling operators provide complementary expertise and resources that can address technical and operational challenges more effectively than any single organization.

Regulatory compliance adds another layer of complexity, particularly for processes using novel chemicals or generating unique waste streams. Securing necessary permits and approvals can add 6-18 months to implementation timelines and may require process modifications to meet local environmental standards.

Infrastructure development represents a final hurdle, as many advanced technologies require specialized equipment and facilities. Building these capabilities requires significant capital investment before revenue generation begins, creating financial challenges that have limited the pace of technology deployment.

How Will These Technologies Impact the Global Lithium Supply Chain?

The successful implementation of advanced lithium recovery technologies will fundamentally reshape the battery material supply chain in several dimensions. Most immediately, these technologies will create a significant secondary supply stream that reduces dependency on primary lithium mining operations.

This evolution creates a more resilient supply network with greater geographical diversity. While primary lithium production remains concentrated in Australia, Chile, and China, recycling operations can be distributed globally near battery manufacturing and vehicle end-of-life locations, reducing vulnerability to regional disruptions.

The environmental footprint of battery production will improve substantially as recycled content increases. Primary lithium production—whether from hard rock mining or brine operations—carries significant environmental impacts, while advanced recycling technologies can recover materials with a fraction of the carbon and water footprint.

Price volatility may moderate as recycled supply grows as a percentage of total market volume. The relatively stable cost structure of recycling operations, less affected by resource nationalism or extraction challenges, could help stabilize lithium prices that have shown extreme volatility in recent years.

Regulatory compliance will become more manageable for manufacturers as recycling capacity expands. With the EU and other jurisdictions implementing mandatory recycled content requirements, established recovery channels will be essential for companies to maintain market access in key regions.

The ultimate impact may be accelerated electric vehicle adoption as supply chain constraints ease. Current material availability limitations have forced some manufacturers to delay production targets, but a robust recycling ecosystem could help alleviate these constraints while improving the overall sustainability proposition of electric mobility.

What Questions Remain About Lithium Recovery Technologies?

Key Research and Implementation Challenges

Despite significant progress, several critical questions remain unresolved regarding the future of lithium recovery technologies and their implementation at global scale.

The most pressing question involves scalability: Can these promising technologies maintain their performance advantages when processing millions of tonnes of batteries annually? Laboratory and pilot results don't always translate directly to industrial scale, particularly when dealing with the variability in battery condition, chemistry, and construction encountered in real-world recycling streams.

Chemistry evolution presents another significant uncertainty. Battery manufacturers continue developing new formulations to improve performance and reduce costs, with solid-state technologies potentially entering commercial production within the next decade. These evolving chemistries may require adapting recovery processes, potentially rendering some current technologies less effective.

Infrastructure requirements remain incompletely defined, particularly regarding collection and preprocessing systems. Even the most efficient recovery technology requires appropriate battery collection networks, testing facilities, and preprocessing capabilities to provide suitable feedstock. The investment required for this supporting infrastructure may exceed that of the core recovery technology itself.

Quality assurance for recovered materials represents an ongoing challenge. Battery manufacturing requires exceptionally pure materials with consistent performance characteristics. Ensuring that recycled lithium meets these stringent requirements across millions of production cycles will require sophisticated quality control systems not yet fully developed.

Policy evolution continues to create both opportunities and uncertainties. While current regulatory trends favor increased recycling, specific implementation details—including enforcement mechanisms, verification procedures, and potential trade barriers—remain in development and could significantly impact economic viability.

Sustainable Lithium: Building the Circular Battery Economy

The development of advanced lithium recovery technologies represents more than technological innovation—it signals a fundamental shift toward circular economy principles in what has historically been an extractive industry. These technologies are rapidly moving from theoretical concepts to commercial implementation, creating the foundation for a more sustainable electric mobility ecosystem.

The economic case for lithium recovery continues strengthening as technology improves and primary resource challenges intensify. What began as primarily an environmental initiative has evolved into a strategic business imperative for battery manufacturers and automakers seeking supply chain security and regulatory compliance.

The diversity of emerging technologies provides multiple pathways to address different battery chemistries, regional contexts, and scale requirements. This technological portfolio approach improves the resilience of the overall recycling ecosystem while accelerating innovation through healthy competition.

Continued investment in research and development remains essential to overcome remaining technical challenges, particularly regarding process efficiency, energy consumption, and output quality. Public-private partnerships have proven effective in accelerating these developments, with government funding helping bridge the gap between promising research and commercial viability.

As implementation expands, lithium recovery will increasingly shift from a technical challenge to an integrated component of the battery value chain—ensuring that today's electric vehicles become the resource mines for tomorrow's batteries in a truly circular economy approach to electrified transportation. Recent global lithium insights suggest this transformation is already well underway, with major industry players positioning themselves for a future where recycling becomes as important as mining in securing critical battery materials.

“‘Is it as solid as you say it is?’” It bears repeating that upward of 97 percent of climate experts agree that human-caused climate change is happening, but there are many areas of climate science that merit further study.","Should you be worried about climate change? The answer used to be debatable — literally.

Way back in 2007, NPR aired a debate over the proposition that “Global Warming Is Not a Crisis.” The panel had six commentators, divided equally into two sides. Those on the “not a crisis” side (which included Jurassic Park author and nonscientist Michael Crichton) argued that much of the current alarm was based on “ignorance.” Sure, the climate was changing, but that wasn’t anything new, they said. They weren’t convinced carbon dioxide was driving it this time around, either.

Those stuck arguing that global warming was not not a crisis — an awkward double negative — countered that the scientific community was in near-universal agreement that CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions were at fault. They laid out the dire consequences (rising seas, shrinking ice caps, warming oceans) and called on the audience to think of the planet their children and grandchildren would inherit.

Afterward, the conservative think tank The Heartland Institute declared that the climate “realists” had beaten the “alarmists.” Polling the audience, NPR found that 57 percent thought that global warming was a crisis before the debate, but only 42 percent did afterward. The results seemed to confirm the fears that participant Gavin Schmidt, a NASA climate scientist, had outlined on his blog ahead of the event. “Is this kind of rhetorical jousting useful for clarifying issues of science … ? Or does it just validate the least serious opposition?” he wrote.

In 2010, around the time when these kinds of debates were popular, almost half of Americans falsely believed there was a lot of disagreement among scientists that climate change was happening. Fast-forward to today, and the public’s understanding has evolved. More Americans acknowledge that scientists agree on climate change. People are also increasingly worried about the consequences: The intense floods, wildfires, and heat waves battering the country have sparked concern not only for the future, but for the present.

And yet the old way of discussing climate change — framing it as a debate — appears to be coming back into fashion, this time spurred by the federal government.

A new report from the Department of Energy, “A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate,” arrived in late July. “Climate change is a challenge — not a catastrophe,” Chris Wright, the Trump-appointed energy secretary, declared in the foreword. He wrote that the public conversation on climate change had “drifted from the science” because of exaggerated media coverage, potentially leading to “misguided policies based on fear.”

While the report acknowledged that yes, the planet is getting warmer, and yes, it’s caused by humans, it argued that these changes aren’t as bad as you think. It contended that carbon dioxide is good for plant growth, that computer models are overstating predictions of future warming, and that sea level rise isn’t accelerating. These conclusions were no surprise considering that the report’s five authors — John Christy, Judith Curry, Steve Koonin, Ross McKitrick, and Roy Spencer — have a long track record of pushing back against mainstream narratives about climate change.

Among those who care deeply about climate change, the report sounded alarm bells. Critics pointed to its use of selectively chosen data. A fact-check from the data journalism nonprofit Carbon Brief identified more than 100 cases of false or misleading claims in the 140-page document, with some researchers saying their cited work had been mischaracterized. Some scientists, led by Andrew Dessler at Texas A&M University, have begun organizing an academic response to the report.

“It is a shock to see the U.S. government, in an official document, deny scientific realities and spew so much disinformation,” said Rachel Cleetus, a senior policy director for climate and energy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

But getting scientists riled up might have been intentional. One of the report’s authors, Koonin, recently told E&E News that the expected pushback to the DOE report is part of a long-standing effort to create a “red team, blue team” exercise that could revive the “debate” over climate change.

“Red team, blue team” is a reference to an adversarial military exercise used to expose weaknesses. The idea, with roots in 19th-century Prussian war games, took off in the U.S. during the Cold War in the 1960s and has since become popular in cybersecurity. Companies will hire a “red” team to try to poke holes in their “blue” team’s digital defenses. These provocations help companies bolster their defenses against actual hackers.

The red team, blue team idea was floated by an EPA official during President Donald Trump’s first term as a way to challenge mainstream climate science. Before that, it had been raised by Spencer, another author on the 2025 report, as early as 2009. For a matter like climate change, however, a loud red-team attack has the effect of making the whole field look wobbly, split into two equally divided sides.

“It can really create perceptions of false equivalence in the public sphere,” said Max Boykoff, an environmental studies professor at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Matt Burgess, an environmental economist at the University of Wyoming, said that the context of the DOE report — the Trump administration’s broader assault on climate information — makes it hard to take it seriously. While the DOE report was underway, officials removed congressionally mandated climate reports on how climate change affects life in the United States from the federal website they lived on. The administration has also cut billions in funding for climate programs and research, and has proposed halting projects that monitor climate change.

On the same day the DOE report was released in July, the Environmental Protection Agency fired another shot at climate science, saying it would roll back the Obama-era finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health — the scientific foundation that allows the agency to address climate change. In its proposal to repeal this so-called “endangerment” finding, the EPA cited the new DOE report, and many have interpreted it as a pretext for the EPA’s announcement.

So the “blue team” pushed back. Two environmental groups, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists, filed a lawsuit against both agencies earlier this month, arguing that Wright had secretly arranged for five “hand-picked skeptics” to write a report challenging the scientific consensus on climate change. The lawsuit alleges that involving a “secret, unaccountable” group in policymaking concerns violated federal law. (The DOE did not respond to a request for comment for this story.)

But scientists may want to be careful in how they push back at the report, since arguing over fringe viewpoints may have the effect of amplifying them, falling into the same trap created by the climate debates of 20 years ago. One study from 2023 found that disinformation about climate change was more emotionally compelling and persuasive to people than scientific facts. To Cleetus, the government’s revival of the climate “debate” is a distraction from the task at hand. “We’re losing precious, precious time to help stave off these terrible impacts of climate change,” Cleetus said. “And I don’t know what we will say to our children and grandchildren, that this is what we wasted our time on.”

Much of the polarization around climate change appears to stem from disagreements over what to do about it. In recent years, many advocates have justified faster action — more regulations, fewer fossil fuels, and more green technology — by appealing to “science.” The Biden administration even enshrined “listen to science” as its official policy. But while science can inform policy decisions, it doesn’t answer the question of how to navigate the complex moral and cultural issues that come with reimagining life after fossil fuels.

The political left has used the science-has-all-the-answers framing to shut down important conversations about real trade-offs, said Travis Fisher, who helped organize the DOE report. He is also the director of energy and environmental policy at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. He says that by using “the science” as justification to push through controversial policies, it invites skepticism in science as an objective force.

“There’s only so many times you can get hit with that, like, trademark ‘science’ club before you start saying, ‘Hey, what’s actually in that club that you have?’” Fisher said. “‘Is it as solid as you say it is?’”

It bears repeating that upward of 97 percent of climate experts agree that human-caused climate change is happening, but there are many areas of climate science that merit further study. For example, the question of whether climate change affects tornadoes (not yet clear) or just how quickly and strongly CO2 emissions will drive global warming in the future. (The DOE report argues that the planet is less sensitive to CO2 than commonly believed, while scientist James Hansen argues that it’s actually more sensitive.) Science is always evolving as new evidence comes in, and it takes many studies to create a sufficient body of evidence before a causal argument can be accepted.

Take that famous 97 percent stat from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, for example. According to the organization, it came from “not just … a single study, but by a converging stream of evidence over the past two decades from surveys of scientists, content analyses of peer-reviewed studies, and public statements issued by virtually every membership organization of experts in this field.”

To Burgess, the environmental economist, the messy context around the DOE report represents a missed opportunity — particularly because he thinks the critics make some good points. There are certain narratives, especially around the severity of climate impacts, he said, “that are underappreciated in the mainstream discourse.”

But the solution, Burgess said, isn’t war-room style debates — it’s open, transparent collaboration between what might be described as the “blue team” and “red team.” As an example of a way to encourage thoughtful engagement, he pointed to the University of Pennsylvania’s Adversarial Collaboration Project, which encourages scholars who disagree to work together to resolve polarizing scientific disputes.

“We do ourselves and the community a favor when we dispassionately try to, through things like adversarial collaboration, get to the bottom of genuine scholarly debates about how to interpret facts,” Burgess said. “Even if we don’t like the people who interpret the facts differently than we do.”

Wright has hinted that the DOE’s report, which is open to the public to comment, may just be the start of the administration’s move to stir up debate over climate change. “We’ll probably have public events here in D.C. this fall,” he said in an interview with CNN earlier this month. “We want to have an honest dialogue with the American people about climate change.”

Burgess interprets the whole episode around report differently. “I think it’s just basically another opportunity for people to yell at each other online and go back to their silos,” he said.

Senate GOP leaders are staring down a lengthy to-do list of priorities that will force them into a delicate balancing act, including funding the government and changing the rules to expeditiously confirm President Trump’s nominees.

The upper chamber reconvenes on Tuesday following the month-long August break and is set to hit the ground running with only weeks between their return and a potential government shutdown.

But amid bipartisan priorities including government funding and getting the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) ready for prime time, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) will also be forced to juggle a series of thorny political items. Those are headlined by the GOP’s effort to change the rules to confirm more of President Trump’s nominees, chaos at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the White House decision to issue a “pocket rescission,” which tossed a major wrench into the funding wars of the coming weeks.

“He’s going to have a full plate,” one Senate Republican told The Hill.

Democratic leaders on Thursday called on Thune and Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) to hold a “four corners” meeting immediately when Congress returns, which will be exactly four weeks before the funding deadline.

Republicans in March were able to back Democrats into a corner to pass a government funding package for the remainder of the fiscal year, but the minority party has vowed that there will be no repeat this time around.

“The Sept. 30th funding deadline will be upon us shortly. It is therefore imperative that we immediately meet upon our return to Congress next week to discuss the need to avert a painful, unnecessary lapse in government funding and to address the healthcare crisis Republicans have triggered in America,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) wrote.

But any hopes for progress took a major hit late last week when the White House announced an attempt to claw back $4.9 billion in foreign aid funds without congressional approval, drawing the ire of Democrats and appropriators and increasing the chances of a shutdown.

Such a move had not been made in nearly a half-century, and it is expected to face legal challenges. It also comes two months after GOP lawmakers approved the first rescissions package worth $9 billion that targeted global aid programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

“I was feeling good about where we were [on a spending deal]. I don’t feel good after this morning,” one Senate GOP aide told The Hill shortly after the rescissions package was revealed.

Schumer wasted little time lambasting the move, arguing that Trump and GOP lawmakers don’t have “any plan to avoid a painful and entirely unnecessary shutdown.” He added that Thune and Johnson have “repeatedly refused” to meet with Democrats to discuss a “bipartisan path forward.”

“In fact, it seems Republicans are eager to inflict further pain on the American people, raising their health care costs, compromising essential services and further damaging our national security,” the Democratic leader said. “[I]f Republicans are insistent on going it alone, Democrats won’t be party to their destruction.”

Both sides are expecting to pass a stopgap spending bill in order to keep the government’s lights on as both chambers still have a ways to go before wrapping up work on a full-year funding package.

Senators passed only three of the 12 annual appropriations bills so far in one of their final actions before recess. The House has passed two. And the chambers’ bills differ sharply.

Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) also made her opposition clear to the rescissions play, saying in a statement that the action is “unlawful” while underscoring the worries about a shutdown in the process.

“Any effort to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval is a clear violation of the law. “Instead of this attempt to undermine the law, the appropriate way is to identify ways to reduce excessive spending through the bipartisan, annual appropriations process,” Collins said. “Congress approves rescissions regularly as part of this process. In fact, the year-long funding bill that we are currently operating under includes 70 rescissions. … The annual funding bill is the most appropriate way to ensure that any rescissions reflect the views of Congress.”

Further complicating the spending effort is the calendar. All of Congress will be in recess the final full week of September in observance of the start of the Jewish high holidays, nixing a key stretch for work on Capitol Hill days before the Sept. 30 deadline.

Alongside the funding battle, the immediate concern for the Senate GOP is processing scores of Trump nominees to fill out various departments and agencies, with a change in the chamber’s rules likely on deck for them to do so.

Republicans were angry when they departed for the August break without a bipartisan deal to greenlight potentially dozens of nominees in bloc, with Thune and rank-and-file members being quick to mention that none of his choices have been advanced via a voice vote or unanimous consent. Only one of Trump’s nominees — Secretary of State Marco Rubio — did not face a full filibuster.

This has led GOP members to beat the drums louder for a possible rules change that would allow them to expedite the passage of nominees, including lowering the debate time for lower-level selections down from two hours to 15 minutes or eliminating the cloture vote in whole, among other things.

“We’re trying to figure this out. The last 20 years, it’s getting worse every session,” Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla) recently told reporters at the Capitol.

Lankford and Sen. Katie Britt (R-Ala.) are leading a working group of a half-dozen members to “explore the menu of options,” be it an internal quick fix or something more long-term that Democrats could potentially get behind.

“It’s intolerable,” Lankford said. “Whether you’re a Republican [or] Democrat president, we’ve got to figure out how the president actually gets confirmed nominees.”

In positive news, the process to pass the NDAA remains on track, with both chambers set to vote on it in the coming weeks and a conference process expected to commence in the ensuing weeks.

There are other items that aren’t likely to be priorities, but very much could be on the docket at some point during their first month back.

Republicans have waited on a green light from Trump to put a bipartisan Russia sanctions package on the floor, but pressure could heighten after Moscow fired a series of missiles at Kyiv on Thursday, with Russian President Vladimir Putin showing few signs of being ready to end the war.

“India, China, Brazil and others who prop up Putin’s war machine by buying cheap Russian oil: How do you feel right now that your purchases have resulted in innocent civilians, including children, being killed?” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a lead sponsor of the proposal, posted on X after the attacks on Kyiv.

The package would levy a 500 percent tariff on imports on those countries for their continued purchase of Russian uranium, gas and oil.

The fast-food chain, in partnership with Quebec-based charging station manufacturer Flo, plans to install some 400 chargers at 100 locations across the country by the end of 2028. Chargers will be installed in all 10 provinces. The first ones have already been installed and are operational in Regina, Saskatchewan.

For the rollout of the other chargers, work will be completed at 13 more restaurants by the end of this year and at 50 by the end of 2026. Each participating restaurant will have an average of four charging stations for customer use.

Hope Bagozzi, Chief Marketing Officer at Tim Hortons, said in a statement that the deployment of approximately 400 chargers will make the company “the largest restaurant provider of EV fast charging in Canada.”

The chargers being installed are Flo Ultra models, capable of providing up to 120 km (75 miles) of range in just 10 minutes.

“This partnership with Tim Hortons marks a pivotal moment in making EV charging a seamless part of everyday life for Canadians. By investing ourselves in the installation of FLO Ultra chargers at trusted, well-visited locations, we are accelerating our strategic focus as an Own and Operate charging network operator and delivering the reliable infrastructure EV drivers need to confidently embrace their transition to electric mobility,” said Louis Tremblay, CEO of Flo.

As reported by Automotive News, these new installations are part of the partnership between Flo and the Canada Infrastructure Bank, which has committed $235 million to Flo to enable the commissioning of more than 1,900 public fast-charging stations across Canada.

Growing need for chargers

Though progress has been made on this front, Canada needs a greater number of fast-charging stations. It’s estimated that to meet its EV sales targets, Canada needs 100,520 chargers. According to the analytics firm Dunsky Energy + Climate, there are currently just over 35,000 fast chargers in operation across the provinces and territories.

The shortage of charging infrastructure in Canada has long been a concern for automakers, who are mandated by the federal government to increase EV sales.

Brian Kingston, head of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, which represents the interests of the three Detroit automakers in Canada, has stated that the funding and number of charging stations are insufficient.

Earlier this year, he acknowledged that there is “a large and growing deficit in public charging infrastructure in Canada, which requires the installation of 40,000 chargers annually to be filled.”

As voices across the auto industry call for an easing of the current rules regarding the ban on gasoline vehicle sales in Canada, set for 2035, many will be watching to see how fast the EV charging network can be expanded.",http://picolio.auto123.com/auto123-media/articles/2025/9/73146/flo-tim-hortons-002fr.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 13:03:34.053957

While there are plenty of options in the performance EV segment, these are some of the most notable options.
In the same way high power in gasoline engines comes with a trade-off in low fuel economy, many performance EVs produce high performance to the detriment of range.","Nowadays, the fastest cars on the road might not be powered by gas-guzzling V8s or twin-turbo V6s. For adrenaline junkies seeking to take off as fast as possible from a red light, an electric vehicle might be the best choice for top speed.

And automakers have begun filling the market with sporty, performance-first EVs to satisfy speed demons. Plenty of brands — from long-standing, recognizable nameplates to EV startups — now offer electrified rides catered toward drivers who want a vehicle that can push some serious power, while relishing in the benefits of driving an electric vehicle.

Why opt for a performance EV?

The biggest appeal to drivers seeking high performance is that electric vehicles are now some of the fastest vehicles on the road.

The reason for such speed? Instant torque.

EVs can immediately push peak power to the wheels and therefore accelerate faster than their gas-powered counterparts. Even the most powerful internal combustion engines require time for valves to fire and gas to burn to make use of all the power.

EVs, on the other hand, get up and go the second you press the gas — er, electricity? — pedal.

Along with the thrill of more power, EV ownership is becoming easier. In the U.S., electric vehicle infrastructure has made it plausible to take EVs long distances. If you compound more access to charging stations with engineers scrambling to pull every mile of range possible out of battery motors, and an EV is becoming a reasonable choice.

What are some notable performance EVs?

While there are plenty of options in the performance EV segment, these are some of the most notable options.

2026 Porsche Taycan Turbo S Cross Turismo (Price: $178,295, Horsepower: 871, Range: 270 miles)

What are the downsides of owning a performance EV?

High performance comes at a cost. In the same way high power in gasoline engines comes with a trade-off in low fuel economy, many performance EVs produce high performance to the detriment of range.

Further, EVs are generally more expensive than vehicles with a traditional powertrain at any level of performance, and the higher performance makes and models certainly demand a pretty penny.","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/31/USNK/85923403007-20250424-t-124333-z-902937568-rc-274-eadr-0-pm-rtrmadp-3-autoshowchina-1.JPG?crop=5499,3094,x0,y286&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-01 13:03:38.489260

That’s exactly what an American company intends to do, uniting two trends shaping the 21st century: the race for AI and the search for large-scale sustainable energy. The focus here is on abundant, cheap, and constant energy, which will allow AI not only to exist but to flourish.

A desert megaproject aiming to power the birth of AGI

The project’s ambition has been clear from the outset. So much so that the first phase, scheduled for 2026, will feature 300 MW of power and 1 million square feet of space. Essentially, it’s like building an entire city dedicated solely to machines that learn, process, and train artificial intelligence models. But that’s just the beginning.

This project, named Data City, has a long-term vision and aims for 5 GW of total power and over 15 million square feet of built area. To put it in perspective, this capacity is greater than that of many countries in their electricity grids. It’s not just about infrastructure: it’s about scaling the impossible. Now, where will all this begin? Right in the Texas desert, where space, sun, and wind create the perfect setting for transforming ambition into reality.

Beyond the grid: how Data City plans to fuel AI with its own green power

A technical term constantly appears in this project: behind-the-meter. But what does this mean in practice? Basically, instead of relying on the traditional power grid, shared by millions of consumers, Data City generates its own energy on-site. It’s like having a dedicated power plant, dedicated entirely to data centers. This brings three crucial advantages:

Reliability — continuous power, without competing with urban demand.

Planned scale — gigawatts are tailored to AI needs.

Predictable costs — less volatility and more security for so-called hyperscalers.

This will be a transition from gas to hydrogen, which, in the short term, will begin with natural gas produced in Texas, ensuring stability. And, in the medium term: the bet is bold: we’re talking about migrating entirely to green hydrogen (which, if green in America, already has a blue hydrogen in Europe), stored in underground salt caverns in the neighboring Hydrogen City project, scheduled for 2028.

Texas reinvents itself

Remembering that Texas was once synonymous with oil and gas, today it’s beginning to write a new chapter: that of a global clean energy hub for cloud computing. In fact, here are some initiatives that only reaffirm this role:

Corpus Christi: Energy Abundance’s own green energy hub, with an estimated annual production of 280,000 tons of hydrogen and 1 million tons of green ammonia (operation starting in 2029).

Last Energy: Plans to install 30 micro-nuclear reactors in Haskell County, responding to the explosion in demand from data centers.

Goal (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp): Contract with Spanish company Zelestra to enable 595 MW of solar energy in the state alone.

This all becomes important because AI feeds not only on data, but also on energy. In other words, every advance in generative models, every click on a more “intelligent” search, depends on a massive volume of electricity. Concentrating this infrastructure in dedicated projects, like Data City, means growth without overloading the national electricity system. This also reminds us of the first AI wind turbine triple power yield.

“Building behind-the-meter is the path to energy abundance—a cornerstone of this landmark project. It’s an honor to lead a quintessentially American and Texas endeavor that will power the AI revolution and pave the way to an energy-abundant future,” Maxwell said.

The United Arab Emirates leads the sector, capturing nearly 47% of 2024 revenue, followed closely by Saudi Arabia. Both countries are leveraging large-scale incineration and gasification facilities to convert municipal solid waste into electricity and heat while advancing their circular economy strategies.

Technology Dominance and Project Benchmarks

Thermal technologies accounted for nearly 95% of the market in 2024, reflecting the region’s reliance on large-scale incineration, pyrolysis, and gasification. Flagship projects include Dubai’s 200 MW Waste-to-Energy plant and Sharjah’s Bath–Masdar facility, both designed to reduce landfill dependency and support national sustainability policies.

In February 2025, BEEAH Energy and Masdar announced plans to expand the Sharjah plant’s capacity from 300,000 to 450,000 tons annually, boosting renewable electricity generation to 45 MW.

“This expansion demonstrates the UAE’s leadership in sustainable waste management and renewable energy adoption,” said a joint statement from BEEAH Energy and Masdar.

Country Insights: UAE and Saudi Arabia at the Forefront

The UAE’s commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050 has made it a hub for WtE deployment, with projects integrated into district heating, desalination, and smart grid systems. Saudi Arabia, under Vision 2030, is scaling WtE capacity through competitive bidding led by its Renewable Energy Project Development Office. Developments in Riyadh, Jeddah, and Makkah, as well as mega-projects like NEOM, position the Kingdom as a major growth driver.

Oman, Qatar, and Kuwait are also advancing. Oman’s Muscat WtE project and Qatar’s Domestic Solid Waste Management Centre combine incineration with recycling, while Kuwait’s Kabd facility is set to become one of the largest in the region.

Drivers and Barriers

Urbanization, rising waste volumes, and strong government policies are the core growth drivers. However, high capital costs, long project timelines, and emissions control requirements remain significant barriers. Integrating waste segregation and advanced flue gas treatment is critical to ensuring environmental compliance.

Key Players and Regional Competition

Leading companies include Tadweer Group, Bee’ah, Masdar, Veolia, Suez, Averda, and BESIX.

Conclusion: A Compelling Long-Term Investment Johnson Controls’ strategic shift toward recurring revenue, coupled with margin expansion and a robust backlog, positions it as a resilient player in the energy-efficient building sector.","Johnson Controls International (JCI) has emerged as a standout performer in the energy-efficient building sector, with its Q2 2025 earnings underscoring a strategic pivot toward high-margin, recurring revenue streams. The company reported a 7% year-over-year increase in organic sales, driven by robust demand for its OpenBlue smart building platform and service offerings, while net income surged to $478 million—a stark contrast to the $277 million loss in the prior-year period [1]. This transformation reflects JCI’s alignment with the global shift toward sustainability and operational efficiency, positioning it to capitalize on long-term tailwinds in the sector.

Historical data on JCI’s earnings performance reveals a nuanced picture. A backtest of 84 instances where JCI beat earnings expectations from 2022 to 2025 shows that while the stock typically reacts positively in the short term (average +0.07% on the day of the beat), this outperformance tends to erode over time. By the 30-day mark, JCI underperformed the S&P 500 by -1.15% compared to the benchmark’s +1.87% gain. The win rate for holding the stock after an earnings beat also declines from 56% at day 2 to 34% by day 30. These findings suggest that while JCI’s strong earnings can drive initial optimism, long-term outperformance may require broader market or sector tailwinds beyond transient earnings surprises.

Margin Expansion and Organic Growth: A Foundation for Resilience

JCI’s Q2 results highlight its ability to expand margins despite macroeconomic headwinds. The Global Products segment, for instance, achieved a 30.1% EBITA margin—a 780-basis-point improvement year-over-year—despite a 13% sales decline due to divestitures [2]. This margin resilience stems from disciplined cost management and a focus on high-margin service contracts, which now account for 40% of revenue and are projected to reach 60–70% in the coming years [3]. The company’s Building Solutions backlog of $14.0 billion, up 12% organically, further reinforces its visibility into future cash flows, with recurring service revenue growing 7% quarter-over-quarter [4].

The strategic emphasis on recurring revenue is paying dividends. JCI’s OpenBlue platform, which integrates AI-driven energy management and predictive maintenance, is a key differentiator in a sector where customers increasingly prioritize lifecycle costs over upfront capital expenditures. This shift not only enhances customer retention but also insulates JCI from cyclical demand swings, a critical advantage in an industry sensitive to construction cycles and material costs [5].

Valuation: A Premium for Long-Term Potential

While JCI’s valuation multiples appear elevated relative to peers, they reflect its superior growth trajectory and margin expansion. As of August 2025, JCI trades at a trailing P/E of 31.62, above Honeywell’s 24.83 and Siemens’ 22.37 but in line with Schneider Electric’s 28.96 [6]. Its EV/EBITDA of 18.94 is competitive, matching Honeywell’s 20.10 and outperforming Siemens’ 15.27 [6]. These metrics suggest investors are pricing in JCI’s leadership in energy-efficient technologies and its ability to convert earnings into cash, as evidenced by its 15.7% EBITDA margin in Q2 [7].

However, JCI’s high debt-to-equity ratio of 70.38% raises concerns about financial leverage [8]. This risk is partially offset by its strong ROE of 9.80% and ROIC of 6.24%, both above industry averages [8]. The company’s $400 million restructuring plan, aimed at eliminating stranded costs, further strengthens its balance sheet and supports its full-year guidance of $3.65–$3.68 in adjusted EPS [3].

Macro Risks and Sector Headwinds

The energy-efficient building sector faces significant macroeconomic risks in 2025. Tariffs on steel, aluminum, and softwood lumber have increased project costs by up to $14,000 per single-family home, potentially delaying energy-efficient upgrades [9]. Additionally, interest rates hovering near 4% may dampen financing for large-scale renovations, particularly in the residential market [9].

Yet JCI’s exposure to these risks is mitigated by its focus on commercial and industrial clients, which are less sensitive to consumer discretionary spending. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) also provides a tailwind, offering tax credits and rebates for energy-efficient retrofits—a policy JCI is well-positioned to leverage through its OpenBlue platform [10]. However, potential policy rollbacks under initiatives like Project 2025 could disrupt this momentum, underscoring the need for regulatory clarity.

Conclusion: A Compelling Long-Term Investment

Johnson Controls’ strategic shift toward recurring revenue, coupled with margin expansion and a robust backlog, positions it as a resilient player in the energy-efficient building sector. While valuation premiums and macroeconomic risks warrant caution, JCI’s leadership in AI-driven building technologies and its ability to navigate supply chain challenges justify its current price. Investors seeking exposure to the clean energy transition may find JCI’s combination of growth, margin discipline, and sector alignment particularly compelling.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-01 13:03:51.647305

Future outlook remains uncertain The disappointing quarterly results raise questions about the sustainability of China’s electric vehicle boom.
The fundamental question facing BYD is whether China’s electric vehicle market can support its current number of players or whether painful consolidation lies ahead.","BYD shares plunged nearly 8% in Hong Kong on Monday after China’s electric vehicle champion revealed that quarterly profits had fallen by almost a third. The dramatic selloff reflected investor alarm at how even the industry’s strongest player cannot escape the devastating effects of China’s automotive price war.

The Shenzhen based manufacturer reported net profit of 6.36 billion yuan or $891 million for the April through June period marking a 30% decline from the same quarter last year. This sharp drop came despite revenue growth of 14% to approximately 201 billion yuan driven partly by expanding international sales.

The disappointing results underscore how China’s electric vehicle market has transformed from a growth story into a survival battle. BYD acknowledged that increased price competition and excessive marketing tactics have created adverse periodic impacts throughout the industry. The company described competition as reaching fever pitch levels with industry malpractices disrupting normal market dynamics.

What makes these results particularly striking is that BYD emerged as the global leader in electric vehicle production surpassing Tesla in annual revenue last year. Yet this market leadership provides little protection from the brutal economics reshaping China’s automotive sector.

Price cuts reshape the landscape

The numbers tell a sobering story about China’s car market. Average vehicle prices have plummeted approximately 19% over the past two years falling to around 165,000 yuan or roughly $22,900 according to industry data. This dramatic compression reflects desperate efforts by manufacturers to maintain market share.

BYD faces intense competition from domestic rivals including Nio and XPeng alongside American giant Tesla which operates its massive Shanghai factory. All these companies have engaged in aggressive discounting creating a destructive cycle that benefits consumers but threatens manufacturer profitability. Automakers now offer zero interest loans and substantial dealer subsidies.

Chinese authorities grew concerned enough to issue warnings in May threatening to punish carmakers for fueling excessive price cuts. Beijing fears unchecked competition could damage the broader economy and create instability in an industry it considers strategically important.

The price war stems partly from oversupply issues as past government policies encouraged numerous players to enter the sector. This created a situation where even market leaders struggle to maintain profitability despite strong sales volumes. Industry analysts suggest consolidation appears inevitable as smaller players face increasing pressure.

Global expansion offers limited relief

BYD has aggressively pursued international markets as a hedge against domestic challenges opening showrooms across Europe and launching vehicles at competitive prices. The strategy has shown promising results with the company recording over 13,000 new registrations in Europe during July representing a 225% increase from the previous year.

The company has also expanded into Southeast Asia Latin America and other emerging markets seeking growth opportunities. These efforts include building overseas manufacturing facilities and establishing local partnerships to reduce costs.

Yet overseas success has not offset domestic pain. The company set an ambitious target of selling 5.5 million cars globally this year but reached only 2.49 million units by July’s end. This gap highlights the difficulty of maintaining growth momentum when your home market faces turmoil.

The first half results painted a somewhat brighter picture with net profit rising nearly 14% to 15.5 billion yuan and revenue climbing about 23% to 371.3 billion yuan. New energy vehicle sales hit record highs during this period suggesting volume growth remains robust even as margins compress.

Future outlook remains uncertain

The disappointing quarterly results raise questions about the sustainability of China’s electric vehicle boom. While government support and consumer adoption continue driving sales growth the industry faces a reckoning as profitability becomes increasingly elusive.

BYD’s technological advantages and manufacturing scale should theoretically provide competitive benefits but these strengths mean little when rivals operate at losses. The company must balance maintaining market position against preserving profitability in an environment where both goals seem incompatible.

The fundamental question facing BYD is whether China’s electric vehicle market can support its current number of players or whether painful consolidation lies ahead. Price cuts may provide immediate benefits to consumers but risk creating long term oversupply problems.",https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2471937827.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 13:03:48.289552

The map, which can be accessed here, is designed to help legislators, policymakers, and investors visualise the full-scale and strategic alignment of Wales’ clean energy pipeline and industrial transition, and to spotlight the transformational potential for jobs, infrastructure, and regional economies.

It not only identifies £6.9 billion which could be added to the Welsh economy over the next decade but also highlights £2.1 billion which could be saved by avoiding further deindustrialisation through investment in low-carbon technologies and infrastructure.

To support political understanding and constituency-level impact, the map overlays the 16 new ‘super constituencies’ which will be contested in the 2026 Senedd election. This allows political candidates and decision-makers to identify priority clean energy and industrial projects within their prospective constituencies — and to understand the local benefits they could deliver.

Ben Burggraaf, CEO of Net Zero Industry Wales, said: “At its core, this map sends a powerful message: Wales is not simply a collection of individual projects. As a nation, we are building a strong, diverse and nationally significant clean energy and low-carbon industry investment portfolio, enabling Wales to become a leading clean energy transition hub and remain a cornerstone of the UK industrial base.”

Jess Hooper, Director of RenewableUK Cymru, said: “Renewables are not just about delivering projects and electricity— they are about delivering a future. Clean energy is both a climate imperative and a once-in-a-generation economic opportunity.

“With this map, we’re making the case for action on where investment is needed, with real locations, real figures and real opportunities for every part of Wales.”

Critical infrastructure upgrades can also be seen, including grid reinforcements to boost connectivity in Mid Wales and create a North–South transmission spine, alongside current and new interconnectors with Ireland and Scotland. These are essential to ensuring clean power can flow efficiently into, out of, and across Wales — unlocking further investment and economic growth.

The collaboration between clean energy and industry associations reflects the shared missions of the two organisations: Net Zero Industry Wales is focused on decarbonising industry and manufacturing, positioning Wales as a clean energy hub and a cornerstone of the UK industrial base; RenewableUK Cymru is leading the shift to clean electricity by embedding renewables into Wales’ wider economic strategy.

“EPA has the responsibility – and the legal obligation – to reduce pollution that warms the planet and harms human health, which is exactly what the agency did when it finalized power plant carbon standards last year,” said Frank Sturges, attorney at CATF. “Eliminating these rules ignores the facts: pollution from power plants contributes significantly to climate change that harms public health. Power plants are the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., accounting for a quarter of emissions. And the harms from climate change – from increased dust and wildfire smoke to stronger heat waves – are clear. If EPA finalizes this repeal, power plants would continue to spew greenhouse gases completely unregulated, threatening public health and driving up electricity costs.

“But it doesn’t have to be this way. We have the technology to achieve significant emissions reductions while providing Americans with reliable and affordable electricity. Carbon capture systems – which use a type of pollution scrubber like those EPA has been relying on in pollution limits for decades – can reduce emissions at a reasonable cost, and the technical record has only gotten stronger since EPA correctly reached that determination. Now hellbent on advancing a deregulatory agenda on political grounds, EPA completely ignores its own factual findings, disregards scientific evidence, and relies on unreasonable assumptions. But the law and science cannot be politicized – EPA has the statutory duty to regulate industries that significantly contribute to air pollution, and the standards currently in place are achievable. There is only one thing EPA can do to comply with the law – withdraw the proposed repeal.”

The proposed repeal includes both a primary and alternative rationale. The primary rationale proposes to reinterpret the phrase “contributes significantly” in Section 111 of the Clean Air Act.

Montana Renewables won’t publicly commit to underground injection

A long-pending application to inject wastewater from the Montana Renewables biorefinery into unused oil wells in Pondera County will get a new public hearing next month.

After the public expressed concerns about the wastewater, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency attempted to predict the spread of the material over 10,000 years. The findings indicated that the wastewater could drift as far as two miles, deep underground in the Madison Aquifer, although the agency claims that drinking water sources in the area will not be affected.

The plan has received sustained scrutiny from locals, particularly the three Pondera County commissioners who worry there are too many unknowns to risk contaminating current water wells and any future use of the aquifer.

“We just don’t trust they have all the information they need to make a real, solid conclusion on how far this water will travel,” Commissioner Zane Drishinski told Montana Free Press last week.

The application concerns two unused oil wells about five miles southwest of Lake Frances. The owner of the wells, Montalban Oil and Gas Operations, applied for a permit in 2022 to dispose of industrial wastewater from Montana Renewables. The request calls for injections of wastewater around 3,500 feet underground in the Madison Aquifer at an amount of up to 84,000 gallons per day.

The wastewater comes from Montana Renewables’ pre-treatment unit about 80 miles away in Great Falls, which washes the raw materials the facility uses to make biofuels. Those raw materials can include seed oils, vegetable oils and beef tallow. Montana Renewables currently ships the wastewater by truck and rail to an out-of-state disposal site at a cost of $12 million annually.

On Aug. 20, the EPA announced a new public hearing to discuss the estimated migration of the wastewater underground. Following the announcement, Montana Renewables issued a statement saying that it appreciated the EPA’s increased scrutiny after hearing the public’s concerns.

Still, the company has tried to keep the wastewater injection plan at arm’s length. In its recent statement and in other settings, Montana Renewables has repeated that the wells are not owned by the company. Montalban Oil and Gas owns the wells and is requesting the disposal permit, but the permit documents say that this project is specifically for Montana Renewables wastewater.

MTFP asked a Montana Renewables spokesperson last week if the company is committed to using the wells to inject wastewater if the EPA grants the permit. The spokesperson, Lanni Klasner, would not say one way or the other before adding that the company is committed to transparency.

“I can say any water management approach we adopt will meet or exceed applicable environmental standards,” Klasner wrote in an email.

Pondera County officials have raised concerns that Montana Renewables’ wastewater characteristics remain relatively unknown. Documents filed with the EPA still say that the facility’s pre-treatment unit is “currently under construction” and that water quality data aren’t available, although the unit has been operational and the plant has been producing biofuels for several years.

A previous statement from the Pondera County sanitarian office said that the wastewater contains “potentially unacceptable levels of nutrients, heavy metals, residual pesticides or other contaminants.” In an email to MTFP, an EPA spokesperson said that final approval of the permit will require a sample of the wastewater to be analyzed by the agency.

Permit documents filed with the EPA note that the water currently at the proposed injection site is already of poor quality and that the wells have been used in the past to dispose of wastewater from oil and gas operations. That wastewater contained oil and grease, as well as detectable levels of the harmful chemical benzene.

Furthermore, the permit documents note that the deepest drinking water well in the region is 310 feet deep — far from the 3,500-foot depth of the injection well. No public or private users tap this part of the Madison Aquifer for drinking water.

Patrick Montalban, CEO of the company that owns the wells, said they were drilled nearly 15 years ago and didn’t produce. Shortly thereafter, the wells were permitted as waste injection sites. He operates 17 other injection wells in Montana and said there are 28 active injection wells in Pondera County.

“If you see an oil and gas well, 90% chance you’re going to see an injection well,” he said.

Pondera County commissioners told MTFP that it’s unknown what the region’s water needs will be decades from now. There might come a time when the aquifer will need to be tapped for agricultural or drinking use.

“We live in a pretty arid part of the state here,” Commissioner Drishinski said. “And there are other areas in Montana that are digging wells down close to that range that are finding good sources of water down there.”

Officials have urged Montana Renewables to prioritize wastewater treatment on-site in Great Falls. The company has long planned a treatment facility as part of a $1.6 billion expansion, but it hasn’t said when construction will commence and whether the wells in Pondera County will be used in the interim.

The forthcoming public hearing will address an “aquifer exemption expansion,” which would allow that region of the aquifer to be used as a disposal site with the new EPA projections for wastewater spread.

The hearing will be Sept. 23, 5:30 p.m., at Conrad High School.

Property taxes to decrease for countywide levy

Cascade County has tightened its spending slightly since last year as commissioners work to set the county’s 2026 budget.

Property owners can expect a decrease in the 2026 general mill levy for Cascade County, according to a draft budget that’s open for public comment through Sept. 4. The proposed levy will be $152.60 less than the previous year on a $300,000 property and $215.24 less on a $600,000 property, according to county documents.

Overall budget revenue is expected to be flat for 2026, and spending is expected to decrease.

Elected officials won’t receive an increase in pay for 2026 based on a previous decision by the Cascade County Compensation Board.

In addition to the countywide mill levy, all properties in Cascade County will also pay a share of the public safety levy, which voters approved in 2022. That levy is expected to raise $3 million in 2026, though an estimate for individual properties wasn’t immediately available.

Due to new property tax legislation, the public safety mill levy had to be recalculated to avoid a drop in revenue, similar to the action taken by Great Falls on the library mills. While voters approved a specific number of mills (14) in 2022, the recalculation establishes a new maximum number of mills based on the revenue made in 2025. The county finance office has recommended that the levy be tied to inflationary increases allowed by statute for each budget after recalculation.

Property owners outside of Great Falls pay into the county road mill levy, which will raise $2.9 million. They also pay into the rural mill levy, budgeted at $1.6 million, which supports the health department, library services, roads and planning.

County commissioners will meet on Sept. 4 to consider the public safety levy and the final budget for 2026.

In a social media post, Racki said that attacks on law enforcement had gone too far and that Republicans put “the safety and freedom of law-abiding citizens first by standing with law enforcement.” Racki’s most recent political contributions for partisan races were in 2022, when he donated $150 to state House candidate Barbara Bessette, a Democrat. That same year, he donated to Cascade County Sheriff Jesse Slaughter’s campaign. Slaughter also switched parties in 2021, moving from Democrat to Republican.

On Aug. 25, the Great Falls Public Schools Board of Trustees enacted a new policy that dictates what kinds of flags can be shown on school property. The policy explicitly allows the Gadsden flag and flags honoring law enforcement but bans flags that “express a political viewpoint.” According to the policy, that includes flags representing sexual orientation or gender, which is widely viewed to prevent the Pride flag from being shown. School trustees didn’t specifically discuss the policy before passing it. The policy reflects a law that was passed earlier this year at the Montana Legislature.

The Great Falls Animal Shelter will hold a free rabies vaccination clinic Sept. 28 in conjunction with World Rabies Day. It’s a walk-in event for dogs and cats. Pets must be leashed or kenneled at the event, which is from noon to 2 p.m.

Two hours of free summer parking has ended at the north parking garage in downtown Great Falls. The program, which started last year, intended to draw visitors to use the parking structure. Garage parking remains available at 50 cents per hour, which is half the price of on-street parking. The garages are free after 6 p.m. and on weekends.

A Denton-area landowner has sued NorthWestern Energy, alleging negligence for the 2021 West Wind Fire that burned more than 30,000 acres and damaged the town. The company has acknowledged that overhead power lines may have sparked the fire. The plaintiff in this case, Clifford Edwards, owns 234 acres east of Denton and described the land as an animal and plant sanctuary. The land was destroyed in the fire. There have been at least four other lawsuits against NorthWestern related to the West Wind Fire, according to the Lewistown News-Argus. Two were settled earlier this year. This spring, Gov. Greg Gianforte signed a wildfire liability law that was drafted by NorthWestern Energy. Opponents included victims of the West Wind Fire, who argued that the law didn’t go far enough to ensure accountability. An attorney in the Edwards case told MTFP in an email that the new law doesn’t apply to this lawsuit because the fire happened in 2021.

Public notice

In 2009, developers of the Eagles Crossing neighborhood on the far north end of Great Falls received a two-year extension to finish upgrades to water and sewer infrastructure. Some of that work was never completed.

On Sept. 2, the Great Falls City Commission will consider giving a new developer, Cascade Communities LLC, until 2026 to complete the infrastructure to support the development of 20 lots. Cascade Communities purchased the undeveloped lots from Eagles Crossing LLC in May.

Commissioners will also consider enacting a pilot program to fund the replacement of some lead and galvanized water lines. Replacement of those lines is mandated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The $300,000 pilot program will aim to replace up to 20 water lines and take advantage of a state loan fund that offers 60% forgiveness. The city’s water fund will cover other expenses.

The city has been working to identify lead water lines in private properties.

The city commission meets Sept. 2 at 7 p.m. The agenda is available here.

Dept. of corrections (and clarifications)

The Aug. 25 edition of Great Falls This Week misspelled Deputy City Manager Bryan Lockerby’s first name.

In that same newsletter edition, MTFP reported that proposed workforce housing that benefits from tax increment financing would need to be monitored for income eligibility in perpetuity. After that newsletter was published, Planning and Community Development Director Brock Cherry reached out to clarify that there is a time limit to that eligibility.

Cherry said that rental projects that are supported by TIF must remain “affordable” for 30 years, not in perpetuity and that property owners submit compliance reports annually. For-sale projects supported by TIF must remain affordable for 75 years.

Affordability in this context means homeowners who make between 60% and 140% of the area’s median income. For Great Falls, that’s between $36,120 and $84,280 for one person or $46,440 to $108,360 for a family of three, according to a city presentation. City officials have explored using TIF to support the development of workforce housing in vacant or older downtown properties.",https://montanafreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MTFP-Great-Falls-09.png,N,,2025-09-01 12:04:01.176319

Charlotte-based CleanAIRE NC launched the AirKeeper Dashboard, a platform of real-time air quality and information to empower community advocacy for clean air.

A Charlotte-based nonprofit is taking the mystery out of environmental science.

CleanAIRE NC launched CleanAIRE Academy, an interactive online learning tool that gives residents access to expert-driven information and resources to advocate for healthier communities. The initiative’s courses are tailored for easy use to track air quality and its health impacts.

“The CleanAIRE Academy aims to transform understanding into action,"" Rafi Vaca, CleanAIRE NC’s education manager, said in a statement. “Air pollution is an invisible and often understated problem, yet its impact on public health is profound. We created this platform to demystify complex issues and inspire meaningful engagement.”

The online academy is the latest in a series of recent initiatives launched by CleanAIRE NC. In July, the nonprofit debuted the AirKeeper Dashboard, an interactive mapping tool that tracks air quality in real time.

The dashboard, developed in partnership with AirKeepers, or community scientists who host a network of air monitors used on the map, provides access to environmental data, demographic information, and health statistics.

Growing concerns about North Carolina’s readiness to handle potential environmental emergencies as well as legal changes have raised greater awareness on informed community engagement. As the federal government rolls back support for environmental protections – especially in at-risk communities that tend to be low-income and predominantly Black or brown – a grassroots approach is necessary.

“As someone passionate about environmental justice and community health, the CleanAIRE Academy greatly expanded my knowledge of air quality and advocacy,” said Naami Abbey, a UNC Charlotte student and an early user of the platform. “The self-paced courses made learning so much easier, deepening my understanding of air quality and how to turn concern into meaningful action for environmental justice.”

Craig Woodburn brings valuable expertise in sustainability, having accumulated years of experience in circular economy practices, supply chain sustainability, carbon management and environmental governance.
Since joining Molson Coors in 2024, he has escalated from the position of Western Europe Sustainability Director to holding responsibilities over the EMEA and APAC regions.
The historical roots of Molson Coors' sustainability efforts trace back to 1885, with its foundational recycling initiatives offering customers incentives for returning empty bottles.
Gavin Hattersley, CEO at Molson Coors Beverage Company, said on LinkedIn: “It is an important time to remember that beverage makers like Molson Coors depend on the Earth to create the products our consumers love.","Molson Coors has long been a prominent name with a diverse portfolio including beers such as Coors Light and Blue Moon Belgian White.

Striving to uphold industry standards, the company is committed to leaving a positive impact across its workforce, communities and the environment.

Established in 1786, it stands as Canada's oldest brewery.

In this vein of tradition and innovation, Craig Woodburn has been appointed as the EMEA and APAC Sustainability Director.

Craig Woodburn brings valuable expertise in sustainability, having accumulated years of experience in circular economy practices, supply chain sustainability, carbon management and environmental governance.

His educational qualifications include a Bachelor’s degree in biology and chemistry, followed by a Master’s in Integrated Environmental Control from Nottingham Trent University.

Since joining Molson Coors in 2024, he has escalated from the position of Western Europe Sustainability Director to holding responsibilities over the EMEA and APAC regions.

Focus on sustainable manufacturing practices

Molson Coors' appointment of Woodburn falls within the company’s broader strategy initiated in 2019, which targets geographic expansion while retaining a focus on a global team ethos.

His appointment supports the company’s ambitious eco-friendly manufacturing goals, reflecting a drive towards reduced environmental impact through water conservation and carbon footprint reduction.

The historical roots of Molson Coors' sustainability efforts trace back to 1885, with its foundational recycling initiatives offering customers incentives for returning empty bottles.

Today, the company strives to decrease water consumption by 22% in its largest breweries and restore 3.5 billion gallons in water-stressed areas by 2025.

These targets are crucial, considering the beer production’s dependency on water resources.

Additionally, Molson Coors aims to halve its carbon emissions by 2025 and has currently achieved a 44.3% reduction, bolstered by investments in renewable energy like wind farms to cut back on fossil fuel reliance.

Furthermore, Molson Coors remains steadfast in its pledge to exclusively use 100% reusable or recycled materials in its packaging, reinforcing its sustainable manufacturing commitment.

Gavin Hattersley, CEO at Molson Coors Beverage Company, said on LinkedIn: “It is an important time to remember that beverage makers like Molson Coors depend on the Earth to create the products our consumers love.

“Barley, hops, yeast and of course, water are the backbone of our business.

“At Molson Coors, we are committed to reducing our impact on the planet.”

Setting the standard across the supply chain

The company establishes firm guidelines on environmental, social and economic conditions for its suppliers, pushing towards an ethical and sustainable supply chain.

It is determined to source all its barley and hops in alignment with these principles, thereby supporting sustainable agricultural practices.

Molson Coors aims to reduce water use in its agricultural supply chain and malting operations by 10% by 2025, proving its dedication to minimising environmental footprints across all production stages.

Signifying a modern approach to sustainable agriculture, Molson Coors developed its Grower Direct Portal in the US.

This digital platform enables practitioners to monitor sustainable farming practices, boosting efficiency and transparency across the industry.

Leadership in sustainable production

Craig Woodburn says: “As we accelerate our progress towards our whole value chain target, we are continuing to increase engagement with our suppliers to understand the challenges they face and collaboratively develop solutions, with the support and experience of our procurement teams.

“Data collection, accuracy and availability is a key priority for us and our suppliers and customers.

“It is essential for targeted reductions, as well as driving continuous improvement at pace.

“Data provided by our suppliers will improve visibility of the trajectory needed to ensure we achieve net zero across our value chain by 2050.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/e93c9ad8f5fa4a570b290d4968a31ce8:4a3013e5a296f56f7ce1ac29b3485bdc/self-3b.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 13:02:21.123026

Employees charged that FEMA, under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has been stripped of resources, overloaded with bureaucracy, and pressured to ignore climate science.
And I will continue to do so.” The administration’s hostility toward climate science has further alarmed employees.
In December 2024, FEMA released its Future Risk Index, analyzing how natural hazards would intensify with climate change and identifying which communities were most vulnerable.
“I am proud of the current and former Fema employees for having the courage to speak up.","Nearly 200 current and former employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) took the extraordinary step of signing a public letter to Congress on August 25, denouncing what they described as the Trump administration’s sabotage of disaster preparedness and warning that the country could face another Hurricane Katrina-level catastrophe. More than 30 signatories publicly identified themselves, while the rest signed anonymously out of fear of retaliation.

The letter, titled the Katrina Declaration, was issued as the nation marked the 20th anniversary of the devastating 2005 hurricane that killed 1,833 people in New Orleans and across the Gulf Coast. “Hurricane Katrina was not just a natural disaster, but a man-made one,” the signatories wrote. “The inexperience of senior leaders and the profound failure by the federal government to deliver timely, unified, and effective aid to those in need left survivors to fend for themselves. Two decades later, Fema is enacting processes and leadership structures that echo the conditions PKEMRA was designed to prevent.”

The declaration accused the administration of violating the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act (PKEMRA), passed in 2006 to overhaul FEMA’s leadership, coordination, and capacity after its failures during Katrina. Employees charged that FEMA, under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has been stripped of resources, overloaded with bureaucracy, and pressured to ignore climate science. “Our shared commitment to our country, our oaths of office, and our mission of helping people before, during, and after disasters compel us to warn Congress and the American people of the cascading effects of decisions made by the current administration,” the letter stated.

Among the most urgent concerns is a DHS directive requiring that all grants over $100,000 be personally approved by Secretary Kristi Noem. Employees say the rule has created massive backlogs, delaying contracts with vendors that staff FEMA helplines and slowing aid for communities hit by storms. The bottleneck left disaster survivors in states like Texas and North Carolina waiting weeks for assistance. In July, floods in Texas killed at least 135 people, including 37 schoolchildren, and experts said FEMA’s weakened capacity may have contributed to the death toll.

One signatory described the stakes in stark terms. “I knew that if I didn’t sign this letter I would feel as though I was failing in my duty to protect the public I swore an oath to serve; that I would feel complicit in the false narratives this administration has been working so hard to drive about their intentions with FEMA when I’ve seen only evidence to the contrary,” she said. “In the end, I knew that more people would die if I did not help raise the alarm. So I did. And I am. And I will continue to do so.”

The administration’s hostility toward climate science has further alarmed employees. In December 2024, FEMA released its Future Risk Index, analyzing how natural hazards would intensify with climate change and identifying which communities were most vulnerable. In February 2025, following executive orders restricting climate change research and diversity-related programs, FEMA was forced to take the index offline and remove climate-related language from its website. “The executive orders are forcing us to turn a blind eye to where the best science is,” said Katherine Landers, a geospatial risk analyst who helped develop the index. “It’s forcing us to turn our heads and completely ignore the science. It’s scary. Our hands are tied right now.”

The letter also raised concerns about FEMA’s leadership. Since January 2025, the agency has been overseen by acting administrators without Senate confirmation or disaster management backgrounds. Current acting administrator David Richardson, identified by staff as unqualified, came under fire after reportedly telling employees he did not know the United States had a hurricane season. His predecessor, Cameron Hamilton, was fired after opposing Trump’s proposal to abolish FEMA entirely. “Since January 2025, Fema has been under the leadership of individuals lacking legal qualifications, Senate approval, and the demonstrated background required of a Fema administrator,” the signatories wrote.

Employees say the dysfunction has triggered a mass exodus from the agency. More than 2,000 staff—roughly one-third of the permanent workforce—have departed since Trump’s inauguration. “Without the hub, your spokes don’t fit in; your wheel can’t turn,” one mitigation specialist said, describing FEMA’s role coordinating disaster preparation and response nationwide. Others pointed to burnout and low morale as widespread, with some employees calling in sick or taking leave without pay rather than work in what they described as a toxic environment.

The Katrina Declaration’s release was met with swift retaliation. Within days, the more than 30 employees who signed their names, including Landers, were placed on administrative leave, locked out of government email accounts, and barred from entering FEMA offices. “It was very sudden,” one signatory recalled. “I was at work and we all received emails that we were placed on administrative leave. We’re in a state of purgatory. We can’t do our jobs but we’re also not free to do anything else. That’s very unusual.”

Yet employees have continued to sound the alarm. “The public is currently staring down the barrel of a gun held by the administration as it plays Russian Roulette, with natural disasters serving as the bullet,” one explained. “It may not be the next pull of the trigger—or tomorrow—but the outcome is inevitable unless meaningful, lasting change, as outlined in the Katrina Declaration, is implemented and with haste. And this isn’t just hyperbole for the sake of it; the danger posed to our collective communities, especially those on the coast, in tornado alley, or in areas prone to fire and flooding, is very real.”

Michael Coen, former FEMA chief of staff under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, praised the signatories. “I am proud of the current and former Fema employees for having the courage to speak up. Lessons were learned from Katrina and Congress took action. Those lessons and actions are being disregarded by the Trump administration.”

FEMA’s acting press secretary Daniel Llargués dismissed the letter, saying, “It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform.” He said the administration “is committed to ensuring Fema delivers for the American people” and to cutting “red tape, inefficiency and outdated processes.”

Despite such assurances, FEMA employees warn that the agency is hollowed out at the very moment when hurricane season, tornado outbreaks, wildfires, and floods are intensifying due to climate change. The declaration calls for FEMA to be elevated to Cabinet-level status and insulated from DHS interference. Until then, workers say, Americans remain vulnerable.",https://i0.wp.com/s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.nationofchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/26155524/fema.jpg?fit=529%2C300&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-01 12:03:58.027069

In cooperation with the organiser of the Arosa ClassicCar and with Porsche Switzerland as main sponsor and car partner, HIF Global is giving participants the opportunity to refuel their racing cars with e-Fuels free of charge. The amount of fuel provided is sufficient for all races during the event weekend, giving 180 drivers the chance to run exclusively on e-Fuels.

“We have been operating the world’s first e-Fuels pilot facility for over two years” said Thorsten Herdan, CEO of HIF EMEA. “With this sponsorship, we demonstrate once again the viability of e-Fuels and their contribution to reducing CO₂ emissions in transportation. Together with Arosa ClassicCar and Porsche Switzerland, we are proud to champion the future of sustainable mobility. The recent Swiss law allowing synthetic fuels to count toward CO₂ fleet targets for road vehicles reinforces this vision and sets an example for the rest of Europe.”

e-Fuels are made with renewable energy to separate hydrogen from oxygen in the molecule of water. The hydrogen is combined with recycled carbon dioxide to produce e-Fuels, such as e-Methanol, which can be used as a shipping fuel or converted into other e-Fuels including e-Gasoline for cars, e-SAF for planes, and e-Diesel for trucks. e-Fuels are chemically equivalent to fuels used today and can therefore be dropped-in to existing engines without requiring modifications.

“e-Fuels offer a useful complement to electric mobility, especially for our existing fleet” added Holger Gerrmann, CEO of Porsche Schweiz AG. “At the Arosa ClassicCar, we will offer a memorable demonstration of how the CO2 footprint of historic cars can be significantly improved, without losing their authentic driving dynamics and their unmistakable character. The potential is enormous – there are currently more than 1.3 billion internal-combustion cars around the world that will be on the road for decades to come and that will be able to contribute to decarbonisation thanks to e-Fuels.”

But, the court found that 75% of its eucalyptus plantation in Paraguay were not secured beyond 2029 and Apple was unable to guarantee that these contracts would be extended.

DUH head Juergen Resch said in a statement: ""The supposed storage of CO₂ in commercial eucalyptus plantations is limited to just a few years, the contractual guarantees for the future are not sufficient and the ecological integrity of monoculture areas is not guaranteed.""

The court suggested that due to there being no guarantee of future carbon offsetting the carbon neutrality claim cannot be substantiated.

An Apple representative told AppleInsider: ""We strongly disagree with the DUH's position, which runs counter to the EU's and Germany's climate strategy and widespread international scientific consensus that both emissions reductions and carbon removal are necessary to achieve global climate goals.""

What will the changes be to the EU legislation in 2026?

By 2026 the European Union is planning to create more laws surrounding carbon offsetting in an aim to reduce greenwashing.

In 2024 the EU made a statement announcing that it is working on updating its existing rules regarding commercial practices and customer protection in order to promote friendly decisions and create a circular economy.

The union says it wants to ban greenwashing, where companies add sustainability statements such as neutral or eco without having the evidence to back up these claims.

The EU says it wants to make sure that information outlining a product's impact on the environment, longevity, reparability, composition, production and usage is all backed up by verifiable sources.

In alignment with these goals the EU says it wants to ban:

Generic environmental claims on products without proof

A company claiming that a product is neutral, reduced or has a positive impact on the environment due to carbon offsetting

Labels making sustainability claims without approved certification or established by a public authority.

Apple says that it will phase out its use of the carbon neutral label to coincide with the coming bans in 2026, a spokesperson for the brand told ESG News: “Importantly, the court has broadly upheld our rigorous approach to carbon neutrality.

“We remain laser-focused on further reducing emissions by industry-leading innovation in clean energy, low-carbon design and more — work that has put us on track to achieve carbon neutrality throughout our entire supply chain by 2030.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/60b10707de1d7faff4fb2bef325cd1cc:07bfc21294b31aa8c3ff4bbddedb8513/apple-series-9-main.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 15:01:38.827682

The Mesquite factory is not thought to include cell production lines.

“Local manufacturing lets us meet American standards, respond quickly to demand, and work with communities and partners to drive the clean energy transition,” Hithium VP of North America operations James Boswell said.

At the time the factory was announced last year, the US government under then-president Joe Biden was seeking to promote domestic clean energy supply chains, leading to a rush of investments in manufacturing being announced across the country.

Policy uncertainty over issues such as import tariffs and stricter rules on using Chinese imported battery products since Donald Trump took office has contributed to an estimated 21GWh of planned BESS cell manufacturing capacity being cancelled since the beginning of this year, according to market intelligence firm Clean Energy Associates (CEA).

However, despite this reduction in planned capacity, coming mainly from startups with greenfield developments, investments by bigger players in the BESS space in both cell and BESS assembly are bearing fruit.

Solar Media Market Research analyst Charlotte Gisbourne recently wrote in a Guest Blog for this site that capacity additions from Tesla, Canadian Solar and LG Energy Solution will bring US-based annual BESS cell manufacturing capacity to more than 50GWh by the end of 2026.

There will be about the same amount of BESS assembly capacity in the country by the end of this year, Gisbourne wrote, noting that cell production plants take longer to build and cost more than module and systems assembly facilities.

Under the current administration, BESS project developers are still able to avail of a 10% adder through domestic content bonuses to the investment tax credit (ITC) and manufacturers the 45x production tax credit (PTC) worth US$35/kWh for cells and US$10/kWh for modules made in the US.

However, new restrictions on imported materials or investment from foreign entity of concern (FEOC) companies from China apply since the passing of the H.R.1 ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act’ legislation, intended to drive further self-reliance and lessen dependency on a country the US deems unfriendly.

Hithium has yet to announce plans to onshore some of its cell production to the US. The company has, however, made recent headlines for its battery cell technologies made in China. It launched an industry-first 1175Ah large-format lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cell in June. Mass-produced at a facility in Chongqing, central China, it equips Hithium’s new 6.25MWh containerised BESS solution.

The company also said in late August that it had begun mass production of its ∞Cell 587Ah high-capacity energy storage battery cells from its Xiamen factory.

North America currently leads with a 35% market share as of 2024, fueled by substantial investments in AI research and renewable infrastructure. Meanwhile, the Asia Pacific region is expected to experience the fastest growth over the next decade, driven by ambitious energy goals in countries such as India, China, and Japan.

By application, grid management and optimization currently dominate, ensuring stable energy supply amid fluctuating renewable sources. Meanwhile, renewable energy output forecasting is the fastest-growing segment, allowing utilities to predict energy production more accurately and reduce operational risks. Among end-users, energy generation companies lead the market, but microgrids and prosumers—consumers who generate and share energy—are emerging rapidly as key players.

How Generative AI is Transforming Renewable Energy

Smarter Grid Management

Renewable energy sources like solar and wind are inherently variable, dependent on weather conditions and seasonal changes. Generative AI can predict subtle fluctuations, optimize energy flow, and adjust resource allocation in real time. This capability reduces energy loss, prevents disruptions, and ensures higher efficiency. For decentralized systems like rooftop solar and battery storage, GenAI enables seamless integration into pre-existing grids, balancing supply with local demand.

Driving Efficiency and Cost Savings

Beyond smart grids, GenAI streamlines operations and reduces costs. By automating routine data analysis, reporting, and optimization tasks, AI frees professionals to focus on high-value decisions. Actionable insights derived from vast datasets enhance resource allocation, minimize waste, and improve cost management, making renewable energy systems more profitable and sustainable.

Boosting Energy Output

Generative AI also enhances renewable energy generation. AI-powered systems can track sunlight to optimize solar panels, detect early mechanical issues in wind turbines, and forecast water availability for hydropower plants. Google's DeepMind, for instance, achieved a 20% efficiency increase at a solar farm through AI integration. Similarly, Vestas leverages AI for predictive maintenance, ensuring wind turbines operate at peak efficiency.

Since then, the UK energy regulator Ofgem approved plans put forward by the National Energy System Operator (NESO), the independent body that manages the UK energy system, including gas, for a new way of managing grid connection applications.
The rooftop revolution The rooftop solar sector in the UK has “done well” out of connection reform, Hewett says.
It will also find opportunities to develop “technology sovereignty” by driving the UK’s domestic clean energy supply chain, in line with the UK government’s recently released Industrial Strategy.
Supply chain and the Solar Roadmap Perhaps the government’s most keenly awaited promise, but arguably the slowest to deliver, has been the Solar Roadmap.","Voted into government off the back of a manifesto that centred renewables and pledged rapid solar expansion, Labour’s election marked a break from a period during which those in power had, if not actively encouraged, then willingly overseen anti-solar rhetoric that allowed misinformation to circulate.

The new Labour government’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) was quick to act. In his first week as energy secretary, Ed Miliband granted development consent orders (DCOs) for three solar plants with a combined capacity of over 1.3GW.

One year on, eight solar nationally significant infrastructure projects (NSIPs) have received a DCO from Miliband, most recently giving the nod to Baywa r.e. for the 140MW Oaklands Farm solar-plus-storage development.

According to Sulaiman Ilyas-Jarrett, former head of policy and strategy, renewable delivery for DESNZ, who now provides private consultancy and hosts the Energy Revolution podcast, “solar has been an unsung success story in the UK over the last year”.

Labour’s manifesto pledged to reach 72GW of installed solar capacity by 2035, after having tripled solar capacity by 2030 to roughly 42GW.

The 2035 target has been slightly lost behind the government’s Clean Power 2030 Action Plan, which details the necessary steps to a majority (98%) renewable energy-powered energy system operating in the UK by 2030. Within this, the government is committed to between 42 and 47GW of solar installed by 2030.

Lead solar analyst for Solar Media Market Research Josh Cornes says that the uptick in solar NSIPs entering the planning system since the election could be the result of improved developer confidence following Miliband’s quick DCO approvals and supportive signals from government, or the CP30 plan pushing them to act sooner than later.

Planning system changes

As promised, the government has changed the UK planning system to make it harder for local authorities to reject solar developments on spurious grounds.

Previously, wording in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) referenced consideration of agricultural land for food production in considerations for renewable energy project applications. The common misconception that solar PV development will lead to food insecurity by taking agricultural land out of commission is one that has been disproven on several counts, including in a statement made by Miliband to the House of Commons in July 2024. Accordingly, in December, the government implemented a reworded NPPF to state that planning authorities should give “significant weight to the benefits associated with renewable and low carbon energy generation and the proposal’s contribution to a net zero future” when determining applications.

The NPPF is aligned with other changes to wording the government made to National Policy Statements (NPSs), which cover NSIPs. Adjustments mean that NPS EN-3 calls NSIPs “critical national priority”, and as such their “national security, economic, commercial and net zero benefits” should outweigh impacts from their development.

These changes were introduced alongside the CP30 Action Plan, but as Chris Hewett, chief executive of the UK solar trade body Solar Energy UK and co-chair of the government’s Solar Taskforce, points out, they will not have a major effect on installed generation capacity until after 2030.

The action plan, Hewett says, creates a welcome urgency to build towards a looming target: “More projects came through from our industry because of that.”

Likewise, Ilyas-Jarrett says it’s “important and useful” to have the 2030 target.

Grid connections: creating winners and losers

When Hewett spoke to PV Tech Power last year in the wake of the election, he was clear that grid connections were the biggest concern for the industry.

Since then, the UK energy regulator Ofgem approved plans put forward by the National Energy System Operator (NESO), the independent body that manages the UK energy system, including gas, for a new way of managing grid connection applications.

In an effort to cut ‘zombie projects’ that apply for a grid connection with little chance of ever being realised from the queue, the new system arranges applications into ‘gates’, prioritising projects that are likely to deliver and are aligned with UK-wide energy policy.

According to Hewett, “it’s fair to say it’s been an uncomfortable process”. The new methodology had to be developed very quickly and has been met with some discontent in the solar industry. Hewett says that because government and NESO moved so fast, it has caused economic ripples in the industry, and throughout the process, which was “pretty opaque”, it was not clear that generators’ views were being properly taken into account.

“There are winners and losers out of it as a whole,” he says.

This is another area in which the situation post-2030 has not been discussed. The flip side of the urgency created by CP30, and the speed at which connection reforms have been implemented, is that there are “probably greater question marks over what’s going to happen between 2030 and 2035”.

The rooftop revolution

The rooftop solar sector in the UK has “done well” out of connection reform, Hewett says.

A long-standing ask of the connections process was that the transmission threshold be raised from 1MW to 5MW in England and Wales. In Scotland, the threshold was raised from 50kW to 200kW in summer 2024.

By raising the capacity at which a rooftop installation needs a transmission impact assessment (TIA), which previously slowed or prevented rollout of larger rooftop PV installations, NESO said it hoped to “release around 400 distributed generation projects from having to demonstrate Gate 2 compliance or alignment with Clean Power 2030 targets”.

At the time, Solar Energy UK issued a “warm welcome” to the news that “a burdensome element of red tape that has added many years to getting projects off the ground”, contributing to the government’s stated ambition to “unleash a rooftop revolution”.

The government had pledged in its manifesto to implement a mandate for all newly built properties in the UK to have rooftop PV systems installed, a policy that had been floated by the previous government.

However, close to a year after its commitment to the rooftop revolution, the policy that had seemed a sure thing from the off was only made official in June 2025, with the Future Homes Standard to be published in Autumn this year and include the mandate.

Speculating on why the government took so long to make good on that pledge, Ilyas-Jarett says: “I’m sure there were inter-ministerial conversations about priorities and how to balance the desire to have increased rooftop solar with the desire amongst the Ministry of Housing and Treasury to build new homes quickly [another of the government’s manifesto promises].”

“That’s front and centre [for DESNZ] but it’s not necessarily there for ministers in the housing industry it’s a more complex policy environment to jump into,” he explains.

Something more in reach for DESNZ was reform to the Contracts for Difference scheme, something Ilyas-Jarett explains effectively uses existing tools.

Last year’s auction round six (AR6) broke records for the highest budget, which Miliband increased to £1.56 billion (US$2 billion), and capacity secured, with 3.3GW solar projects receiving contracts (out of a total of 34.74GW awarded). Shortly after the success of last year’s auction, the government announced its ambition to reform the process for an even bigger capacity in AR7.

To meet CP30 targets, at least 12GW capacity will need to be secured in AR7, AR8 and potentially (depending on speed of deployment) AR9 across all technologies. For its speed to deploy and comparably low cost (in comparison with other technology types included in the auction), solar could meet much of this new capacity.

Changes to the scheme approved on 15 July 2025 include increasing the length of contracts available for wind and solar projects from 15 to 20 years and allowing the energy secretary to view developer bids ahead of setting the final budget.

According to Ilyas-Jarrett, this move gives more forward certainty to industry as to what application rounds will look like for the projects set to be delivered by 2030, something that has been well received.

“CfD privileges medium to large-scale projects in the way that it’s set up,” he points out. “But the area for future growth is smaller scale and domestic solar,” because “from a political standpoint, that kind of domestic rooftop solar will be just as, if not more, important.”

He says this is where the government’s flagship Great British Energy company could play a role: “This small-scale, lower capacity but higher social impact solar [is what] GB Energy could do”.

The state-owned energy company has begun to take shape, after being promised as a flagship entity by the government when it came to power, even if its precise role was initially vague.

Hewett notes that on the launch of GB Energy, the solar industry’s advice was that the investment vehicle-stroke-renewable energy developer use some of the £8.3 billion it is allotted to invest in the public sector—“which is exactly what they’ve done”.

A £200 million investment from the UK government and GB Energy will see the company work with schools and the NHS to install rooftop solar PV on a total of 400 sites, delivering between 70MW and 100MW of solar generation.

In England around £80 million in funding will support around 200 schools, alongside £100 million for nearly 200 NHS sites, with the first solar systems to be installed by the end of summer 2025.

A more recent development in the company’s remit is an amendment to the Great British Energy Bill that sets an obligation to ban the use of solar products with forced labour in their supply chains in its projects. It will also find opportunities to develop “technology sovereignty” by driving the UK’s domestic clean energy supply chain, in line with the UK government’s recently released Industrial Strategy.

Supply chain and the Solar Roadmap

Perhaps the government’s most keenly awaited promise, but arguably the slowest to deliver, has been the Solar Roadmap. Soon after the election, Miliband recalled the Solar Taskforce, co-chairing the group with Hewett as a signifier of the emphasis he placed on its mission.

Hewett says that “you can’t fault the ambition” in the speed at which Miliband moved. The roadmap was first promised for autumn 2024, after a shift to reflect the new government’s increased ambition and one month after its first meeting in September 2024.

Ensuring alignment with the CP30 Action Plan delayed this, and Hewett concedes that Miliband wasn’t able to be “as hands on” with the Taskforce as he would have liked.

However, with the government’s first Spending Review confirming its economic commitment to renewable energy development, the Solar Roadmap has at long last been published—with not an insignificant amount of focus on the supply chain issues.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/lauren-hurley-and-desnz.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 13:02:25.298707

While offshore wind development remains in its early stages in the United States, Europe has already deployed thousands of turbines across its deep waters. Unlike land-based models, these massive offshore structures demand extensive port infrastructure from large-scale assembly hubs to deepwater docks capable of handling vessels that transport the turbines out to sea.

“This is a new level of idiocracy, where the Trump administration is trying to destroy an entire sector of clean energy, kill thousands of good paying jobs, and drive up electricity prices for American consumers,” said Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., who represents the area that has apparently lost the funding, as per the NPR report.

Barely a week earlier, the Trump administration directed developers to halt work on a wind project off the Rhode Island coast. The president has long voiced disdain for wind energy, arguing that it drives up costs and harms wildlife. His efforts to scale back tax breaks for both wind and solar have drawn criticism from analysts, who warn such moves could push electricity prices higher nationwide.

The latest setbacks have jolted the wind sector, a sharp contrast to just a few years ago when rising power needs fueled a wave of new project announcements. Chris Mikkelsen, who serves as executive director of the Port of Humboldt Bay, saw his port’s project funding withdrawn. Mikkelsen, stated, “the federal [Trump] administration ran on rebuilding back America, building infrastructure, creating U.S. jobs, creating manufacturing – this project does all of that,” as quoted by NPR.

The grants had been aimed at building wind manufacturing and shipping centers in places like Maryland, Massachusetts, and Staten Island, New York. The steepest cut, however, falls on Northern California’s Humboldt Bay, which is set to forfeit more than $426 million in federal support.

“It’s the biggest we’ve seen in the century, there’s no doubt about it,” Mikkelsen. “We’re not talking about entry-level jobs. These are very skilled, very high-paying jobs. Jobs here in Humboldt County are in desperate need.”

READ: Trump moves to cancel $5 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid (

The Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind Heavy Lift Marine Terminal Project had counted on the federal grant as a cornerstone of its financing, alongside expected state and private investment. The plan called for environmental cleanup, new facilities to manage massive turbine components, dredging to accommodate larger vessels, and construction of an expanded wharf designed to handle steel sections longer than a football field.

Following the loss of funding, Mikkelsen expressed hope the project is only on hold, pointing to California’s aggressive renewable energy targets. The state aims to reach 100 percent zero-carbon electricity by 2045, and offshore wind is seen as especially valuable since it generates power during nighttime hours when solar output drops off.

“This hurts a little bit, but it doesn’t change our focus and it certainly doesn’t change our outcome,” Mikkelsen said. “An administration can’t change the fact that the U.S. has incredible energy demands.”

As electricity demand rises nationwide, driven in part by new AI-focused data centers, renewable sources like solar and wind offer a cost advantage over traditional natural gas and coal plants. Still, prices can fluctuate widely based on the project’s location and technology, underscoring both the potential and the challenges of scaling clean energy.",https://americanbazaaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Trump-and-White-town.png,N,,2025-09-01 12:03:24.084961

Transnet BW also calls for further research and pilot projects, which they say are necessary to enable large-scale deployment.","A state-funded project in Germany, run by TSO Transnet BW, has resulted in the development of a technology for grid stability at times of high use and fluctuating renewables by combining battery energy storage and a hydrogen-capable gas turbine.

German TSO Transnet BW, alongside experts from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Ulm University of Technology (THU), the Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research Baden-Württemberg (ZSW) developed the hybrid grid booster under the HydrogREenBoost project.

The now completed research project demonstrates that the tech is technically and economically viable, says the TSO in a release.

According to Transnet BW, it can make an important contribution to grid stability, balancing out periods of high utilisation and fluctuating renewable energy sources.

The components for the study were successfully tested under realistic conditions in a specially designed grid laboratory at THU. The integration of the components into a central control system was also designed and evaluated.

Under a test, the battery storage system was ramped up from standby to rated power within 2.4 seconds and replaced by the hydrogen turbine after 25.4 minutes. The test demonstrated a constant power range – flexible, efficient, and low-emission.

Grid boosters act as a type of safety buffer for the power grid, avoiding expensive redispatch measures such as curtailing renewable energy or ramping up conventional power plants, allowing the grid to be utilised more efficiently.

Focus on profitability

The project team examined several implementation scenarios.

A 500MW plant with a battery storage capacity of 176.5MWh and a turbine connected to the gas grid appears particularly promising, says Transnet BW.

Depending on the grid’s development status, the savings in redispatch costs and marketing on the balancing reserve market could result in payback periods of three to seven years. Variants with additional hydrogen storage increase the resilience of the entire system but result in higher costs.

Said Michael Jesberger, technical director of TransnetBW: “The project provides important insights for the efficient and cost-effective use of new technologies in the transmission grid.

“Hybrid grid boosters could play an important role in the implementation of the energy transition in the future.”

Future studies, says the TSO, should focus on alternative implementation strategies, revenue opportunities, and integration into existing grid topologies.

This new decree, stricter than the one adopted in 2024, aims to block any future transaction. Petro accuses his officials of bypassing his instructions and has mobilized the Colombian navy to physically prevent shipments to Israel.

Marginal energy impact for Israel

The practical effect of this decision on Israel’s supply remains limited. Coal occupies a declining share in Israel’s energy mix, increasingly replaced by natural gas from the Tamar and Leviathan offshore fields as well as renewables. Colombia, despite being Latin America’s largest coal producer, represents only a secondary supplier for Israel. The embargo therefore neither affects the country’s energy security nor the stability of its electricity infrastructure.

A weakened coal industry in Colombia

In Colombia, the measure comes in an unfavorable context for the coal industry. Exports, estimated at nearly $7 billion in 2023, have already fallen by half due to declining global prices and rising Indonesian competition. The ban targeting Israel has only a marginal impact on volumes but increases regulatory uncertainty and feeds the perception of politicization in the sector. Local mining unions emphasize that presidential decisions weigh more on market confidence than on real demand.

Anti-Americanism as a diplomatic axis

This decision is part of the rupture strategy Petro has pursued since taking office. By targeting Israel, he indirectly challenges the United States, Israel’s main military and strategic ally, and seeks to position Colombia within the Global South. This orientation allows him to promote an anti-imperialist narrative that strengthens his domestic electoral base. According to observers, the initiative is more about symbolic diplomacy than energy policy. It feeds his communication strategy by rallying his base with a simplified narrative tailored to their reach.

Shadows in the presidential trajectory

Petro’s trajectory continues to raise questions. A former member of the M-19 armed movement, he is accused of diverting attention from Colombia’s economic and social difficulties with high-profile international initiatives. According to some local investigations, suspicions exist around irregular political financing, and analysts mention possible indirect ramifications with cartel-linked structures, which remain influential in Colombia’s informal economy. These allegations, not officially proven, nevertheless fuel distrust and reinforce the idea that the president’s international stance serves his domestic balance as much as his diplomatic ambitions.

The manipulation of figures and the instrumentalization of the conflict

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict provides the framework for this strategy. The Hamas attack of October 7, 2023, which killed 1,219 people in Israel, triggered a retaliation that Gaza’s Ministry of Health – an organ under Hamas control – claims caused more than 63,000 deaths. These figures, considered “reliable” by some international bodies, are nevertheless disputed due to their origin and political use. From a demographic perspective, Gaza’s population, estimated at 2.2 million before the conflict, continues to grow despite the hostilities, raising questions about the relevance of the term “genocide” often invoked.

Israel, for its part, maintains energy security based on domestic gas resources and an active diversification of its mix. Petro’s decision, presented as an act of international solidarity, appears more as a diplomatic communication maneuver. It illustrates how some actors outside the conflict seek to place themselves at the center of the global debate, at the cost of mixing energy diplomacy with political calculations, mobilizing questionable data and rallying their electoral base through a simplified narrative.",https://energynews.pro/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/en_1140310835540-1.webp,N,,2025-09-01 13:02:48.234812

An increasingly charged global energy landscape requires European corporates to fine tune geopolitical risk management as never before.

Orsted’s travails are a cautionary tale of being caught on the wrong side of a diplomatic impasse.

The Danish state-backed renewables player was already reeling from President Donald Trump’s antipathy to offshore wind, having failed to find takers for a stake in its US project Sunrise Wind, a 924 MW offshore wind farm in New York. That led it down the path of unveiling a giant DKK 60bn (EUR 8bn) rights issue earlier this month.

A bad situation got worse following a stop-work order last weekend from the US Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) regarding Orsted’s 704 MW Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island, a 50/50 joint venture with Global Infrastructure Partner’s Skyborn Renewables.

Orsted was forced to reiterate the robustness of its capital plans in the face of the Revolution announcement, alongside more positive news about extending its underwriting syndicate.

As things stand, Orsted’s woes stand in stark contrast to the fate of Norwegian energy peer Equinor – whose own BOEM stop-work order in April for the USD 5bn Empire Wind 1/South Brooklyn Marine Terminal project was rescinded the following month after some whirlwind diplomacy.

Norwegian Finance Minister Jens Stoltenberg dusted off his transatlantic contact book, built having served as NATO secretary general from 2014-2024, to secure an agreement from the Trump administration to proceed.

“I commend the Trump Administration [sic] for our great cooperation,” Stoltenberg gushed on X (the social media platform formerly known as Twitter) on 20 May, hailing the Equinor deal.

Orsted appears to have no such diplomatic leverage and is at a positive disadvantage given Denmark’s ongoing tension with the Trump administration over the future of Greenland.

Eyebrows were raised last week when Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and California’s Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom signed a memorandum of understanding regarding cooperation on climate and technology.

An implacable enemy of Trump’s – aping his meme-fuelled online persona while engaging in tit-for-tat congressional redistricting efforts following Texas Republicans’ attempts to juice their position in the House of Representatives – Newsom’s palling with Rasmussen would have been a red rag to a bull.

The BOEM’s Revolution stop-work order came the next day, followed later this week by accusations from Denmark about the US undertaking covert influence operations in Greenland.

It’s tough to see how Orsted navigates this treacherous diplomatic terrain, in the context of a rights issue to fund US operations. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment on any political lobbying to ease its difficulties.

Homegrown hazards

Trump’s aversion to renewables is both ideological and financial – he sees the agenda as a threat to the US’s enormous fossil fuels industry.

As part of the controversial European Union (EU)-US trade deal struck last month, establishing a single 15% tariff ceiling for most EU goods, the trading bloc agreed to increase US energy imports to USD 750bn over the next three years.

The transmission mechanism for that promise looks shaky – the EU has neither the authority nor the muscle to impose the agreement on member states.

But as a contribution to the bloc’s approach to energy mix, it appears rather Janus-faced given European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s ongoing commitment to the European Green Deal, targeting net zero by 2050.

Then again, member states need no assistance from Brussels to confuse energy-focused corporates.

France’s political rollercoaster has seen endless delays to the unveiling of the government’s 2025-2035 energy strategy, set to establish a mix of objectives between nuclear, renewables and fossil fuels alongside a state investment framework.

Originally scheduled for publication in 2023, it has remained in development hell, with Le Figaro earlier this month describing the process around it as a “psychodrama”, as politicians from right and left denounce draft plans as either too focused on renewables or not green enough. An almost impossible position for embattled Prime Minister Francois Bayrou given his lack of a parliamentary majority.

Meanwhile, a report commissioned by the French and German governments for discussion at a historic joint cabinet meeting today (29 August) noted energy policies across the territories “suffer from a blatant lack of coordination and involve the risk of putting the two countries on a collision course”. Recommendations include joint procurement auctions for renewables and the formation of a bilateral energy council to facilitate greater policy cohesion.

There are 47 active auctions focused on energy utilities, renewable production and fossil fuels across Europe, according to Mergermarket’s proprietary data. Some 78 potential transactions are “Missing in Auction”, meaning there has been no update on their progress for six months.

With Europe’s energy market still heavily impacted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, any clarity on the meaning of the EU’s pledge to massively increase US energy imports and national governments committing to their mix of nuclear, renewables and fossil fuels could see many of those mothballed transactions come back to life.

A Communitywide Opportunity The move toward electric school buses isn’t just about buses.","By Olivia Xu • Student Action Committee Chair, student.action@newjersey.sierraclub.org

As the yellow school bus rolls through your neighborhood each morning, it may look the same as it has for decades—but a quiet revolution is coming. To reach the goal of 100% clean energy in New Jersey by 2035, electric school buses (ESBs) are on the rise, offering a cleaner, healthier alternative to their diesel-fueled predecessors. It is time for school districts to start encouraging state and federal authorities to join the commitment to electric school buses now.

The Problem With Diesel

Diesel exhaust created by diesel-powered school buses is highly toxic. Each time a diesel school bus starts its engine, it releases harmful pollutants, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), exposure to diesel exhaust causes serious respiratory health issues, especially for children, whose lungs are still developing. Studies have shown that concentrations of PM2.5 and air toxins are 4-12 times as high in school bus compartments as in ambient air.

Additionally, PM2.5 from diesel exhaust can enter the bloodstream, increasing the risk of chronic conditions like heart disease and even cancer. The World Health Organization has classified diesel exhaust as a Group 1 carcinogen, the most toxic of pollutants, placing it in the same category as asbestos and tobacco smoke.

In the United States, more than 20 million children ride school buses each day, yet over 90% of school buses that are operating run on diesel. That means millions of children are exposed to air pollution during their daily commute.

While students with asthma are the most visibly affected, all children who ride diesel buses breathe in these pollutants. If we continue to leave this issue for the future, the repeated exposure will add up and compound the health effects for young Americans.

Electric school buses eliminate this threat at the source. With zero tailpipe emissions, they do not pollute their own passenger compartments, and they make travel healthier for other motorists. Transitioning away from diesel isn’t just an environmentally mindful solution. It’s a public health imperative.

The Costs and the Bigger Picture

A new electric bus does have high initial costs, around $352,000, roughly three times the price of a diesel model. But that number doesn’t necessarily mean electric school buses cost more than fossil fuel–powered buses in the long run.

Electric buses cost far less to maintain and operate over time, although it has become more challenging to obtain funding. New Jersey’s $45 million Electric School Bus Program remains operational. However, ESB funding awards through the EPA’s $5 billion Clean School Bus Program were paused by the Trump administration in January 2025.

My school district, West Windsor-Plainsboro (WWP) can potentially become a leader in the transition to EVs.

Learning from Leaders

Other districts are already paving the way. Princeton Public Schools has begun its transition to electric by investing in two electric school buses, which are expected to begin service in the coming school year. In 2025, Maryland’s Prince George’s County committed to full electrification of its transit fleet by 2040 after student testimony spurred action. In California, the Cajon Valley Union School District has gone a step further, by feeding excess electricity from its ESB fleet back into the grid to save on energy costs.

Of course, while efforts are expected to be bumpy, many school districts were able to overcome them and receive benefits back in no time. In Montana, six school districts had initial concerns with winter reliability, but were still able to consistently cover the required daily route. In fact, they reported $1,575 in annual equivalent fuel savings compared with diesel buses. In California’s Compton district, charging logistics and the potential of power outages caused some fears the program would not work out. In response, the Compton district introduced hands-on training sessions back in January 2025 to aid with charging, schedules, and EV safety. These examples of ESB use prove that it can be done.

What School Districts Can Do

Start small: A district could begin with 1-2 electric buses to assess cost savings, maintenance, and rider feedback. Use this pilot data to build community support for expansion.

Use what you own: If your district already has solar generation and charging capability, find out whether that can support the use of ESBs or what else may be needed for the necessary upgrade.

Funding: Apply for NJ Department of Environmental Protection grants and other money. Supplement charging costs through PSE&G’s incentive program.

Demand more from contractors: Revise future transportation contracts to reward or require electric options. The Rick Bus Company is already taking steps—others should follow.

Center equity and health: Prioritize ESB for routes serving vulnerable communities. Every student deserves a clean, safe ride to school.

Make the effort: There will be obstacles, but there will be ways to maneuver around them.

A Communitywide Opportunity

The move toward electric school buses isn’t just about buses. It’s about what kind of district—and what kind of future—we want to build. Cleaner air, healthier kids, and smarter spending shouldn’t be luxuries.

By taking the first step, your school district can join a growing group of school districts across the country that are choosing progress over pollution. It’s time to put our values",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-01 13:03:29.089862

From construction sites and factories to ports and power plants, working people are the backbone of our economy and the foundation of our shared prosperity.

“Nowhere is that clearer than in the offshore wind industry, where labor is on the front lines. Today, more than 5,000 workers—many of them proud union members—are directly engaged with building this new American industry, with many thousands more manufacturing products across 40 States that will help lead to a new era of U.S. energy independence. These projects represent years of planning, billions of dollars in private investment, and the promise of tens of thousands of additional jobs. They are revitalizing our ports, strengthening our supply chains, and ensuring that America—not our competitors—leads in clean energy manufacturing and innovation.

“We are looking for the Trump Administration to uphold all offshore wind permits already granted and allow these projects to be constructed.

Workers, businesses, and communities need certainty, not reversals that would cost tens of thousands of American jobs and critical investment. Sudden reversals would also impact countless other workers and taxpayers on scores of non-energy public projects. The U.S. markets operate on certainty. Canceling projects that have already been fully permitted--including some near completion—sends the worrisome message to investors that the work can be stopped on a whim, which could lead them to decide to either not finance different projects or impose higher interest rates that would ultimately place a bigger burden on taxpayers.

“At the same time, we remain committed to ensuring that the electric grid is reliable, resilient and affordable. Offshore wind and other renewables are central to that effort, but it must be complemented by a diverse mix of resources—including nuclear power, natural gas, hydropower, and other technologies—that together keep our system strong and our energy sources secure.

On January 23, 2025, President Trump signed an order (EO 14179) to retool America’s policy for AI development. Trump’s order focused on speed, deregulation, and global AI dominance. It removed Biden-era safeguards for worker protection, cybersecurity, product safety, and fairness in AI contracting. Now growing rapidly, the AI industry will be an enormous consumer of electricity. It must be reliant on clean energy to mitigate the threat of global warming.

“AI data centers have two unique energy-related features compared with traditional ones: They have an enormous appetite for electricity, with generative AI [able to create new text, images, code, etc.] consuming 10-30 times more energy than task-specific AI, and they require advanced liquid-based cooling solutions, as they generate substantially more heat than traditional [cloud or web-hosting] operations,” according to the American Action Forum, an independent policy advisory body.

Power demand for data centers in the United States is expected to reach 606 terawatt-hours (TWh) by 2030, up from 147 TWh in 2023. AI data centers used 3.7% of total US electricity in 2023. By 2030, data centers will account for 11.7% of total US power demand. The United States needs to quickly develop new sources of energy and increase generation capacity by upgrading existing infrastructure.

The competitive advantage for quick and affordable development of new sources belongs to renewable energy. “While solar and onshore wind farms normally take less than two years to build, gas-fired power plants usually take as many as four years to become operational, and can also require construction of gas pipeline infrastructure,” according to the World Resources Institute.”

On average in 2024, solar power was 41% cheaper than the lowest-cost fossil fuel power, and onshore wind was 53% cheaper than fossil fuel–based generation. Onshore wind remained the most affordable new source of electricity at $0.034 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), with solar following at $0.043/kWh. Clearly, renewables are the most scalable and affordable means to meet rapidly growing energy demand.

AI data centers and next-generation chip foundries demand vast, uninterrupted flows of energy, and fossil fools are quick to point out the intermittent (fluctuating) nature of sun and wind power. Yet, fossil fuel power stations experience outages, such as those in Texas during the 2021 Ground Hog Day blizzard. The recent blackout in Spain is attributed to conventional power plants using coal, gas and nuclear that failed to help maintain an appropriate voltage level. Denmark, whose primary energy source is renewable, has a grid reliability of 99.9%. This corresponds to an average consumer being without electricity for around 40 minutes a year. Yet, in practice, many consumers never experience an outage during the year.

The discussion of providing reliable energy needs to include energy backup. Small data centers rely on gasoline or natural gas generators in the event of blackouts, but large AI data centers will require grid-scale type energy storage systems. Google partnered with Energy Dome to provide long-duration CO2 batteries for 24/7 carbon-free data centers across Europe, the Americas, and the Asia-Pacific. California-based B2U Storage Solutions is building a new battery energy storage facility east of San Antonio, Texas, that will be powered by used EV batteries. Energy storage will play an important role in the age of AI.

Finally, the aging grid wasn’t designed to accommodate today’s rising household electricity needs and electric vehicles, let alone the massive demands from data centers. Utility companies must invest in costly upgrades to increase transmission capacity and to integrate power sources. Those costs, which are ultimately passed on to customers, could cause electric bills to increase as much as 70% by 2029, according to the Jack Kemp Foundation.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-01 13:02:58.048690

Dessler is just one of many leading climate scientists who voiced concerns about the DOE report, saying it is riddled with errors, shows signs of bias and misrepresents some research findings in order to downplay the threats from climate change.

After sifting through sections on heat waves, ice melt, agricultural impacts and other climate effects, Dessler said the final reply weighs in at a hefty 439 pages—about three times longer than the original report.

""This is related to Brandolini's law,"" Dessler said on the social media site Bluesky, referencing a popular maxim about misinformation. ""The amount of energy needed to refute [B.S.] is an order of magnitude bigger than that needed to produce it.""

Dessler and the dozens of scientists who contributed to the response were willing to do that extra work because of the high stakes involved. Far from just an arcane scientific dispute, the DOE report is part of a larger effort to roll back more than a decade of climate-related regulations.

The Trump administration is working to revoke a landmark 2009 government finding that climate change and the greenhouse gases causing it constitute a threat to public health and welfare. That ruling, known as the ""endangerment"" finding, provided the scientific and legal basis for the regulation of greenhouse gases.

Overturning it could begin to unravel more than a decade of rules on emissions from power plants, autos and other sources, a move that has massive implications for our environment and economy.

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said at a press event in late July that he thought that rules limiting carbon pollution were a greater danger than climate change.

""Emissions standards themselves, not carbon dioxide which the finding never assessed independently, was the real threat to Americans' livelihoods,"" Zeldin said.

The administration's extraordinary action would remove a keystone of the country's climate regulation just as the world experiences unprecedented heat and climate-driven extreme weather disasters. Climate scientists have determined that the last two years have been the warmest on record and likely the hottest in thousands of years.

Clean energy leaders said that revoking the endangerment finding also puts businesses at risk.

""Policy uncertainty, especially on something as important as climate change, is going to be detrimental to investment,"" Lisa Jacobson, president of the Business Council for Sustainable Energy, told Newsweek. ""It's going to disrupt business planning that's already been underway.""

Jacobson's group has 65 member companies and trade associations focused on energy efficiency, natural gas, renewable energy, energy storage and sustainable transportation. She said energy businesses have been able to reduce emissions from the power sector as the economy grew.

""We don't have to choose between growing our economy, meeting new energy resource needs and addressing air quality and climate change,"" Jacobson said. ""But what we need is a clear direction on policy to enable us to make these long-term investments.""

A retreat from federal regulation could sow chaos, Jacobson said.

""It will make more of a patchwork of policies,"" she warned. ""And I think a big concern to industry is the litigation risk.""

Anne Kelly is vice president of government relations for Ceres, a nonprofit organization that works with businesses and investors to accelerate a clean energy transition. She said the legal landscape for companies could become far more difficult without the EPA regulating greenhouse gas emissions.

""As a baseline for stability and predictability, the law has served us well for 16 years,"" Kelly told Newsweek. ""It kind of levels the playing field by having one clear, certain administrative remedy.""

The Supreme Court determined in 2011 that climate-related legal claims against private entities were displaced by EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gases. Removing that authority could open the courtroom doors to more lawsuits against businesses.

When President Trump first proposed revoking the endangerment finding during his first term in office, the Congressional Research Service cautioned that ""climate change litigation may potentially increase.""

Kelly said the administration's move to undo climate regulation on behalf of industry could end up exposing businesses to more liability.

""You take away the stability of the administrative rule, well, now you're into the Wild West of common law, nuisance, who knows?"" she said. ""It's almost like the more conservative position is to stick with what has worked up to this time.""

The administration has extended its comment period on its proposal to revoke the endangerment finding to September 22. The comments the agencies receive will include the 400-plus page response from Andrew Dessler and other scientists.

""People are really mad,"" Dessler said. ""When we see something like this, something that is really a mockery of science, it can't help but just infuriate you.""",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2712744/greenhouse-gases-power-plant.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 11:04:53.418367

Katherine Yusko, research analyst at the project and the report's lead author, explained the pace of EV sales in the U.S.

""They have slowed a little bit,"" Yusko observed. ""They've been less dramatic than perhaps was expected, and this is in part because of the politicization of electric vehicles, their association with climate change, people worry.

The report added the American EV market is a strategic asset and without bold investment and new trade alliances, the U.S. could cede the future to China. Right now, China is the largest EV market in the world by a wide margin, producing 70% of the world’s EVs and 80% of the world’s lithium-ion batteries.

Michigan is positioned to become a leader in battery production by 2030, with billions in investments planned but the goal hinges on federal policy to support it. Yusko argued government support serves an important role in the success of any nation's EV industry.

""In China, we see the government playing a substantial part in really driving forward the EV factor, and we could see the same happen in the U.S., not perhaps in the same way,"" Yusko noted. ""But, certainly, the government has major influence over the course of this industry.""

Solar PV is ideal for electricity needs, while solar thermal can be utilised for both heat and electricity demand.","A balanced approach that includes both solar photovoltaic and solar thermal, backed by strong policy support, local manufacturing and circularity infrastructure, is essential to ensure India’s energy security.

India is celebrating its milestone of achieving half of the total electric power installed capacity (484.8 GW) from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources, as envisaged in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for 2030 under the Paris Agreement.

The majority of India’s non-fossil power comes from solar photovoltaic (SPV) systems with an installed capacity of 116.25 GW.

Solar energy can be harnessed mainly through the SPV route by converting sunlight directly to electricity via solar cells, and through the solar thermal (ST) route, collecting solar energy as heat, which can be utilised directly or converted into electricity.

However, cost-effectiveness, ease of deployment and policy support have put SPV systems at the forefront of India’s Net Zero agenda. The share of solar thermal technologies in India’s total installed solar capacity is only 0.28%. Their contribution to the energy mix remains marginal, with an installed capacity of just 329.5 MW, of which only 101 MW is operational.

In India’s celebratory march, a critical question remains: Are we becoming too dependent on SPV while ignoring the promising potential of ST technologies?

Reliance on imports

There’s a need to evaluate the potential consequences of India’s extremely high dependence on SPV technology.

This is because the raw materials involved in manufacturing SPV panels such as polysilicon, ingot/wafer (the raw material used in solar cell manufacturing) and solar cells are mostly imported while other parts, such as aluminium frame, junction box/ wiring and encapsulant, are manufactured domestically.

In 2023-24, 56 percent and 65 percent of the total imports of solar cells and modules, respectively, were from China alone.

Even after achieving self-reliance in solar manufacturing, India’s huge dependence on the import of essential critical minerals to support its growth in the renewable energy sector is a big challenge.

Silicon, tellurium, indium and gallium are the essential critical minerals involved in the manufacturing of SPV systems. India imports 40 percent of these minerals from China. Moreover, the country is 100 percent import dependent for lithium, cobalt and nickel, which are used in electrochemical batteries.

Production gaps

Solar panels and solar cell manufacturing have gained traction in India over the last three-four years due to global geopolitical instabilities such as trade tensions and supply chain disruptions. The Government of India (GoI) has taken some necessary steps to achieve self-sufficiency in solar module manufacturing, such as the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM), which includes the models and list of manufacturers eligible to be utilised in any government project, and the Production-linked Incentives (PLI), a GoI initiative that offers financial incentives to companies based on their increased domestic manufacturing output.

However, the current capacity of solar panels and solar cell manufacturing is 74 GW and 25 GW, respectively. This is insufficient to support the country’s future demands of 500 GW of non-fossil capacity by 2030 because not all facilities run at full capacity, solar modules wear out faster, need replacing, and cell production is limited to 25 GW.

End-of-Life waste disposal and critical mineral recovery

Another issue with the rise of PV installation is the large amount of solar waste generated. By 2030, India is expected to create approximately 600 kilotonnes of solar waste, a volume equivalent to 720 Olympic swimming pools.

As per India’s E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2022, solar PV manufacturers are required to manage the collection, secure storage and certified recycling of used panels under the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework. However, at present, only about 20 percent of materials from discarded solar panels are officially recovered, while the remaining 80 percent are often handled informally or dumped in landfills.

Discarded solar panels contain critical minerals like silicon, copper, cadmium and tellurium, whose recovery can support India’s mineral security. However, if not appropriately managed, toxic elements such as lead and cadmium can pollute soil and water, especially in remote and densely populated areas where solar projects are located.

The economic viability of solar panel recycling largely depends on recovering valuable metals, which make up only a small fraction of the panel’s weight, making the process less financially attractive.

Unsafe handling and disposal also pose serious health risks to workers involved in dismantling and recycling of solar panels. According to a World Health Organization report, a significant proportion of child labour, often as young as five years, is involved in India’s informal e-waste management sector. Therefore, responsible solar waste management is crucial at this time.

A missed opportunity

While solar thermal may not replace all the applications of solar PV, there are a few which can be better managed by using solar thermal.

Non-concentrating solar thermal collectors, in which the whole collector area captures sunlight without focus, can be utilised for low-temperature applications such as water heating.

However, concentrating solar power (CSP) systems, in which mirrors and lenses are used to concentrate sunlight on a small absorber area, are suitable for high-temperature applications such as power generation, institutional cooking and industrial process heating.

In India, industries consume 40 percent of the final energy primarily in the form of heat, which comes from fossil fuels. Therefore, CSP can play a significant role in industrial decarbonisation. Regions such as Rajasthan and Gujarat have high solar irradiance (power of sunlight received per unit area on the earth’s surface). In such regions, CSP integrated with appropriate thermal energy storage (TES) technology can be a potential option for round-the-clock clean power generation. Independent solar energy collection and power generation loops make it a suitable power generation technology for hybrid power plants.

Integrating costly ($200–300/kWh) electrochemical batteries in large-scale SPV plants to prevent a drop in solar output due to changes in sunlight received on earth is economically unviable. In contrast, CSP coupled with TES offers a cost-effective alternative, enabling reliable and on-demand electricity generation.

Recently, the government planned to withdraw the Inter-State Transmission System charge waivers for solar PV projects. This will increase the cost of delivered SPV power, potentially affecting their competitiveness and large-scale deployment in India. Despite this, government support for solar thermal technologies remains limited compared to that for SPV technologies. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy offers interest subsidies for solar water heaters, but there is minimal support for CSP.

India currently depends heavily on imports for evacuated tube collectors, a type of non-concentrating collector tube, primarily from China and Turkey. While there is comparatively lower import reliance on glass mirrors, India has domestic manufacturing capability for other components of solar thermal technologies such as structural frames, tracking mechanisms, piping, valves and pumps.

Although materials like glass, copper, aluminium and insulation used in solar thermal collectors are theoretically recyclable, the country currently lacks organised systems for formal recycling.

Diversification is key to security

India doesn’t need to choose between solar PV and solar thermal; it needs to embrace both strategically. The right technology can be deployed for the right need. Solar PV is ideal for electricity needs, while solar thermal can be utilised for both heat and electricity demand. A more balanced approach that includes both PV and solar thermal—backed by strong policy support, local manufacturing and waste management infrastructure—is essential to ensure energy security.

It is time to reverse this missed opportunity and start viewing solar thermal as an essential partner for India’s Net Zero growth.

The New Jersey Office of Emergency Management is urging residents to not only learn about their flood risks, but to stay prepared.
In July, two New Jersey residents were killed during a heavy storm.

Let us know!

As the remnants of Hurricane Erin hit New Jersey in August, waves rolled across beaches and into dunes and boardwalks. Streets became flooded, and emergency responders were called to rescue drivers. Beach erosion in some towns left municipalities scrambling to fix access before the busy Labor Day weekend.

With increased flood risks caused in part by climate change, New Jersey is taking steps to raise awareness.

The state launched its first-ever Flood Safety Week in August, offering residents tips on how to stay safe, and released a report highlighting programs that aim to mitigate flooding and address climate change.

The initiative comes four years after the remnants of Hurricane Ida caused widespread flooding throughout the state.

“Over the past year, New Jerseyans have experienced the effects of extreme weather on our communities,” said Gov. Phil Murphy in a statement. “As we approach the fourth anniversary of Hurricane Ida, we are focused on strengthening our resilience to extreme weather events so that we can better mitigate climate threats.”

New Jersey, which has more than 18,000 miles of rivers and streams and 1,800 miles of ocean and estuarine coastlines, has always been prone to extreme flooding. But floods have become more frequent as climate change threatens more intense storms. New Jersey is among the top states in the nation for receiving post-disaster assistance through the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

“We’re surrounded by water on three sides, the Delaware River being our western boundary,” said Shawn LaTourette, Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. “So, we have a significant inland flooding risk in addition to the coastal risk, and the two come together to be quite punishing to our communities.”

He calls New Jersey “ground zero” for some of the worst impacts of climate change — sea level rise is occurring at twice the global average, and the state is experiencing more precipitation than anyone has ever planned for. The state also faces droughts between periods of sudden, intense rainfall that sometimes overwhelm aging water infrastructure.

Loss of federal funding will hurt NJ’s efforts to prevent coastal flooding

New Jersey has taken on several initiatives to protect the state’s ecosystem, improve its coastal resilience and educate the public. These include programs offering home buyouts in flood-prone areas and creating living shorelines. The state also offers planning assistance to local governments to help them better prepare for flooding.

However, the state faced setbacks this year when the federal budget for the first time cut funding to beach nourishment programs that pump sand from the ocean floor onto the beach to replace what was washed away by storms.

LaTourette called the decision “disheartening.”

“That leaves communities in the lurch because these projects are so expensive. The state government can’t possibly do it by themselves,” he said. “The federal government brings in about 65% to 75% of the cost of a shore protection program and the state brings in 35% or 25% depending on the particular project in question.”

Last week’s severe erosion caused by the remnants of Hurricane Erin is foretelling of how reduced federal funding could impact the state, LaTourette said.

“Imagine no dune system to stop those waves, that’s what we’ll be left with,” he said. “So what happens when the next storm comes and it’s closer? Does that boardwalk survive? That’s the question I think we want to ask our federal representatives and the federal government that has always been there to help us in years past.”

NJ urges residents to know their flood risk and have a plan

DEP’s Know Your Flood Risk tool uses FEMA and state flood zone maps to help residents understand their flood risk and take action to protect themselves. Fifteen percent of the state’s landmass is within a floodplain.

The New Jersey Office of Emergency Management is urging residents to not only learn about their flood risks, but to stay prepared. In July, two New Jersey residents were killed during a heavy storm.

The agency recommends creating an emergency kit with food, water and medication and signing up for weather alerts. In addition, residents are urged to stay away from downed power lines and avoid driving through floodwaters.

“Flood Safety Week is your reminder: flooding can happen anywhere, even outside a known flood zone,” said Colonel Patrick Callahan, New Jersey State Police Superintendent and State Director of Emergency Management, in a statement. “The time to prepare is now, because readiness is the key to protecting your family, your home, and your community when the waters rise.

Lithium is vital to a variety of climate technologies, particularly Li-ion batteries used for energy storage and electrification.

“Just as we have contributed to making Chile the world leader in copper production, we will now contribute to making our country a leader in the production of lithium, another mineral critical to the energy transition, which will allow us to fight the climate emergency,” says Codelco Chairman Máximo Pacheco.

“We will do so as partners of SQM, a Chilean company that has the scale, technical and human expertise, financial resources and sales network that we need to avoid missing the opportunities that now open themselves up to us.”

About Codelco

The National Copper Corporation of Chile, known as Codelco, is part of Chile's copper mining heritage, playing an integral role since its inception in 1976.

Headquartered in Santiago, it aims to explore, develop and exploit mineral resources, produce refined products and market them to clients around the world.

Codelco has seven mining divisions:

Chuquicamata

Ministro Hales

Radomiro Tomic

Gabriela Mistral

Salvador

Andina

El Teniente

By 2030, the company aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 70%, in part by implementing a 100% clean energy matrix.

It also aims to recycle 65% of its industrial waste and reduce its consumption of inland water by 60%.

What is SQM?

SQM (Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile) is a Chilean supplier of lithium, iodine and industrial chemicals.

Its main production facilities are located in the Atacama Desert in Tarapacá and Antofagasta regions.

“The projects we are going to develop with Codelco will be extraordinarily positive for Chile, the Antofagasta Region, communities, workers and for both companies,” says Ricardo Ramos, CEO of SQM.

“This partnership is proof of the confidence we inspire with our over 25 years of experience producing lithium from the Salar de Atacama and refining it at the chemical plant in Antofagasta, our operational efficiency and the business synergies.

“We are committed to compliance with the highest environmental standards and an ongoing process of dialogue with Atacameño communities to protect the salt marsh’s ecosystem.”

Why is lithium important?

Lithium is found in rocks and salt flats in the earth’s crust and 85% of the world’s reserves are in South America’s ‘lithium triangle’.

Chile is the world’s second largest producer of lithium behind Australia, responsible for 29% of global production.

Primarily, lithium is used in electric vehicles and energy storage.

It is also involved in the manufacturing of glass, ceramic and electronic goods.

Lithium has high electrochemical potential and low weight, making it useful in lithium-ion batteries that power everything from EVs and mobile devices to grid-scale renewable energy storage systems.

Renewable energy sources, like wind and solar, generate power intermittently so energy storage is needed to capture electricity when production is high and put it to use when demand rises or production falls.

However, there are negative environmental impacts associated with the mining and processing of lithium, such as water use and carbon emissions.

With concerns such as cyberattacks or AI-driven equipment failures already on the radar of offshore operators, the paper demonstrates that less detectable risks, those emerging from unpredictable interactions between humans and AI, pose the greatest threat to operational safety.

AI is emerging as a useful tool in many industries, often in a bottom-up way as individuals use AI-based tools in their daily work. At the same time, AI technology itself is evolving at high-speed, with new capabilities and potential applications constantly arising.

Graham Faiz Head of Digital Energy at DNV said: ""Ensuring safety in the face of a disruptive new technology is paramount, particularly in the offshore environment. AI will certainly find applications within the sector; however, its emergence presents a real challenge to regulators due to its disruptive nature, extremely rapid pace of development and easy accessibility to individuals. For example, if an individual engineer uses a generative AI engine to write standard operating procedures for a new piece of equipment, how does the industry ensure that maximum safety is maintained? This is just one example of how AI-related risks could potentially overwhelm traditional safety mechanisms.""

To address this growing challenge, DNV's research proposes a systemic safety framework that incorporates safety engineering principles and AI assurance across the entire system lifecycle.

AI will be tested in offshore settings to understand and manage safety risks. Specific scenarios, known as ‘use cases', will be studied to spot dangers and suggest ways to reduce them, focusing on how AI changes over time, how complex its decisions can be, and how it affects both people and the wider system. This approach forms the basis of the safety framework.

Hari Vamadevan, Senior Vice President and Regional Director UK and Ireland, Energy Systems at DNV, said: ""Offshore Europe brings together organisations and industry leaders from across the global energy sector, making it the ideal platform to showcase innovation and contribute to critical industry conversations. AI is becoming increasingly ingrained in the industry, and as humans and AI become more integrated their interactions become more unpredictable. However, we have seen little consideration of how existing safety systems can address this new technology. A new approach is needed to directly address the emergent risks of AI integration across our industry.

""As the UK continues to build out its renewable energy infrastructure, we see a strong opportunity to develop and embed robust safety frameworks, which include the use of AI, from the very beginning. By identifying and mitigating potential risks, our work aims to prevent unintended consequences and ensure the safe integration of AI in safety-critical operations.""

This year's paper is a continuation of DNV's research that was presented at OE23, which found that although AI is being readily used across the sector, there was a lack of trust in the technology. Two years on, the conversation has shifted to how the industry can address the challenges that AI will introduce. A 2025 DNV survey found that, of 1160 companies across Europe, North America, Central and South America, and Asia, 60% of respondents state that they will use AI-driven applications in their operations in the year ahead; up from 47% in 2024.

The research will be presented at OE25, taking place 2-5 September at P&J Live, Aberdeen. There are 18 other technical sessions on the programme, including Net Zero: Net Zero to 2050, Oil and Gas: Development Drilling, and Oil and Gas: Decom. A record 600 abstracts were submitted by businesses across the energy supply chain for consideration for this year's conference.

DNV will present its technical paper and findings as part of the Digital: AI Supported Subsurface technical session on Wednesday, 3 September at 2:30pm in Meeting Room 7. With the offshore industry pushing forward on digital transformation and net-zero goals, DNV's findings are expected to play a key role in shaping safety standards and AI governance across the sector.

PJM Interconnection, the nonprofit that manages the country’s largest electricity grid region, is barely known by the general public and almost never mentioned by elected officials — except when something bad happens.

Well, something bad has happened. For two years in a row, PJM’s process for ensuring the grid has sufficient power plant capacity has resulted in record high prices, which will get passed on to consumers. The results are tied to rising electricity demand for data centers and a bottleneck in approving grid connections for new projects.

Almost everything about these events is bound up in layers of complexity.

Energy bills likely to tick up again in 2026 after electricity auction clears at maximum price

To explain what’s happening, my colleague Rambo Talabong put together some charts and I spoke with energy policy experts. Together, we aim to make this situation understandable.

PJM, based in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, oversees the grid and electricity markets in a territory that stretches from New Jersey to Chicago. The organization has roots in a 1920s partnership between utilities in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

“It’s a bunch of utilities who have come together and said, ‘We can provide more reliable, less expensive electric service to customers if we work together and have a mutual aid pact,’” said Abe Silverman, an energy research scholar at Johns Hopkins University who has a background working in utility regulation and the energy industry.

“When a customer in New Jersey can buy power from a power plant in New Jersey, or a power plant in Pennsylvania or a power plant in Ohio, it’s going to be cheaper than if they were just buying from power plants from New Jersey,” Silverman said.

One of the ways PJM manages its system is by holding an auction in which power plant owners compete to see who will offer the lowest prices to be available to the grid at all times.

The result is a “capacity price,” which is the price set to ensure that there are enough resources to meet the region’s needs on the hottest days of summer. The price sets the level of payments to participating power plants, which is an important income source for them in addition to what they make from selling electricity.

Here are the results of the last decade of auctions, and you can see why electricity consumers are feeling the sting.

Last year, the auction produced a result so unusual that this topic, usually reserved for the business press, became general news. The new price, which took effect two months ago, was $269.92 per megawatt-day, an increase from $28.92 per megawatt-day in the previous delivery year.

The most recent auction was last month, yielding an even higher price, $329.17 per megawatt-day. This price will take effect next June.

Since a megawatt-day (which is 24 megawatt-hours) is a unit that most people don’t use or understand, it’s easier to put these results in terms of how many billions of dollars power plant owners stand to receive in aggregate. The change from two years ago is dizzying, going from a low of $2.2 billion to the most recent result of $16.1 billion.

Governors across PJM territory have voiced their displeasure. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, said, “What PJM has laid out is a slap in the face.”

Why did costs go up so much? There are many reasons, but the main one is that electricity demand is soaring, largely due to the development of data centers. The upward curve in PJM’s long-term forecast is in contrast to the prior decade-plus of flat growth.

“Supply and demand,” said Daniel Lockwood, a PJM spokesman, when asked about the reasons for rising costs. “Unprecedented and continuing growth in demand from the proliferation of high-demand data centers in the region.”

Silverman from Johns Hopkins agreed that this is, by far, the leading factor.

When demand is flat, old and inefficient power plants often struggle to compete, leading plant owners to close the plants that are losing money or barely profitable. Since 2000, PJM has seen a shift as coal-fired power plants reached the end of their lives and were replaced by natural gas plants and some renewables.

The retirement of old coal plants was good for the environment, but the rapid loss of those plants has helped to intensify the supply crunch that’s now happening.

But plant retirements are only part of the picture.

One of the reasons PJM is struggling to secure enough power plant capacity is the organization’s challenges in connecting new plants to the grid.

PJM has an online queue in which owners of prospective power plants get in line to gain approval to hook up to interstate power lines. Ideally, this would be a fast process, but the queue has turned into a quagmire of long waits, meaning the grid isn’t getting some of the new power plants that would otherwise be ready.

Most of the affected projects are solar arrays, the results of a solar boom across much of PJM territory.

Some caveats: Some of the projects in the queue are highly speculative and unlikely to get built, so the numbers can be misleading. Also, some projects are held back by more than just PJM, with challenges getting local permits and other factors.

As of June, there were 63 gigawatts of projects waiting in PJM’s interconnection process that should be completed by the end of 2026, according to Lockwood, the PJM spokesman. He noted that there are 46 gigawatts of projects that have agreements to plug into the grid today, but some aren’t being built because of factors beyond PJM’s control, such as siting, permitting and financing.

Clean energy and consumer advocates have said PJM often acts as an obstacle to reducing dependence on fossil fuels.

“The power grid operator’s policy decisions too often favor outdated, expensive power plants and needlessly block low-cost clean energy resources and battery projects from connecting to the grid and bringing down prices,” said Sarah Moskowitz, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Illinois, in a statement. “This extended price spike was preventable.”

Here are some of the wait times broken down by technology.

So, how much is a household’s electricity bill rising because of all this?

I asked several of the largest utilities in PJM for specifics. Their answers had wide variations, which helps to show differences in rate structures, state regulations and other factors that affect how and when the PJM charges reach consumers.

PSEG, the largest utility in New Jersey, notified customers in February of an impending 17 percent rate increase that was largely due to the rise in PJM charges. As of June, a household using 650 kilowatt-hours per month now paid $183, which was $27 more than before.

ComEd, which serves the Chicago area, has increased its residential bills by roughly 10 percent because of the surge in PJM charges that took effect in June. A typical household, which uses 609 kilowatt-hours per month, is paying $117, which is $11 more than before.

Dominion, which is the largest utility in Virginia and also has PJM customers in North Carolina, said its customers were largely insulated from PJM costs because the company gets most of its electricity from power plants that it owns. This is different from most large utilities in PJM, which do not directly own power plants and use market-based systems to obtain electricity for customers.

The total monthly cost for PJM capacity, even after the increase, would be less than $2 per month, according to a Dominion spokesman.

Just like PJM’s capacity prices have gone up, they can come back down. But for that to happen, some of the market fundamentals will need to change. I don’t expect that to happen any time soon.

So you’re probably going to keep hearing about PJM in the context of explanations for high electricity prices.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_7706-2048x1536-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 09:59:46.105409

The plant is the third – and likely the last – mothballed reactor in the U.S. that is in shape to come back online to support growing electricity demand in the U.S.

Duane Arnold would follow similar restarts planned for the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan and Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, which plan to resume operations later this year and in 2027, respectively, subject to approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved a request last week from NextEra Energy, Duane Arnold's owner, to let the nuclear plant reconnect to the electric grid. NextEra sees Duane Arnold restarting operations by the fourth quarter of 2028 at the earliest, according to FERC filings.

""While a significant amount of work needs to be done before the facility could be restarted, FERC's decision is another positive step in the process,"" Neil Nissan, a NextEra spokesperson, said in a statement to CNBC.

Power purchase agreement

With big technology companies looking to feed more nuclear power on to the grid to fuel the electricity-hungry data centers they are building to train artificial intelligence, Florida-based NextEra is aiming to win a lucrative power purchase agreement to restart Duane Arnold. Three Mile Island, for example, is restarting with financial support from a power agreement with Microsoft .

""The recommissioning of Duane Arnold has received significant commercial interest from premier American companies,"" Garrett Goldfinger, the NextEra executive in charge of the restart project, told FERC in a late July filing.

Duane Arnold would bring more than 600 megawatts of electricity back to the grid, equivalent to the electricity needs of more than 400,000 homes.

""If we're successful in bringing Duane forward, that obviously creates a hot bed of data center activity around that facility,"" NextEra CEO John Ketchum told investors on the company's July earnings call.

'Unicorn opportunities'

Duane Arnold, Palisades and Three Mile Island are three of the 10 U.S. reactors that closed over the past decade as nuclear power strained to compete against cheap natural gas and renewable energy.

Restarting these plants is the most concrete sign yet that the nuclear industry is coming back after years of financial struggles.

""These are unique opportunities because you don't face the new build costs associated with nuclear,"" Ketchum said on NextEra's earnings call. ""These are really unicorn-type opportunities.""

NextEra, the largest renewable power developer in the U.S., had previously divided up Duane Arnold's grid connection among multiple solar farms that the company was developing in response to the demand in Iowa for lower cost electricity.

But the market last year started to shift back in favor of high-capacity nuclear power as the U.S. saw an unprecedented increase in electricity demand from industry and data centers, NextEra said in its filing to FERC.

NextEra is now consolidating those solar grid connections back into a single one for Duane Arnold after securing FERC approval. This will ""provide commercial and financial certainty to support the recommissioning effort and expedite the resumption of clean, reliable operations at Duane Arnold,"" Goldfinger told FERC.

Capital intensive

NextEra said the restart of Duane Arnold will be a ""highly capital-intensive process."" It disclosed in its filing to FERC that it plans on spending as much as $100 million in 2025 alone on the project.

NextEra has placed orders for new transformers to replace the ones that were removed when the plant was shut down, although the transformers face significant supply chain constraints and will take about three years to deliver. The plant's cooling towers, administration building and training center were also dismantled and need to be replaced.

The nuclear industry has a long history of projects delays, Goldfinger cautioned, and the Duane Arnold restart could take longer than expected if the transformers, for example, are delivered late.

While there are risks, Duane Arnold represents a financial opportunity for NextEra, the parent company of Florida Power & Light. The stock has barely moved this year despite growing power demand, a sharp reversal from 2024 when shares jumped 18% Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump's repeated attacks on renewable energy have shaken investor confidence in solar and wind power.

Solar and wind projects will no longer be eligible for two key tax credits after 2027, which is expected to crimp demand for renewables. Duane Arnold restarting in 2028 could help offset some of the lost earnings from the phase out of the tax credits, Ketchum said on the July earnings call.

Since 2020, the city has required all new builds to use electricity for water heating, heating and cooling systems, and cooking appliances. The proposed change would require homes and businesses undergoing major renovations to do the same. However, buildings with gas appliances protected under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act are exempt, and affordable housing units would get a temporary exemption.

""I do think the climate crisis is real,"" Board of Supervisors President Rafael Mandelman told CBS News, which summarized the proposed change. ""The health impacts of natural gas and fossil fuels are real, and we can't ignore them. We have to address them.""

For one, gas stoves emit dangerous toxins such as benzene, nitrogen dioxide, and methane into your home. In fact, one reporter recently did an experiment with two scientists in her home, finding that her gas stove not only released these gases into her kitchen but also spread into her child's room and living room. Meanwhile, the gas readings didn't go up when she used her plug-in induction stovetop.

Natural gas, along with other dirty fuel sources like coal, is also a major contributor to the overheating of our planet.

If you're looking to go electric at home, an induction stove is an easy and affordable solution. These nifty appliances can also help you cook faster. And there's no better time than the present, as you can get up to $840 off the cost of a new induction stove through the Inflation Reduction Act through the end of the year.

If you are a renter or can't afford a larger investment right now, plug-in induction burners are an excellent alternative. Starting at around $50, induction burners offer the same benefits as an induction stove on a smaller scale.

However, with lignite reserves running low, and pressure mounting to decarbonise, industry needs to urgently weigh the best and most sustainable path forward for the energy complex.

By Monika Manowska, Investment Advisor at Energy Investment Management BV and Economics student at Erasmus University Rotterdam

Established in 1975 by PGE (Polska Grupa Energetyczna), a Polish state-owned energy company, the Bełchatów complex is the largest lignite mine and power station in Europe.

Bełchatów generates nearly 20% of Poland’s total electricity and accounts for approximately 72% of coal energy in Poland. However, the power complex is also one of the biggest pollutants, emitting around 27 million tonnes of CO2 each year, an amount equivalent to almost 9% of Poland’s total emissions.

Now, as the lignite necessary for the complex to keep on operating is running out and pressure from the European Union’s climate policies increases, questions arise concerning what lies ahead for Bełchatów and the future of energy in Poland.

The end of lignite

The Bełchatów complex is heavily reliant on lignite, a finite resource which is expected to run out by 2036 at the latest. As such, the shutdown of the powerplant is not up for debate, but rather an eventuality that the region, as well as the whole of Poland must now prepare for.

The official closure roadmap for the coal complex is a gradual scale down in the 2030’s and closure of the powerplant by 2036, followed by the closure of the last mine by 2038.

However, these dates are not confirmed as range of economic or regulatory factors could accelerate or delay the timeline.

Before the full closure

Despite more than a decade left until the total closure, Bełchatów is already taking steps to reduce its environmental impact. The complex has partially reduced its emission levels of NOx, CO2, as well as SO2 and has improved its ash handling process in order to minimise dust.

Additionally, PGE has announced a staged shut down of all 12 units between 2030 and 2036, with one unit closing in 2030, one in 2031, one in 2032 and 2033, three in 2034, two in 2025 and the final unit in 2036.

In the Łódzkie region, where Bełchatów is situated, authorities target a 75% reduction in lignite mining and generation by 2030.

As coal generation becomes more and more expensive due to high CO2 prices, Bełchatów’s share of national energy generation is expected to decrease further in the future.

What can replace lignite?

The big question now is how to successfully replace the energy generated by the complex with something more sustainable.

In terms of land use, the region has been identified to have enormous renewable potential. Research shows that around 11GW of wind and solar energy would be sufficient to replace 80% of Bełchatów’s current energy output. An alternative scenario, consisting of 6GW of wind and solar energy combined with a gas, biomass, or a waste-to-energy plant is estimated to result in a similar output.

One option for the replacement of energy generation in Bełchatów is nuclear energy. However, despite nuclear being a prominent part of the long-term energy transition strategy, it will be challenging in the case of Bełchatów. The reasons for that are the geographical characteristics of the region, and a lack of access to large bodies of water required for cooling.

PGE’s vision and its limits

At the national level, PGE has announced ambitios plans regarding renewable development. In its recently published Strategy 2035, the company plans to invest approximately €55 billion ($65 billion) into renewable energy and grid infrastructure, developing 4GW offshore wind, 4GW of onshore wind by 2035, as well as 11GW of new grid capacity and 18GWh of storage.

However, the announced local projects for the Bełchatów region are far more limited. Despite the regions’ substantial potential, PGE has only proposed to build around 600MW of solar and 100MW of wind energy. This development would only amount to approximately 4% of the capacity needed to match Bełchatów’s present output, falling short of the energy production needed to replace the current complex.

Surprisingly, while the energy industry has put forward proposals to replace Bełchatów’s coal-generated electricity with renewable sources, primarily solar and wind, PGE has a different vision. Instead of focusing on renewable development, the company plans to repurpose the massive pit mine left behind after the plant’s closure, one of the largest man-made holes on Earth.

PGE has outlined a 45-year-long plan to transform the pit into Poland’s deepest lake, with the hills reshaped into trails, ski slopes, bike paths and even facilities for horse riding, golf, or scuba diving. By 2070, PGE envisions the remains of the power plant as a tourist hub for people seeking to partake in outdoor sports or relax by the lake.

PGE’s recreational plan, however, is facing severe criticism from the renewable energy industry. The Bełchatów complex already has extensive infrastructure installed in place, such as transmission lines and substations, that would be capable of supporting gigawatts of renewable power produced. Shifting the area away from energy production is a wasted opportunity say analysts, considering the value of the existing infrastructure.

Also of interest: Green ambitions of Polish energy giant Tauron

Alternative solutions for the pit could be, for example, installing solar arrays on the mine’s shallow edges or floating solar farms on the future lake. Estimates also suggest that the region could host 5 to 15GW of wind power alone.

Who will pay for the transition?

Transforming the Bełchatów complex towards renewable energy isn’t just a question of what solutions should be used but also how the transition can be funded.

Poland is set to receive €3.85 billion (4.5 billion) from the EU’s Just Transition Fund, which is the largest share assigned to any member state. Within this amount, €369 million ($433 million) is designated specifically for the Bełchatów region in order to fund innovation, green infrastructure and workforce retraining. Additionally, PGE plans to invest over €1.5 billion ($1.8 billion) for the energy transition.

Despite the large amounts of funding available for Bełchatów to become green, it is still not enough.

Estimates suggest that the current financial support from the EU and revenue from selling carbon allowances by the complex can only cover about 50% of what Poland needs to finance the transition towards green energy.

The future of Poland’s energy

Bełchatów and its looming shut down is a major issue for Poland both on a national and regional level.

As one of the biggest pollutants in Europe, the complex is heavily reliant on lignite, which is rapidly running out. Even though the energy infrastructure is already in place, it seems that development of renewable energy in the region is not clear cut, nor is it a forgone conclusion.

As the biggest energy complex in Europe, the way the closure and its aftermath will be dealt with in Poland will serve as an example to other major power plants that face transition in the future.

According to ITALIA SOLARE’s analysis of Gaudì – Terna data, 113,465 new photovoltaic systems were connected from January to June, for a total capacity of 2,809 MW. This is significantly lower than the same period in 2024, with a 33% decline in the number of systems and a 16% decline in installed capacity. Overall, at the end of June, 1,992,353 photovoltaic systems were connected in Italy, for a cumulative capacity of 39,885 MW.

The decline, clearly highlighted in the first quarter data, was confirmed in the second quarter of the year: 56,844 new plants were connected from April to June, 25% less than in the same quarter of 2024 (75,629), for an additional capacity of 1,377 MW, 17% less than in the same period last year (1,651 MW).

The figures confirm the trend seen at the European level, according to SolarPower Europe’s semi-annual report, which highlights a slowdown due in particular to the decline in the residential segment, following the easing of the energy crisis and the gradual end of related incentives in key markets such as Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, and the Netherlands. The European utility-scale photovoltaic market, on the other hand, is proving relatively resilient and is driven by public auctions in various European countries that promote flexible projects combined with storage systems or wind farms.

“The first-half data clearly shows that the expansion phase of residential photovoltaics has come to a halt. The more than 30% drop in the number of installations cannot be ignored: it is a symptom of a period of regulatory uncertainty and a slowdown in investment, especially for families and SMEs,” comments Paolo Rocco Viscontini, president of ITALIA SOLARE. “The good news is that the utility-scale segment continues to grow, but that alone is not enough. A structural strategy is needed: stable tax deductions, simplified connections, and clear rules for the development of self-consumption systems and energy communities. We cannot afford to lose momentum just as the energy transition enters its most critical phase.”

Sharp declines in residential and commercial properties. Large installations performed well.

The slowdown particularly affects the residential and commercial-industrial segments, traditionally linked to plants under one megawatt.

In the <20 kW band, i.e. the one relating to the domestic sector, 106,562 systems were installed for a total of 686 MW: this represents a 31% decrease compared to the first half of 2024.

The 20 kW – 1 MW segment, which includes commercial and industrial, also saw a significant contraction: 804 MW installed, equal to a 32% drop compared to the same period of the previous year.

The exception is the utility-scale sector, i.e. those larger than 1 MW, where growth of 12% on an annual basis was observed: in the first six months of 2025, 307 plants were connected, for a total capacity of 1,319 MW.

Monthly trend and stable trend

Monthly data confirm a relatively stable growth rate over the six-month period: from 487 MW in January to 635 MW in June, with an average of approximately 450 MW/month. These figures are lower than in 2024, when monthly peaks of nearly 700 MW were recorded, driven by the Superbonus and the post-energy crisis acceleration, but still higher than the pre-Superbonus period.

In the U.S., ICE vehicles are projected to represent a record low 75% of the market in 2025 [3].
With falling prices, rising ICE costs, and China’s technological edge, the sector is entering a phase of mass adoption.","The global automotive landscape is undergoing a seismic shift. By 2025, electric vehicles (EVs) are no longer niche products but central to the future of mobility. Investors who recognize the confluence of narrowing price gaps, falling EV costs, and rising internal combustion engine (ICE) prices—coupled with China’s dominance and Europe’s accelerating transition—stand to capitalize on a sector primed for explosive growth.

The Narrowing Price Gap: A Catalyst for Mass Adoption

The cost parity between EVs and ICE vehicles is no longer a distant promise but an emerging reality. In 2025, the average purchase price of EVs remains 20-40% higher than ICE equivalents in most markets, but this gap is collapsing. In China, battery electric SUVs now sell for an average of USD 24,000—USD 700 less than comparable ICE models [1]. This trend is driven by a 25% global drop in battery pack prices in 2024, which has slashed manufacturing costs and enabled competitive retail pricing [1].

Total cost of ownership further tilts the balance in favor of EVs. Over five years, EVs save owners 30-50% in fuel and maintenance costs compared to ICE vehicles [4]. The used EV market reinforces this momentum: 55% of used EVs are priced under USD 30,000, with average hold times for models in this range significantly shorter than non-eligible units [5]. Tax incentives and home charging affordability are accelerating this shift, making EVs increasingly accessible to budget-conscious buyers [6].

Rising ICE Costs: A Market in Retreat

While EVs become cheaper, ICE vehicles are becoming pricier. Automakers are phasing out lower-cost ICE models to focus on high-margin EVs, reducing supply and driving up ICE prices [1]. In the U.S., ICE vehicles are projected to represent a record low 75% of the market in 2025 [3]. In China, where nearly half of 2024 car sales were electric, ICE prices have risen as automakers reallocate resources to electrification [1].

Policy shifts also favor EVs. The U.S. Clean Vehicle Tax Credit and Europe’s Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) are reshaping demand, indirectly pressuring ICE pricing [2]. Meanwhile, Tesla’s European sales dropped 40-45% in early 2025, while Chinese brands like BYD captured budget-conscious consumers with localized strategies [5]. This dynamic underscores a critical inflection point: ICE vehicles are no longer the default choice.

China’s Competitive Edge: A Global Powerhouse

China’s dominance in EVs is reshaping the industry. By 2025, the country accounts for 60% of global EV production and 62% of sales [4]. Innovations in lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery technology—enabling 2,000 km range batteries and rapid charging—have allowed Chinese automakers to price vehicles 20-30% lower than Western counterparts [2].

Government policies have been instrumental. Over USD 230 billion in subsidies from 2009 to 2023, coupled with local content requirements and R&D investments, have cemented China’s control over 60% of global lithium and 70% of cobalt processing [1]. Export restrictions on key battery technologies further protect its edge, disrupting supply chains for U.S. and EU manufacturers [3]. Chinese brands like BYD and NIO are now expanding into Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia, signaling a global shift in automotive leadership [2].

European Automakers: Accelerating the Transition

European automakers are racing to close the gap. Battery-electric vehicle (BEV) registrations surged 34% in the first half of 2025, with Volkswagen leading the charge [1]. The EU’s Innovation Fund has allocated €852 million to six battery projects, aiming to add 56 GWh of annual production capacity and reduce emissions by 91 million tonnes over a decade [5].

Infrastructure investments are equally critical. Public charging points in Europe grew by 35% in 2024, reaching 1 million stations [4]. The Netherlands, Germany, and France lead this expansion, addressing accessibility concerns for non-home-charging users [3]. Automakers like BMW, Ford, and Mercedes-Benz are collaborating on charger installations, while the UK removed planning barriers for public charging sockets [4].

Strategic Investment Timing: Where to Allocate Capital

The sector’s momentum presents clear opportunities:

1. EV Infrastructure: With 1 million public charging points in Europe and AFIR-driven growth, infrastructure providers are set to benefit.

2. Battery Technology: China’s LFP dominance and EU-funded projects highlight the need for innovation in sustainable, cost-effective battery production.

3. European Automakers: Companies like Volkswagen and BMW are investing heavily in electrification, positioning themselves to capture a projected 50% EV market share by 2030 [3].

Conclusion

The EV revolution is no longer speculative—it is here. With falling prices, rising ICE costs, and China’s technological edge, the sector is entering a phase of mass adoption. For investors, the window to capitalize on this shift is narrowing. Strategic allocations in EV infrastructure, battery tech, and European automakers accelerating their transitions offer a compelling path to long-term gains.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-01 09:00:46.706034

“This landmark supply chain agreement with Corning will help invigorate America with scalable, reliable, low-cost energy,” said Daniel Barcelo, T1’s CEO and Chairman of the Board.
“This is American companies building in America and protecting American energy security.
The U.S. needs to establish critical energy supply chains built on domestic capacity and industrial knowhow.
“We are accelerating the ramp of our advanced manufacturing capabilities to support a resilient U.S. solar supply chain.","T1 Energy Inc. and Corning Inc. have announced a strategic commercial agreement that boosts the U.S. solar supply chain and advanced manufacturing of affordable, fast-to-deploy energy.

T1 will source hyper-pure polysilicon and solar wafers produced by Corning at its Michigan campus. Starting in the second half of 2026, Corning wafers will be delivered to T1’s G2_Austin solar cell facility, which is currently under development. These cells will then be used to manufacture solar modules at T1’s operational G1_Dallas site.

Supply chain certainty remains a top priority for customers, and the expanded agreement between T1 and Corning delivers a more stable and predictable supply of domestically sourced solar components. By connecting American-made polysilicon, wafers, cells, and modules, this vertically integrated model supports long-term planning, regulatory compliance, and energy resilience.

The United States needs more electricity immediately to compete in the global AI race and achieve energy independence. The T1-Corning agreement addresses this urgency by unlocking the nation’s most scalable energy source through a manufacturing base that spans Michigan and Texas.

“This landmark supply chain agreement with Corning will help invigorate America with scalable, reliable, low-cost energy,” said Daniel Barcelo, T1’s CEO and Chairman of the Board.

“This is American companies building in America and protecting American energy security. The U.S. needs to establish critical energy supply chains built on domestic capacity and industrial knowhow. Together with Corning, we intend to accelerate America’s ability to manufacture leading-edge solar solutions, support a total of nearly 6,000 American jobs, and promote American energy independence.”

“Corning is proud to help meet the growing need for solar products made in the United States,” said AB Ghosh, Corning VP and GM of Solar, and Chairman and CEO of Hemlock Semiconductor.

“We are accelerating the ramp of our advanced manufacturing capabilities to support a resilient U.S. solar supply chain. Our agreement with T1 underscores the strong demand for high-quality, American-made solar technologies. By building foundational infrastructure in Michigan, we’re adding good-paying manufacturing jobs, strengthening the U.S. solar industry and advancing a more energy-independent future for the country.”",https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/dq/media/media_files/2025/09/01/t1-2025-09-01-13-55-59.png,N,,2025-09-01 09:03:03.613534
,American Energy,2025-09-01 12:31:22+00:00,PV Tech,CALSSA calls for US$10 million fine for utilities for slow residential solar and storage approval,JP Casey,,,,,https://www.pv-tech.org/calssa-us10-million-fine-utilities-slow-residential-solar-storage-approval/,"Ultimately, CPUC ruled that within two years, the utilities would have to reach approval decisions on “no less than 95%” of residential energy projects within their own stated timeframes.
However, CALSSA said that both PG&E and CSE have consistently failed to meet these timelines.
The graphs below show the percentage of each stage of an approval process that was completed in accordance with the utilities’ timelines, beginning with PG&E.
The graph above demonstrates SCE’s performance against its own timeframes, and shows a much more uneven trend for all parts of the approval process.
This was designed to incentivise the co-location of battery energy storage systems (BESS) with residential solar projects, minimising the need for residential customers to sell power to the grid, but the move has caused residential solar installations to fall by around 80%.","These “standards” refer to a 2019 recommendation, reached by a working group organised by CPUC that: “95-100% of projects meet all timelines within the framework for tracking and reporting within two years after the start of tracking”. While PG&E was “not in consensus with setting an overall goal”, SCE agreed with the working group that this benchmark was “useful for process improvements and corrective actions”.

Ultimately, CPUC ruled that within two years, the utilities would have to reach approval decisions on “no less than 95%” of residential energy projects within their own stated timeframes.

However, CALSSA said that both PG&E and CSE have consistently failed to meet these timelines. The graphs below show the percentage of each stage of an approval process that was completed in accordance with the utilities’ timelines, beginning with PG&E.

The graph demonstrates that while the design upgrade and initial review phases of the approval process have been completed relatively quickly within the PG&E network – with approvals granted or denied in a timely fashion 96% and 82% of the time, respectively, in the most recent quarter – other parts of the approval process have been completed more slowly.

Most strikingly, none of the system impact studies have been completed promptly thus far in 2025, and construct upgrade approvals have been completed increasingly slowly in each of the last three quarters.

The graph above demonstrates SCE’s performance against its own timeframes, and shows a much more uneven trend for all parts of the approval process. Across many of the phases, however, there was a significant slowdown in approval completion in both the third quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, and while the completion of all of these phases accelerated in the second quarter of this year, only the supplementary review and initial review phases were completed in a timely fashion more than 80% of the time in the most recent quarter.

Fines and process changes

CALSSA argued that these delays do not necessarily stem from the approval process simply taking more time than initially expected, and could be a conscious effort on the part of the utilities to minimise the deployment of residential solar and storage systems within their grids.

“There are clear rules on how long the utilities can take for their review, but there has been zero enforcement of those rules,” said Kevin Luo, policy and market development manager for CALSSA. “PG&E and SCE get away with suppressing what they consider to be their competition.”

The accusation comes as California’s residential solar sector grapples with the impacts of the NEM (net energy metering) 3.0 scheme, which was implemented in 2023 and slashed the rate for which residential customers could sell their excess solar energy back to the grid by 75%. This was designed to incentivise the co-location of battery energy storage systems (BESS) with residential solar projects, minimising the need for residential customers to sell power to the grid, but the move has caused residential solar installations to fall by around 80%.

Neither utility has responded to the CALSSA complaint, and PV Tech has reached out to both PG&E and CSE for comments on their process for approving residential energy systems and how they would respond to the complaint.

In addition to calling for CPUC to fine PG&E and CSE each US$5 million for their activities, CALSSA has asked for the commission to “establish a penalty framework”, which is to be assessed each quarter, so that there is a formal process for which utilities can be fined for failing to reach the end of the approval process in a timely manner.

CALSSA first called for a penalty system in 2019, when the working group was making its recommendations, but CPUC rejected the proposal, calling the imposition of financial penalties “premature, at this time”.

The association’s proposed fine structure would see utilities docked more each quarter for lower rates of approval timeline compliance; CALSSA is calling for utilities that reach approval decisions for 85-95% of projects to be fined just US$125,000, while utilities that reach approval decisions for less than 15% of projects to be fined US$1.125 million.

CALSSA also proposed a schedule for CPUC to hear its complaint, beginning with a response from the utilities on 29 September, and a final decision to be made by the commission by 16 March 2026. These are much shorter timelines than the standard CPUC complaint process, which can take as long as 18 months; first CPUC will have to decide on a timeline for its investigation, before responding to the parties involved.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/REC.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 10:00:02.913370

The post Ola Electric’s technical breakout: sign of an EV shift or short-lived hype?","Ola Electric’s stock leaped as much as 13% on Monday, extending the two-week uptrend that has driven gains of over 45% since mid-August.

Key triggers behind this spike include strong technical momentum: the stock performed a breakout above previous resistance, supported by high volume and a series of higher price lows.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) touched 75, signalling an overbought zone and hinting at either a pause or profit booking ahead.

The underlying catalyst was regulatory: Ola’s top-selling Gen 3 scooter range received coveted Production Linked Incentive (PLI) certification, making the company eligible for government support worth 13–18% of sales until 2028.

This covers the lion’s share of Ola’s scooter volume and is intended to boost both margins and profitability from Q2 FY26 onwards.

Management and analysts say the improvement in cost structure could be significant, positioning Ola closer to EBITDA positivity “sooner than earlier expected”.

In addition to PLI benefits, investors have reacted positively to Ola’s push into local battery manufacturing, efforts to reduce dependence on rare earth metals, and technological upgrades in charging speed.

The company also launched new models like the S1 Pro Sport and Roadster X+, aiming for delivery rollouts through late 2025 and early 2026.

Ola Electric’s stock: Financial progress, but caution lingers

Despite the stock euphoria, Ola’s underlying financials are still under pressure.

For Q1 FY26, Ola reported a net loss of ₹428 crore, wider than the previous year but an improvement from the March quarter as operating costs fell.

Quarterly revenues halved year-on-year to ₹828 crore, though gross margin improved to 25.6%.

Notably, Ola’s auto segment turned EBITDA positive for the first time in June, reflecting impact from cost cuts, vertical integration, and initial incentives.

The company has guided for full-year improved profitability and a gross margin target of 35–40% in subsequent quarters, contingent on higher PLI benefits and growing market share.

Ola delivered 68,192 vehicles in Q1, with new models expected to drive further growth.

However, the stock still trades 43% lower year-to-date and remains well beneath its ₹76 IPO price.

Sentiment among analysts is mixed as some see Ola as a potential long-term winner in the Indian EV sector, especially as production scale rises and policy support persists.

The others point to continued cash flow challenges, pressure to capture and defend market share, and the memory of this year’s steep share declines.

Inflection point, or passing wave?

The current rally in Ola Electric is an intersection of bullish policy momentum, early signs of financial improvement, and technical excitement.

If cost controls, PLI incentives, and ambitious production targets are delivered on, Ola could indeed mark a turning point for India’s EV industry.

But with losses still substantial, the market likely awaits proof of sustained profitability to turn recent optimism into long-term conviction. For now, the rally is equal parts hope and risk, a microcosm of the maturing Indian EV marketplace.

The company’s net profit for the second quarter (Q2) fell by 29.9% to 6.4bn yuan ($894.7m), a significant trend reversal from the 100.4% increase seen in the previous quarter.

Despite the downturn in profit, BYD reported a 14% rise in revenues, reaching 200bn yuan for the quarter ending June 30.

However, the company’s vehicle sales in the first half (H1) of the year, totalling 2.15 million units, fell slightly short of being on track for its annual goal of 5.5 million battery-electric and plug-in hybrid cars, representing only 40% of the target, as per Bloomberg’s data.

The second half of the year poses further challenges for the EV maker, especially after its aggressive discounting strategy earlier in the year attracted scrutiny from authorities in Beijing.

The Chinese government is actively trying to curb price wars in the industry, which it believes could threaten the financial stability of even the most well-funded manufacturers. Despite these efforts, major brands have continued to reduce prices.

BYD also noted a shift in its domestic market during Q2, with fully electric car sales remaining strong, but hybrid vehicle sales seeing a reduction compared to the previous year.

In an international expansion move, BYD’s Thai subsidiary began exporting EVs to Europe, marking the company’s first foray into markets such as Germany, Belgium, the UK, as reported by Xinhua.

By Michel Ladrak, Head of Mobility, NEOM MICHEL LADRAK – Head of Mobility As Head of Mobility at NEOM, Michel Ladrak leads on overall urban development and mobility systems for the giga-project, including road, rail, water and vertical air mobility.","Spearheaded by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, NEOM is a futuristic high-tech project designed to harness technology, sustainability and business for a new planned city in Saudi Arabia. It is part of efforts to diversify Saudi Arabia’s economy. A sustainable and connected mobility ecosystem is an important part of the vision. In this guest article, Michel Ladrak, Head of Mobility, NEOM, describes the NEOM vision of future green mobility.

The severe wildfires that California has been experiencing recently have added further fuel to claims that climate change is increasing this annual devastation. Of the 20 largest fires in California’s history, eight have occurred in the past three years1 and with the fires starting earlier and finishing later, California’s wildfire season is becoming an almost year–round event2 .

With the transport sector responsible for approximately a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, it is certainly implicated in the climate change issues we are witnessing. Transport derives 95% of its energy from fossil fuels3 and although the number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the world’s roads is growing, figures show that sales have recently slowed4. Several factors for this have been identified, including concerns about EV resale values, fears about changes in government policy for electric vehicles, and worries over a lack of rapid-charging infrastructure5.

Norway is one country that is bucking this trend. The Scandinavian nation’s EV sales have continued to remain strong, with these vehicles accounting for nine out of 10 new passenger car sales in 20246 . This has been achieved through generous government subsidies, investment in infrastructure and incentives for day-to-day driving, such as free parking, free charging, congestion charge exemption and permission for EVs to use bus lanes. It is also noteworthy that the country has embraced the future of electric transport despite its wealth of oil and gas natural resources, which it could easily put to domestic use if it chose to.

Saudi Arabia, once known for fueling the world’s internal combustion engine vehicles, is now poised to lead the global transition away from fossil fuel-based transport. While Norway has been able to tap into its renewable hydroelectricity, which accounts for 88% of its energy production7, Saudi Arabia similarly enjoys an abundance of renewable energy derived from the sun, with solar power having the capacity to meet all the country’s energy needs8.

Thanks to its commitment to green mobility, Saudi Arabia has the potential to not only transition its domestic sector away from fossil fuels as Norway has done, but to accelerate the global shift towards delivering sustainability, in the process becoming a world leader for sustainable transport.

Under Saudi Vision 2030, the Kingdom is creating a comprehensive EV ecosystem underwritten by favorable policies for EV adoption and significant investments in EV infrastructure. The Kingdom has already established its first automotive brand, Ceer, to design, manufacture and sell electric vehicles9 and in early 2025, the company signed USD 1.4 billion worth of deals at a PIF event to support the launch of its first model, which is scheduled for 202610. The establishment of Ceer follows the 2023 opening of a Lucid Group car factory at Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah Economic City, Jeddah – the country’s first-ever car manufacturing facility and Lucid Group’s first international plant. The site will produce Lucid’s electric vehicles for Saudi Arabia’s domestic market, as well as for export11.

NEOM’s Mobility sector is playing its role in helping the Kingdom meet its sustainable transport sector objectives and is developing a fully sustainable mobility ecosystem for its range of developments. These include the linear city THE LINE, the mountain retreat Trojena, the coastal region of Magna, and the port and manufacturing center, Oxagon. Unlike most cities, which are retrofitting infrastructure for new technology and vehicles, NEOM is designing a new mobility paradigm from the ground up. NEOM has made significant progress in developing its charging infrastructure, which will support the incorporation of EVs into our shared public transport system. The sector has installed charging stations in six areas across the region as part of its long-term plan to offer full connectivity across NEOM. These new stations support the expanded use of its EV fleet, which, with around 140 electric vehicles for use by the NEOM community members, is the largest electric vehicle fleet in the Kingdom. More charging stations are in the pipeline and will be progressively rolled out as Mobility’s network grows.

While electrification of infrastructure and vehicles is an essential element in delivering sustainable mobility, it is far from being the sole component. NEOM’s Mobility strategy is prioritizing shared mobility and automation as fundamental pillars of its future transport model. Shared mobility reduces congestion, enhances accessibility and decreases the environmental footprint of transportation. By integrating on-demand shuttles, autonomous taxis, and app-based ridesharing, NEOM can create a seamless, multimodal transport system that is both efficient, comfortable and better for the future of the region and indeed, our planet.

Within the next decade, cities which have not embraced autonomous transport will be gridlocked, inefficient and economically disadvantaged. NEOM is showing the world how to avoid this fate. Autonomous electric shuttles and ride-sharing fleets can operate at peak efficiency, minimizing energy waste and improving overall user experience. NEOM’s partnership with Pony.ai—one of the world’s leaders in autonomous driving technology—has resulted in Saudi Arabia’s first permit for autonomous vehicle testing, marking a significant milestone in the Kingdom’s mobility transformation.

Finally, we need to state the importance of hydrogen as a growing source of clean energy and an increasingly significant aspect of green mobility. Hydrogen fuel cells provide a sustainable alternative for heavy-duty transport where battery-electric solutions may not be as practical due to weight and range limitations. Hydrogen-powered vehicles play a crucial role in NEOM Mobility’s ecosystem and I see it playing a much more important role as a fuel for transport moving forward, particularly with construction vehicles. Off-highway hydrogen vehicle applications confer the advantages of not only zero emissions but also reduced noise on construction sites.

In support of NEOM’s growth, Mobility is progressively expanding its portfolio of clean energy solutions to ensure a diversified approach. Through electrification, shared mobility, automation and hydrogen, the sector is driving the project’s transport transformation and creating a fully integrated transport ecosystem powered by clean energy. NEOM is a living lab for next-gen mobility, testing and refining solutions that can be scaled globally.

The global transition to sustainable mobility is not a matter of ‘if’ but ‘when’. The question is: Who will lead the way? Saudi Arabia is stepping up—and, through NEOM, the Kingdom is creating a new model for public transport—one that centers on sustainable mobility… and one that successfully consigns climate-changing transport emissions to history.

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)2 reports a global loss of 75 billion tons of soil from arable land each year due to soil erosion, nutrient leaching, spreading of soil contaminants, and desertification. In the United States (U.S.), 4.7 tons of topsoil are washed from every hectare of cropland per year, with a predicted increase of soil erosion from 8% to 21% by 20503. Major aquifers supplying 90% of water systems in the U.S. are rapidly being depleted, inflicting further harm on open-field agriculture4. Moreover, as natural disasters become more frequent, the food supply chain becomes even more vulnerable5,6. Globally, nearly one-third of food is wasted from farm to fork annually7,8,9,10. In the U.S., the retail industry, food services, and households generated 66.2 million tons of food waste in 201911, exacerbating food and nutrition insecurity challenges. We are seeking a new solution to boost crop productivity on limited arable land and ensure the resilience of food and nutrition security in the face of climate change while reducing food waste across agricultural production and food distribution.

Controlled environment agriculture (CEA) enhances food resilience through diversified sources, high productivity, water conservation, and protection against climate uncertainties, while promoting equitable food access for all communities. In CEA, crops grow under controlled conditions that include light (spectrum and intensity), temperature, and humidity. Crop yields (tons/hectare/year) in CEA are reported to range between 10 and 100 times higher than open-field agriculture12,13,14. Water use in CEA is typically about 4.5–16% of that from conventional farms per unit mass of produce15,16. CEA benefits communities by providing diversified food sources and the ability to shield food production from the uncertainties of climate conditions. CEA permits year-round crop growth with consistent quality and predictable output, shortens food miles), and provides social and health benefits to communities. This perspective article focuses on plant-based CEA production, rather than emerging novel food systems (e.g. cellular agriculture and microbial food17,18,19).

CEA is experiencing swift global growth, with each country tailoring it to meet its specific challenges. In China, CEA is driven by rising food demand, the need for pesticide-free produce, an aging agricultural workforce, heat stress, and food insecurity from natural disasters. Government policies support innovation in indoor agriculture and rural revitalization20. Singapore aims to meet 30% of its nutritional needs by 2030 through advanced CEA technology to enhance food production and security21. Canada’s vertical farming industry is driven by consumer preferences, environmental sustainability, and technological advancements, supported by government policies and research funding22. For developing countries such as Kenya, Nigeria, India, and Sri Lanka, CEA contributes to food security, safety and quality while promoting social equity and providing job opportunities23.

While fast-growing, CEA remains relatively immature as an industry, with many indoor farming companies having failed due to challenges in technology adoption, business model viability, and operational scalability24,25. CEA grapples with issues ranging from design and operation to workforce development. The energy-intensive nature and high carbon footprints of the industry26,27 make it difficult for CEA, especially vertical indoor farming, to be sustainable. Energy associated with artificial lighting, temperature control, and ventilation accounts for about 25% of the operating costs of large vertical farms in the United States. Energy is the second largest overhead cost in CEA, exceeded only by labor28,29,30. Carbon footprints were reported as 5.6–16.7 times and 2.3–3.3 times greater than that of open-field agriculture for indoor vertical farms and greenhouses, respectively31. Therefore, emerging technologies and advancements in fundamental science are essential for CEA to achieve significant resource efficiency32 and reduce operational costs while maximizing productivity33.

Integrated decision making based on life cycle analysis

Life cycle analysis guides decision making and policy for CEA (Fig. 1). Early-stage assessment across the life cycle of CEA is essential to support integrated decision-making and minimize costs49. Life cycle analysis can be used to optimize key CEA design factors50, such as CEA size, location, envelope design, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, and guide research and development to identify critical technologies for the CEA industry51. However, there is a lack of comprehensive life cycle analysis, evaluating potential environmental, economic and social impacts of the new CEA designs at different settings.

Most existing CEA life cycle analyses, such as life cycle assessment (LCA)52, evaluate carbon footprints of resource use (e.g. fertilizer, energy, water)26,31,53,54,55,56,57,58,59 or both economic and environmental performance49,60,61,–62 through case studies. Linking LCA to a bioeconomic model has been proposed for analyzing area-based farming policy63. Most studies represent current CEA technologies and have well-defined CEA in terms of size, system, and location. Thus, these studies are limited to comparing the current CEA prototypes to open-field agriculture but have limited impacts on supporting new designs and decision making for CEA.

Advocates for an ecological-economic approach that considers the environmental dimensions of meeting human needs highlight the need for a comprehensive approach to LCA that integrates economic, social, and environmental aspects64. Weidema65 emphasizes the importance of integrating social aspects into LCA, while Arodudu et al.66 suggests the use of tools and methodologies to bridge methodological gaps in LCA application to agro-bioenergy systems and to integrate agronomic options and life cycle thinking approaches.

LCA can be further applied to fulfill the CEA circular economy, supporting the development of sustainable strategies for CEA industry, reduction in waste and cost, and enhancement of resource efficiency at community scales. The reuse and recycling opportunities include waste heat utilization, CO2 supply through co-location, water reuse and reclamation of nutrients from water treatment plants, and recycling of growing media and food packages67. Various case studies report their utilization of waste heat from combined heat and power plants68,69,70, data centers71,72,73,74, and plant factories75. Indoor farms reuse low-quality energy, in the form of warm water or air in a temperature range of 30–47 °C. Recirculating irrigation water has the potential to reduce water consumption by 20–40% and fertilizer costs by 40–50%76. Water reuse for crop growth conserves freshwater, promotes water circularity, and reduces the total need for chemical fertilizers77. Defining the water treatment and nutrient reclamation requirements for crop growth is an important research question for CEA78. Potential contamination risks such as microbial pathogens and chemical content should also be considered for irrigation79. Although waste resources may be limited by location, it is possible to create a CEA ecosystem through strategic planning of businesses and infrastructure within communities. The evaluation of the planning scenarios can be based on comprehensive life cycle analysis, integrating economic, social, and environmental aspects.

Distributed indoor agriculture

Distributed indoor agriculture (DIA) systems within buildings can support crop cultivation using hydroponic techniques—such as NFT and DWC, as discussed in Section “Current CEA technologies”. Each DIA system (Fig. 2) is equipped with integrated hardware and software solutions, including controls of grow lights and irrigation, monitoring of crop growth, and diagnosis of issues related to crop health and system operation.

Indoor living walls, a foundational prototype of the DIA system, have gained popularity by bringing nature indoors80, and indoor plants have become highly desirable with the rise of remote work81. Studies show measurable benefits of these systems on occupants’ thermal comfort and building cooling load reduction82,83,84. With living walls, the cooling setpoint can be increased by 0.9 K and still satisfy thermal comfort needs for the majority of the occupants83. In an experimental study of a hall with a floor area of 520 ft2 that was not equipped with air conditioning, an average temperature reduction of 4 K was observed85. In addition, indoor plants demonstrate the capability to improve indoor air quality86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93, productivity and creativity94, while reducing noise levels95, the negative effects of visual glare96,97, stresses98, and discomfort symptoms99,100. Plant leaves and their microbes purify indoor air through phytoremediation, absorbing pollutants via leaf stomata and degrading them through plant metabolism101. Plant elements like leaves and twigs reflect, scatter, and attenuate sound through mechanical vibration. A study of a 2.4 m2 living wall in a space with floor area of 19.6 m2 found a weighted sound reduction index of 15 dB and a weighted sound absorption coefficient of 0.4095. Moreover, people were more productive (12% quicker reaction time on a computer task) and less stressed (systolic blood pressure readings lowered by one to four units)94.

Can DIA systems be a potential integrated solution to food resilience, better indoor environmental quality, energy efficiency, and well-being? Broadly speaking, there are four broad markets to target (1) offices; (2) institutions; (3) hospitality; and (4) residential buildings. Dedicating 1% of floor area identified in the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS)102 and Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS)103 to growing lettuce in existing buildings has a potential yield of 5.1–70.4 kg fresh weight lettuce per capita per growing cycle (about four weeks) based on the reported lettuce yield (6.9–95 kg fresh weight) per growing floor area (m2)104. This potential yield is much higher than the U.S. per capita consumption of fresh romaine and leaf lettuce (5.8 kg) in 2022105. DIA and CEA are distinct and potentially competitive models for food production, but their co-existence can provide mutual benefits. Successful DIA demonstrations promote mass-market acceptance of hydroponically grown foods through social impacts, public education, and easy accessibility of technology.

CEA electricity demand flexibility

Connecting CEA with microgrids can not only reduce CEA’s carbon footprint but also contribute to stabilizing microgrids through demand response and frequency control. Electricity demand from lights and HVAC systems and the associated carbon footprints have been significant for indoor vertical farms. CEA can be strategically co-located in areas with existing microgrid infrastructure or where dynamic electricity pricing creates opportunities for cost savings and load flexibility. Shifting LED lights from continuous to intermittent operation was implemented to reduce operational costs by responding to daily electricity price fluctuations106,107.

CEA can serve as a demand-side dispatchable load for microgrids to reduce the volatility of renewable energy resources (Fig. 3). Stable operation of electric systems requires frequency regulation; providing frequency regulation from demand side resources mitigates technical, economic, and political challenges108. Existing studies have tested the feasibility of using HVAC equipment as dispatchable loads on the demand side109,110,111. Due to the high volatility of such distributed energy resources (DERs) as wind turbines, photovoltaics, and hydroelectricity, balancing renewable energy generation and demands for microgrids is expensive in comparison to traditional power grid frequency regulation. CEA can potentially serve as an important dispatchable load on the demand side if crops can tolerate certain lighting fluctuations. Dynamic environmental variations trigger plants’ physiological response, yet they can maintain diurnal leaf carbon gain in comparison with plant growth in constant environments112. Further research is needed on how variations of LED light and temperature induced by dynamic variations in price signals from microgrids affect crop yield and quality.

Digital twins in CEA

A CEA Digital Twin (DT) framework integrates computer vision, edge computing, AI-enabled predictive analytics, and optimal control technologies (Fig. 4), forecasting and optimizing the behavior of the physical asset (crops) and resource management. DT frameworks have been explored in various contexts in CEA, including monitoring DT for tracking subsystems113, predictive DT for optimizing production and resource use efficiency114,115, supply chain DT to optimize agrifood supply chain116, DT for aquaponics production facilities117, and visualization DT118.

Computer vision is the key component to acquire crop growth information and provide feedback to update crop model parameters for resource optimization119,120,121,122. Studies have focused on developing growth forecasting based on early-stage growth images using spatial transformation123 and spatial-temporal attention mechanisms124. State-of-the-art algorithms, such as YOLO series119, Mask-RCNN125, and Deepabv3+126, have been employed for growth monitoring, yield prediction, and spacing optimization. However, image-based systems encounter limitations. Occlusions and complex canopies create challenges in developing automation solutions for plant monitoring. Thus, advanced algorithms and approaches such as 3D reconstruction (via Neural Radiance Fields127, and Gaussian Splatting), and geometric DT128,129 are needed to enhance crop growth monitoring solutions for CEA. Furthermore, multispectral and hyperspectral imaging systems have been deployed to determine the nutrient concentration in CEA produce so that growers can develop mitigation strategies before deficiency symptoms arise130,131,132,133. However, the detection accuracy is limited due to the extremely complex workspace. Most deep learning-based networks require image normalization before images are input to the network, reducing the feature details and decreasing detection accuracy.

Intelligent climate controllers, driven by microclimate data, have advanced optimal energy use management. AI algorithms, such as reinforcement learning have been explored to optimize energy and water use in greenhouses134. A wide range of control algorithms has been explored to optimize variables such as light intensity, air velocity, shade curtain, vapor pressure deficits, and CO2 levels to minimize energy costs135,136,137,138. In addition, DT requests vast amounts of data, subject to issues like inaccuracies and cyberattacks. Blockchain has been applied in CEA applications139,140,141 to enhance information security.

A major obstacle to optimal outcomes in CEA lies in real-time crops’ response to environmental conditions and thus decoupled crop growth and resource optimization142. Although studies have been conducted for optimal resource allocation under fixed microclimate conditions143,144,145, forecasting growth based on training data from fixed conditions may limit its applicability in real CEA environments with dynamic climate conditions. A real-time feedback DT system must assess forecast accuracy and adjust model parameters, leading to efficient decision support for growers to optimize production and energy use.

Microbiome management in CEA

Growing plants in hydroponics rather than soil dramatically changes the challenges. One important facet of plant physiology and plant health is the contribution of the plant microbiota, which represents a largely untapped opportunity146. Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) reside in or around plants and can act as biostimulants, biofertilizers, and bioprotectants147. Plant-associated beneficial microorganisms – e.g., bacteria and fungi – promote growth, nutrient uptake, stress tolerance, and resistance to pathogens148. However, many plant-growth-promoting microbes found in soil cannot make the transition to hydroponic environments149. Moreover, many PGPB products are developed for field application and have not been optimized for specific conditions of CEA which include dense cropping of specifically optimized crops, controlled water and climate systems, and integrated sensors and controllers. While hydroponics has a range of advantages over soil-based cultivation, one of the disadvantages is the fast spread of infectious diseases due to the recirculating nature of nutrient solution in the whole system. In such a case, PGPB may offer a unique solution in hydroponic systems by sensing and preventing pathogen outbreaks, improving access to nutrients and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses and increasing crop yield. To date, there are reports that PGPB promotes plant growth in various hydroponic systems. For example, Pseudomonas psychrotolerans IALR632 increased shoot and root growth of green Oakleaf lettuce grown in nutrient film technique (NFT) in the greenhouse, indoor vertical NFT, and a deep-water culture system150.

Another group of beneficial microbial-based microorganisms is arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). AMF is known to form AMF-host plant symbiosis with more than 80% of plant species151. The primary positive impacts of AMF symbiosis are increasing availability of both macro- and micro-nutrients, increasing photosynthetic rate, and enhancing tolerance to stressful conditions through augmentation of antioxidant defense system. A recent study by Caser et al.152 for saffron in soilless systems in a glasshouse indicated that inoculation with one AMF species (Rhizophagus intraradices) or a mixture of R. intraradices and Funneliformis mosseae increased spice quality as evidenced by a superior content of several health-promoting compounds (polyphenols, anthocyanins, vitamin C, and antioxidant activity) in one cycle of growth in soilless systems compared to open field production, while spice yield was similar to that of open field. These results improve our understanding of microbial communities in soilless media. Nevertheless, such information is still limited, and future studies are needed to fully understand and optimize the benefits of microbes under controlled environments. There are also advanced opportunities for genetically engineering these communities for enhanced properties for the plant; better association with the plant and survival/persistence in the hydroponic environment, and for coupling to CEA control systems by reporting on water, microbiome and plant health through expression of environmentally-sensitive fluorescent and volatile organic reporters153. A growing body of literature has focused on defining, engineering and using laboratory evolution to evolve such synthetic communities for plants in both soil and artificial conditions154,155 —a focused effort to co-design microbial communities supporting optimized plants and coupling with control systems.

Engineered plants for CEA

Transgenic crops have revolutionized the scale and nature of agriculture; however, such efforts are largely focused on addressing producer-facing challenges associated with traditional methods of growing crops in fields (i.e., herbicide tolerance, insect resistance). Crops grown in CEAs may shift the focus of engineering efforts towards other consumer-facing traits that may benefit from indoor growth. Growing plants that are engineered to improve human health through the enhanced delivery of key phytonutrients has been a key pillar in plant engineering efforts156,157. Complex natural products ranging from edible health compounds to plant-derived pharmaceuticals may be developed as interesting targets for transgenic plants grown in CEA158,159,160,161. Nutrient management in CEA can significantly enhance the vitamin content in crops through precise control and optimization of nutrient solutions that meet the specific requirements of various plant species and growth stages. This targeted approach enables growers to enhance the uptake of specific nutrients that are precursors to vitamins, leading to increased vitamin content in crops162. One regulatory challenge of field-grown crops is the concern of outcrossing of transgenes; thus, the large-scale indoor growth of transgenic crops in CEA may open the door to safer implementation and growth of engineered plants, which may also expand the range of traits that could be pursued.

Optimizing and redesigning plant architecture within confined space limitations has the opportunity to dramatically enhance yield of indoor-grown crops. Kwon et al. leveraged CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to target and manipulate the physiology of tomato plants by engineering highly compact and rapid flowering plants163.

• The event witnessed the announcement and felicitation of the winners of the Energy Transitions Innovation Challenge (ENTICE) 2.0

• To further promote clean tech development, investment partners signed MoU to unleash catalytic capital and fund the winning solutions of ENTICE

• BRPL and GEAPP announced signing of MoU to launch the Digitalization of Utilities for Energy Transition (DUET) program at two sub-stations in Delhi

The Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP) hosted its Alliance in Action Convening on 29 August 2025 at the Hyatt Regency, New Delhi, bringing together key stakeholders, investors, innovators, and DISCOMs to advance India’s clean energy transition. The event featured the announcement and felicitation of the winners of the Energy Transitions Innovation Challenge (ENTICE) 2.0, along with the signing of MoUs to scale winning solutions and unlock catalytic capital for clean-tech innovation.

GEAPP also announced the launch of the Digitalization of Utilities for Energy Transition (DUET) program with BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL), to be piloted at two substations in Delhi.

ENTICE, GEAPP’s flagship India program, addresses the funding gap faced by clean-tech innovators by providing grants, mentorship, and market access. The second edition focused on two problem statements:

• Developing AI tools to analyze behind-the-meter (BTM) energy consumption patterns and create digital twins of appliances.

• Using AI to analyze smart meter data, identify large-scale flexible assets, and detect inefficiencies in industrial energy use.

By partnering with distribution companies like Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (JVVNL) and BRPL, ENTICE provides startups access to real-world data and pilot opportunities, bridging the gap between innovation and deployment.

The winning solutions to the first problem statements were Enlog and Flock Energy. Enlog delivers autonomous energy intelligence via a compact, patented plug-and-play loT device + Al. It cuts electricity use and improves appliance-life without manual effort. Flock Energy uses a modular, Al-powered platform to disaggregate smart meter data into appliance-level insights, tailored for India's 15/30-minute intervals.

Trillectric and Faclon Labs were announced winners for the second problem statement. Trillectric offers a modular system that analyzes smart meter data to flag inefficiencies and flexibility using standardized, structured data. Its lightweight architecture emphasizes usability and integration-readiness, making it ideal for rapid industrial deployment. Faclon Labs uniquely integrates Al, Big Data, and energy systems to optimize consumption. With 400+ projects executed across India and tens of thousands of energy meters digitized, Faclon’s Al tools enable real-time diagnostics, anomaly detection, and demand forecasting.

To accelerate deployment of these solutions, investment partners AWE Funds, Synapses, Theia Ventures, ZeCa Capital, Spectrum Impact, and Ankur Capital signed MoUs pledging funding support and implementation assistance, subject to due diligence.

Gurdeep Singh, Chairman & Managing Director, NTPC felicitated the winners and remarked, “Innovation thrives when diverse minds come together to challenge conventions and co-create solutions. The Alliance in Action event demonstrates how constructive disruptors can address some of our toughest energy challenges, turning today’s problems into tomorrow’s possibilities.”

Woochong Um, CEO, GEAPP, added, “India’s strides in clean energy show how innovation and strong policy support can drive transformation. The urgency of the climate challenge demands collaborative action, where governments, businesses, civil society, and philanthropy come together to unlock capital, deploy solutions, and share knowledge at scale. India’s example offers both inspiration and practical models for the Global South to accelerate an equitable and inclusive transition.”

The convening also featured a fireside chat with Ashish Khanna (DG, International Solar Alliance), Woochong Um (CEO, GEAPP), and Saurabh Kumar (VP – India, GEAPP) on the role of the Multi Donor Trust Fund, which aims to mobilize funds for high-impact solar projects. A panel discussion on ‘Economic Development through Decentralized Renewable Energy (DRE)’ followed, moderated by Samit Mitra, Managing Director, Country Delivery – India, GEAPP.

Saurabh Kumar, Vice President - India, GEAPP, noted, “India’s journey towards a sustainable and energy-independent future is an alliance-driven mission. Initiatives like ENTICE provide a collaborative platform for innovators to scale the climate-tech solutions needed to build a smarter, more resilient grid.”

Building on this momentum, GEAPP will soon launch ENTICE 3.0, which will expand focus on deep tech innovation, grid resilience, and digitalization-driven energy efficiency, further advancing India’s renewable energy transition.

,Clean Energy ,2025-09-01 12:04:22+00:00,Los Angeles Times,Why electric vehicle drivers should charge their cars at the office - Los Angeles Times,"Jeff Myers, Jeff Myers Guest contributor",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2025-09-01/california-next-energy-challenge,"Most EV owners now have chargers at home and can conveniently replenish their vehicles’ energy stores overnight.
Although the typical lot hosts around 10 EV ports, some parking structures have space for more than 100.
Workplace EV charging networks were expected to triple by 2030, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation.
Continuing to push forward on network expansion and function, along with improving price structures to reflect the benefits of midday energy use, would go a long way.
Charging EVs midday would be a huge step toward utilizing that power.","With more than 1.9 million electric vehicles registered across its roads, accounting for more than a third of all EVs nationwide, California leads the U.S. in convincing drivers to switch away from internal combustion engines. Yet despite this success, the state is still failing to make the most of this important transition.

The cheapest and cleanest time to charge an EV is when the power grid is flush with solar energy — that is, when the sun is high in the middle of the day. This makes electric cars quite different from conventional gas-powered vehicles, whose pollution levels aren’t affected by when a driver pulls into the corner station.

In fact, while switching from gas-powered vehicles to EVs charged overnight can cut emissions by 80%, daytime charging can actually slash emissions a further 80%. But convincing Californians to change habits and fill their batteries midday isn’t easy.

Most EV owners now have chargers at home and can conveniently replenish their vehicles’ energy stores overnight. With our current energy mix, that means these cars are largely powered by natural gas that fuels the grid when the sun isn’t shining.

At UC San Diego, I’m part of the team running the world’s largest scientific experiments on human behavior when it comes to charging EVs at the workplace, meeting drivers where many are parked midday.

UCSD has created a great opportunity to study this emerging field by building a massive charging network — 550 ports today, with plans for 1,200 total by early 2026. These ports are spread across 42 parking lots, located on campus and at satellite locations such as hospitals and coastal labs. Although the typical lot hosts around 10 EV ports, some parking structures have space for more than 100. These are all “Level 2” stations, typically three to five times as powerful as a regular outlet charger and capable of replenishing more than half of a typical EV’s battery during a workday charging session of at least four hours.

We’ve leveraged this living laboratory to test how information shapes habits. It turns out that describing the benefits of daytime charging can effectively shift driver behaviors — albeit slightly.

Bigger changes in behaviors will require stronger incentives and more opportunity to refill batteries away from home. The best incentive could be for utilities to price electricity based on the real costs to provide it. Today, retail prices for electricity mostly vary based on grid infrastructure costs — that’s why retail rates are cheapest overnight, when our transmission and distribution lines have lots of unused capacity. In contrast, wholesale prices — what your electricity provider might pay a power generator — already demonstrate that electricity used midday usually costs less to generate and transmit to consumers.

Workplace EV charging networks were expected to triple by 2030, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation. However, the current pullback of federal support for more public EV stations will mean even greater need to add workplace ports.

Policymakers also need to focus more on the quality of the networks we’re building, not just on the number of chargers we can install. California has started addressing this issue by setting reliability requirements for EV stations to qualify for subsidies, but monitoring and enforcement have lagged. Continuing to push forward on network expansion and function, along with improving price structures to reflect the benefits of midday energy use, would go a long way.

The scale of this challenge — and the opportunity it represents — is vast.

Last year, California squandered enough solar and wind energy to supply more than half of all the EV charging needed in the state. We simply couldn’t use or store it all at the time it was generated. Charging EVs midday would be a huge step toward utilizing that power. Using the cheap, clean energy we’re already generating is an obvious win to reduce costs and emissions, and supportive policy can help us adjust our habits to get there.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6ee6ba8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5234x2748+0+564/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F60%2F5b%2F5bcb892e4a46972279d72e3acdcc%2F2219832726.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 09:01:19.703471

MORE ON KATRINA BBC News looks into how hurricane forecasting has developed since Katrina, while Scientific American says “budget cuts may set us back”.","On Friday, the US Department of Transportation cancelled $679m in federal funding for a dozen offshore wind projects, in what the Associated Press describes as the “latest attack by the Trump administration on the reeling US offshore wind industry”. Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, the newswire explains, including $435m for a floating wind farm in northern California and $47m to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the interior department has pledged to cancel. The article quotes a statement from transportation secretary Sean Duffy, who said: “Wasteful wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalising America’s maritime industry…Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritising real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.” In response, a spokesperson for California governor Gavin Newsom described the move as an example of the Trump administration “assaulting clean energy and infrastructure projects – hurting business and killing jobs in rural areas and ceding our economic future to China”, reports Reuters. CNBC has a full list of cancelled projects.

Also on Friday, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) fired “at least eight employees who signed a letter criticising the agency’s leadership” under the Trump administration, the Associated Press reports. It quotes an EPA spokesperson, who said the EPA “has a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November”. The so-called “declaration of dissent” in June was signed by 170 employees, the newswire notes, but the exact number that have been dismissed has not been disclosed. Reuters notes that the EPA placed about 140 employees on administrative leave after they signed the letter. In further EPA news, Politico reports that a “federal judge on Friday tossed out a lawsuit brought by almost two dozen nonprofit groups and localities whose environmental justice grants were terminated by EPA”.

Bloomberg reports on how the “American dream” of Danish wind power company Ørsted is becoming a “multi-billion dollar nightmare”, while Bloomberg’s “Energy Daily” newsletter says that “offshore wind is running into trouble everywhere except China”. The Financial Times reports that Norwegian oil and gas group Equinor is to pump “almost $1bn of fresh capital into Ørsted”.

Applicants for positions at the US National Weather Service are “being asked to explain how they would advance president Donald Trump’s agenda if hired”, reports the Associated Press.

The Guardian reports on how the information from the US climate.gov website, which was shut down in the summer, is to be “revived by volunteers” as climate.us with an “expanded mission”.

The US International Trade Commission voted on Friday to proceed with an investigation into whether solar panels from India, Laos and Indonesia are “stifling” domestic manufacturing, reports Reuters.

On Friday, California energy regulators “put the brakes on plans requiring oil companies to pay a penalty if their profits climb too high”, says the Associated Press.

Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK’s opposition Conservative party, has pledged to extract “all” the remaining oil and gas from the North Sea, reports the Financial Times, as her party “seeks to distance itself from its previous support for the country’s ‘net-zero’ emissions target”. If the Tories were to win power, Badenoch said the North Sea Transition Authority regulator would be rebranded as the North Sea Authority, with environmental regulations slashed in favour of a single mandate to “maximise the extraction of our oil and gas”, the newspaper reports. It quotes a statement, which comes ahead of a speech at a major oil and gas conference in Aberdeen tomorrow, in which Badenoch said the UK’s move away from oil and gas extraction was a “unilateral act of economic disarmament”. Badenoch added that it was “absurd” that the UK was “leaving vital resources untapped whilst neighbours like Norway extract them from the same seabed”, the article notes.

In her speech, Badenoch will also claim that net-zero measures mean households end up “paying the price through higher energy bills”, says BBC News. [A Carbon Brief factcheck earlier this year shows how the wholesale price of fossil gas is the main driver of high electricity prices in the UK.] In response to the statement, a government spokesperson said that “new licences to explore new fields…will not take a penny off bills, cannot make us energy secure and will only accelerate the worsening climate crisis”, reports the Guardian. Posting on BlueSky, Tessa Khan – executive director of the environment group Uplift – sets out the “reasons why we should treat [Badenoch’s announcement] with maximum scepticism”. There is further coverage in the Daily Telegraph, Independent, Daily Mail and Press Association, among others.

Energy secretary Ed Miliband has delayed a decision over a new hydrogen plant on Teesside “over fears it will clash with the prime minister’s flagship proposals to create an ‘AI growth zone’ in the same area”, says the Daily Telegraph.

BBC News reports that the “long and hot summer” has caused a “massive” spike in wildfires in Wales, while a separate article says a moorland fire that has been burning for 18 days has had a “quite devastating” impact on local wildlife.

The climate-sceptic Daily Telegraph continues its attacks on net-zero, with reporting on the “disarray” over plans for a floating wind farm in Scotland; how a French-owned wind farm is being paid for “electricity that wasn’t used”; how the world’s first all-electric airline has “sacked almost its entire workforce”; and accusations that Labour’s “cult of carbon” has caused an oil rig parts maker to shut down 80% of its UK operations.

In other reporting in a similar vein, the climate-sceptic Daily Mail has a double-page spread in its print edition on the “solar farm threat to Domesday villages”, while the Daily Express claims that Ed Miliband is “plotting” to switch British diets from meat to insects.

Pakistan’s eastern province of Punjab is dealing with its “biggest flood in its history”, as river levels have risen to all-time highs over the past week, reports the Associated Press in continuing coverage of the region’s extreme flooding. Punjab’s senior minister Maryam Aurangzeb told a press conference yesterday that it is the “first time that the three rivers – Sutlej, Chenab and Ravi – have carried such high levels of water” and the “flood has affected 2 million people”, the newswire reports. Late last week, rescuers “raced to evacuate tens of thousands of people stranded by floods”, reports another Associated Press article, “with many left without food or medical supplies”. The floods in the eastern Punjab province began “when an abnormal amount of rain triggered sudden water releases from Indian dams on the Sutlej, Chenab and Ravi rivers”, it explains. Reuters adds that officials in Pakistan said that the flooding was made worse by India’s suspension of a river-sharing treaty earlier this year.

The flooding is the worst that Punjab has seen for “nearly four decades”, says the Times of India. A second Times of India article says that 33 people have been killed and more than 700,000 have been evacuated. It adds: “Experts say global warming has made this year’s monsoon worse in Pakistan, which is highly exposed to climate change.” Another Reuters article says the “devastation threatens Pakistan’s economy”. The Guardian and Al Jazeera also have the story, while the Hindu reports that five people died and 11 are missing after “torrential rains wreaked havoc” in India’s northern state of Uttarakhand on Friday.

COP30 president-designate Andre Correa do Lago has “urged CEOs to ignore the Trump-led green backlash and come to the Amazonian city of Belem to step up the fight against global warming”, reports Bloomberg. In an interview with the newswire, Correa do Lago says “that recent attacks on clean energy sources…show that the interests of fossil fuel producers are increasingly threatened by the transition to a greener economy”, the article explains. He tells the newswire: ““The success of this agenda is a challenge to some businesses and some interests…This is the utmost demonstration that these policies worked or these policies are working and that they are somehow threatening some significant interest.” In a letter published on Friday, Correa do Lago also calls on the private sector to take a “step forward and not back” in order to make the transition an “exponential reality”, the article notes.

At a council of ministers meeting in Toulon on Friday, Germany and France “largely resolved” their “long-standing dispute” over nuclear power, with Germany recognising it as a low-emission source, reports Die Zeit. While France is not seeking EU funding for nuclear facilities, it is interested in research on small modular reactors, notes the outlet. Germany, in return, secured France’s backing for establishing hydrogen connections to southwestern Europe. Politico notes that both countries also agreed to better integrate energy markets and align on EU green laws. Meanwhile, Der Spiegel reports that climate scientist Dr Brigitte Knopf has warned against Germany misusing the climate and transformation fund (KTF). The finance ministry’s draft 2026 budget plans to use KTF funds to purchase emissions certificates, if Germany fails to meet its climate targets. Knopf called it “an absurd vicious circle”, saying funds intended for domestic climate action would instead pay for foreign certificates. Germany faces a projected 224m tonnes of CO2 “gap” by 2030, which could cost around €22bn at €100 per tonne of CO2, notes the newspaper.

There is continuing reflection in the media on the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which brought catastrophic flooding to New Orleans. In the Washington Post, reporter Brady Dennis writes: “The ordeal that followed produced images that remain seared into collective memories of a major American city drowning.” He adds: “In an era of climate change, the nation is facing more frequent and more intense weather-related disasters, and many places remain vulnerable to the sort of cataclysmal event that Katrina made clear was possible.”

New Orleans marked the anniversary with “memorials, performances and a parade to honour those who were affected”, says the Associated Press. While Time looks at the “important lessons” from Katrina, multiple outlets note that preparedness is still lacking in New Orleans and the US more widely. Vox says that the “walls built to protect New Orleans after Katrina are failing”; Al Jazeera notes that “experts warn disaster readiness lags in the US”; Euronews asks whether cuts to disaster preparedness could “leave the US vulnerable again”; and Politico reports on how a $3bn wetlands rebuilding project to offer storm protection in Louisiana has just been cancelled. There is more scrutiny of Katrina and its legacy in the New York Times, Boston Globe, Hill and Bloomberg. Netflix has a three-part documentary.

BBC News looks into how hurricane forecasting has developed since Katrina, while Scientific American says “budget cuts may set us back”.

The Los Angeles Times reports on the “lasting effects” of hurricanes on US minorities.

In an “exclusive”, Reuters reports that the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) has extended a hiring freeze through to at least the end of this year, as the peak of hurricane season approaches.

A Financial Times “big read” looks at how the Trump administration has “gutted” Fema, noting: “More than 180 Fema employees signed a letter to Congress last week saying that all the progress made in reforming the agency since Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast 20 years ago was now at risk.”

In the Hill, opinion contributors Justin Ángel Knighten and Will McDow write, respectively, that “disaster communication is in crisis” 20 years after Katrina, and “Katrina’s lessons show we shouldn’t abandon FEMA”.

Writing in the Daily Telegraph (see the second half of the article), former Tory cabinet minister and current editor of the Spectator Michael Gove says that environmentalists and Conservatives are “not just natural allies, but the strongest champions”. He continues: “There can, therefore, be no true conservatism which does not respect the natural world and recognise our duty to creation. For Conservatives, real environmentalism means honouring home, recognising the importance of prudence, restraint and respect for limits, and celebrating beauty.” Gove notes that there are “those on the right, many of whom might call themselves Conservatives, who do not recognise the importance of nature”. He argues that this perspective, which takes economic liberalism and “allows it to trump all other instincts”, is an “impoverished vision of Toryism”.

Elsewhere in the climate-sceptic newspaper, an editorial applauds Kemi Badenoch’s call to extract “all” remaining oil and gas from the North Sea. It describes the move as “common sense”, adding: “In a country where industrial users are facing the highest electricity prices in the developed world, and growth has been moribund for almost two decades, it is unaffordable. We must make use of every advantage available to us.” In the Daily Mirror, associate editor Kevin Maguire writes: “[Gas] output is sold on international markets and does virtually zilch to keep down energy bills, but she won’t tell you that, or that investing in North Sea wind electricity is the best financial, security and environmental strategy.” An editorial in the climate-sceptic Sun says it is “madness to put our energy security at risk for decades by ignoring huge reserves of fossil fuels in the North Sea”. It also calls for fracking to be “back on the agenda”.

While Germany’s new government stated it wanted the country to be home to the first nuclear fusion reactor in the coalition agreement, “it would be nice if it also stated that Germany will be the first country with ten hydrogen-ready gas-fired power plants,” Andreae said.

Germany’s new government has set the goal to build 20 gigawatts (GW) of new gas-fired power plants by 2030 to serve as backup for times of little wind and sunshine. These are needed to secure the country’s electricity system stability, especially in light of Germany’s coal phase out, the government argues. The economy ministry is still in talks with the European Commission regarding state aid it aims to provide to get these plants built. As Germany phases out fossil fuels, the plants could later undergo an extensive retrofit to run on green hydrogen, a clean fuel produced with electricity from renewables and water.

The BDEW head pointed out that next year’s federal budget did not focus enough on ramping up the hydrogen economy. “It is short-sighted to hesitate here,” she said.

Andreae called on Germany’s government to lead a European hydrogen alliance, similar to France’s “nuclear alliance”, to push for hydrogen-friendly EU regulations. “Global demand [for green hydrogen] will be enormous, and developing our own renewable energy sources, including [green hydrogen and derivatives], will make Europe more resilient to threats and dependencies,” Andreae said. “The energy transition strengthens our sovereignty.”",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-09-01 09:01:24.269001

Spatial correlation network characteristics of GTFEE Evolution of network In this study, the natural breakpoint method is employed to stratify the correlation network into four distinct levels, namely, the core network, basic network, conventional network, and edge network, based on the magnitude of correlation strength.","In recent years, profound changes have taken place in the driving forces of global economic growth, the way of production and life, and the direction of scientific and technological development. Energy is the key to economic development. Clean and efficient use of energy is the foothold of green and low-carbon economic transformation1. As the world’s largest energy producer and consumer, China has made remarkable achievements in the innovation and development of energy technology. However, China’s energy security situation is still severe, facing problems such as overall low energy efficiency2. In addition, China’s total coal consumption is still in the increasing phase, the total carbon dioxide emission has not reached the peak. The improvement of energy use efficiency is still faced with large constraints on energy supply structure and ecological environment pressure3. How to improve energy utilization efficiency and optimize energy distribution is one of the major issues that China’s economy needs to overcome in order to achieve energy consumption reduction and green development from the stage of high-speed growth to the stage of high-quality development.

In 2019, the State Council of China issued the ‘Outline of the Yangtze River Delta Regional Integration Development Plan’, which stipulates that 27 cities in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Anhui will constitute the core urban agglomeration of the Yangtze River Delta, exerting an influence on all cities within the broader region. Within this framework, the Yangtze River Delta region, characterized by its vibrant economic development, high level of openness, and robust innovation capacity, occupies a pivotal leadership position in promoting ‘regional integrated development’ and ‘high-quality economic development’ in China4. Nonetheless, the region is devoid of traditional energy resources and heavily reliant on energy imports from other provinces, with the total terminal energy demand accounting for approximately 17% of the nation’s total. Furthermore, the region exhibits a high proportion of fossil energy consumption, coupled with significant carbon emissions from the industrial sector. Consequently, the central region of the Yangtze River Delta continues to encounter numerous challenges in enhancing green total factor energy efficiency (GTFEE) and establishing a robust green circular economic system. Investigating GTFEE in the Yangtze River Delta is instrumental in further optimizing energy distribution and enhancing the efficiency of green energy utilization. Simultaneously, achieving low-carbon transformation and promoting integrated regional energy development holds profound significance within the international community.

Generally, the primary measurement indicators of energy encompass energy consumption5, energy intensity6, energy structure7, and energy efficiency8. Among these indicators, GTFEE takes into account diverse factors, including energy, labor, economy, and environment, embodying an “all-factor” characteristic that more accurately represents the interplay between economic development and energy utilization8. Recently, researchers have directed their attention towards identifying the pivotal factors influencing GTFEE2,3,9. Research on the urban scale and spatial correlation characteristics of GTFEE remains relatively scarce. Examining the spatial correlation characteristics of GTFEE among cities will assist governments in devising rational distributions of regional green and low-carbon energy sources, thereby optimizing the regional energy structure. Social Network Analysis (SNA) constitutes an efficacious approach for analyzing the correlation attributes of entities, particularly demonstrating potential in examining the correlation features between regions. At present, the SNA method has been widely used in the field of energy, for example, Xu et al.10 used the SNA method to analyze the associated characteristics of building energy performance gaps. Altuntas and Gök11 used the social network analysis method based on patent information to study wind energy technology. Patent documents were analyzed by applying social network analysis to identify the most influential and relevant technologies in the wind energy sector. However, limited research has been conducted on the evolutionary characteristics of the GTFEE spatial correlation network at the urban scale utilizing SNA.

GTFEE is an efficiency index that accounts for the mutual substitutability of production factors and structural alterations within the production process. It can be assessed through the development of a comprehensive evaluation index system alongside a radial DEA model12,13. Nevertheless, this methodology presents several issues, including the compensation of a high economic index value for a low environmental index value, disregard for the slack in input-output variables, and a tendency to overestimate the actual efficiency level14. Tone15 employed the SBM model, which incorporates undesirable outputs, to measure GTFEE. The results obtained from this method align more closely with the actual circumstances of GTFEE. Building on this foundation, an increasing number of scholars have extended the SBM model. Shi and Li3 applied the SBM-Malmquist-Luenberger index method to assess GTFEE in Chinese prefecture-level cities. Concurrently, Tong et al.16 further utilized the Super-SBM model to re-evaluate GTFEE. Xia and Gulinaer2, building upon prior research, constructed a non-radial, non-angular SBM-Undesirable model to assess GTFEE. Therefore, the Super-SBM model, which incorporates undesirable outputs, addresses the irrationalities inherent in the traditional DEA model that treats pollutant emissions as input variables17. This advancement holds profound significance for investigating changes in GTFEE.

In addition to the exploration of GTFEE measurement methods, the investigation of factors influencing GTFEE has garnered considerable attention. Firstly, economic development and energy efficiency exhibit a coordinated and synchronized relationship. Shifting the economic development paradigm leads to GTFEE enhancement18,19. Furthermore, green technology innovation contributes significantly to GTFEE improvement. This innovation effectively mitigates energy intensity20. Nonetheless, some scholars argue that the impact of innovation on energy efficiency can be hindered by technological bias, thus not invariably yielding positive outcomes21. Moreover, given the “market failure” resulting from resource and environmental externalities, the government implements a range of policies to regulate or encourage enterprises’ environmental conduct and green practices3,9. Hence, the influence of policy regulation on GTFEE cannot be overlooked. Additionally, the digital economy facilitates the rationalization and upgrading of the industrial structure, thereby enhancing GTFEE2. Yet, existing research predominantly focuses on the impact of individual factors on GTFEE, while the driving forces behind GTFEE network correlations remain underexplored.

In summary, the current research focuses more on analyzing the key factors affecting GTFEE, and there is a lack of research on the characteristics of urban scale and spatial association. Meanwhile, the existing research mainly focuses on the impact of a single factor on GTFEE, and does not comprehensively analyze the driving force of GTFEE network association. In addition, in terms of measurement methods, the traditional comprehensive evaluation index system and radial DEA model have some problems, such as high economic index value to compensate for low environmental index value, slack neglect of input-output variables, and easy overestimation of the true level.

In light of this, based on the production frontier theory, this study utilizes the urban agglomeration in the central region of the Yangtze River Delta, China, as a case study, with the objective of conducting a comprehensive assessment of GTFEE and its spatial correlation characteristics at the urban scale. This is achieved by incorporating a super-efficiency model that accounts for undesired outputs and employing the SNA method. Additionally, the quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) is employed to investigate the driving forces behind network correlation and to identify the key factors influencing these correlation characteristics. Thus, this study provides a scientific basis for understanding the city-scale spatial interaction mechanisms of GTFEE and for fostering regional energy integration.

This paper is divided into four parts. Section 2 gives a brief description of the research area, data sources, research methods and research framework. Section 3 analyzes the spatial and temporal pattern, spatial correlation network characteristics and driving factors of GTFEE in the central area of Yangtze River Delta. Finally, Sect. 4 gives the discussion, conclusion and policy recommendations.

Study area and data source

The research objects of this study are the 27 cities involved in the urban agglomeration of the central area of the Yangtze River Delta. This paper uses ArcGIS software to draw the urban agglomeration of the central area of the Yangtze River Delta. (Fig. 1). The city base map presented is sourced from the standard vector map available on the website of the Standard Map Service of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China (http://211.159.153.75/). The review number downloaded from the map service website is GS(2020)3189. In order to better reflect the long-term spatiotemporal variation trend of GTFEE, and at the same time, QAP regression analysis requires sufficient data to support its results Therefore, in this paper, while ensuring the availability of data and minimizing missing values, the data of the central urban agglomeration of the Yangtze River Delta from 2006 to 2022 are selected for research. The pertinent data were obtained from the statistical yearbooks of each prefecture-level city spanning the years 2006 to 2023, with additional data sourced from the Statistical Bulletin of Social Development.

Research framework

GTFEE represents a comprehensive index designed to quantify both economic benefits and environmental impacts. Building upon conventional total factor productivity analysis, GTFEE incorporates additional factors such as energy consumption and environmental pollution. This enables a more comprehensive assessment of the sustainability of economic activities.

Referring existing studies22,23, this study considers capital, labor, and energy as inputs, defines the gross regional product as the desired output, and identifies industrial sulfur dioxide emissions, smoke dust, and industrial wastewater as environmental discharge outputs. The Super-SBM model is used to assess GTFEE of the urban agglomeration in the central area of Yangtze River Delta. Subsequently, exploratory spatio-temporal data analysis is used to reveal the characteristics of spatio-temporal interaction. Then, social network analysis is used to investigate the spatial correlation network characteristics of GTFEE. Lastly, QAP model is used to analyze the driving force of network correlation and reveal the key factors that affect the correlation characteristics. The research framework is shown in Fig. 2.

Super-SBM model

In contrast to the traditional DEA model, the Super-SBM model, which accounts for undesired outputs, integrates relaxation variables within the objective function. The model assumes a monotonically linear relationship between inputs and outputs, that is, the relative efficiency of decision unit (DMU) is determined by linear programming techniques. Firstly, it addresses the issue of non-zero relaxations in input-output, and secondly, it resolves the problem of undesired outputs inherent in the production process15. Consequently, this study employs the Super-SBM model to assess the GTFEE of urban agglomerations in the central Yangtze River Delta region. The corresponding calculation formula is presented in Eq. (1).

$$\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {\hbox{min} \rho =\frac{{\frac{1}{m}\sum\limits_{{h=1}}^{m} {(\overline {x} /{x_{hk}})} }}{{\frac{1}{{{r_1}+{r_2}}}(\sum\limits_{{l=1}}^{{{r_1}}} {\overline {{{e^d}}} /e_{{lk}}^{d}+\sum\limits_{{p=1}}^{{{r_2}}} {\overline {{{e^u}}} /e_{{pk}}^{u})} } }}} \\ {\left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {\overline {x} \geqslant \sum\limits_{{a=1, \ne k}}^{n} {{x_{ha}}{\lambda _a};\overline {{{e^d}}} \leqslant \sum\limits_{{a=1, \ne k}}^{n} {e_{{ha}}^{d}{\lambda _a};\overline {{{e^d}}} \geqslant \sum\limits_{{a=1, \ne k}}^{n} {e_{{pa}}^{d}{\lambda _a}} } } } \\ {\overline {x} \geqslant {x_k};\overline {{{e^d}}} \leqslant e_{{la}}^{d};\overline {{{e^u}}} \geqslant e_{{pk}}^{u}} \\ {{\lambda _h} \geqslant 0,h=1,2, \cdot \cdot \cdot ,m;a=1,2, \cdot \cdot \cdot ,n;a \ne 0} \\ {l=1,2, \cdot \cdot \cdot ,{r_1};p=1,2, \cdot \cdot \cdot ,{r_2}} \end{array}} \right.} \end{array}$$

Social network analysis

GTFEE gravity model

Based on the study by Yin et al.24, a GTFEE gravity model is developed in this paper. Furthermore, the network nodes represent the GTFEE of each city, while the edges depict the connections among the GTFEE values of the cities. This model integrates information pertaining to economy, geographical distance, and energy efficiency. The gravity of GTFEE and the gravity coefficient are computed using Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively.

$${a_{ij}}={k_{ij}}\frac{{{X_i} \times {X_j}}}{{\gamma D_{{_{{ij}}}}^{b}}}$$

(2)

$${k_{ij}}=\frac{{{X_i}}}{{{X_i}+{X_j}}}$$

Where, aij is gravity of GTFEE between cities i and j; xi is the GTFEE of the i city; kij is the gravity coefficient of GTFEE from city i to j; Dij is the distance between cities i and j; b is the distance coefficient. b = 1 is set in this paper. γ represents the weight coefficient of geographical distance.

Overall network

The primary characteristics of the overall network structure encompass three indices: network correlation (NC), network density (ND), and network efficiency (NE), which are calculated using Eq. (4) to (6). These indices characterize the reachability among regions within the network, the strength of inter-regional relationships, and the degree of line redundancy in the network.

$${N_C}=1 - \frac{V}{{n(n - 1)/2}}$$

$${N_E}=1 - \frac{S}{{\hbox{max} (S)}}$$

(6)

Where, n is the number of regions in the network; V is the number of unreachable point pairs in the network; W is the actual number of connections between nodes; S is the number of redundant lines; max(S) is the maximum number of possible redundant lines.

Individual network

The key attributes of individual network structures comprise degree centrality (DC), closeness centrality (CC), and betweenness centrality (BC). These dimensions respectively quantify the number of direct connections for each node, the proximity of a node to all other nodes in the network, and the extent to which a node serves as a mediator within the network. The formulae for these calculations are presented in Eq. (7) to (9).

$$DC{\text{=}}\frac{{{L_m}}}{{2(P - 1)}}$$

(9)

Where, Lm is the number of connections with endpoint m; P is the number of cities in the network; q is the sum of all actual network connections; dmn is the shortest distance from m to n; hnk(m) is the number of times that city m appears in the shortcut associated with city n and k.

Clustering of networks

In this study, we employ the block model analysis method from Social Network Analysis (SNA) to perform cluster analysis on the network, as outlined by Yu et al.25. Utilizing the iterative correlation convergence method26, we categorize the GTFEE spatial correlation network into four blocks: the bidirectional overflow block, the net overflow block, the main benefit block, and the agent block. Furthermore, we investigate the spatial correlation and interaction mechanisms between GTFEE within the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration. The characteristics of each block are detailed in Table 1.

Analysis of influencing factors

The formation of the GTFEE network is potentially influenced by a multitude of factors. The factors listed in Table 2 exert an indirect influence on the GTFEE network through their impact on green energy efficiency. These influencing factors are elaborated upon as follows.

1.

Economic development level: On the one hand, some scholars argue that rapid economic growth often comes at the expense of a degraded living environment, thereby impeding the enhancement of green energy efficiency. However, other scholars posit that as economic growth occurs, people’s living standards and education levels improve, and this, in turn, significantly enhances environmental awareness among some individuals, thereby fostering the promotion of green transformation across various provinces2.

2.

Industrial structure: The impact of various industries on GTFEE varies. Among these, the primary industry consumes relatively little energy and has a minimal impact on the ecological environment. The secondary industry, particularly heavy chemical and manufacturing industries, consumes significantly more energy during its development, especially in terms of power resources, exerting a greater impact on the ecological environment. As economy and society develop, the tertiary industry increasingly dominates, yet it relies less on energy, thus having a relatively minor impact. Nonetheless, the overall shift in industrial structure significantly influences the GTFEE level within a region27.

3.

Green technology innovation: Green technology innovation has the potential to optimize energy consumption structures and enhance the utilization efficiency of diverse energy sources. Ultimately, the goal is to influence the overall level of green development by enhancing the capacity to manage undesirable outputs resulting from energy consumption18.

4.

Green finance: The development of the Internet and the tightening of environmental regulations have indirectly facilitated the enhancement of regional total factor energy efficiency through green finance. Additionally, green finance stimulates innovation in green energy technologies. Furthermore, the ascendancy of the digital economy further augments the role of green finance in enhancing energy efficiency28.

5.

Environmental regulation: Environmental regulation serves as an effective mechanism to mitigate pollution pressures on the ecological environment, while the reinforcement of such regulations facilitates the adoption of more efficient and environmentally friendly energy practices by enterprises27.

6.

Level of digital economy: The digital economy exerts a significant influence on the balanced development of escalating energy demands and the low-carbon energy transition. The advancement of the digital economy can facilitate the acceleration of green energy utilization efficiency1,2.

7.

Urbanization level: Urbanization results in population agglomeration, subsequently boosting the demand for energy consumption. Nonetheless, urbanization also accelerates the innovation and adoption of green technologies, thereby enhancing the efficiency of green energy utilization29.

8.

Spatial proximity: Due to the fact that GTFEE among neighboring cities can mutually influence each other, particularly in the realms of resource sharing, technological collaboration, and industrial relocation, spatial proximity relationships may consequently impact GTFEE levels.

In QAP regression analysis, the researcher will assume that the data is in the form of a symmetric square matrix and there is interdependence ‌between the variables. Given the potential for multicollinearity among the selected variables in this study, the QAP model does not necessitate the assumption of variable independence34, the QAP model can be directly used for analysis. Consequently, the QAP model, as outlined in Eq. (10), is employed to investigate the driving forces behind the network correlation of various factors.

$$Y=\beta X+\varepsilon$$

(10)

Where, Y is the intensity matrix of GTFEE spatial correlation between cities; X is the vector matrix composed of various influencing factors.

Spatiotemporal evolution of GTFEE

Figure 3 illustrates the overall trend of GTFEE changes in 27 cities located in the central region of China’s Yangtze River Delta over the period from 2006 to 2022. As depicted in Fig. 3, GTFEE exhibited a rapid increase during the period from 2006 to 2012. During the years 2013–2014, GTFEE underwent a slight decrease. From 2014 onwards, GTFEE has consistently increased. Nevertheless, starting in 2016, GTFEE in the central region of the Yangtze River Delta has demonstrated a fluctuating upward trajectory. Overall, the trend of GTFEE in these cities is on an upward path, suggesting that the green energy efficiency of the urban agglomeration in the central region of the Yangtze River Delta is continuously enhancing, and green and low-carbon development is progressing in a systematic manner.

To delve deeper into the spatio-temporal distribution patterns of GTFEE in the central region of the Yangtze River Delta from 2006 to 2022, the present study categorizes the GTFEE of the urban agglomeration into four levels. The results are presented in Fig. 4. Generally, GTFEE exhibits an upward trend from 2006 to 2022. Nonetheless, notable disparities in GTFEE are observed among cities. During the initial phase, the spatial distribution of GTFEE was characterized by higher values in the north and south, and lower values in the center. From 2012 onwards, there has been a significant increase in GTFEE in the central region of the Yangtze River Delta, particularly in the core cities of the urban agglomeration. This surge is attributed to the policy environment in the Yangtze River Delta region. In 2018, the GTFEE of the urban agglomeration remained relatively stable. Nonetheless, GTFEE in the eastern coastal cities exhibited a continuous improvement, indicating a gradual expansion towards surrounding cities. By 2022, GTFEE had developed a distinct spatial pattern characterized by urban agglomeration. The agglomeration effect was particularly evident in the northeast, and the area of high GTFEE concentration in the east expanded progressively.

Spatial correlation network characteristics of GTFEE

Evolution of network

In this study, the natural breakpoint method is employed to stratify the correlation network into four distinct levels, namely, the core network, basic network, conventional network, and edge network, based on the magnitude of correlation strength. Figure 5 illustrates the spatial distribution of the GTFEE association network within the central region of the Yangtze River Delta. The core and basic networks are predominantly concentrated in the northern section of the central Yangtze River Delta region. Between 2006 and 2022, there has been no noteworthy alteration in the prominent position of GTFEE in the northern part of the central Yangtze River Delta region. Furthermore, since 2018, the quantity of core networks has started to rise, and the significance of GTFEE in the northern region has become increasingly evident.

Overall characteristics of the network

Table 3 presents an overview of the characteristics of the GTFEE spatial correlation network. As evident from Table 3, the GTFEE network correlation for the urban agglomeration in the central Yangtze River Delta region is 1, suggesting a strong interconnection among nodes and the presence of a spatial spillover effect. In comparison to the years 2006, 2012, and 2018, the network density in 2022 has notably increased, indicating a closer connection in green energy utilization between cities. An increasing number of cities are becoming interdependent and mutually influenced in their green energy consumption. This trend is attributed to the recent optimization of industrial structures, the acceleration of green and low-carbon industrial transformations, and the promotion of green and clean energy utilization. Nonetheless, from 2006 to 2022, a declining trend in network efficiency has been observed. Concurrently, the value of network density remains relatively low. This further indicates that, despite the continually strengthening correlation between cities, there is a need to enhance the efficiency of green energy use and strengthen the conversion and utilization of green energy across regions.

Individual characteristics of the network

Table 4 presents the results of the individual centrality indices for the GTFEE spatial correlation networks. In this study, we analyze the status and function of the urban network based on degree centrality (DC), closeness centrality (CC), and betweenness centrality (BC). As evident from Table 4, the DC values for Changzhou, Shanghai, Wuxi, Hangzhou, and Nanjing are notably higher, suggesting that these cities exhibit significant achievements in green and low-carbon transformation and maintain strong connections with their adjacent regions. The lower DC values observed for Anqing, Chizhou, Chuzhou, and Yancheng imply weaker connections with other cities in the network.

In terms of CC values, Changzhou, Shanghai, Wuxi, Hangzhou, and Nanjing exhibit consistently high scores, indicating their ability to swiftly connect with other regions in the network, serving as pivotal nodes within the network, and facilitating the dissemination of green energy initiatives. Hangzhou and Wuxi, with high BC values, emerge as key hubs for the production and utilization of green energy. The BC values for Chuzhou, Yancheng, Chizhou, and other cities approach zero, suggesting that cities with smaller populations and scales exert minimal influence on the GTFEE of other cities. The comprehensive analysis reveals that GTFEE is primarily associated with capital cities and major industrial hubs, exemplified by Hangzhou, Nanjing, Wuxi, and Shanghai. However, the impact of smaller cities on network connectivity is comparatively limited.

From the perspective of evolution characteristics, the core cities show the characteristics of stability and diffusion from 2006 to 2022. Shanghai and Wuxi have always been in a dominant position, and at the same time, the sub-core has matured, for example, the DC values of Nanjing and Changzhou have also begun to rise. In addition, the differentiation trend of network hierarchy is significant, and the provincial capital cities or large industrial cities always maintain high connectivity, while the DC value of Chizhou decreases, and the BC value of Chuzhou is always close to 0, indicating that small cities are always at the edge of the network. Meanwhile, the period from 2012 to 2018 is a turning point, with Suzhou starting to decline from the absolute core and Hangzhou gradually becoming the key node of green energy transmission.

Clustering characteristics of the network

Figure 6 illustrates the clustering patterns of the GTFEE spatial correlation network spanning from 2006 to 2022. As illustrated in Fig. 6, over time, there is an increase in the number of cities within the bidirectional overflow block and the main benefit block, indicating frequent energy exchanges among cities and mutual influences on GTFEE. Among these cities, Zhoushan, Ningbo, Jinhua, Wenzhou, and Taizhou consistently belong to the bidirectional overflow block, suggesting that they not only satisfy their own green energy demands but also contribute to the energy supply of other cities. Anqing, Chizhou, Xuancheng, Maanshan, Wuhu, Hefei, and Tongling have consistently been classified within the main benefit block. Notably, traditional resource-based cities, including Chizhou, Xuancheng, and Maanshan, require external green technology assistance to enhance their GTFEE levels. Other cities exhibit a continuous transition from the net overflow block to the bidirectional overflow block. These cities demonstrate a higher level of development and exert considerable external influence.

From 2006 to 2022, the mobility of green energy among regions has persistently existed. Furthermore, over time, the concept of net overflow regions has gradually diminished, while the mobility of resources and information amongst cities has consistently augmented. This observation further implies that, amidst the process of national integration, the frequency of factor flows between cities within the central region of the Yangtze River Delta has intensified, the circulation of energy sources has escalated, and consequently, the efficiency of green energy utilization has enhanced.

Driving force analysis

The results of the QAP regression analysis are presented in Table 5. A stronger network correlation strength of a city is associated with a greater impact of GTFEE on the surrounding area, thus increasing the likelihood of it contributing to the collective utilization of regional green energy. In 2006, the industrial structure and urbanization level exerted a significant negative influence. However, over time, the impact of industrial structure and urbanization level on GTFEE correlation strength gradually diminished and became nonsignificant. Green finance exhibited a significant positive effect solely in 2018. In the long term, the industrial structure, urbanization level, and green finance may cease to be the primary determinants within the network.

The impact of the digital economy on GTFEE correlation strength was not statistically significant. However, by 2022, it had evolved into a significant positive effect, primarily attributed to China’s initial proposal in 2019 to vigorously develop the digital economy, which exhibited a lag in its developmental impact. During the period from 2006 to 2018, the impact of the digital economy was not significant; however, its influence has been progressively increasing.

The influence of green technology innovation from 2006 to 2022 has been significantly positive. Over time, the impact of green technology innovation on the strength of GTFEE correlation has progressively intensified. This indicates that China’s emphasis on innovation has been on the rise, positioning innovation as the primary driver of productivity, thereby establishing green technology innovation as a pivotal determinant of network correlation intensity.

Environmental regulation has had a significant positive impact between 2018 and 2022, and its influence has been progressively increasing. In recent years, China has consistently prioritized green and ecological development, accompanied by the reinforcement of ecological supervision across multiple domains. This, in turn, has facilitated the adoption and enhanced efficiency of green energy.

The influence of spatial proximity on the strength of GTFEE correlation is significantly positive, suggesting that neighboring cities may exhibit mutual influences in terms of resource sharing, technical cooperation, and industrial transfer, among others. Consequently, spatial proximity emerges as a crucial determinant of GTFEE network correlation strength.

Discussion

Utilizing the Super-SBM model, which accounts for unexpected outputs, alongside the SNA method, this study thoroughly examines the disparities and interconnections of GTFEE within urban agglomerations in the central Yangtze River Delta region, thereby offering a more holistic perspective on regional energy coordination and development. In contrast to conventional research that primarily emphasizes the examination of variations in energy consumption, energy intensity, and energy structure, GTFEE provides a more comprehensive reflection of the interplay between the economy and the environment, enabling a more thorough assessment of the sustainability of economic activities.

Research on energy use efficiency has progressively garnered the attention of scholars; however, the majority of studies have been limited to examining the impact of a single factor on overall energy use efficiency9,22,35. Regional division and attribution analysis have been overlooked34. Employing a block-based community partitioning approach, this study delves deeply into the dynamic transfer mechanism. Concurrently, by integrating major social and economic indicators, this study identifies the key drivers influencing network connectivity strength, thus offering a significant reference for policy formulation and regional cooperation in promoting green energy efficiency.

The coordinated development of energy integration across cities is crucial for achieving adjustments in urban energy structures and enhancing energy efficiency. Our findings indicate that solely relying on individual cities to enhance green energy use efficiency, while neglecting spatial correlation effects, may hinder the rapid allocation and transfer of green technologies and resources. This aligns with the notion of accelerating regional energy integration and reducing regional disparities in green total factor energy efficiency, as proposed by Feng et al.36. Furthermore, echoing the research conducted by Feng et al.36 on the national green energy use efficiency network, a notable imbalance is observed in the GTFEE correlation network within the central region of the Yangtze River Delta. This imbalance may precipitate a future ‘Matthew effect’, whereby the intensification of urbanization and innovation capacity could exacerbate the concentration of high-efficiency green energy use areas in select advantageous cities.

From the perspective of network complexity, the correlation between the overall scale and density of GTFEE networks within the central urban agglomeration of the Yangtze River Delta is on the rise. This may be attributed to cities’ heightened focus on energy structure adjustment and green development, coupled with the progressive refinement of regional energy integration systems, which has augmented the regional significance of GTFEE.

The results of community division, utilizing the block model, further elucidate the spatial correlation mechanism of GTFEE. Cities within different blocks demonstrate distinct characteristics and functions in relation to GTFEE. For instance, cities within the bidirectional overflow block enhance the efficiency of green energy utilization by facilitating resource sharing. Cities within the net overflow block exert a significant influence on other regions. Cities within the main benefit block require access to resources from other blocks and technological innovation to enhance the efficiency of green energy utilization. Meanwhile, over time, the net overflow block gradually dissipated, and the circulation of resources and information between cities steadily increased. This indicates that, amidst the process of national integration, the frequency of inter-city factor flows in the central region of the Yangtze River Delta has steadily risen, leading to enhanced energy utilization and circulation, and subsequently improved efficiency of green energy use.

Finally, this study demonstrates that green technology innovation, environmental regulation, and spatial proximity exert significant positive influences on the strength of GTFEE network connections. This finding further corroborates the research conducted by Yao et al.20 and Shi and Li3 from a spatial perspective. Concurrently, this study confirms the positive impact of the digital economy on GTFEE from a spatial dimension, thereby reinforcing the research conclusions of Xia and Gulinaer2, which were derived using a panel regression model. In conclusion, this study offers valuable insights for the formulation and implementation of joint carbon emission reduction policies across cities in the future.

In addition, there are still some shortcomings in this study. First of all, the region involved in this study is limited to the central urban agglomeration of the Yangtze River Delta, which has a good level of economic development. The research conclusions may not be applicable to the regions with a large gap with the economic development level of the region. Therefore, future research can compare and explore the differences in temporal and spatial changes of GTFEE at different levels of development by region. Secondly, QAP regression is mainly used to analyze network data, and its results are easily affected by the complexity of network structure. In the driver analysis, if the network structure is complex, the use of QAP method may bring bias to the results. Based on this, future research can further optimize the research methods of driving factors, so that the reliability and robustness of the results can be continuously improved.

Conclusion

1.

The overall GTFEE of urban agglomerations in the central region of the Yangtze River Delta exhibits a decreasing trend, with agglomeration observed in both high-efficiency and low-efficiency cities. The urban agglomeration located in the northern section of the central Yangtze River Delta region holds a pivotal role within the GTFEE spatial correlation network. Furthermore, the rise in network density coupled with the decline in efficiency indicates substantial potential for coordinated energy development among cities.

In the individual network analysis, cities exhibiting strong associations with GTFEE are predominantly provincial capitals or major industrial hubs, exemplified by Hangzhou, Nanjing, Wuxi, and Shanghai. Nonetheless, the impact of smaller cities on the network’s correlation is relatively minimal. The growing number of cities participating and the gradual diminution of the net overflow block within the bidirectional overflow network community indicate an intensifying interdependence and influence of GTFEE among urban centers.

3.

The driving force analysis revealed that green technology innovation, environmental regulations, and spatial proximity exert significant positive influences on the connectivity strength of the GTFEE network. Furthermore, the accelerated growth of the digital economy in recent years has resulted in a sustained significant correlation impact of this factor on the GTFEE network.

Policy suggestions

To achieve regional coordinated energy development in the central Yangtze River Delta region, this paper proposes the following suggestions.

1.

Develop tailored energy development policies based on the variations in carbon emission efficiency among urban industries. Provincial capitals and major cities, exemplified by Hangzhou, Nanjing, Wuxi, and Shanghai, should allocate more resources to green energy investment, whereas smaller and medium-sized cities must enhance their environmental regulatory oversight.

2.

Leverage the pivotal roles of core cities in fostering green technological innovation and enhancing energy efficiency, and institute regional cooperation frameworks to assist peripheral cities in optimizing their green energy utilization.

3.

Based on the level of urban centrality, devise differentiated energy utilization strategies to facilitate technological innovation and knowledge exchange. Highly centralized urban areas should adopt cutting-edge technologies to enhance the overall efficiency of green energy utilization. Less centralized urban centers are collaborating with highly centralized ones to optimize the efficiency of green energy consumption.

4.

In light of the multifaceted influences of green technological innovation, environmental regulations, green finance, and the digital economy on the holistic development of regional green energy, governmental entities ought to foster the growth of high-tech enterprises, facilitate the transition of foreign trade towards clean energy sources, achieve a balance between urbanization and environmental sustainability, promote cleaner production practices within heavy industries, and implement more stringent environmental protection standards.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-17905-2/MediaObjects/41598_2025_17905_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-09-01 09:59:23.759959

With only 30 days left to utilize these credits, buyers can navigate the contrasting benefits from each administration’s policy initiatives.
Even with the Biden tax credit, buyers may still be facing a premium of around $1,500 compared to gas-powered vehicles.
Additionally, Biden’s legislation provides a $4,000 tax credit for qualifying used EVs, although this credit is not applicable for the Trump tax credit.
In summary, the confluence of federal tax credits may offer potential savings for those in the market for a new electric vehicle, aligning well with Labor Day shopping.","As Labor Day approaches, prospective electric vehicle (EV) buyers are presented with a unique opportunity to capitalize on tax credits from both the Biden and Trump administrations, potentially securing significant savings. With only 30 days left to utilize these credits, buyers can navigate the contrasting benefits from each administration’s policy initiatives.

The Biden administration’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act offers an enticing incentive of up to $7,500 in tax credits for those purchasing new plug-in electric vehicles or fuel-cell electric vehicles. However, it’s important to note that this credit is set to expire on September 30. This gives buyers a narrow window to secure the benefit just in time for the holiday.

On the other hand, the “Big Beautiful Bill,” championed by the Trump administration, proposes an annual tax credit of up to $10,000 on interest accrued from loans for new vehicles. This credit is applicable for cars weighing less than 14,000 pounds and assembled in the United States and is effective for purchases made between 2025 and 2028.

The potential for combining these tax incentives could lead to considerable savings, though financial experts advise caution when considering the purchase of a new EV. The current market shows that the average cost for a new electric vehicle hovers around $57,734, according to Kelley Blue Book. Even with the Biden tax credit, buyers may still be facing a premium of around $1,500 compared to gas-powered vehicles. However, a long-term view on expenses reveals that the projected five-year fuel costs are significantly lower for EVs—approximately $4,295 for electric vehicles versus $9,490 for traditional gas vehicles.

For those willing to consider alternatives to new cars, the used EV market offers a more budget-friendly option, with average prices around $20,000 less than new models. Additionally, Biden’s legislation provides a $4,000 tax credit for qualifying used EVs, although this credit is not applicable for the Trump tax credit.

Buyers should also be mindful of specific eligibility criteria associated with each tax credit. Under the “Big Beautiful Bill,” the auto loan tax credit begins to phase out for individual incomes between $100,000 and $150,000, and for joint filers between $200,000 and $250,000. Furthermore, this credit is not available for fleet purchases, commercial vehicles, or leasing arrangements.

To qualify for the EV tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act, consumers must purchase a vehicle assembled in North America and meet income thresholds of $150,000 for individuals and $300,000 for joint filers.

In summary, the confluence of federal tax credits may offer potential savings for those in the market for a new electric vehicle, aligning well with Labor Day shopping. However, prospective buyers should carefully evaluate their options, keeping in mind the financial implications and eligibility requirements associated with each credit to make an informed decision.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Labor-Day-Deals-Maximize-EV-Savings-with-Biden-and-Trump.png,N,,2025-09-01 09:01:02.113229

But in rural western Fresno County—where energy firms have planned multiple large-scale battery and solar projects—many residents feel blindsided.
The stakes are big near Darden, including for Newsom's plans to expedite other clean energy projects.
Intersect's community benefits spending, she said, is ""going directly to highly reputable nonprofits"" and community-based organizations that will focus on western Fresno County.
Even so, the fire protection district said it will need to build four new stations and hire additional staff as more large clean energy projects are built.","The fallowed farmland—too dry, salty and barren to grow crops—stretches across a remote, sunbaked expanse crisscrossed by rutted dirt roads.

Soon, roughly 15 square miles of these retired agricultural fields in western Fresno County will hold one of the world's largest solar and battery energy storage projects—a behemoth capable of powering some 850,000 homes for four hours.

The Darden Clean Energy Project, approved by the California Energy Commission in June, is the first development to be fast-tracked under a 2022 state law that allows large renewable energy projects to be reviewed and permitted without sign-off from county and municipal governments.

The Opt-In Certification Program, as it is called, is meant to sidestep the kind of local pushback that can drag on for years. And the Darden project's approval was touted by Gov. Gavin Newsom as a major victory in helping the state meet its ambitious climate goal of using 100% clean energy by 2045.

But in rural western Fresno County—where energy firms have planned multiple large-scale battery and solar projects—many residents feel blindsided. They have raised serious questions about who benefits and who gets left behind when major projects are fast-tracked.

Espi Sandoval, a board member for the nonprofit Rural Communities Rising, a western Fresno County advocacy group, said the impoverished, mostly Latino area has long been exploited by corporate agriculture and now is playing catch-up as it finds itself suddenly at the forefront of California's energy transition.

""We're forgotten by the government. Now we've got this private sector coming in with these huge solar panel farms,"" said Sandoval, who has lived in western Fresno County since 1972. ""I don't want to see the same exploitation of our people.""

Within a few miles of the Darden site are several tiny farmworker towns, including Cantua Creek, Five Points and Three Rocks (also known as El Porvenir). The solar and lithium-ion battery project will be built within a census tract where more than a third of residents live in poverty—double the rate in Fresno County as a whole.

The nearby towns struggle with poor drinking water and air quality, extreme heat and lack of access to opportunity, dozens of environmental justice groups and community advocates wrote in a letter to Newsom and the Energy Commission as the project was being considered.

In its oversight of the Darden project, they wrote, the state ""has the potential to either set the stage for an equitable, just transition or, conversely, to continue patterns of disinvestment in low-income communities of color.""

The Darden project's owner, IP Darden I, a subsidiary of San Francisco-based Intersect Power, is set to become the second-largest property tax payer in Fresno County, behind Pacific Gas and Electric. Intersect will pay at least $232 million to the county over the next decade, according to an economic impact report by the company.

The project is also projected to generate tens of millions of dollars in local sales tax, including through the purchase of construction equipment and materials, according to Intersect Power. The company said it will create more than 1,200 construction jobs while it is being built and 16 full-time operational jobs once it's up and running.

Maria Pacheco, the mayor of Kerman, a small city northeast of the Darden site, wrote in a letter to the Energy Commission this spring that the project's jobs and tax revenue will be transformative for the San Joaquin Valley. They will help provide ""essential services and infrastructure improvements, directly benefiting the often-underserved west side,"" she wrote.

The stakes are big near Darden, including for Newsom's plans to expedite other clean energy projects. The Opt-In Certification Program requires environmental reviews to be completed within 270 days of a project application being deemed complete.

Eight other projects, from Imperial County in the south to Shasta County in the north, are currently pursuing approval through the opt-in process. And after significant local pushback, a developer that has been planning to build a lithium-ion battery storage facility on the site where Morro Bay's iconic smokestacks stand pulled out of the municipal permitting process this spring, indicating it might pursue the state's fast-track program.

As part of the fast-track process, Intersect Power was required to enter into at least one so-called ""community benefits agreement"" with a local organization and to provide tangible benefits to the region.

Intersect Power agreed to donate $2 million to local groups over the next 10 years and $5 million over the life of the project.

In a statement to The Times, Elizabeth Knowles, the head of community engagement for Intersect, said the company has been meeting with residents, schools and other local stakeholders since 2023. Intersect's community benefits spending, she said, is ""going directly to highly reputable nonprofits"" and community-based organizations that will focus on western Fresno County.

Much of the initial $2 million will be split among Fresno-based nonprofits that work to build housing and reduce asthma and hunger. An Intersect donation to the nonprofit Centro la Familia Advocacy Services was used to give away 250 high-efficiency window air-conditioning units to households close to the Darden site this summer.

The company also agreed to give money to Westside Elementary School, about four miles southeast of the site, to support campus upgrades and efforts to build more local housing.

Some donations have raised eyebrows. An undisclosed amount of the Intersect Power donations will also fund two years of after-school piano lessons from the Steinway Piano Gallery of Fresno at Cantua Elementary School.

In an email to The Times, Felipe Piedra, superintendent of the Golden Plains Unified School District, which includes Cantua Elementary, said 98% of the school's roughly 185 students qualify for free or reduced lunch and ""are in need of additional support and resources."" He said ""water and clean energy are a big priority"" but did not answer questions about why funds were going towards piano lessons.

Intersect Power is donating an undisclosed amount to the nonprofit Tree Fresno, which plants shade trees to reduce the effects of extreme heat and air pollution.

Sandoval, a former member of the Kerman City Council and longtime teacher in nearby Tranquility, scoffed at the piano lessons and tree donation, noting that Cantua Elementary is across the street from an orchard. He said he was frustrated to see Intersect Power working primarily with Fresno-based nonprofits.

""This thing is dictated from the top,"" he said. ""How is the money going to filter down to the community? Property taxes? That's going to the county. How can we get some of those benefits?""

In an email to The Times, Tree Fresno's chief executive, Mona Cummings, said her organization was assessing the need for plantings at the elementary schools in Cantua Creek and Five Points and seeking more input from locals.

During a public meeting in Coalinga this April, Leticia Villegas, a farmworker from Five Points, told the Energy Commission that she lives three miles from where the Darden solar panels will be built. She said through a Spanish interpreter that she works in the fields during the day, when the sun is baking, and comes back to a run-down home with no air conditioning.

She said she hopes money from the development will ""go directly to our community.""

""Please,"" she added, ""we want to be listened to.""

Felipe Perez, a City Council member in nearby Firebaugh and a former fieldworker, said he used to pick crops near the Darden site. He said it was not easy seeing new industries arrive, ""using soil that we used to use for ag.""

Perez, 56, who came to the U.S. from Sinaloa, Mexico, in 1988, said there are not as many field jobs as there once were, in part because of drought and out-of-town farmers selling their land.

""The question is, are they going to hire us?"" he said of clean energy developers. ""In what language are they going to teach us? And what are we going to do when they don't help us and we still get those kinds of bills?""

Construction on the Darden project is expected to begin by the end of this year, and it should be fully operational in late 2027 or early 2028, Knowles said.

It will be built on 9,500 acres sold by the Westlands Water District, the nation's largest agricultural water district. Decades of farming and irrigation have degraded the soil, drawing salts and metals to the surface. That and the district's uncertain water supplies have made the land impractical for farming, prompting Westlands to divert water to more productive land.

The Darden project—located near a major PG&E power line that can transmit electricity north or south—will include a 1,150-megawatt solar facility with approximately 3.1 million solar panels.

It will also have up to 1,150 megawatts of battery storage via 1,440 Tesla Megapack 2XL units—essentially shipping container-sized units filled with battery modules. Such battery systems store excess energy generated during the day and release it into the power grid during times of high demand, including evening hours.

But in western Fresno County, many residents have expressed concern about the lithium-ion batteries catching fire—a fear that intensified after a massive blaze in January tore through a battery energy storage system in Moss Landing, a rural community in coastal Monterey County.

That fire, which burned more than 54,000 LG battery modules, spewed toxic smoke into the air and smoldered for several days. Firefighters let it burn, citing the dangers of dousing lithium-ion battery fires with water, which can cause dangerous chemical reactions. The risk of reignition has been so high that cleanup crews are just now beginning to remove the charred batteries.

Knowles said the Darden site will be safer because batteries will be in independent enclosures separated by open space outdoors, not stacked and placed in an enclosed building like they were in Moss Landing.

With proper engineering, lithium-ion battery storage sites pose little risk of catching fire, said Shirley Meng, a molecular engineering professor at the University of Chicago who is an expert on batteries and studies ethically sourced, recyclable materials for energy storage. Safety has improved dramatically in recent years, and the failure rate is about one in 10 million for all types of lithium-ion batteries, she said.

""Everybody has batteries in their hands,"" Meng said, referencing smartphones. ""Batteries are safe. The chemistry that's in those [large-scale] facilities is even safer than the ones that you hold in your phone.""

In western Fresno County, residents have ""been very vocal"" about the Darden project being built in a place where emergency response times are already long, said Ryan Michaels, assistant chief of operations for the Fresno County Fire Protection District, which provides emergency services for the area.

There is no fire station in the nearest communities of Cantua Creek, Five Points and Three Rocks. Response time is typically more than 20 minutes, and ""we want to make sure that as solar grows we don't reduce our current level of services within those communities,"" Michaels said.

Several large solar farms have already been built and are planned, and ""it really hit us by surprise how many were coming to western Fresno County,"" he added.

In recent months, Michaels said, firefighters have responded to numerous malfunctioning alarms and inverter fires at solar farms, he said. One recent blaze was sparked by vandals trying to steal wiring.

Intersect Power and the Fresno County Fire Protection District said they are still negotiating fire mitigation measures. A state-required emergency action plan has not yet been finalized.

Stacey Shepard, a spokesperson for the California Energy Commission, said Darden, like all such projects, must meet strict safety standards. When batteries are being shipped from the factory to the project site, they can only be charged up to 30%, and the developer has to provide at least two gates into the battery storage facility wide enough for emergency access. On site, she noted, the batteries will be surrounded by thermal detection cameras.

Even so, the fire protection district said it will need to build four new stations and hire additional staff as more large clean energy projects are built.

Michaels said Darden and other projects have to be planned for the long term. If it is going to be operating for up to 35 years, he said, ""we need to be ready to fight fire there—and provide for their workers—for decades.""

Installing solar panels is the ultimate home energy hack because it can dramatically lower your monthly bills.","Frontwave Arena in Oceanside, California, has just scored a major sustainability win. The venue — home to the San Diego Sockers and San Diego Clippers — is now powered by a nearly 800-kilowatt solar system paired with battery storage, per Renewable Energy Magazine.

The rooftop installation includes 1,350 panels that will generate more than 1.2 million kilowatt-hours of clean electricity each year, enough to avoid 825 metric tons of carbon pollution annually. That's equivalent to taking nearly 200 gas-powered cars off the road. By pairing the system with 1,146 kilowatt-hours of energy storage, the project ensures the arena has reliable, lower-cost power available even when the sun isn't shining.

""This project will allow us to not only offset a significant portion of our energy use, but also demonstrate our long-term commitment to sustainability,"" said Josh Elias, cofounder and CEO of Frontwave Arena.

The partnership between DSD Renewables and Baker Electric highlights how sports and entertainment venues can play a leading role in reducing pollution, cutting costs, and strengthening local energy independence. As Scott Williams, executive vice president at Baker Electric, noted, the project represents ""a significant step toward our shared vision for sustainable infrastructure and operations.""

Beyond the environmental benefits, projects like this help stabilize local grids, reduce reliance on dirty energy sources, and create clean energy jobs — all while saving organizations money.

For everyday people, these projects are proof that clean energy isn't just for big arenas — it's a growing option for homes and communities, too. Installing rooftop solar panels can bring energy bills down to nearly $0, while community solar programs make renewable power accessible for renters and homeowners alike.

Installing solar panels is the ultimate home energy hack because it can dramatically lower your monthly bills. EnergySage offers a free service that helps you compare vetted local installers and save up to $10,000 on installation costs. Going solar also makes it cheaper to run other money-saving appliances, like heat pumps — and Mitsubishi can help you find the right one for your home.

Katherine Lillydahl of DSD commented on the new installation to Renewable Energy Magazine: ""Making a positive impact on the communities we operate in is a core principle at DSD. With this project, we're providing long-term energy savings and improved environmental impact for a venue that will serve as a cultural hub in the region for a long time to come.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Frontwave-Arenaimage-recsqB1I88nXo3172.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 09:01:32.302847

Global force in addressing environmental and biodiversity challenges

The UAE’s legacy of conservation is rooted in the visionary leadership of its Founding Father, the late Sheikh Zayed, who initiated species reintroduction programs and banned wild bird hunting as early as the 1970s. Today, the country is a recognized global leader in nature protection and coastal marine restoration, with a commitment to restoring 100 million mangroves by 2030.

Through innovations like the Nabat AI climate-tech platform, the Jaywun marine research vessel, and the Plant Genetic Resources Center, the UAE continues to fuse ancestral knowledge with cutting-edge science to restore ecosystems and safeguard biodiversity at scale.

“Thanks to the wise vision of its leadership, the UAE continues to strengthen its position as a leading global force for developing practical, innovative solutions to environmental and biodiversity challenges. Today, the UAE is home to 49 nature reserves, encompassing approximately 15.5 percent of the country’s territory. This demonstrates its profound dedication to safeguarding ecosystems and natural habitats,” said Her Excellency Dr Amna bint Abdullah Al Dahak, Minister of Climate Change and Environment.

Al Dahak also revealed that the nation undertakes substantial efforts to conserve endangered species, both locally and globally, through pioneering reintroduction programs, alongside mangrove cultivation as a nature-based solution to address climate change and protect coastal environments. The UAE also spearheads ocean protection through impactful initiatives such as the Clean Rivers Foundation, which helps reduce river and sea pollution and preserve marine ecosystem health. These integrated efforts present an inspiring Emirati model for the world, building its capacity to confront climate change impacts and achieve a balance between development requirements and protecting natural resources for future generations.

Building a more sustainable future

“We are pleased with our distinguished relationship with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). A significant outcome was the inclusion of nine globally important biodiversity sites in the UAE last year, an achievement that truly underscores the nation’s efforts to conserve nature,” added Al Dahak.

Building on this productive relationship, the UAE’s hosting of world leaders and concerned international organizations at the IUCN World Conservation Congress in Abu Dhabi embodies its standing as a hub for collaboration for nature, she added.

“Here, political resolve converges with scientific, innovative visions to shape practical solutions to global environmental challenges. Protecting the environment, conserving nature, and fostering biodiversity is a deep-rooted approach established by our Founding Father, the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. We follow in his footsteps with a spirit of openness and effective partnerships, affirming that international cooperation and the integration of all stakeholders into a single, constructive framework is the true path to building a more sustainable future, a nature that meets the world’s needs, and empowering people to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and protect our planet’s natural resources,” she said.

A 100% solar-powered manufacturing plant for photovoltaic and EV components opened in an under-served area of southern Illinois this week, bolstered by a $4.6 million clean-energy state-incentive package.

Manner Polymers will produce all of the electricity it uses, said the company’s CEO Raj Bhargava.

“Our objective is to build the lowest cost, highest quality, most environmentally sustainable flexible PVC [polyvinyl chloride] compounding plant in the world,” Bhargava said.

The Manner Polymers manufacturing facility was bolstered by the REV Illinois incentive package, while Manner Polymers invested $54 million to support the facility’s construction.

REV Illinois provides tax credits to businesses that will support the development and growth of electric vehicles and other products essential to the renewable energy sector. Illinois provides additional benefits, through REV, for clean energy and advanced manufacturing investments made in under-served or energy transition areas.

“Manner Polymers’ plant will help maximize the manufacturing potential and accelerate the clean energy revolution that is taking place,” Governor JB Pritzker said at the facility’s ribbon cutting. “These are gains that are going to be felt by the state of Illinois in a variety of sectors.”

At the ribbon cutting, Governor Pritzker thanked Republican Senator Dale Fowler for helping to bring business to the state.

Richardson Electronics

Governor Pritzker also recently announced another REV Illinois investment, with which Richardson Electronics will invest $8.5 million to research, develop, and produce next-generation battery energy storage technologies at the company’s Illinois manufacturing facility.

As part of the state’s incentive package, Richardson Electronics was awarded an $8.6 million REV Illinois tax credit for their capital investment and commitment to job creation. In addition to targeting 54 new jobs, the REV agreement also specifies the retention of 190 jobs for the entirety of the four-year agreement period.

According to Pritzker’s office, Richardson Electronics’ decision to expand their operations within Illinois builds upon the numerous manufacturing companies that have also recently chosen to establish or expand their business in the state.

Pure Lithium

In July, Illinois awarded Pure Lithium with $4.4 million in REV incentives for investing $46 million to move from Boston to Chicago. After completing its initial start-up phase in Boston, the entire operation is relocating to Illinois and expanding to include production and manufacturing.

Pure Lithium said the move puts it closer to Argonne National Laboratory. Pure Lithium and Argonne are currently collaborating on a project to scale lithium metal anode production using recycled lithium metal, with funding from the US Department of Energy.

Pure Lithium said its investment will enable the company to manufacture the first commercially viable lithium metal battery in Illinois, with plans to target the drone and defense; consumer electronics; grid-scale energy storage systems; and EV markets while supporting the state’s clean energy economy.

After exploring options in different cities and states, Pure Lithium said it decided Illinois provides the best opportunities to achieve its goal of commercialization.

The REV Illinois incentive also supported EV manufacturer Rivian and lithium-battery manufacturer Gotion to locate to Illinois.

Ford says its new electric truck will be available in 2027.","Automotive giant Ford has big plans for smaller electric vehicle batteries, according to InsideEVs.

During a recent announcement on factory upgrades in Kentucky, Ford detailed plans to build a new electric pickup truck there that would have a battery a third smaller than competitors while maintaining similar range.

Designers claim to have removed three-quarters of the parts, two-thirds of the welds, half of the fasteners, and over 4,000 feet of wiring in the new vehicle compared to Ford's first electric SUV. It should also have more passenger room than the Toyota RAV4. Best of all, Ford is aiming for a $30,000 price point.

Ford says the key to these improvements is a new manufacturing process. While the traditional assembly line would have the whole vehicle traverse down and have parts added throughout, Ford intends to build the new EV using a ""tree"" model, whereby three large modules would be assembled separately, then brought together to create the final product.

""This could translate to more affordable EVs and a better business case for Ford, something it needs badly,"" said Tim Levin of InsideEVs. ""The company's EV division has lost some $12 billion over the last two-and-a-half years as it has invested in R&D and sold relatively few vehicles.""

Making electric vehicles more affordable is important for increasing adoption. The savings on lower up-front consumer costs to EVs would be on top of fuel savings versus gas cars, which can be up to $2,200, according to Department of Energy estimates.

Those savings can be further extended by charging a car with solar power. EnergySage can connect you to a vetted local installer who can quote a system right-sized for your home and EV.

Light-duty vehicles produce a large proportion of atmospheric pollution in America, which in turn exacerbates destructive weather patterns, such as floods and droughts. These trends have caused significant damage to farming yields and housing costs. Many of those pain points can be alleviated by getting more drivers into EVs.

Ford says its new electric truck will be available in 2027.

Despite prolonged conflict in Gaza and recent escalations in Iran, energy prices have remained remarkably stable. Even Europe, once shaken by the Ukraine war, has largely adapted, with gas supplies successfully reoriented. This resilience suggests that the global energy system has matured, capable of absorbing shocks that once would have triggered widespread disruption.

While geopolitical events have occasionally spiked oil prices – such as the surge into the $90s during Middle East tensions in 2022 and 2024 – these have proven temporary. The more enduring trend is a slowdown in demand growth, coupled with a ramp-up in supply. OPEC+, having relaxed its production cuts, is leading the charge, and forecasts suggest a supply surplus by year-end. Unless a major escalation occurs, low prices may persist for several years.

One of the more dramatic policy proposals in recent months has been the threat of imposing secondary tariffs – up to 500% – on buyers of Russian crude, particularly targeting China and India. While the proposal signals a bold geopolitical stance, its implementation would carry significant risks. Severing trade with major economies could trigger market shocks and drive oil prices sharply upward. The decision to delay action by 50 days reflects a strategic pause, likely aimed at pressuring Russia diplomatically without committing to economically disruptive measures.

Beyond supply-side dynamics, demand remains a critical factor. The initial decline in oil prices earlier this year was triggered by tariff threats and sustained by fears of their impact on global growth. Although the U.S. economy has shown resilience, global demand, especially in China, remains a concern. That said, in 2024 demand remained robust.

The Statistical Review of World Energy 2025, published by the Energy Institute in association with KPMG and Kearney, reveals a complex picture of global energy dynamics:

Global energy supply increased by 2% in 2024, driven by rising demand across all energy forms. Non-OECD countries dominated both the share and growth rates

Fossil fuels still account for 86% of the global energy mix, underscoring the slow pace of transition despite record investments in renewables

For the fourth consecutive year, fossil fuel demand and CO₂ emissions hit record highs, reflecting the structural challenges in aligning consumption with climate goals

All major energy sources—renewables and fossil fuels alike—reached record consumption levels in 2024, marking the first time this has occurred since 2006

Clean energy, often heralded as the future of the sector, faces its own set of challenges. Competition is intense, and profitability remains elusive. In China, government interventions have sought to stabilize renewable energy and electric vehicle prices, introducing the concept of ‘neijuan’ or ‘involution’—a race to the bottom where increased effort yields no additional reward. This dynamic is pushing Chinese firms to seek higher-margin markets abroad, while other nations struggle to compete in sectors where they lack industrial depth. Overcapacity among Chinese green manufacturers continue to depress global prices, complicating the economics of clean energy investment.

Macroeconomic conditions further complicate the energy landscape. High inflation and interest rates pose a serious threat to capital-intensive sectors like oil and gas. In such an environment, profitability is elusive, and new capital expenditure – especially for long-cycle projects – becomes increasingly difficult. Trends in Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) are worth monitoring closely, as under-investment could become a systemic risk. In the United States, shale producers who rely on short investment cycles are already cutting back. This year could mark the first since the COVID-19 pandemic that U.S. oil production fails to grow or even declines.

Taken together, these developments paint a complex picture of the energy sector in 2025. Geopolitical tensions remain high, but the market’s ability to absorb shocks has improved. Tariff threats, though potent, are unlikely to materialize in their most extreme forms. Demand-side weakness continues to weigh on prices, while clean energy faces structural challenges despite its long-term promise. Meanwhile, macroeconomic headwinds are reshaping investment strategies across the sector.

The energy industry stands at a crossroads where strategic clarity and adaptability will be essential. Policymakers and investors alike must navigate a landscape shaped by geopolitical maneuvering, economic uncertainty, and technological transformation. The choices made today will determine not only the trajectory of energy markets but also the broader contours of global economic stability.

How to stack the auto tax credits

Here's how combining Biden’s and Trump’s tax credits over the next four years could save you a hunk of money on an EV:

A new EV might not be the best investment

To be sure, this strategy might not be the best way to stretch your dollar. But perhaps you're set on purchasing a new EV with the latest gadgets and upgrades.

The average price paid for a new EV this year has been $57,734, according to Kelley Blue Book. Even with the $7,500 tax credit, the EV premium over a gas-powered car is about $1,500. The math tips in favor of EVs when you look at the five-year fuel costs: $9,490 for gas-powered vs. $4,295, according to Kelley Blue Book.

If you can live without the new-car smell, used EVs' average listing price this year is about $20,000 less than for new models, according to Kelley Blue Book. You can also get a $4,000 tax credit from Biden's legislation for several used EV, but that wouldn’t qualify you for the Trump tax credit.

Some additional fine print to consider if you use either of these tax credits

◾ Big Beautiful Bill: The tax credit for auto loans phases out for incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 for an individual and between $200,000 and $250,000 if you file jointly.

In July 2025, a key decision was made when the government rejected zonal pricing and pursued Reformed National Pricing, encompassing a single national wholesale electricity price enhanced with strategic improvements. This includes the rolling out of a Reformed National Pricing Package (RNNP) with a strong emphasis on:

Strategic Spatial Energy Plan (SSEP): A framework to guide where new electricity generation and storage should be built, aligning it with grid capacity and planning reforms.

Centralised Strategic Network Plan (CSNP): A 25-year roadmap for expanding transmission infrastructure in line with SSEP insights.

Reforms to network charging (TNUoS) and connection costs: Making costs more predictable and aligned with long-term planning signals for investors.

Operational improvements: Updating how electricity balancing and settlement work, such as reducing minimum plant size in the balancing market, moving to shorter settlement intervals (like 5 or 15 minutes), and better unit-level bidding.

Final REMA decisions – which will include a full cost benefit analysis (CBA) of the different wholesale market reform options – are expected to be published before the next Contracts for Difference (CfD) Allocation Round (AR7) anticipated later this year. Primary legislation aimed at facilitating the necessary changes and delivery pathways to achieve REMA’s goals will also be introduced.

This is a critical engagement window where industry, developers and system experts should participate in consultations and provide feedback to ensure reform practicality and performance.

The first SSEP is expected to be published in late 2026 where zones for generation, storage, and grid reinforcements will be prioritised in coordination with planning and investment pipelines. The SSEP will be updated every 3 years, so early feedback and practical alignment with real-world constraints is essential.

The CSNP will follow the SSEP and is expected to roll out by late 2027. This long-term plan will drive infrastructure decisions and investment priorities for the transmission network. It is expected that wider REMA reforms – including operational changes, investment signals, and consumer participation models – will continue to be phased in, likely into 2029.

Locational pricing: end of the road?

The current market, built around uniform national pricing and legacy infrastructure, has struggled to integrate high volumes of renewables efficiently – especially in constrained areas. Under the REMA pathway, the UK retains simplicity but adds coordination tools (SSEP, CSNP, and reformed charges) to mitigate inefficiencies without fully embracing regional pricing. However, if grid congestion worsens or regional imbalances grow, pressure may mount to revisit more explicit locational mechanisms.

Although the UK has opted for a RNNP, this is likely not the end of the story for locational market mechanisms. Even with zonal pricing officially ruled out, the underlying need for geographically variable signals may not have disappeared. Future developments may include:

Enhanced constraint pricing with market mechanisms that reflect local grid congestion in generator revenues, albeit within a national pricing structure

Locational investment incentives with targeted financial or regulatory support for siting generation and storage in optimal areas.

Distribution-level flexibility market with local balancing schemes that reflect regional system needs and perhaps even evolve into more granular pricing frameworks.

Differentiated network charges with more dynamic Transmission or Distribution Use of System (UoS) reforms that vary by region, offering an indirect form of locational signal.

In addition, as NESO’s Regional Energy Strategic Planning (RESP) activity develops, further opportunities for regional differentiation – or “synergisation” – may unfold. Regional conditions, priorities and spatial/location data are distinct focus areas within the Transitional RESP (tRESP), supporting the third electricity distribution price control (RIIO-ED3) process.

Navigating the path ahead

REMA signals a notable shift in how the UK thinks about power system design, prioritising strategic coordination over regional pricing complexity. For industry this is a call to action to bring engineering insight, operational realism, and consumer focus to a reform process which will define the evolution of the UK’s electricity market.

By asking critical questions, sector stakeholders can ensure these reforms deliver not only decarbonisation, but also network resilience, investment clarity and ultimately, a more efficient and affordable electricity system.

This duality underscores the company’s strategic pivot toward electrification and its ability to capitalize on India’s rapidly evolving automotive landscape. While the SUV segment—a traditional strength—faced headwinds, Mahindra’s EV momentum, coupled with broader market tailwinds, positions it as a key player in the next phase of India’s auto sector growth.

SUV Segment: A Temporary Setback Amid Structural Shifts

The 9% drop in SUV sales in August 2025, compared to 49,871 units in July 2025 [5], reflects cyclical and structural factors. CEO Nalinikanth Gollagunta attributed the dip to “seasonal inventory adjustments” and a shift in consumer focus toward festive-season purchases [2]. However, the broader SUV market remains robust, with Mahindra’s market share rising to 23% in Q3 2025 [2], driven by models like the Scorpio-N and XUV700. The decline in August appears to be a short-term correction rather than a long-term trend, as the company’s SUV sales for the year-to-date still show a 20% YoY growth [5].

EV Surge: A Strategic Bet Paying Off

Mahindra’s EV sales in August 2025—3,495 units—represent a 937% YoY increase [3], outpacing even industry leaders like Tata Motors (7,080 EVs sold, +61% YoY) [6]. This growth is fueled by the BE6 and XUV400 models, which have captured 20% of the passenger EV market in August 2025 [3], up from 5% in 2024. The company’s EV strategy, anchored on the NU IQ modular platform and a 10-lakh-unit production target by 2027 [1], is paying early dividends. By 2027, Mahindra expects 20%-30% of its SUV sales to come from electric vehicles [4], aligning with India’s national EV adoption goals.

Broader Market Tailwinds and Strategic Resilience

The Indian auto sector’s August 2025 data highlights a structural shift toward electrification. The passenger EV market grew 155% YoY to 17,298 units [3], driven by festive demand and new model launches like the MG Comet EV [6]. Mahindra’s aggressive expansion of its EV service network—adding 150-200 outlets annually [1]—positions it to capitalize on this trend. Meanwhile, its commercial vehicle segment saw a 16% YoY growth in the <7.5T LCV category [2], diversifying revenue streams and mitigating SUV-related volatility.

Strategic Moves for Long-Term Growth

Mahindra’s near-term growth hinges on its ability to balance ICE and EV production. While it plans to ramp up ICE capacity for the 3X0 and ROXX models [2], its greenfield plant and Chakan facility expansion [1] signal a long-term commitment to electrification. The company’s cautious approach to EV scaling—prioritizing quality over speed [2]—reinforces investor confidence in sustainable growth. Additionally, its wholly owned subsidiary, Mahindra Advanced Technologies Limited, diversifying into security solutions [3], adds a new revenue avenue.

Implications for Investors

For investors, Mahindra’s August performance highlights its dual strengths: resilience in traditional segments and agility in emerging ones. The SUV dip is a temporary blip in an otherwise strong year, while the EV surge demonstrates the company’s ability to adapt to regulatory and consumer shifts. With India’s EV market projected to grow at a CAGR of 30% through 2030 [6], Mahindra’s strategic investments in production capacity, service infrastructure, and platform innovation position it to outperform peers.

In conclusion, Mahindra & Mahindra’s August 2025 results reflect a company navigating near-term challenges while accelerating its transformation into an EV-first automaker. For investors, this duality—combining SUV market leadership with EV growth—offers a compelling case for long-term value creation.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-01 09:01:06.178606

To help offset environmental impacts, many manufacturers turned to carbon credits, which have come under increasing scrutiny in recent years due to a lack of transparency and debated levels of impact. As we know, carbon credits are not the silver bullet needed to solve the climate crisis, but they can have a role to play if used alongside direct carbon emission reductions.

From emissions to opportunity

For manufacturers looking to lead the charge, there’s a clear need to address the carbon intensity of core operations. That means getting creative with raw materials, supply chains and production processes. Those that take these steps will be better positioned to deliver transparent, verifiable climate performance and maintain a competitive edge.

One example of this creativity is a change in how we consider carbon, not simply as something to eliminate, but as a resource that can feed into a more sustainable manufacturing process.

By replacing virgin fossil materials with innovative recycled, bio-based and captured carbon materials, manufacturers can move towards a closed-loop system that keeps carbon out of the atmosphere, often without significantly altering manufacturing processes or increasing production costs.

As a manufacturer within the construction industry, Interface has an important role to play, with buildings and construction responsible for nearly 39% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Working to create lower-carbon materials for a variety of projects can have a significant impact across the entire built environment.

In 2024 at Interface, we abandoned the use of offsets, choosing to go ‘all in’ on solving the climate crisis by repurposing former carbon offset investments into projects that accelerate carbon reduction.

Most recently, this has seen the incorporation of captured carbon into our carpet tile manufacturing process, creating a product that performs to the same standard, at the same cost, but with a lower carbon footprint. We are demonstrating how real climate action is achievable in the manufacturing sector, while helping us achieve our own goal of becoming fully carbon-negative by 2040.

‘Good enough’ is not enough

The transformation of manufacturing to a truly sustainable industry needs more than performative gestures. The sector needs to take action to drastically reduce its impact on the climate.

The real opportunity lies in innovating how we design, source, and manufacture products from the ground up. By investing in sustainable technologies, such as using captured carbon and alternative fuel sources, manufacturers can directly reduce their footprint and contribute to long-term climate resilience.

These innovations are not only possible – they’re scalable, practical, and commercially viable.

The Massachusetts-based company, which employs about 42 people and has established itself in solar and battery storage, announced earlier this year that it has acquired two late-stage hydropower development projects from Advanced Hydro Solutions.

These acquisitions mark Agilitas Energy’s first entry into hydropower – and also its first projects in West Virginia and Maryland. The two projects are the 30MW Tygart Hydropower Project in Grafton, West Virginia, and the 14MW Jennings Randolph Hydropower Project in Garrett County, Maryland. Both facilities will deliver clean, baseload power into the PJM Interconnection, the largest regional transmission organization (RTO) in the US, serving 13 states and the District of Columbia.

Agilitas Energy expects both plants to come online in late 2028. Together, the projects’ combined capacity of 44MW will generate enough reliable electricity to power over 15,000 homes annually. The company acquired both assets at a late development stage, with the FERC licensing process already completed, allowing Agilitas Energy to focus on optimising the project execution and delivery timeline.

For Barrett Bilotta, Agilitas Energy’s President and CEO, the move into hydropower is a natural next step that builds on the company’s experience with other renewables while positioning it for long-term value creation. “We’ve always been in solar and storage, and hydro was a really interesting step for us as we think about the broader renewable energy landscape,” Bilotta said during a recent interview.

A long-term play

Bilotta explains that the company sees hydropower as uniquely aligned with its vision of building a resilient and diversified clean energy portfolio. Unlike solar and storage assets, hydropower plants can provide baseload power that isn’t subject to daily or seasonal intermittency in the same way. Hydro assets – which often operate for decades or even a century – have unique staying power in a sector where many clean energy projects are typically designed with 20- to 30-year time horizons.

“What really attracted us to hydro was its perpetual nature – these projects can operate for 100 years,” Bilotta says. “That’s a very different asset class than what we’ve typically developed in solar and storage, which might have a 20- or 25-year useful life before needing major reinvestment or repowering.”

This longevity, Bilotta notes, makes hydropower particularly well suited to long-term ownership strategies. It aligns with Agilitas Energy’s shift toward holding more assets on balance sheet for long-term value rather than flipping projects or exiting post-construction. “We really think there’s tremendous long-term value in hydropower,” he says. “It’s a more capital-intensive investment upfront, but the long-run returns – and stability – make it worthwhile.”

This long-term orientation fits well with how Agilitas Energy views the evolving US energy market. The company sees growing demand for reliable, round-the-clock power, driven in part by new loads from data centers and other large energy users, particularly in the PJM region.

“We’re seeing substantial growth in demand, particularly from data centers, and hydropower can help serve that demand in a reliable, carbon-free way,” Bilotta says. “It’s a great fit with what we’re seeing in the market.”

Why PJM, why now?

The location of these initial hydropower acquisitions is no coincidence. Agilitas Energy had already been active in PJM (Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland) through its other assets and sees the region as a place where its hydro investments can deliver strong value.

“PJM is really the largest RTO in the country, and it covers an area where there’s a lot of interest in renewables and a lot of demand for electricity,” Bilotta explains. “We’re already familiar with operating assets in PJM, so hydro is a great complement.”

The fact that both projects were already FERC-licensed and in late-stage development also played a role. “We’re not interested in taking on the full risk of greenfield hydro development,” Bilotta notes. “We were looking for projects where most of that heavy lifting had been done.”

The acquired projects allow Agilitas Energy to enter hydropower in a way that balances risk and opportunity. With regulatory approvals in hand, the focus is now on advancing toward construction and eventual operations. The two sites – one at the US Army Corps of Engineers’ Tygart Dam in West Virginia and the other at Jennings Randolph Lake on the North Branch Potomac River – represent a combined investment in reliable, long-lived renewable infrastructure.

The Tygart project, for instance, will involve installing generating facilities at a dam originally built for flood control. By adding generation capacity to existing non-powered dams (NPDs), Agilitas Energy is helping unlock untapped renewable energy potential without the need for new impoundments or major environmental disruption.

Another key factor in the decision was the availability of federal incentives, particularly through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Agilitas Energy expects to benefit from the clean energy investment tax credit (ITC) as well as the energy community adders that apply to both of the project sites.

“These are energy communities where there’s a strong desire to bring new clean energy investment,” Bilotta says. “The ITC adders make these projects even more attractive, helping to improve returns and support financing.”

For Agilitas Energy, the IRA’s support for hydropower aligns with its strategy to build a balanced portfolio of clean energy assets that can thrive under evolving federal and state policy frameworks. The additional ITC boosts for energy communities also allow the company to deliver benefits to historically coal-dependent areas now transitioning to cleaner power sources.

A foothold for further growth

Bilotta says the Tygart and Jennings Randolph acquisitions represent only the beginning of Agilitas Energy’s hydropower ambitions. “We’re absolutely looking to expand,” he says. “We’re very interested in acquiring additional hydro assets, particularly small run-of-river facilities under 10MW.”

The company is exploring opportunities in the US, with an initial focus on projects in PJM and other familiar markets. But Bilotta doesn’t rule out international possibilities either. “If the right opportunity came along that made sense for us and aligned with our goals, we’d certainly take a look at it,” he says.

Hydropower’s potential to provide reliable, low-carbon electricity over very long timeframes makes it a compelling complement to Agilitas Energy’s existing solar and storage business. And Bilotta emphasises that hydro fits squarely within the company’s mission.

“We’re focused on bringing clean, reliable energy to the grid and doing it in a way that provides long-term value,” he says. “Hydro really fits that mold.”

Building on past success

Agilitas Energy’s entry into hydropower comes on the heels of its steady growth in the solar and storage space. With a portfolio of assets across several states, the company has established itself as a reliable partner for utilities and communities seeking to decarbonise their energy supply.

Bilotta notes that the company’s expertise in developing, financing, and operating complex energy projects gives it a strong foundation for success in hydro. “At the end of the day, developing a hydro project shares a lot in common with what we’ve done in solar and storage,” he says. “It’s about managing risk, aligning with stakeholders, and delivering projects that make sense for the market.”

Agilitas Energy’s vertically integrated model – handling development, construction, operations, and asset management – allows it to control costs and maintain quality throughout the lifecycle of a project. That’s an advantage the company hopes to bring to hydropower as well.

Operational plans

While both the Tygart and Jennings Randolph projects are several years from completion, Agilitas Energy is already thinking through its operational approach. Bilotta says the company plans to bring its in-house operations and asset management capabilities to bear, while also drawing on external expertise as needed.

“We have a strong internal team for asset management, and we’ll look to build on that as we expand into hydro,” he says. “We want to make sure we’re operating these assets efficiently and responsibly from day one.”

As the projects advance toward construction, Agilitas Energy will also work closely with local communities, regulators, and stakeholders to ensure transparency and engagement throughout the process. “We’re very focused on doing things the right way – building relationships, being good stewards of the environment, and creating lasting value,” Bilotta adds.

A complementary portfolio

For Agilitas Energy, hydro’s value goes beyond the attributes of any individual project. The company sees its growing hydro portfolio as part of a broader strategy to create a balanced mix of assets that can meet the evolving needs of US power markets.

“Hydro gives us baseload power that complements the intermittent nature of solar and the flexibility of storage,” Bilotta explains. “It’s about creating a portfolio that can deliver value across different market conditions and timeframes.”

Bilotta adds that being able to offer a range of technologies makes the company more resilient to policy shifts, market changes, and other external pressures. “We think having that diversification – solar, storage, and now hydro – gives us a much stronger position long-term,” he says.

As Agilitas Energy works to bring its first hydropower projects to fruition, the company remains focused on the fundamentals that have driven its success to date: careful project selection, disciplined execution, and a commitment to long-term value.

Bilotta is optimistic about what hydropower will mean for Agilitas Energy’s future. “This is just the beginning for us in hydro,” he says. “We see a lot of opportunity, and we’re excited to continue building out this part of our business.”

With Tygart and Jennings Randolph setting the stage, Agilitas Energy’s move into hydropower reflects both a strategic evolution and a deepening commitment to the clean energy transition. As Bilotta puts it: “We’re here for the long term – and hydro is going to be a big part of that.”",https://www.waterpowermagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/09/Barrett-headshot.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 10:01:07.108893

The cargoes will be supported by existing North American offtakes and based on Delivered Ex Ship (DES) terms. The pricing index will include Henry Hub (HH), the US gas benchmark, reinforcing direct exposure to the North American gas market.

A response to expiring contracts

This new agreement comes as several long-term contracts of KOGAS reach their end. The 4.1 mtpa contract with Oman LNG expired at the end of 2024, and another 4.92 mtpa contract with QatarEnergy also concluded in 2024. Additional volumes of about 3.3 mtpa will expire in 2025 and 2026. These expirations represent more than 12 mtpa to be replaced.

To mitigate this impact, KOGAS has signed a separate contract with BP Singapore for up to 9.8 million tons over eleven years, with operations expected to start in 2026. Another contract with Woodside covers 0.5 mtpa over ten years starting in 2026. In addition, an agreement with QatarEnergy signed in 2025 secures 2.0 mtpa over twenty years.

Alignment with new US liquefaction capacity

The 2028 start date coincides with the ramp-up of new US liquefaction projects. Corpus Christi Stage 3 and Port Arthur LNG together are expected to add more than 20 million tons of export capacity by the end of the decade. Integrating KOGAS volumes into this window reduces logistical risk and strengthens execution capacity.

KOGAS already holds a long-term FOB (Free On Board) contract with a US exporter for 3.5 mtpa signed in 2012 and running until 2037. This provides commercial flexibility, while the new DES agreement ensures direct delivery into South Korea. The combination of FOB and DES strengthens portfolio resilience against market fluctuations.

Price structures and logistics

The introduction of Henry Hub in the pricing structure reduces KOGAS’s reliance on oil-linked formulas such as Brent. According to US gas price projections, HH plus a fixed premium is positioned close to Brent-indexed contracts at 11.3–11.5%. This diversification smooths exposure to global cycles and secures competitive volumes.

On the logistics side, 3.3 mtpa represents roughly 45 cargoes per year in standard 170,000 m³ LNG carriers. These flows complement those already secured from BP and Woodside, forming a bridge for the 2026–2028 period. This balanced contracting approach ensures continuity before the new US volumes begin while maintaining stability in South Korea’s LNG imports.",https://energynews.pro/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/en_1140310836540-1.webp,N,,2025-09-01 07:03:42.313211

Residential energy storage demand is surging worldwide, driven by rising energy costs, grid instability, and policies.

CHINA, September 1, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Multiple Drivers Behind Residential Energy Storage Demand

In the context of global energy transition and growing power shortages, residential energy storage is shifting from a “backup option” to an essential household necessity. Rising electricity prices, frequent extreme weather events, and consumers’ pursuit of energy independence are driving residential energy storage systems to become a core force behind market growth.

For example, during the 2024 Texas snowstorm, households equipped with residential energy storage systems were unaffected by the large-scale blackouts. This self-sufficient energy model has become a crucial solution to grid instability.

Meanwhile, government policies are accelerating adoption. Subsidies and incentive programs in Europe, the U.S., Japan, and across Asia are propelling residential storage from a niche to a mainstream market faster than ever.

Global Market: Expanding Across Regions

Europe: Germany and Italy remain the largest markets. By the end of 2024, Germany’s residential storage installations exceeded 2GW, accounting for nearly 40% of Europe, with consumers motivated by both high electricity costs and energy independence.

North America: California leads with high energy prices and frequent outages, making it one of the fastest-growing regions. In 2024 alone, California added around 500MW of residential energy storage, a year-over-year growth of more than 60%.

Emerging Markets: Brazil faces weak grid infrastructure but sees stable growth with government support. Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines have rapidly rising energy demand that storage systems help relieve. In Africa, South Africa and Kenya are also actively deploying residential solar batteries to enhance household power stability.

Technology Acceleration Driving Affordability

Since 2010, lithium battery costs have dropped by more than 80%, while cycle life has improved from a few hundred to several thousand cycles. This shift has transformed home energy storage from a high-end product into an affordable, mainstream solution, fueling global adoption.

Industry Leaders Powering the Transition

The rapid rise of residential storage would not be possible without the support of professional manufacturers. GSL ENERGY, a global leader in lithium and LiFePO4 battery manufacturing, has been deeply engaged in the energy storage sector for over a decade, completing thousands of residential and C&I energy storage projects across Europe, the Americas, Africa, and Southeast Asia.

Sign up for their newsletter here.

Companies that make solar power components in the United States are still positioned to benefit from tax policy and tariffs, despite the Trump administration’s aversion to renewable energy.

Some big manufacturers, such as First Solar and Hanwha Qcells, are expanding, while smaller players also see opportunities.

Among the new names is T1 Energy, a solar company based in Austin, Texas, which said this month that it was forming a partnership with Corning Inc. of New York to set up a supply chain in which nearly all components would be produced in this country. T1 is part of a cluster of businesses that are helping to make Texas a leader in solar manufacturing.

“No country ever wants to be totally dependent on imported energy,” said Russell Gold, an executive vice president of communications for T1 and a former journalist reporting on energy for publications including Texas Monthly and The Wall Street Journal. “When you’re talking about solar manufacturing, we’re building the oil and gas fields of the future.”

The emergence of T1, which until recently was called Freyr Battery, is part of a broader trend of many companies aiming to meet the growing demand for solar power while also navigating complex tax credits and tariffs.

President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed in July, did little to change tax credits for manufacturers, maintaining a 2030 phaseout for manufacturing tax credits. This was in contrast to the bill’s rapid phaseout of other clean energy credits.

One caveat is that the bill contains restrictions on using components that come from “prohibited foreign entities,” which is mainly aimed at stopping credits from going to China. The Trump administration has not yet released guidance on how it will interpret this part of the bill, which leaves uncertainty for projects that rely on the manufacturing credits.

On top of recent legislation, the Trump administration’s ever-changing tariffs provide additional reasons for companies to want to develop U.S.-based supply chains.

But the United States has a long way to go to become a serious competitor in solar manufacturing. China dominates global production of solar panels and the major components that they’re built with. Chinese companies have many of the latest technologies and economies of scale, making it difficult for anyone else to compete.

The world’s six largest solar panel manufacturers, ranked by gigawatts of annual production, are based in China, according to BloombergNEF. The seventh is Canadian Solar, with headquarters in Kitchener, Ontario, and the eighth is First Solar, based in Tempe, Arizona.

Setting up a supply chain doesn’t happen quickly or easily, said Antoine Vagneur-Jones, head of trade and supply chains for the research firm BloombergNEF. He anticipates that many solar companies will face technical challenges as they try to secure supplies of polysilicon and other materials.

“People are being rightly skeptical, given that this is something that’s quite new in the U.S.,” he said.

The solar supply chain has several main operations, which often take place in separate plants, starting with the processing of polysilicon to turn it into a form that can be used on solar cells. Next is the manufacturing of solar cells, which are small squares with polysilicon across their surface. A manufacturer also needs suppliers for glass, racking and electronic equipment.

The final step is assembling the parts into a finished panel, something that Vagneur-Jones likens to putting together Ikea furniture.

Vagneur-Jones thinks First Solar is well-positioned because it has decades of history producing solar panels in the United States and managing a supply chain. The company expects its U.S. factories will have the capacity to build 14 gigawatts of solar panels per year by the end of 2026. This is at three plants in Ohio, one in Alabama and one that is about to open in Louisiana.

“It’s important to recognize the fact that we’ve got some manufacturers who are planning things that can be taken relatively more seriously than others,” he said.

He also sees potential for success with Hanwha Qcells, a South Korean solar manufacturer that has operated in Dalton, Georgia, since 2019 and is working on a large expansion in the state.

Beyond the major players, he sees many smaller companies that are at earlier stages of their development, and he said it will take time to know which ones will emerge as success stories.

T1 fits into this category of newer, smaller companies that are planning to ramp up production and build U.S.-based supply chains.

Until a rebranding was announced in February, T1 was called Freyr Battery. The company, with roots in Norway, planned to open a U.S. battery plant in Georgia. Then, it scrapped the Georgia plans and said it was focusing on solar manufacturing, initially at a panel plant near Dallas, which it bought from a Chinese company.

T1 announced in March that it was building a plant in Rockdale, Texas, which is about 60 miles northeast of Austin. The plant would have the capacity to build 5 gigawatts of solar cells, which are thin squares covered with processed silicon. A typical solar panel has dozens of solar cells across its surface.

The partnership with Corning illustrates how T1 plans to build a supply chain.

T1 will use polysilicon processed at a Corning plant in Michigan, starting in the second half of 2026. The material will then be delivered to T1’s planned cell manufacturing plant in Rockdale before going to T1’s Dallas plant for final assembly as solar panels.

The partnership would support about 5,800 new jobs, according to T1 and Corning.

“This landmark supply chain agreement with Corning will help invigorate America with scalable, reliable, low-cost energy,” said Daniel Barcelo, T1’s chairman and CEO, in a statement. “This is American companies building in America and protecting American energy security. The U.S. needs to establish critical energy supply chains built on domestic capacity and industrial know-how.”

T1 is part of a growing cluster of solar manufacturing businesses in Texas.

Texas has 18 solar component facilities online, more than any other state, according to a May report from the American Clean Power Association, a trade group. If all announced projects get built across the country, Texas would still be the leader, with 26, followed by Ohio, with 16, and Alabama, with 9, the report said.

For example, Canadian Solar built a module manufacturing facility in Mesquite, Texas, that was announced in 2023 and completed last year and has 5 gigawatts of production capacity.

While renewable energy is sometimes partisan, with Trump and many Republicans criticizing it, the Canadian Solar announcement in 2023 included supportive comments from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz.

“Texas is an energy production powerhouse, and we embrace an all-of-the-above energy strategy,” Cruz said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/G1_Dallas_2_hires-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 06:00:14.759354

If the policy becomes unstable, it will fly away quickly. Giving policy confidence to markets and investors is paramount.""

Fatih Birol, secretary-general of the International Energy Agency (IEA), a world-renowned energy expert, responded to the question of ""the energy policy that the new government of Korea should focus on."" South Korea's energy policy has taken a step toward the Moon Jae In government's 'de-nuclear power plant' and the Yoon Suk Yeol government's 'de-nuclear power plant'.

Secretary-General Birol advised in a interview with Maeil Business Newspaper on the 29th of last month, ""The Korean government should pursue a balanced energy policy in the long run."" ""The biggest headache has been the shaking of energy policies and excessive politicization of energy as governments change and international disputes entangle,"" he said, as the head of the IEA for the 10th year this year. ""We expect energy to be treated as an economic problem, not politics.""

He positively evaluated the energy policy direction of the Lee Jae-myung administration, which brought up the ""energy mix"" instead of the nuclear power plant. Secretary-General Birol said, ""It is positive that the current government has expressed its willingness to promote a balanced energy mix without forgetting the importance of nuclear power, which is essential to the Korean economy,"" adding, ""We hope that not only traditional nuclear power plants but also small module reactors (SMR) will be introduced in Korea soon.""

Birol also gave great significance to recent moves to cooperate with Korea on nuclear power. This is because the U.S., which has original nuclear power plant technology, and South Korea, which has strengths in large nuclear power plant projects based on construction and operation capabilities, can meet and create synergy.

""The U.S. is leading innovation, especially in the small module reactor (SMR), which has the advantage of flexible deployment and low initial cost,"" he said. ""Korea has a more stable construction track record in terms of budget and schedule than the U.S. or Europe."" KPMG predicts that the SMR market will grow to 300 billion dollars (418 trillion won) by 2040.

In particular, Secretary-General Birol predicted that the Korea-U.S. nuclear power plant alliance will bring about a major change in the global nuclear power plant export landscape. ""Of the 52 nuclear power plants that began between 2207 and 2024, 25 were designed by China and 23 were designed by Russia,"" he said. ""Korea-U.S. cooperation can also contribute to diversifying the nuclear power market and will be a very attractive option for countries seeking to introduce new nuclear power plants such as Southeast Asia.""

Secretary-General Birol observed that Korea could find new opportunities amid the spread of artificial intelligence (AI) and the acceleration of energy transition. ""The clean energy technology manufacturing market is currently worth 700 billion dollars (975 trillion won), but it will grow to 2 trillion dollars (2,788 trillion won) over the next 10 years, which is equivalent to the global crude oil market,"" he said. ""Korea can contribute to the diversification of supply chains around the world and is in a position to enjoy economic benefits in the process.""

""South Korea is one of the few leaders in the global battery supply chain except China,"" he said. ""We will be able to fully expand our leadership to key power grid equipment such as transformers and cables.""

Secretary-General Birol predicted that stable power supply and flexible power grid systems are essential for Korea to take the lead in the global AI competition. From this point of view, he gave a positive evaluation to the 'energy highway' promoted by the Lee Jae-myung government.

Secretary-General Birol said, ""What I felt in common with leaders from around the world, including Europe, the United States, Africa, and Latin America, was the lack of transmission networks around the world. It is a great decision for the Korean government to accurately diagnose this problem and expand the transmission network to smoothly supply all electricity, including renewable energy, to consumers.""

""It is difficult to choose a country that has enough power generation and transmission networks at the same time,"" he said. ""I hope that the energy highway will be realized as soon as possible and Korea will become a role model.""

The Interior Department’s recent order is ​“entirely designed to make these [renewable] resources they don’t like look bad,” Pierpont said.","In addition to denying that climate change requires a shift away from fossil fuels, Goreham told people at the Knox County meeting that solar farms require much more land than nuclear, gas, and coal-fired power plants. He also focused on ​“power density” in a 2023 opinion piece for the conservative-leaning Western Journal, warning that ​“environmental devastation” will result from policies that aim to accomplish net-zero carbon emissions. Goreham repeated this land-use argument in a Real Clear Energy post in March.

“Everybody needs to come to this debate with a full picture of who they’re talking to and why they’re saying what they’re saying,” said Ray Locker, executive director for the Checks and Balances Project. Companies in the fossil-fuel industry ​“have a vested interest in preserving their business,” so when they present renewable energy ​“as somehow dirty, then that furthers their interest.”

“An absurd metric”

Burgum’s order to the Department of the Interior is ​“really implementing an ideological agenda,” said Brendan Pierpont, director of electricity modeling at think tank Energy Innovation. In his view, the mandate’s definition of capacity density is an ​“absurd metric,” with multiple flaws.

Among other things, the capacity-density measurement does not capture the full picture of what it takes to produce electricity from a fossil-fueled or nuclear power plant.

The metric focuses only on the step where electricity is generated. A full life-cycle analysis would consider all stages for producing equipment, obtaining and transporting fuel, and dealing with waste. The Interior Department’s recent order is ​“entirely designed to make these [renewable] resources they don’t like look bad,” Pierpont said.

The definition of capacity density also fails to account for the fact that renewable projects can coexist with other activities, such as livestock grazing or farming certain crops, noted Matthias Fripp, global policy research director at Energy Innovation.

Anderson at the Energy and Policy Institute called the rationale for the Interior Department’s order ​“a red-herring argument to focus on just one of the impacts of different energy sources.”

Nowhere does the order address environmental and health concerns about mining for coal or uranium, drilling for oil and gas, or transporting and burning those fuels.

It will be built alongside the electric Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq SUVs, as well as the petrol Cadillac XT5.
Meanwhile, the Factory Zero site in Detroit-Hamtramck (also Michigan) will remain GM’s dedicated EV plant, continuing to exclusively assemble the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, Cadillac Escalade IQ and GMC Hummer EV (pickup and SUV) – albeit with the temporary production cuts outlined above.","According to the Detroit Free Press, the slowdown is scheduled between 2 September and 6 October. During this period, production of the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ will pause on both the first and second shifts. Around 160 of the roughly 4,000 plant workers will be affected. Both vehicles rank among the largest and most expensive electric models in GM’s portfolio.

A GM spokesperson told the paper that the temporary measure would help align output with demand: “Factory Zero is making temporary adjustments to production to align to market dynamics,” the spokesperson said.

The production pause follows a similar move GM announced in April at the same Detroit facility. At that time, the carmaker opted for a temporary reduction in its workforce. 200 employees were laid off as GM reported declining sales of the GMC Hummer EV (both pickup and SUV), GMC Sierra EV, Chevrolet Silverado EV, and Cadillac Escalade IQ. Notably, demand has only cooled for these larger models. By contrast, GM’s new entry-level EVs, such as the Chevrolet Equinox EV and Blazer EV, are seeing strong sales growth.

Against this backdrop, GM presented a more differentiated product strategy in early summer. In terms of powertrain mix, the company is once again leaning more heavily towards petrol. At the same time, GM announced plans for another “affordable next-generation EV” at its Kansas facility.

Overall, GM intends to invest around four billion US dollars over the next two years to expand production at its US plants. Three factories in Michigan, Kansas and Tennessee will benefit most, to assemble “over two million vehicles annually in the US.” GM has not specified how that volume will be distributed across powertrains. In June, however, the company outlined the following production plans:

The Orion Assembly plant in Michigan will begin building petrol SUVs and light pickups in early 2027. Originally, GM had planned to start producing electric pickups there in 2026.

Fairfax Assembly in Kansas will add production of the recently launched petrol Chevrolet Equinox from mid-2027, a model currently only built in Mexico. By the end of this year, Fairfax will also start producing the Chevrolet Bolt EV. Part of GM’s announced investments will go into preparing the site for affordable next-generation EVs.

At Spring Hill Manufacturing in Tennessee, GM will begin producing the petrol-powered Chevy Blazer from 2027, a model that is also currently assembled in Mexico. It will be built alongside the electric Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq SUVs, as well as the petrol Cadillac XT5.

The focus on new combustion models fits with GM’s recent announcement to invest 888 million US dollars in its Tonawanda Propulsion plant near Buffalo, New York, to build its next-generation V8 engine. Meanwhile, the Factory Zero site in Detroit-Hamtramck (also Michigan) will remain GM’s dedicated EV plant, continuing to exclusively assemble the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, Cadillac Escalade IQ and GMC Hummer EV (pickup and SUV) – albeit with the temporary production cuts outlined above.

GM currently reports overall sales growth in the US for both petrol and electric vehicles. The company also stresses that, in the second half of 2024, it became the country’s second-largest EV seller behind Tesla, thanks to the 13 all-electric models now available across its brands.

One of the UK’s largest long-duration battery storage systems, 1GW / 8GWh, in phases.

First UK project to combine grid-scale battery storage with maritime electrification infrastructure.

1GW National Grid connection to deliver reliable, affordable renewable energy for industry and ports.

NatPower is set to create around 200 construction-phase jobs and ongoing skilled roles, as well as commit up to £2 million annually to a community benefit fund.

Planned operational date: NatPower aims to connect the GigaPark to the National Grid by 2028, with infrastructure designed from the outset to power ships at berth (cold ironing) and recharge electric propulsion systems for future vessel types.

Supports UK industrial resilience, reduces clean energy curtailment (worth up to £3.5bn/year), and anchors Teesside as a national clean energy hub.

As the UK faces grid bottlenecks, £3.5bn a year in wasted clean energy due to curtailment, and rising industrial energy costs, NatPower’s £1bn Teesside GigaPark will deliver one of the UK’s most advanced battery storage facilities (BESS), power industry and ports, enable marine electrification and create 200 construction jobs, long-term skilled employment, and invest £2m annually into the local community.

NatPower UK has secured an agreement with Sembcorp Utilities (UK) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sembcorp Energy UK, for a 32-acre site at Wilton International in Redcar to deliver a 1GW / 8GWh lithium-ion Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), one of the UK’s highest-capacity and longest-duration projects and the first to combine utility-scale grid storage with dedicated port electrification infrastructure.

Fully privately financed and representing a £1bn investment, the Teesside GigaPark will operate at four hours’ storage capacity (4GWh) initially, with potential to double to eight hours (8GWh). This level of duration and capacity combined has not been delivered before in the UK, where most BESS developments operate at one to two hours.

Energy Minister Michael Shanks said: “Energy storage is a pillar of a clean power system – helping to protect homes and businesses from future energy price shocks by stocking up on homegrown renewable energy at times of high generation to release it when needed, instead of relying on fossil fuels.”It is projects like this that will help us to decarbonise our industries – as clean energy will be used to charge ships in one of Europe’s biggest ports, helping to cut emissions, create skilled jobs and boost local investment.”

Stefano D.M. Sommadossi, CEO of NatPower UK and NatPower Marine, said: “Teesside, our most advanced GigaPark, located at Wilton International, will be the blueprint for how we combine high-capacity renewable energy storage with the electrification of ports and industry. Within five years, we can transform one of the UK’s most important industrial hubs into a net-zero economic powerhouse and then replicate this model in ports across the globe.”

Connecting clean generation to increasing demand

The project holds a 1GW connection agreement with the National Energy System Operator for a 400kV connection to National Grid’s substation. NatPower will build and operate the site, with the aim of connecting it to the grid by 2028. The infrastructure is being designed from the outset to power ships at berth (cold ironing) and recharge electric propulsion systems for future vessel types.

The Teesside GigaPark’s BESS will be one of the most advanced in the UK, designed to keep the grid balanced as the nation transitions to clean energy. With electricity demand forecast to rise by 50% by 2050 and an extra 15% expected from shipping electrification, the UK grid faces unprecedented pressure. The multi-gigawatt system will store surplus renewable electricity from offshore wind and other generators when production is high, then release it instantly during periods of peak demand or low generation. This capability will help cut the curtailment of renewable energy. Nationally, the widespread deployment of large-scale, long-duration storage could save the UK energy system up to £3.5 billion a year, according to Imperial College London[1]. By replacing the need for fossil-fuel peaker plants, the GigaPark will also stabilise the grid, lower emissions and make key UK sectors, including steel, chemicals, advanced manufacturing and other energy-intensive industries, more resilient and competitive.

Zeroing maritime emissions

This same clean, flexible power will now enable the potential for decarbonising UK shipping at Teesside. Once operational, the BESS infrastructure will make it possible to provide shore power to ships for cold ironing at berth, eliminating emissions while docked, at anchor, and for electric propulsion while operating near-shore. This capability will position Teesside as a prospective leader in marine electrification and aligns with the UK’s maritime climate targets.

Mike Patrick, CEO of Sembcorp Energy UK, said: “We are pleased to support NatPower to bring one of the UK’s most advanced battery energy storage projects to Wilton International. With its robust grid infrastructure, Wilton International offers the ideal platform for scaling long-duration battery storage and supporting maritime electrification. This project further strengthens Wilton International’s role as a strategic site for low-carbon innovation, driving the UK’s journey towards a net-zero future.”

Creating sustainable communities

NatPower’s investment will anchor Teesside as a national clean energy hub within the UK’s Freeport network. It will deliver high-quality jobs, including around 200 during construction and permanent skilled roles in operations and maintenance. NatPower is in advanced talks with local colleges and environmental organisations to launch clean energy and engineering training, while local manufacturers, engineering firms, and logistics operators will be able to benefit from new supply chain opportunities. Potential partnerships with universities are also being explored in areas such as smart grid integration, offshore wind maintenance, and marine decarbonisation. NatPower UK will also make a substantial contribution each year to the local community once operational, in a community benefit fund operated by Evogea, a dedicated foundation.

The scale and reliability of the GigaPark will also appeal to energy-intensive users such as data centres, logistics hubs, and clean manufacturing facilities. NatPower is already in discussions with potential industrial off-takers, with draft commercial agreements in progress.

NatPower’s Teesside GigaPark is more than an infrastructure project; it is a catalyst for the UK’s clean industrial future. By combining high-capacity energy storage with next-generation port electrification, it will cut emissions, lower costs and secure reliable power for the industries that keep Britain moving. With construction on track and partnerships forming across the region, NatPower UK is ready to work with government, business and communities to make Teesside the blueprint for a net-zero economy at home and a model for ports worldwide.",https://cyprusshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/New-Project-60.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 07:03:10.617761

Nevertheless, the EPA continued to retain and expand GHG emission standards for new motor vehicles and engines that impose billions of dollars in compliance costs on American businesses and consumers.
If finalised, this action would rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding for GHGs emitted by new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines under CAA Section 202(a) (74 FR 66496).
The denials reflect many of the same legal and scientific flaws the EPA propose to correct by rescinding the Endangerment Finding.
In connection with the proposed rescission of the Endangerment Finding, this action would remove all existing regulations that require new motor vehicle and new motor vehicle engine manufacturers to measure, report, or comply with GHG emission standards.","On August 1, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published in the Federal Register (Vol. 90 No. 146) a Proposal to repeal all greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards for light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines to enforce the latest reading of Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 202(a); 40 CFR Parts 85, 86, 600, 1036, 1037, and 1039. The EPA proposes that CAA Section 202(a) does not authorise the EPA to prescribe emission standards to address global climate change concerns and proposes to rescind the Administrator's prior findings in 2009 that GHG emissions from new motor vehicles and engines contribute to air pollution which may endanger public health or welfare. The EPA further proposes to rescind the Administrator's prior findings in 2009 because the EPA unreasonably analysed the scientific record and because developments cast significant doubt on the reliability of the findings. EPA proposes to repeal all GHG emission standards on the basis that no requisite technology for vehicle and engine emission control can address the global climate change concerns identified in the findings without risking greater harms to public health and welfare.

In 2009, the EPA took the unprecedented step of asserting authority to regulate GHG emissions in a standalone action titled ‘Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Finding for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act,’ 74 FR 66496 (Dec. 15, 2009) (Endangerment Finding). The EPA subsequently relied on the Endangerment Finding to impose increasingly stringent GHG emission standards for new motor vehicles and engines and to attempt, largely without success, to extend its GHG initiative into additional CAA programs.

In Utility Air Regulatory Group (UARG), v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302 (2014) the Supreme Court rejected EPA’s attempt to extend GHG emission standards to stationary sources subject to Title I and Title V requirements, including after the EPA admitted that applying the statutory scheme as written to GHG emissions from most covered stationary sources would be unworkable. And in West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697 (2022), the Court vacated EPA’s attempt to shift the power grid away from using fossil fuels through GHG standards for existing power plants under CAA Section 111(d). The Court held in both cases that the EPA actions at issue implicated the major questions doctrine, and that Congress must clearly authorise agencies to take actions that decide major questions of policy. Nevertheless, the EPA continued to retain and expand GHG emission standards for new motor vehicles and engines that impose billions of dollars in compliance costs on American businesses and consumers. Meanwhile, global GHG concentrations in the upper atmosphere have continued to rise, driven primarily by increased emissions from foreign sources, all without producing the degree of adverse impacts to public health and welfare in the United States that the EPA anticipated in the 2009 Endangerment Finding.

The Administrator's review of the relevant information, including scientific literature, gave rise to serious concerns that the EPA actions taken to regulate GHG emissions from new motor vehicles and engines exceed our statutory authority under CAA Section 202(a) and are otherwise inappropriate. Continuing to impose billions of dollars in regulatory costs on American businesses and consumers without an adequate legal basis would threaten to undermine public confidence in EPA activities and commitment to fulfilling the Agency's core mission: protecting human health and the environment. The EPA has expended significant resources implementing the GHG regulatory program for mobile sources and attempting to expand its GHG regulatory program to stationary sources with limited success in the courts and no apparent real-world results, often at the expense of programs that fall squarely within our statutory authority. Prompt action is needed to address these concerns with the benefit of public participation.

The EPA now proposes to rescind the Endangerment Finding and all resulting GHG emission standards for new motor vehicles and engines, including the light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty vehicle and engine standards for Model Years (MY) 2012 to 2027 and beyond.

If finalised, this action would rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding for GHGs emitted by new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines under CAA Section 202(a) (74 FR 66496). This Proposal would also rescind denials of Petitions for Reconsideration of the Endangerment Finding in 2022 and 2010 entitled ‘Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act; Final Action on Petitions,’ 87 FR 25412 (Apr. 29, 2022), and 'EPA's Denial of the Petitions to Reconsider the Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Finding for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act,' 75 FR 49556 (Aug. 13, 2010). Although the 2022 and 2010 petition denials have no prospective legal effect, it is proposed to rescind them for the sake of consistency and to lessen potential confusion regarding the EPA's proposed action. The denials reflect many of the same legal and scientific flaws the EPA propose to correct by rescinding the Endangerment Finding. The EPA seeks comment on the impact of the denials, if any, and on whether the denials were legally flawed for additional reasons not explicitly explored in this Proposal. In addition, as a result of these proposed changes, the EPA would no longer have a basis for issuing or retaining GHG emission standards for new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines, including for MYs that have completed manufacture but are subject to ongoing obligations. As discussed elsewhere in the preamble, the EPA is reconsidering additional endangerment findings and GHG emission standards issued under distinct provisions of the CAA in separate rulemakings and is not reopening or proposing to modify those additional findings and standards in this proceeding.

In connection with the proposed rescission of the Endangerment Finding, this action would remove all existing regulations that require new motor vehicle and new motor vehicle engine manufacturers to measure, report, or comply with GHG emission standards. Specifically, the EPA proposes to remove regulations in 40 CFR Parts 85, 86, 600, 1036, and 1037 pertaining to the control of GHG emissions from light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines, including emission standards, test procedures, averaging, banking, and trading requirements (ABT), reporting requirements, and fleet-average emission requirements. As a result of these proposed changes, motor vehicle and engine manufacturers would no longer have future or current obligations for the measurement, control, or reporting of GHG emissions for any vehicle or engine, including for previously manufactured MYs. However, the EPA are not proposing to reopen or modify any regulations necessary for criteria pollutant and air toxic measurement and standards, Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) testing, and associated fuel economy labeling requirements. The EPA seeks comment on whether any elements of the regulations, test procedures, or GHG emission models that are proposed for removal should remain to support programs unrelated to the GHG emission standards and why the preservation of such an element is necessary to support the unrelated program or programs.

The EPA requests public comments on this Proposal (some sections specifically identified) to ensure that the all aspects of these actions are considered and are based on accurate, current data and technology. Comments must be received on or before September 15, 2025. Comments on the information collection provisions submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) are best assured of consideration by OMB if OMB receives a copy of your comments on or before September 2, 2025.",https://www.interregs.com/assets/storage/spotlight-archive/320.jpeg,N,,2025-09-01 11:04:29.030281

Among other things, the capacity-density measurement does not capture the full picture of what it takes to produce electricity from a fossil-fueled or nuclear power plant.
A full life-cycle analysis would consider all stages for producing equipment, obtaining and transporting fuel, and dealing with waste.
The Interior Department’s recent order is ​“entirely designed to make these [renewable] resources they don’t like look bad,” Pierpont said.","In addition to denying that climate change requires a shift away from fossil fuels, Goreham told people at the Knox County meeting that solar farms require much more land than nuclear, gas, and coal-fired power plants. He also focused on ​“power density” in a 2023 opinion piece for the conservative-leaning Western Journal, warning that ​“environmental devastation” will result from policies that aim to accomplish net-zero carbon emissions. Goreham repeated this land-use argument in a Real Clear Energy post in March.

“Everybody needs to come to this debate with a full picture of who they’re talking to and why they’re saying what they’re saying,” said Ray Locker, executive director for the Checks and Balances Project. Companies in the fossil-fuel industry ​“have a vested interest in preserving their business,” so when they present renewable energy ​“as somehow dirty, then that furthers their interest.”

“An absurd metric”

Burgum’s order to the Department of the Interior is ​“really implementing an ideological agenda,” said Brendan Pierpont, director of electricity modeling at think tank Energy Innovation. In his view, the mandate’s definition of capacity density is an ​“absurd metric,” with multiple flaws.

Among other things, the capacity-density measurement does not capture the full picture of what it takes to produce electricity from a fossil-fueled or nuclear power plant.

The metric focuses only on the step where electricity is generated. A full life-cycle analysis would consider all stages for producing equipment, obtaining and transporting fuel, and dealing with waste. The Interior Department’s recent order is ​“entirely designed to make these [renewable] resources they don’t like look bad,” Pierpont said.

The definition of capacity density also fails to account for the fact that renewable projects can coexist with other activities, such as livestock grazing or farming certain crops, noted Matthias Fripp, global policy research director at Energy Innovation.

Anderson at the Energy and Policy Institute called the rationale for the Interior Department’s order ​“a red-herring argument to focus on just one of the impacts of different energy sources.”

Nowhere does the order address environmental and health concerns about mining for coal or uranium, drilling for oil and gas, or transporting and burning those fuels.

Factory Zero produces the Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ

According to a memo obtained by the Detroit Free Press, GM confirmed that production of the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ would be put on hold during this adjustment period.

In addition, a second-shift layoff that was already in place has now been extended until October 6.

Factory Zero, which employs about 4,000 people overall, will keep a significant portion of its workforce idle while the automaker reassesses market conditions and inventory levels.

“Factory Zero is making temporary adjustments to production to align to market dynamics,” GM spokesman Kevin Kelly said in an emailed statement.

He emphasized that the company routinely updates production schedules to ensure vehicle output matches demand.

The pause may seem sudden, but it follows a similar move earlier this year, when GM announced on April 10 that it was cutting approximately 200 jobs at the same plant.

A similar reason was given: slowing demand for its flagship EVs, including the Hummer EV pickup and SUV, Sierra EV, Silverado EV, and Escalade IQ.

This latest adjustment impacts an additional 160 employees, bringing the total number of affected workers this year to over 360.

Those employees will be placed on temporary layoff status and may qualify for unemployment pay and benefits under the GM-UAW national contract.

Demand for EVs has been volatile

Factory Zero is central to GM’s electric vehicle ambitions.

The facility was retooled as part of the automaker’s massive EV push and is responsible for some of the company’s most high-profile electric models.

However, demand for large, luxury EVs like the Hummer EV and Escalade IQ has proven volatile, as consumers weigh high prices and charging infrastructure concerns.

By halting production temporarily, GM aims to avoid oversupplying dealers with vehicles that could sit unsold on lots.

The company insists this is a routine adjustment, not a sign of retreat from its EV goals.

After all, the company’s engineers continue to make breakthroughs in EV technology, like how they managed to get a record-breaking 1,059 miles out of the Silverado EV from a single charge.

However, GM’s ‘green’ EV plant, the Orion Assembly plant in Michigan, recently started making gas-powered trucks and SUVs, hinting that the company may be forced to pause its EV dreams for the time being.

In any case, let’s hope GM doesn’t give up permanently on EVs.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) confirmed authorization for the Rio Grande LNG project developed by NextDecade, while the Department of Energy (DOE) granted Commonwealth LNG a license to export to non-free trade agreement countries, valid through 2050. These approvals provide a full regulatory framework as the developers approach critical deadlines for their Final Investment Decisions (FIDs).

Rio Grande LNG: validated expansion and tight timeline

Rio Grande LNG, located in Brownsville, Texas, already has a first phase of 17.5 million tons per year under construction. The project aims for a total capacity of about 27 million tons per year with two additional trains. Bechtel, in charge of engineering and construction, has set a price validity deadline of September 15, 2025, placing NextDecade under time pressure for its FID. The project will be supplied by the Rio Bravo pipeline, operated by Enbridge, designed to transport up to 4.5 billion cubic feet per day from Agua Dulce.

On the commercial side, Train 4 is fully covered with 4.6 million tons per year of contracts split between Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), Saudi Aramco, and TotalEnergies. Train 5 has begun commercialization with a firm 2.0 million tons per year agreement signed with JERA Co., Inc. These long-term commitments, together with equity contributions, strengthen the bankability of the expansion.

Commonwealth LNG: DOE authorization and strategic contracts

Commonwealth LNG, based in Louisiana, has secured its final DOE export authorization to non-free trade agreement countries. The project targets 9.5 million tons per year of capacity with six modular SnapLNG trains designed by Technip Energies. First LNG delivery is expected in 2029, subject to an investment decision in 2025.

The company has secured about 4 million tons per year in long-term agreements: 1 million with JERA, 1 million with Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS), and 2 million with Glencore International AG. Glencore has also entered into a gas supply agreement with Kimmeridge’s upstream unit based on international netback pricing, aligning feedstock costs with export sales. The developer has also requested approval for preliminary site work to accelerate execution after FID.

Market context and U.S. FID wave

These advances come as several U.S. projects have already reached final investment decisions this year, including Venture Global’s CP2 LNG Phase 1 (14.4 million tons per year), Cheniere’s Corpus Christi expansion (5 million tons per year), and Woodside’s Louisiana LNG project (16.5 million tons per year). These milestones highlight the trajectory of the United States toward a new large-scale liquefaction wave.

Spot reference prices remain favorable: around $10.7 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) in Europe and about $11.2/MMBtu for the Japan Korea Marker (JKM) in Asia at the end of August.

ACEN Australia managing director David Pollington described the approval as a “key achievement” for the company and the Tasmanian economy.
The transmission line required to connect the wind project to the grid is undergoing a separate approvals process, which is expected to conclude in 2026.
The Robbins Island project will assist both state and federal governments in achieving their legislated emissions targets, including Tasmania’s objective to double clean energy production by 2040.
The project will generate 30% more power than the average Australian wind project of similar size.","ACEN Australia has received federal government approval for its 900MW Robbins Island wind project in the state of Tasmania.

The A$3bn ($1.96bn) project will generate sufficient power for 500,000 homes and create 400 construction jobs.

It will contribute A$30m annually to the Tasmanian economy, alongside a community benefits programme worth A$27m for the Circular Head region.

ACEN Australia managing director David Pollington described the approval as a “key achievement” for the company and the Tasmanian economy.

The approval follows an eight-year assessment process involving detailed studies of Robbins Island’s natural environment.

The project aims to provide jobs, training and long-term benefits to the community while offering low-cost baseload generation supported by hydroelectric power.

This arrangement allows hydro to function as flexible on-demand generation and storage, rather than traditional baseload generation.

The transmission line required to connect the wind project to the grid is undergoing a separate approvals process, which is expected to conclude in 2026.

This timeline positions the project to begin generating power by 2030.

The Robbins Island project will assist both state and federal governments in achieving their legislated emissions targets, including Tasmania’s objective to double clean energy production by 2040.

The project will generate 30% more power than the average Australian wind project of similar size.

Pollington stated: “The decision shows that large, complex projects can be delivered responsibly, balancing overall impacts and conserving biodiversity, with the need for clean energy to address climate change.

“It comes at a time when Australia faces a stalling energy transition and looming power shortages as coal exits the system.

“It also reflects the depth and rigour of ACEN’s work to address the assessment criteria and scrutiny applied through the approvals process.”

ACEN will now focus on navigating the detailed approval conditions to assess their impact on project design and ongoing environmental monitoring, while preparing for the transmission proposal assessment in 2026.

Pollington added: “The project supports Australia’s climate commitments, providing a lowest-cost clean alternative to fossil fuels in time to meet supply shortages.

“This is particularly important for Victoria, which will lose half of its coal generation by 2035, making investment in Marinus Link and the North West Transmission Developments a smart and timely move.”",https://www.power-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/09/P1-shutterstock_2497642983.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 07:03:23.985097

The UAE’s legacy of conservation is rooted in the visionary leadership of its Founding Father, the late Sheikh Zayed, who initiated species reintroduction programmes and banned wild bird hunting as early as the 1970s. Today, the country is a recognised global leader in nature protection and coastal marine restoration, with a commitment to restoring 100 million mangroves by 2030. Through innovations like the Nabat AI climate-tech platform, the Jaywun marine research vessel, and the Plant Genetic Resources Centre, the UAE continues to fuse ancestral knowledge with cutting-edge science to restore ecosystems and safeguard biodiversity at scale.

Her Excellency Dr Amna bint Abdullah Al Dahak, Minister of Climate Change and Environment, said: ""Thanks to the wise vision of its leadership, the UAE continues to strengthen its position as a leading global force for developing practical, innovative solutions to environmental and biodiversity challenges. Today, the UAE is home to 49 nature reserves, encompassing approximately 15.5 per cent of the country's territory. This demonstrates its profound dedication to safeguarding ecosystems and natural habitats. The nation also undertakes substantial efforts to conserve endangered species, both locally and globally, through pioneering reintroduction programmes, alongside mangrove cultivation as a nature-based solution to address climate change and protect coastal environments. The UAE spearheads ocean protection through impactful initiatives such as the Clean Rivers Foundation, which helps reduce river and sea pollution and preserve marine ecosystem health. These integrated efforts present an inspiring Emirati model for the world, building our capacity to confront climate change impacts and achieve a balance between development requirements and protecting our natural resources for future generations.

""We are pleased with our distinguished relationship with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). A significant outcome was the inclusion of nine globally important biodiversity sites in the UAE last year, an achievement that truly underscores the nation's efforts to conserve nature. Building on this productive relationship, the UAE's hosting of world leaders and concerned international organisations at the IUCN World Conservation Congress in Abu Dhabi embodies its standing as a hub for collaboration for nature. Here, political resolve converges with scientific, innovative visions to shape practical solutions to global environmental challenges.

There are practical measures to improve air quality that can be an integral part of development projects.
This blog post was developed based on the Air Quality Toolkit for Development Finance Institutions, which was conceptualized by the World Economic Forum’s Global Future Council on Clean Air and developed by the consulting firm Ricardo and Clean Air Asia with support from the Clean Air Fund, Asian Development Bank, and other partners.","Despite efforts to reduce air pollution, recent analysis shows that measures to reduce air pollution account for only about 1% of development aid, while the overall cost of air pollution on health and well-being is estimated at over $8 trillion.

When considering that countries with lower incomes have less domestic finances to address air quality than developed countries, the poor and vulnerable across the planet are disproportionately suffering from its worst effects.

While measures to address this silent killer are lagging, its harmful impacts are not. Poor air quality is now the second leading cause of premature death worldwide, estimated at 8.1 million a year, behind cardiovascular disease.

In many places, it is getting worse. Around 99% of the global population is living in areas that exceed the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines.

Air pollution has detrimental effects which resonate far beyond personal health. It stifles economic growth, including increased burdens on healthcare systems, reduced productivity, lost working days and reduced tourism and investment opportunities. This translates into economic losses of nearly 5% of the global gross domestic product.

In Asia and the Pacific, an estimated 92% of people are exposed to air pollution levels that endanger their health, and the region is home to some of the most polluted cities in the world. Air pollution is linked to nearly one in four deaths of children under five in East Asia and the Pacific.

This is alarming but on a positive note, there are practical measures to improve air quality that can be an integral part of development projects.

It is estimated that every $1 spent on air pollution control returns an estimated $30 in economic benefits. While there is no one-size-fits-all model in tackling air pollution, we can identify various areas where shared co-benefits can make a big difference.

To address the air pollution challenge, we need to take a holistic approach which incorporates integrated solutions across different sectors. It requires reduction in the overall activity that generates emissions (e.g. reducing energy consumption), and reduction in the emissions intensity of that activity (e.g. fuel switching to cleaner technology) or a combination of both.

There are practical measures to improve air quality that can be an integral part of development projects.

Here are some examples of how a few key actions taken in development projects can help countries move the needle for clearer blue skies.

Provide better transport options. Designing projects that reduce the number of vehicles on the street and coming up with more efficient ways to move people and cargo and reducing congestion, will reduce air pollutants. Measures to improve public transport, particularly powered by renewable energy, with low emission zones is one of the effective ways to reduce vehicle emissions.

An Indonesian state-owned bus operator in Jakarta is replacing its fleet with battery-powered electric buses. This helps to conserve energy, improve air quality, and reduce emissions. While buses in Jakarta make up only 0.1% of all vehicles in the capital, they are responsible for 20% to 30% of local pollutants.

Increase renewable power generation. Projects that support transition from fossil-fueled energy generation and switching to renewable energy sources (such as wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, and green hydrogen) substantially reduce air pollutants. The reduction of fossil fuels and enhancing energy efficiency in industrial processes are particularly important to reduce both air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions.

Bangladesh’s current measures to encourage businesses to invest in renewables to power its textile industry, a key generator of national export earnings and jobs, will also help address severe air pollution in the country, which is recognized as a key national challenge.

Better manage agricultural crop residues. The large farming sectors of Asia and the Pacific generate massive crop residues, the materials left behind after harvest. Burning off this agricultural residue increases emissions, health risks, and fire hazards. The efficient reduction or removal of crop residue or transforming it in products that provide economic opportunities for farmers, can be integrated into the design of development projects to improve air quality. Projects that reduce the need for fertilizers and increase efficiency in agricultural processes will also help to improve air quality.

India, where numerous locations are stifled with seasonal swathes of smoke from burning off, is supporting construction of biomass plants which use agricultural residue as feedstock. This is designed to provide power in a way that reduces the chance of smoky skies.

Improve solid waste management. Projects that concentrate on the development of waste collection, recycling, recovery, and advanced disposal systems can help improve air quality in urban areas. The effective management of waste reduces the need to burn it. This also comes with many other health benefits, as open landfills contribute to the contamination of drinking water, infection, and the transmission of diseases.

Provide incentives for improved energy efficiency in households. This could include reducing the overall energy needs for home activities such as cooking, heating, or cooling by retrofitting or upgrading household devices with cleaner technologies.

Moving away from burning coal, still prevalent in some parts of the world, will greatly reduce health risks, while the insulation of buildings to reduce heating or cooling requirements will also help. To engage local communities to reduce air pollution, it is essential to explore long-term and sustainable incentives to enable the shift such as subsidies for energy-efficient appliances and tax breaks for businesses adopting energy-saving technologies.

These measures are just a handful of examples showing how it is possible to tackle the scourge of air pollution while helping countries and communities chart paths to healthier air.

India Energy Storage Alliance (IESA) president Debmalya Sen wrote about the different types of tenders, including hybrid renewable energy and standalone energy storage, and the various ways tariffs are awarded and developers remunerated, in a Guest Blog for this site in May.
The different designs, such as Round the Clock (RTC), peak-specific, load-following and firm, dispatchable renewable energy (FDRE), are all aimed at answering the needs of grid operators, utilities and energy users with requirements on timings and duration of dispatch.
As of the end of the first half of this year, tenders for a cumulative 171GWh of energy storage capacity had been held in India since the first was launched in 2018.","The IPP did not offer details of the solicitation or process through which it was awarded the contract, but claimed that it is the first of its kind for India in that it will be billed based on a fixed tariff, paid in Indian Rupees per kilowatt-hour of discharged energy, rather than the more common fixed monthly rates.

The build, own and operate (BOO) contract is also Sunsure’s first long-term battery storage power supply agreement. The company has a total 500MW portfolio of operational solar PV and wind assets, with a further 2.5GW in construction across various Indian states.

“Round-the-clock renewable energy is the need of the modern, growing India. The next generation of clean energy infrastructure will not be the one that works only when the sun shines or when the wind blows – but one that works when India needs it the most,” Sunsure Energy founder, chairman and CEO Shashank Sharma said.

Sharma noted that Sunsure has been “quietly building capabilities” toward that future over the past two years, moving from pure-play solar offerings to hybrid renewables-plus-storage technologies for commercial and industrial (C&I) customers.

In its utility business, the CEO referenced wins for the company in tenders from the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and hydroelectric power generation company SJVN, alongside NVVN’s “first-of-its-kind BESS deployment in the country.”

“We’ve consistently moved up the technology curve, while preserving our returns,” Sharma said.

NVVN is a power trading and cross-border energy import subsidiary of NTPC (formerly the National Thermal Power Corporation), another state-owned company like SECI and SJVN.

While it may be a first in terms of its contract structure, Sunsure’s latest win sits alongside many different types of hybrid renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPAs) and energy storage services and purchase agreements that India’s nodal agencies and states are tendering for.

From pioneering low-emission LNG infrastructure to delivering global megaprojects using modular construction and renewable-powered e-drive systems, Shaul explains how McDermott is addressing the energy trilemma: energy security, affordability, and sustainability.

How critical is the role of natural gas and LNG in supporting the energy transition and ensuring energy security?

Natural gas and LNG are absolutely essential to the global energy transition. While carbon-free energy production is the ultimate goal, natural gas plays a critical role in achieving interim decabonisation milestones, such as net-zero. That’s where LNG comes in. It is widely considered a bridge fuel that provides energy security and a reliable, lower-emission alternative to coal and oil, while bridging the gap as renewable and other carbon-free infrastructure continues to scale up.

At McDermott, we support this transition by delivering full project lifecycle services from concept to commissioning and fully integrated engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction (EPFC) solutions designed to reduce emissions and improve efficiency across the LNG value chain. For example:

Low-carbon LNG facilities: McDermott is pioneering the development of LNG plants with up to 95% reduction in operational emissions and 65% reduction in construction-related emissions.

Modular execution: Our modular fabrication approach optimises plot plan space, provides execution certainty and reduces the carbon footprint associated with traditional construction.

E-drive systems: By integrating electric drive systems powered by renewable energy, McDermott’s LNG solutions can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 95% compared to gas turbine-driven LNG facilities.

Global reach and scalability: With strategically located fabrication yards and execution offices, we optimise delivery based on regional priorities, ensuring efficiency and sustainability.

Could you give us an overview of your project pipeline and recent milestones?

One of our key projects is the Woodfibre LNG facility in British Columbia, Canada, which is set to be among the world’s lowest-emission LNG plants. Using imported hydroelectric power, a renewable source, the project significantly reduces emissions and exemplifies our commitment to low-carbon delivery through modularisation and integrated project execution.

We are also nearing completion of the first LNG train at the Golden Pass LNG Export Project in Sabine Pass, Texas, with Trains 2 and 3 to follow. The project represents over 15 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of LNG capacity. Once complete, it will bring McDermott’s total large-scale LNG trains delivered on the US Gulf Coast to nine —the second most of any contractor. It demonstrates our ability to execute some of the world’s largest and most complex projects.

Beyond Woodfibre and Golden Pass, McDermott has a strong global LNG portfolio. At Freeport LNG, our team and its joint venture partners delivered three pre-treatment trains, a liquefaction facility with three trains, a second loading berth, and a 165,000 m3 full-containment LNG tank. Each LNG train at the Freeport LNG facility produces around 5.1 Mtpa of LNG and incorporates cutting-edge e-drive systems, including the world’s largest electric motor-driven refrigeration compressors—three 75 MW electric motors per train, which significantly improves North America’s energy export capabilities.

These e-drive systems offer significant benefits: reduced emissions, faster restarts, increased operating flexibility, and improved year-round efficiency.

What are the ways in which your company is powering a sustainable future?

McDermott is leveraging its global scale and breadth of capabilities to support decarbonisation across the energy industry. In addition to e-drive systems powered by renewable energy in LNG facilities, we are also focusing on other critical low-carbon focus areas including HVDC substations for offshore wind; low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia; carbon capture and utilisation; and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Currently, McDermott is delivering Europe’s first green steel project for Stegra in Boden, Sweden, and executing FEEDs (front-end engineering design) for Clean Hydrogen Work’s Ascension Clean Energy blue ammonia project in Louisiana and the Exploits Valley Renewable Energy Complex (EVREC) in Newfoundland.

What key messages do you want to highlight at Gastech 2025, and what are you planning to showcase at the show?

At Gastech 2025, McDermott will highlight our leadership in delivering sustainable LNG, hydrogen and ammonia solutions through advanced technologies and integrated project execution.

We will showcase our expertise in low-carbon project delivery, including the e-drive systems, renewable energy integration, and modular construction.

[4] While the U.S. EV market remains Tesla’s stronghold—accounting for 46% of sales in Q2 2025—the broader landscape is shifting. General Motors, for instance, nearly doubled its EV sales in the same period, signaling a resurgence of traditional automakers in the EV race [3]. This raises a pivotal question: Can Tesla’s pivot to autonomous driving and AI-driven innovation offset its waning dominance in EV sales?

The Sales Slump: A Symptom of Market Maturity

Tesla’s U.S. market share in the EV segment has declined from its peak, even as it remains the largest seller. The phase-out of federal EV tax credits by September 30, 2025, has created a short-term tailwind for Q3 sales, but the underlying trend is concerning. U.S. EV sales in Q2 2025 fell 6.3% year-over-year, with Tesla’s 46% share masking a broader industry slowdown [1]. Competitors like BYD and Xiaomi are gaining traction in China, while Audi and BMW are reclaiming European ground [5]. This suggests that Tesla’s early-mover advantage is eroding as the EV market matures and competition intensifies.

Autonomous Driving: A Lifeline or a Liability?

Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology remains its most ambitious bet for long-term growth. The company’s camera-only approach, while cost-effective, has drawn criticism for lacking redundancy compared to LiDAR-based systems used by Waymo and GM [4]. Consumer sentiment is mixed: 35% of U.S. buyers view FSD as a deterrent, while only 14% see it as a draw [1]. Regulatory hurdles, including a $329 million verdict in a Miami Autopilot-related accident, further complicate deployment [4].

Yet, the potential rewards are vast. The global autonomous vehicle market is projected to reach $2.3 trillion by 2030, with Level 4/5 AVs dominating 60% of sales [5]. Tesla’s FSD v14 update, expected to boost AI model parameters tenfold, could position it as a leader in this space [1]. The company’s Dojo supercomputer and Optimus humanoid project also hint at a broader AI-driven ecosystem, potentially diversifying revenue beyond EVs [6].

The Robotaxi Race: Tesla vs. Waymo

Tesla’s planned robotaxi launch in Austin, Texas, highlights its aggressive timeline, but it lags behind Waymo’s 10 million paid rides and 0.41 accidents per million miles [4]. Waymo’s multi-sensor stack and regulatory compliance give it an edge in markets prioritizing safety. Tesla, however, aims to leverage its massive fleet for data training and a ride-hailing network, mirroring Uber or Airbnb [1]. This “democratization” of autonomy could disrupt mobility-as-a-service, but regulatory delays in Europe and China remain a wildcard [4].

Financial Realities and Investor Sentiment

Tesla’s U.S. brand desirability has dropped from 38% to 29%, reflecting waning consumer enthusiasm [5]. While FSD revenue hit $326 million in Q3 2024, this pales against the company’s $2.5 million vehicle production target for 2025 [2]. Analysts are split: some see recurring revenue from autonomy and AI as a growth catalyst, while others warn of short-term cash burn amid rising R&D costs [1].

Conclusion: A Calculated Bet on the Future

Tesla’s sales slump is a warning sign for the near term, but its long-term viability hinges on its ability to monetize autonomy. The company’s AI-driven innovations and robotaxi ambitions align with a $2.3 trillion market opportunity, yet regulatory and consumer hurdles are non-trivial. For investors, the key question is whether Tesla can scale its autonomy initiatives faster than competitors like Waymo while maintaining profitability. Those with a 5–10 year horizon may find the current valuation compelling, but patience and risk tolerance are prerequisites.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-01 04:01:16.735241

As Trump backs LNG exports, Pennsylvania residents fight $7B terminal

As the Trump administration accelerates liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, communities in Pennsylvania are pushing back against a proposed $7 billion terminal on the Delaware River. Supporters of the LNG expansion project tout economic gains, including thousands of jobs, billions in GDP contributions, and millions in tax revenue. But community groups warn of health and safety risks in an already overburdened environmental justice zone, where polluting industries have disproportionately harmed low-income neighborhoods and communities of color for decades. Pollution from waste incinerators and refineries has driven cancer and asthma rates in these communities well above national averages. The debate highlights growing tensions under the Trump Administration between short-term economic gains and long-term risks associated with community health and climate impacts.

U.S. nuclear expansion hinges on uranium enrichment

The U.S. nuclear industry is entering a pivotal phase as small modular reactors (SMRs) and micro-reactors gain momentum, promising cheaper and faster deployment of emissions-free electricity. These smaller reactors require high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU), a specialized fuel currently produced domestically only by Centrus Energy under a U.S. Department of Energy contract. However, with the U.S. still reliant on imports for two-thirds of its enriched uranium, supply chain bottlenecks could slow nuclear expansion. Much of the U.S.-enriched uranium comes from an enrichment plant in New Mexico, which is provided by the European company Urenco. The supply chain is also highly dependent on Russian enrichment, further threatening Trump’s promises of rapid nuclear energy expansion.

Battery storage allows producers to better match supply and demand, thereby reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
By 2040, the global battery storage capacity is expected to rise ninefold to over 4 TW, according to Rystad.
The world’s utility-scale battery storage capacity is growing at an unprecedented rate, as companies worldwide invest in making their renewable energy delivery more stable.
Lower costs and technological advancements have encouraged more widespread uptake of battery storage, a trend that is set to continue for decades to come.","Following the huge growth in global renewable energy capacity over the last decade, companies and governments have been steadily increasing investment in battery storage to help improve the stability of their green energy supply.

As countries worldwide develop their renewable energy industries, aiming to shift from a reliance on fossil fuels to alternative clean energy sources, such as wind and solar power, one of the main challenges has been to ensure a stable supply of energy to the grid. Solar power can only be produced during the day, while wind turbines only generate power when the wind is blowing. That means that most countries have continued to rely on fossil fuels during low or no production hours. However, this is gradually changing thanks to the deployment of utility-scale battery storage.

Battery storage can be used to store wind and solar power to deliver to the grid during the hours when no electricity is being produced. They mainly consist of lithium-ion batteries. In the U.K., which has the largest installed capacity of offshore wind in the world, the power source continues to be unstable without the use of batteries, which is a massive restriction to achieving a green transition. Battery storage allows producers to better match supply and demand, thereby reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The U.K. government estimates technologies like battery storage systems could save the country up to $48 billion by 2050, ultimately reducing people’s energy bills.

The multinational energy and gas utility National Grid says, “Intelligent battery software uses algorithms to coordinate energy production and computerised control systems are used to decide when to store energy or to release it to the grid. Energy is released from the battery storage system during times of peak demand, keeping costs down and electricity flowing.”

In 2024, global energy storage increased by approximately 200 GWh, bringing the world’s total battery storage capacity to 375 GWh, according to a May Rystad Energy report. China took the lead, installing 100 GWh of new capacity, followed by the United States, which added 35 GWh. Germany, Australia, and the U.K. represented the other main additions. By 2040, the global battery storage capacity is expected to rise ninefold to over 4 TW, according to Rystad.

This massive capacity expansion has been supported by a fall in electricity storage prices, with battery projects decreasing significantly as the technology has improved and more commercial-scale projects are deployed. The global average cost of battery energy storage declined to under $300 per kWh last year, making it far more accessible than in the past. Rystad highlighted that if it were to fall to $250 per kWh, the cost of storing electricity could be as low as $60 per MWh, which could help operators to increase their profit margins.

A recent study suggested that, in Germany, the cost of developing and operating utility-scale solar with integrated battery storage has become cheaper than the equivalent cost for gas-fired power plants. Innovations in battery technology and lower costs have allowed for the development of round-the-clock solar power, with the world’s first 24-hour solar PV project announced for Abu Dhabi at the beginning of the year. The state-owned renewable energy company Masdar is designating $6 billion in funds to develop 5 GW of solar and 19 GWh of battery capacity, which it expects to come online in 2027.

If successful, this could encourage other companies to make similar investments, which would further drive down reliance on fossil fuels to fill the renewable energy supply gap. In addition, technological advancements have also led to longer-life batteries, with manufacturers guaranteeing 10,000 charge-discharge cycles and over 80 percent battery health during that lifespan at present.

Several new markets are investing in battery storage, which is accelerating the industry’s expansion. China and the U.S. continue to dominate the battery storage market in 2025, but several gigawatt-hour projects have been approved or are under development in Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Australia, Netherlands, Chile, Canada, and the U.K. New additions are expected to increase by 35 percent this year, with annual additions totalling as much as 247 GWh, according to BloombergNEF estimates. The industry is expected to see acompound annual growth rate of 14.7 percent through 2035, to achieve an annual addition of around 972 GWh that year.

According to BloombergNEF, utility-scale battery power is expanding more rapidly than previously predicted in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, meaning it could overtake the residential sector to become the largest in the region from 2026. This has been supported by favourable policies and financial incentives across the region.

The world’s utility-scale battery storage capacity is growing at an unprecedented rate, as companies worldwide invest in making their renewable energy delivery more stable. Lower costs and technological advancements have encouraged more widespread uptake of battery storage, a trend that is set to continue for decades to come.

The US has launched a trade investigation into solar panels from India, Laos, and Indonesia, further extending its longstanding protectionist stance in the renewable energy industry. Such actions cannot help the US rebuild its industrial competitiveness, and only show a reluctance to face up to its own structural weaknesses.

The US International Trade Commission voted on Friday to proceed with an investigation into whether solar panels from India, Laos and Indonesia are stifling domestic manufacturing, Reuters reported on Saturday. The move follows the initiation of anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations by the US Department of Commerce just weeks earlier against crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells imported from India, Indonesia, and Laos.

Apparently, India, Indonesia, and Laos have become new targets in the US solar trade dispute, and this is not the first time the US has resorted to protectionist measures in the solar energy sector. US solar manufacturers have reportedly claimed that Chinese companies with operations in those countries receive unfair government subsidies and are selling their products below the cost of production in the US. However, in line with other claims the US has made against Chinese industries and products, this seems like nothing but a flimsy excuse for taking protectionist actions.

Due to high production costs, American solar manufacturers have always been at a disadvantage in market competition. While trade barriers may temporarily restrict the entry of some imported products, they fail to change the fact that US companies' costs remain high.

The predicament faced by the US solar industry is not a result of external competition, but rather its internal structural weaknesses. The US has long been a powerhouse in scientific research and technology, with many innovative ideas born in its laboratories. However, the problem lies in the weak translation of these scientific achievements into industrial production. The transition from laboratory breakthroughs to mass production is often hampered by inefficiencies in supply chain integration and industrial coordination. As a result, the cost of US domestic solar panels is much higher than those produced in Asian countries.

Looking back, the US has previously imposed tariffs on Chinese solar products in an attempt to protect its domestic industry through trade barriers. Yet, years later, there has been no significant revival in its domestic manufacturing capacity. The fundamental issue lies in America's inability to achieve large-scale, low-cost production of solar panels. Whether in terms of industrial scale, market absorption capacity, or cost control, the US does not have the fundamental conditions to support a globally competitive solar manufacturing industry.

Moreover, the negative impacts of protectionism are clearly visible in the US solar market. Trade protectionism has led to a significant increase in the price of solar products in the US. The cost of solar installations in the US is three to four times higher than in other countries. Such high prices have deterred consumers, leading to a decline in demand for solar installations. With shrinking demand, many solar companies in the US are facing bankruptcy. In recent years, many solar companies, including some large-scale ones like SunPower, went out of business, according to media reports. This not only restricts the development of the US solar industry but also hampers the large-scale application and growth of the entire renewable energy industry.

By attempting to use protectionism to solve a cost problem that cannot be fixed through trade barriers, the US is working against economic principles. In today's highly globalized economy, tariffs and investigations alone cannot rebuild national industrial competitiveness.

To a certain extent, the struggles of the US solar panel industry are emblematic of broader challenges in US manufacturing. The country's strengths in high-end technology cannot make up for its weaknesses in market adaptation and industrial foundation. The core problem lies in its failure to control costs, which are rooted in complex structural issues, expensive labor, and relatively low production efficiency. These persistent issues are increasingly constraining the growth of the renewable energy industry in the US.

As countries around the world actively promote the expansion of renewable energy, the problems caused by these structural shortcomings are becoming more and more pronounced, as well as the gap between the US renewable energy sector and global leaders. However, it's also important to note that this is the outcome of the global division of labor, and win-win cooperation could still be carried out if countries pursue openness instead of protectionism.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2025/2025-08-31/561f455e-44f6-4432-aff0-c7d273fcc5e6.jpeg,N,,2025-09-01 05:00:09.642929

But the limited availability and high cost of tritium, a version of hydrogen used to initiate fusion reactions, presents a barrier to the technology’s success. A Los Alamos team is investigating an accelerator-driven system that uses molten-salt technology to produce a supply of commercial tritium from nuclear waste.

“Despite the value tritium holds for the nation’s energy interests, tritium for commercial purposes is simply not produced domestically,” said Terence Tarnowsky, Los Alamos physicist and leader of the tritium production project. “The system we’re proposing could very usefully upcycle nuclear waste in a commercial tritium mission that helps on-ramp the fusion economy.”

Tarnowsky is employing modeling and simulation to understand the design, development, performance requirements and cost of an accelerator-driven system using molten-salt technology. Such a system is potentially versatile enough to work with unique fuel types, including the thousands of tons of used nuclear fuel potentially available from commercial nuclear power plants.

Replenishing supply of a nonrenewable resource

Tarnowsky’s initial estimates suggest that a 2-gigawatt deuterium-tritium fusion energy plant, a system that generates energy via fusion initiated with deuterium-tritium fuel, will require 112 kilograms of tritium per year. But less than approximately 25 kilograms of tritium are known to currently exist on the planet, with the majority of it existing as the byproduct of nuclear reactors and not available commercially.

Tarnowsky’s concept turns the problem of used nuclear fuel — storage is expensive and presents a safety and proliferation concern — into an opportunity. Using computer simulations, Tarnowsky is evaluating potential tritium reactors that use a particle accelerator on used nuclear fuel to drive reactions that produce tritium. The beam from the particle accelerator would generate neutrons in the molten salt. These neutrons can be used to produce tritium from dissolved lithium. Tritium finds its use in a fusion reactor when it combines with deuterium to release tremendous amounts of energy while generating almost no waste.

The accelerator model offers versatility — it can be turned on and off — and does not involve chain reactions, a possible safety advantage over tritium produced via nuclear power plants. Advances in the technology mean that this concept, which has been considered in the past, is more efficient now.

Tarnowsky is building on his recent modeling by going on to evaluate the dollar cost for tritium production and the possibility of using molten lithium salt in the design. Surrounding the nuclear waste with molten lithium salt would provide cooling, make the radioactive material harder to extract, and contribute to the ability to track and safeguard inventory.

“Understanding how design impacts costs and other factors is integral to how we approach decision-making around energy,” Tarnowsky said. “Our modeling aims to show what designs offer the best mix of efficiency and cost effectiveness as we move toward potential implementation.”

Tarnowsky presented his research at the American Chemical Society’s National Meeting and Exposition in August.

Electric vehicle manufacturers are expressing strong opposition to a proposed GST increase on high-end electric vehicles, cautioning that it could hamper progress in the nation's transition to clean mobility at a crucial time. The GST rationalisation group of ministers (GoM) has suggested raising tax rates to 18% from 5% for EVs priced above Rs 20 lakh. Although the GST Council has not reached a final verdict, the mere discussion has unsettled manufacturers, who report it is influencing consumer confidence.

GST Revolution Ahead: Experts Decode PM Modi’s Plan To Simplify India’s Tax Structure

Tata Motors' MD Shailesh Chandra highlighted recent EV advancements - vehicles achieving 500 km range, over 24,000 public charging points nationwide, and competitive pricing against conventional vehicles in several SUV categories. He emphasised that the current tax rate has been crucial in reducing buyer reluctance. ""It is therefore imperative that the 5% GST rate for EVs be retained,"" said Chandra, as quoted by Economic Times. ""Any upward revision would adversely impact EV adoption in India and slow down the transition to clean mobility, diluting environmental gains, and impacting India's aspirations towards zero-emission mobility,"" he added. India's electric car sales reached 15,528 units in July, showing a 93% increase compared to the previous year, as reported by FADA. EVs comprised 4.7% of total passenger vehicle sales, up from 2.4% in July 2024. Vehicle manufacturers are concerned that if the suggested rate increase is implemented, prices for approximately one-quarter of EVs above Rs 20 lakh would increase significantly, potentially affecting adoption rates. A Mahindra & Mahindra representative stated that maintaining the 5% rate is essential for price competitiveness with conventional vehicles and for developing the Rs 10-40 lakh EV segment, crucial for India's international competitiveness. Industry leaders emphasised the need for consistent policies to encourage sustained investment. ""To sustain EV adoption, we need stable long-term policies, accelerated CAFE norms, and zero percent GST on fully electric vehicles,"" said Anurag Mehrotra, MD, JSW MG Motor India. ""Investments in charging infrastructure and easing home charging will also be critical."" Premium car manufacturers indicated that while affluent buyers might be less affected by price changes, the entry-level luxury EV segment could face significant impact. Mercedes-Benz India's MD and CEO, Santosh Iyer, noted that current low GST rates have helped achieve necessary sales volumes and quickened BEV adoption.

In their book, Abundance, Derek Thompson and Ezra Klein argue that the progressive policies so carefully put in place by progressive politicians over the past several decades — things like the Administrative Procedures Act and the National Environmental Policy Act — have fueled the furious assault on reason and rationality on display every hour of every day by the MAGA crowd — especially the full frontal assault on renewable energy.

They write that progressives over the past 30 years have been more concerned with erecting barriers to right-wing policy initiatives than actually getting things done. The result of all those restrictions is the perception that government doesn’t work. It is that constant drumbeat of “government is the problem” thinking that has brought the New Fascism to prominence in the US, they suggest.

In other words, the road to hell is paved with good intentions and Democrats have pretty much shot themselves in the foot with their insistence on requiring all government action be fully compliant with every jot and tittle of the progressive agenda.

In a recent article by Rebecca Egan for Grist, she suggests many of those environmental protection efforts created by progressives are now being turned into weapons against environmental action by the fossil fuel industry and its acolytes. The evidence can be seen in a statement by the failed president of the United States that he posted on his personal antisocial media channel recently in which he said the administration “will not approve wind or farmer destroying Solar. The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!”

Actually, the days of stupidity are just beginning, as he and his slavish minions are taking a sledgehammer to renewable energy at every opportunity. Egan says many renewable energy experts say what the president and the Interior Department are doing is using the environmental legal playbook created by progressives against them to derail renewable energy.

Laws meant to protect and safeguard wildlife and public lands from mining, drilling, and habitat degradation — such as the Federal Land Policy and Management Act’s prohibition against “unnecessary or undue degradation” — are being used as a cudgel against wind and solar, Egan writes.

“They are effectively trying to co-opt arguments that we have used for years to push back on fossil fuels,” Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, the executive director at the Western Environmental Law Center, told Egan. “But I think it should go without saying that they are abusing those laws.” Thompson and Klein would agree with that analysis.

Renewable Energy & Capacity Density

He pointed to the recent capacity density order by the Interior Department as a particularly troubling example. Secretarial orders are meant to function as internal guidance to agencies. “They are not intended to put in place substantive rules that dictate outcomes,” he said, calling the capacity density order “a de facto prohibition against the siting and permitting of renewables on federal public lands. The DOI is fixating on this one metric — capacity density — to the exclusion of a holistic understanding of costs and benefits of a particular energy technology.”

What is capacity density? In simple terms, it is a measure of how much energy can be created per square foot, or square yard, or acre of land. A tank of gasoline has a greater energy content than a 65 kWh battery. By the DOI’s logic, electric cars would be banned on public roads unless and until their batteries reach energy density with gasoline on a per volume basis.

As Egan points out, when a wind or solar farm is decommissioned, the equipment is removed and within a year or two, it’s hard to tell anything was there and the land can be reused. But when a refinery or a fossil fuel plant shuts down, the ground is poisoned. Cancer-causing chemicals like benzene saturate the soil and remediation can take years, assuming it happens at all.

“The DOI is fixating on this one metric, capacity density, to the exclusion of a holistic understanding of costs and benefits of a particular energy technology,” said Schlenker-Goodrich.

“The [DOI is] trying to come up with the facade of a rational reason to stop doing anything related to renewables, but this one especially is really mind-boggling,” said Josh Axelrod, senior policy advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Everything it compares wind and solar to — none of those types of facilities are built on federal land. … There’s no comparison.”

Impacts On Public & Private Land

The Interior Department’s order that all wind and solar projects on federal land undergo “elevated review” is another misuse of environmental law, experts told Grist. Routine procedures that would have previously been handled by a DOI bureaucrat will now need the secretary’s personal sign-off.

The restrictions will impact projects on private land just as much as on public land. A recent analysis from The American Clean Power Association found that 27 of the new procedures requiring Burgum’s sign-off — such as needing consultations around harm to wildlife and endangered species — will allow the DOI to effectively end development of renewable energy projects nationwide.

The goal, it seems, is to create an impossible backlog that bleeds projects of funding before they can get off the ground, Egan writes, and the rules and regulations created by environmentalists are making such attacks on common sense possible. It’s a variation on the old expression “Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.” And boy, howdy, are Democrats getting it!

Picking Winners & Losers

Alex Klass, an environmental law professor at the University of Michigan, told Egan, “[The administration] can talk about energy dominance and talk about the need for new energy,” she said, “but before there was always an argument [that] you shouldn’t try to prop up an industry that can’t make it on its own. That’s basically what they’re doing.”

What’s worse is that foreseeable environmental consequences are being ignored. Burgum has cited concerns for migratory birds and whales as justification for shutting down offshore wind projects. Yet on August 26, the Interior Department announced plans to hold 30 offshore oil and gas lease auctions over the next 15 years.

Offshore drilling has been shown to be especially harmful to marine animals. Seismic blasting can result in hearing loss, which affects the ability of whales to breed and communicate. “It’s clear that actual energy development is being approached from a position of political theater, rather than practicality,” Egan writes.

Interior officials are working overtime to roll back environmental regulations around mining, despite local concerns about a scarcity of fresh water supplies. “Given the administration’s aggressive antipathy for environmental regulations, experts say it’s impossible to believe that the Interior Department’s sudden conservationist concerns around solar and wind impacts are being made in good faith,” Egan reports.

“It’s not like the Biden administration stopped permitting oil and gas development. There’s lots of oil and gas development,” said Alex Klass. “They just also tried to prioritize wind and solar. Here they’re saying, ‘Not only are we not going to prioritize [wind and solar], we’re going to try to shut it down entirely.’”

Remember when Republicans said government should not be picking winners and losers in the marketplace? Now they are doing much more than picking winners; they are effectively banning entire industries from competing both at home and abroad.

Project to create up to 48 jobs and generate $36 million in revenue

A Bunbury company will employ more workers and pursue new manufacturing opportunities in the wind energy sector after receiving more than $2 million under a partnership program established by the Cook Government.

RCR Advanced Technologies, part of the half-century-old RCR Mining Technologies, is the second recipient under the $8 million Wind Energy Manufacturing Co-Investment Program, delivered in collaboration with the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre (AMGC).

The $5.3 million project is set to strengthen Western Australia's capability to produce wind energy componentry locally and support the development of clean energy projects, facilitating Western Australia's broader energy transition.

The Bunbury-based company will receive $2,047,900 in co-investment funding to pilot the production of innovative transition flanges for wind turbines.

Transition flanges connect the turbine tower to the foundation and are currently manufactured overseas. RCR is in talks with turbine manufacturers to build the flanges in WA, to reduce shipping logistics and deliver supply chain reliability.

RCR will modernise and expand its workshop capability, purchase state-of-the-art machinery and upgrade quality control processes to meet the standards of large wind energy developers.

It will also use the investments to upskill its workforce to be capable of undertaking future refurbishment of wind turbine components such as gearboxes and drive shafts.

Leveraging this co-investment and its extensive manufacturing expertise in materials handling equipment for the resources sector, RCR will strengthen its collaboration with global original equipment manufacturers, such as Vestas, and engage with other major renewable energy project developers.

The project is expected to create up to 48 new jobs and generate $36 million in new revenue over the next five years.

The Wind Energy Manufacturing Co-Investment Program provides financial and non-financial support to help local manufacturers increase their participation in wind energy supply chains.

It offers up to 50 per cent of eligible project costs, with industry partners required to match the funding, ensuring a strong collaborative approach.

The program supports manufacturers at various stages of development through two funding streams, related to market entry and growth. It is being delivered in partnership between the Department of Energy and Economic Diversification and the AMGC.

It’s also powering careers. Electricians and laborers are finding steady work on solar, wind, and grid projects. And the newest data backs them up: clean energy jobs are growing faster than the U.S. job market overall.

What the research shows

Clean energy jobs are rising twice as fast as overall U.S. employment, with 2023 growth in the 4–5% range versus about 2% economy-wide.

Unionization in clean energy hit a record of ~12.4% in 2023, above the private-sector average and even surpassing traditional energy.

Energy jobs pay more. Median hourly pay for U.S. energy workers has been reported at about 34% above the national median—evidence that many clean-energy roles are good, middle-class jobs.

Ohio by the numbers

Different research groups count jobs in slightly different ways. But they point to a clear trend: Ohio is a top-tier clean energy employer. Here’s a simple snapshot:

Measure Latest Figure Source Clean energy job growth, U.S. (2023) ~4.2%–4.9% (about 2× overall economy) DOE USEER 2024 / DOE press brief Unionization rate in clean energy (U.S., 2023) ~12.4% DOE USEER 2024 Energy wage premium (U.S.) ~34% above national median EFI/NASEO wage analysis Ohio clean energy jobs ~114,000 (2023 methodology) Clean Jobs Midwest Ohio clean energy jobs ~142,000 (USER-based ranking) Top-10 states list (USEER-derived) Ohio rank Top 10 nationally (often ~8th) Regional and state reports

Local voices: training and steady work

On the ground, union crews say the boom is real. Pat Hook, business manager of IBEW Local 683 in Columbus, said utility-scale solar projects in central Ohio have already created “hundreds and hundreds of jobs” and “millions of dollars in wages and benefits.” His members are also bringing in new apprentices who learn on live projects and earn while they train.

Kevin Pranis, Great Lakes marketing manager for the Laborers’ International Union of North America (LIUNA), framed the value of training this way: “We really train people to be construction professionals.” Those skills move between job sites—solar, wind, highways, and schools—so workers can keep steady hours and grow their careers.

Why these are “career” jobs

Apprenticeships open the door. Earn a paycheck, learn a trade, and get industry credentials.

Portable skills travel across sites (solar arrays today, grid upgrades tomorrow).

Safety and benefits are part of the package in many union shops.

National data matches those claims. Unionization in clean energy rose to a record level in 2023, and energy employers reported fewer hiring challenges than in the prior year. That helps projects stay on schedule and supports stable careers.

Community impact: more than paychecks

Some local groups raised concerns about land use and environmental impacts around large solar sites. Those debates matter. But project backers point to finished facilities that are now producing power and raising local tax revenue. Districts report gains that support schools, police, and fire services. And because many projects sit near small towns, the dollars ripple through diners, hotels, and hardware stores.

Key takeaways for Ohio

Ohio is a top-10 state for clean energy employment.

Job growth is real and faster than the overall labor market nationwide.

Wages are strong, and union coverage is higher than average.

Training pathways from unions and community programs are expanding to meet demand.

Where to learn more (and how to get started)

And for laborer pathways in site prep, concrete, trenching, and more, visit LIUNA.org. These groups run proven programs that help people enter the trades, build skills, and move up.

Ohio’s outlook

So, what’s next? More utility-scale solar is in the pipeline. Grid upgrades are ongoing. Storage is growing too. The broader U.S. data suggests clean energy hiring will stay strong, and research groups expect states like Ohio to keep adding jobs—especially where manufacturers, developers, and unions work together on training and fair pay.

At a glance: national and Ohio context

Topic Quick Fact What it means Speed of growth Clean energy added jobs at ~2× the national rate in 2023 Hiring momentum favors trained tradespeople and new apprentices. Unionization Clean energy unionization is ~12.4%. More jobs come with bargaining power, safety standards, and benefits. Pay Energy median pay ~34% above national median These roles tend to support middle-class living and stable careers. Ohio scale ~114k–142k clean energy jobs, depending on the definition Ohio stands in the national top 10 and continues to grow.

The SUN DAY Campaign in late August said its review of recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) revealed that solar provided almost 9% of total U.S. electrical generation in the first half of 2025. Wind and solar combined produced more than 20%, and the mix of all renewable energy resources generated nearly 28%.

Industry analysts have told POWER they expect renewables will remain important to U.S. power generation, though growth may be slower, while other countries such as China and much of Europe continue to ramp up their use of solar, wind, geothermal and more. It’s expected to be a major topic of conversation at the upcoming RE+ 2025 event in Las Vegas, Nevada, which begins September 8 and continues through September 11. POWER is partner of RE+ and will again have representatives at the conference. Renewable energy also will be part of important conversations at POWER’s Experience POWER event in Denver, Colorado, October 29 through October 31.

Rick Margolin is among industry experts with plenty to say about the future of renewable energy. Margolin is a director in the Renewables Advisory Group at ENGIE Impact, which Margolin said “supports clients in meeting their sustainability efforts through the use of renewables in the most economic and technically feasible manner.”

Margolin provided POWER with insight into how companies are approaching sustainability targets during a period of upheaval in the energy landscape, as government priorities around energy shift not only in the U.S. but also worldwide.

POWER: Are companies moving away from sustainability targets in the current regulatory landscape, or are they simply calling them something else?

Margolin: While there have been a few high-profile retreats from sustainability initiatives, by and large we’re seeing firm commitment to previously stated sustainability targets among our client base, and in some cases actually a doubling down. The broad uncertainty that has emerged is placing clients in a position where they’re increasingly viewing renewables as a mechanism to insulate from anticipated increases in energy costs and volatility.

We’re seeing more clients look to renewables to lock in power prices, gain budgetary certainty, and increase reliability in energy supply as competition for energy becomes fierce and the ability to add new generation sources is constrained. Corporate sustainability commitments aren’t as publicized as they were in recent years, but we’re not seeing much substantive retreat; in some cases, we’re seeing increased commitment.

POWER: Why do you believe current market conditions remain favorable for renewable energy buyers?

Margolin: The main reason is price: renewables in most markets offer some of the lowest cost energy available. Because renewables don’t have associated fuel costs, you can lock in your price and insulate yourself from the volatility that characterizes fuel-generated sources.

Second is expediency. Renewables are the fastest form of technology that can hit the market, with development times of 12 to 18 months depending on project type and size. Other utility-scale sources face major supply chain issues or technical development challenges with longer lead times.

Renewables also don’t obligate an energy buyer to be beholden to a utility. They offer flexibility that allows energy users to generate their own system or engage in power purchase contracts with renewables developers. The procurement opportunities are diverse and flexible, enabling energy buyers to tailor solutions to their energy usage, payment preferences, and budgetary constraints.

Additionally, many clients are publicly traded or backed by private equity where shareholders and investors still value sustainability and moving toward renewable energy sources. That pressure from stakeholders hasn’t abated, providing motivation beyond pure economics.

POWER: In light of policy uncertainty, how can organizations make the most of the limited window for cost-effective clean energy deals while managing their impact on procurement timelines and decisions?

Margolin: The most important thing is getting internal teams aligned. The number one obstacle we see is lack of internal cohesion. Energy buyers need their sustainability group, facilities, procurement, accounting, finance, and tax teams aligned, ensuring everybody knows the objective and that all constraints and abilities are incorporated into a buying plan with C-Suite buy-in.

Once a client has internal alignment, we see the ability to move expeditiously through the process: quickly from opportunity identification to origination to negotiation to contracting to implementation. Many projects in the marketplace can come online in time to capture remaining federal tax credits. It’s a question of whether the client can organize quickly and engage in the process.

POWER: What approaches and strategies does ENGIE Impact use to help clients identify the best deals and lock in renewable energy contracts that hedge against future price volatility?

Margolin: First, we work with the client to understand not just sustainability goals, but how they operate: budgeting, financing, and planning horizons. It’s a conversation around goal setting and achievement.

Second is opportunity identification. We develop roadmaps and strategies where, once we understand their portfolio and operations, we present available marketplace options. This enables us to recommend three or four pathways worth pursuing.

Third, we work on internal buy-in, ensuring everyone understands different procurement tools, costs, and operational impacts. Once aligned, we move to origination, identifying transactable opportunities that fit the strategy.

Finally, we advocate for the client in negotiations, perform due diligence, conduct econometric analysis, and negotiate optimal terms. We manage implementation oversight and provide ongoing monitoring to ensure clients receive what they contracted for throughout the project’s operational life.

POWER: What are the risks associated with delaying procurement? (e.g., higher compliance costs, other financial challenges)

Margolin: The biggest risk right now is losing incentive opportunities. Federal investment and production tax credits are being phased out, and to qualify before they’re eliminated, you need projects that meet certain deadlines. Delays risk missing incentives, which could drive project costs significantly higher.

Beyond incentives, the longer corporate energy buyers delay incorporating renewables into their strategy, the greater their exposure to rising energy prices. The universal expectation across energy markets is that prices are increasing for all sources: renewables, gas, coal, and nuclear. The longer you wait, the greater exposure to both rising and volatile prices.

POWER: Should existing wind or solar power purchase agreements be renegotiated as conditions evolve?

Margolin: It’s difficult to make blanket statements since this depends on individual contracts and projects. What’s important for buyers is monitoring market conditions and forecasts. Energy buyers should understand where markets are heading, then evaluate existing contracts for any that might work against them.

We work closely with clients to understand why energy prices are projected to increase. You need to understand all the contributing factors, not just accept that prices will rise. While that may be the prevailing view, you must also understand the risks to that perspective and position yourself to hedge or leverage both upside and downside opportunities.

POWER: Are clients working to expedite the signing of more deals in 2025 to meet the accelerated deadline for project starts?

Margolin: Absolutely. Companies with aligned internal teams that are already in renewable energy procurement or ready to go are viewing this as go time. There’s definite urgency, primarily due to tax credit expirations.

Projects beginning construction before July 4, 2026, can qualify for full tax credits. Projects that can’t meet that deadline but come online by end of 2027 can still qualify. The rush is to secure projects with prospects of being online or under construction to capture those credits.

Many developers are positioned to meet these deadlines with safeguarded equipment, established financing, labor forces, and permitting expertise. It’s very busy right now (matching developers with off-takers).

POWER: Do you foresee an uptick in clean energy storage projects and deals, given that they remain in favor?

Margolin: Absolutely. Storage makes sense and would see significant growth regardless of incentive structures because it smooths market volatility and provides arbitrage opportunities on power prices in certain markets.

Storage continues growing because it makes financial and operational sense, and it wasn’t disadvantaged by policy changes like wind and solar were. The storage space is also benefiting from technological developments. Beyond traditional batteries, we’re seeing impressive improvements in costs, reliability, durability, and reduced use of precious materials.

We’re also seeing evolution beyond batteries: pumped air, pumped hydro, molten materials for heat storage, and gravity storage. This diverse storage ecosystem has taken off in Asian markets and we expect U.S. deployment as well.

POWER: What makes you hopeful about the future of clean energy procurement despite the policy headwinds?

Margolin: Renewables aren’t going away. If demand grows as projected, we must add new generation. When you examine all forms of energy generation we can add to the grid, renewables win in almost every parameter: lowest cost energy in most markets, fastest to grid, healthiest supply chains, and flexibility to tailor procurement strategies.

Renewables offer flexibility to detach from the grid or operate semi-attached, providing distributed generation opportunities other technologies lack. When you evaluate the entire suite of criteria for new energy sources, renewables continue leading.

The policy environment will make renewable energy more expensive, but it will still be the most cost-advantageous with all the other advantages discussed. We’re still adding renewables; they’ll just cost more.

POWER: What role do you see corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) commitments playing in accelerating procurement decisions this year?

Margolin: It’s still a major role, though diminished compared to 2020-2024. It remains significant because investors, employees, and shareholders value sustainability, not for feel-good reasons, but because investors and pension fund managers recognize sustainability as value-adding.

It improves business operations, provides insulation from volatility, and reduces risks from climate change, geopolitics, and market volatility. Over the past 15 years, the financial community has broadly recognized that sustainability translates to optimal performance.

While less publicized recently, it hasn’t disappeared, and I don’t expect it will because underlying fundamentals haven’t changed. Companies with high pollution or emissions footprints are still seen as generating waste, which isn’t favorable for operations.

POWER: Can you share an example of how a client successfully secured a deal that both improved returns and future-proofed compliance?

Margolin: We worked with a large government agency with greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets for 2030, 2045, and 2050. We helped them procure on-site solar systems for dozens of portfolio properties at rates that save money compared to staying with their utility.

They’re saving money, reducing emissions, and hardening against grid and market volatility while moving significantly closer to meeting their emissions reduction goals. This demonstrates how renewable procurement can simultaneously address financial, operational, and compliance objectives.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/fig2-wind-solar-hydro-shutterstock-570200689.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 05:00:28.106751

Capacitor films may seem like a small component, but they’re the very foundation on which our energy infrastructure is built.
Our national security, economic prosperity, and daily lives depend on a modern, resilient power grid.","By Dr. Ponting, Chief Scientific Officer, Peak Nano

America’s power grid is at a tipping point. On July 7th, the Department of Energy (DOE) issued an unmistakable warning: with growing trends in power plant retirement, surging electrification, and exploding demand from AI data centers, the U.S. could see a 100-fold increase in blackouts by 2030. Without quickly developing and adopting U.S.-made grid-enhancing technologies (GETs), system failure is inevitable.

The department’s conclusion is blunt: incremental, patchwork improvement— “business-as-usual” grid management—no longer cuts it. It’s time for “radical change.”

Energy demand is growing at an extraordinary pace. By 2030, electric vehicles and data centers alone will consume 35 gigawatts (GW)—doubling their 2022 demand and adding unprecedented stress to systems already on edge. Meanwhile, our grid will lose 104GW of reliable baseload power from coal and gas plant retirements, and the vast majority of new generation will come from intermittent wind and solar power.

Utilities have traditionally adopted new technologies at a glacial pace. For decades, the urgency wasn’t there. From my earliest days as a scientist, I’ve wanted to solve genuine, large-scale grid problems. Today, there’s a clear and compelling reason to innovate: we can’t afford to proceed with the old, decade-long timelines for adopting new technologies.

But the hands of our innovators are tied. If we don’t streamline regulatory hurdles, we could slide into an era of chronic energy insecurity. Without immediate, decisive action, rolling blackouts and grid failures will become routine, threatening everything from basic public safety to the future of our cities, industries, and national competitiveness.

For an AI-powered, electrified nation, that is simply untenable. While we can’t throw caution to the wind, we need reasonable policy changes to fast-track new, proven grid technologies.

With smarter, American-made solutions, we can strengthen our grid from within. Grid-enhancing technologies (GETs) enable utilities and grid operators to quickly drop in and deploy upgraded components on existing infrastructure, without large-scale overhauls.

One example is advanced capacitor film—a specialized, super-thin plastic that forms the backbone of the capacitors that store and release energy across the grid. These components are foundational—if the underlying technology isn’t robust, you can’t guarantee stability. As we push to meet rising demand on aging infrastructure, the cracks in our foundation are starting to show, resulting in power blackouts, bottlenecks, and project delays.

The films traditionally used in capacitors are made of BOPP (biaxially oriented polypropylene) and start to break down at 85°C. As temperatures rise above that threshold, these films shrink, degrading performance, forcing operators to replace capacitors more frequently, invest in cooling infrastructure, and/or “derate” (run capacitors below their maximum voltage). This requires more oversight and reduces capacitor performance and efficiency, making it harder to meet increasing energy demand.

Compounding the issue, our energy security is at risk. We rely solely on foreign companies, primarily in China, to supply this consumable material. Cutting off our supply would directly threaten grid reliability, public safety, and our national economy.

Innovative alternatives are emerging. At Peak Nano, we’ve pioneered a high-performance, drop-in-ready capacitor film made in the U.S. called NanoPlex™. This film extends equipment service life by up to five times, cuts energy loss in half, and operates at temperatures up to 135°C with virtually none of the shrinkage or derating issues seen with traditional materials.

Deploying technologies that allow grid operators to get more power and reliability out of existing assets is exactly the kind of leap forward the DOE demands.

We cannot do it alone. The capacitor film industry is worth $200 billion annually, and China is raking in the lion’s share. With broader investment in R&D and commitment to building domestic manufacturing, we can kick-start a supply chain revolution to reshore critical grid-enhancing technology, strengthening the foundation of our grid. This isn’t just about better performance—it’s an investment in America’s energy security.

Practical Change and Policy Imperatives

To rebuild the foundation of our grid, we need to rethink how our grid is structured and operated.

We’re seeing a shift away from large, centralized power plants towards a distributed mesh of modular generation units called microgrids, which create localized power and sell excess back to the grid. Startups and utilities are beginning to embrace this model, which better integrates diverse energy sources and enables grid growth without the delays and opposition tied to building massive power stations. Capacitors sit at the intersection of microgrids and the main grid, holding and distributing power on demand.

Future-proofing our grid also requires a move from analog to digital grid management. Enhancements like solid-state transformers and high-frequency switching will enable more precise energy management and reduce power loss. AI-based demand forecasting and consumption matching will allow us to squeeze greater efficiency from existing equipment, but that depends on the reliability and longevity of our power hardware.

Utilities and OEMs face obstacles to adopting GETs—high upfront costs, regulatory barriers, and public resistance. Modernization will require significant investment and collaboration among state and local actors.

The Advancing GETs Act of 2024 presents a promising framework to accelerate innovation and utilities investment. But success also hinges on policymakers funding public outreach to win community support, helping people understand that short-term disruptions will bring long-term benefits such as lower electricity bills, reliable power, and new local jobs.

We must also move technology out of the lab and into the field. I tell young engineers, “You can’t build a modern power grid from a conference room.” We need skilled electricians and line workers trained on new solutions and practical, real-world deployments to refine and scale innovations.

Securing Our Energy Future

According to Secretary Wright, “In the coming years, America’s reindustrialization and the AI race will require a significantly larger supply of around-the-clock, reliable, and uninterrupted power… to keep the lights on, win the AI race, and keep electricity prices from skyrocketing, the United States must unleash American energy.”

We must bring in new technologies that will “hold up the house” during the energy transition. Capacitor films may seem like a small component, but they’re the very foundation on which our energy infrastructure is built.

Our national security, economic prosperity, and daily lives depend on a modern, resilient power grid. As we race to meet demand, these upgrades must begin today. America’s future can’t wait.","https://img.tdworld.com/files/base/ebm/tdworld/image/2025/08/68af65e7aaceefd0335a817a-1479040330977254___mainimage1280x720.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-09-01 04:02:13.847137

“In conclusion, the record levels of oil and natural gas production in the United States highlight the strength of the energy sector in 2025,” said Di Giacomo.","The United States cemented its status as the world’s preeminent energy superpower this June, reaching unprecedented heights in both crude oil and natural gas production.

According to an August 29, 2025, analysis by Antonio Di Giacomo, Financial Markets Analyst for LATAM at XS, the country hit a historic high of 13.58 million barrels per day (bpd) in crude oil production, driven by robust output from Texas, New Mexico, and the Gulf of Mexico.

This development “consolidates the country’s position as the world’s largest crude oil producer,” Di Giacomo stated, underscoring the “resilience of the U.S. energy sector, despite challenges to investment and fluctuations in international oil prices.”

Total supply of crude and refined products soared to 21 million bpd, the highest since October 2024.

Di Giacomo emphasised that this surge is not merely a function of expanded production, but also the result of “stronger domestic demand.”

Featured among the indicators of revived consumption, gasoline usage climbed to 9.23 million bpd, a peak not seen since July 2024.

Meanwhile, jet fuel demand reached 1.85 million bpd, marking its highest point since August 2018.

“Fuel consumption dynamics are partly explained by the recovery of air travel and the rise in tourism during the summer season,” Di Giacomo detailed.

“Likewise, the strength of the U.S. labour market, along with GDP growth in the second quarter, has boosted the use of cars and trucks for both productive and leisure activities.

“These factors have helped sustain domestic energy demand.”

Simultaneously, gross natural gas production in the lower 48 states set a new record at 120.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), edging past the previous high set in March.

The most substantial production gains were attributed to Texas and Pennsylvania, registering increases of 0.7% and 1%, respectively.

According to Di Giacomo, “This level surpassed the previous peak reached in March, reinforcing the United States’ position as a key exporter in global liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets.”

Di Giacomo noted, “The country’s LNG export capacity has been a decisive factor in strengthening the U.S. gas industry. In recent months, exports to Europe and Asia have increased, driven by persistent demand for energy security and supplier diversification.

“This has placed the United States at the centre of global energy geopolitics, in a context marked by international tensions and shifting trade flows.”

Despite these gains, the analyst cautioned about the pressure such rapid expansion exerts on the sector.

“High production levels also bring challenges,” noted Di Giacomo.

“Pressure on strategic reserves, transportation and storage infrastructure limitations, as well as debates over the energy transition, remain key issues on the political and economic agenda.

“Balancing hydrocarbon leadership with climate commitments is one of the central tensions faced by the current administration.”

Looking forward, the sector faces a challenging landscape.

Di Giacomo suggests that while forecasts indicate U.S. energy output will stay robust, the industry continues to face uncertainties tied to swings in global prices, actions by the Federal Reserve, and levels of investment in renewable energy.

He notes that the future success of the sector hinges on maintaining its competitive edge, fulfilling domestic energy needs, and evolving to address climate-related challenges.

Di Giacomo concluded his outlook by highlighting the dual imperatives now facing U.S. energy.

“In conclusion, the record levels of oil and natural gas production in the United States highlight the strength of the energy sector in 2025,” said Di Giacomo.

“With solid domestic demand and a strategic role in the global market, the country reinforces its position as a leader in the international market.

“However, challenges in infrastructure, energy transition, and sustainability outline a complex future, where the key will be balancing economic growth with environmental responsibility.”",https://petroleumaustralia.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/shutterstock_2285692109-1000x667-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 02:59:57.789481

If electrification cannot be scaled up quickly, the car fleet will be composed of ICEs for a long time.
This process will likely require decades to complete, and in the transitory phase, ICEs comprise a large fraction of the car fleet.","We estimate the emissions from the car sector until 2100 based on projected sales shares of electric vehicles (EVs) and cars with internal combustion engines (ICEs)27 (Fig. 1). Using data from Bloomberg28, we split global values into two groups of emerging and developed countries to capture their different timely adoption of EVs. We fit these projections to historical values for each country reported by the IEA to match current developments to the expected progression of sales shares. The fleet growth is based on data for OECD and non-OECD countries from EIA12, which we match to the categories of emerging and developed countries. We deduce the new vehicle registrations from the fleet size and specific car lifetime per country. Finally, we estimate vehicle emissions by considering car and battery manufacturing and consumption of fuel and electricity. In three scenarios (Business-as-usual (BAU), Middle-of-the-Road (MoR), and Optimistic), we vary the level of ambition regarding the transition to electrification and the decarbonization of grid electricity and analyze different options to meet climate goals by reducing the cumulative emissions of the car sector until the end of the century.

Regional resolution

We combine multiple data sources to address the need for regionally resolved forecasts of electric vehicle markets. This allows us to show the different technology adoption speeds, especially in contrast between developed and emerging countries.

IEA collects historical data (2001–2023) for EV sales, fleet, and new and total vehicle registrations for 31 countries (Supplementary Fig. 1). The remaining countries are aggregated as Rest of the World and Other Europe. These historical data are the starting point for our analysis.

Projection of car sales shares

We complement the historical car sales data by three scenario projections (Stated Policy, Sustainable Development, and Net Zero Emissions) for EVs published by the IEA27 and map them to our scenarios (BAU, MoR, Optimistic). These data reflect a global perspective without any distinction between countries or market types. However, the development of the electric vehicle market happens at different speeds in different regions: while developed regions act as early adopters with higher financial resources, electrification in emerging economies will follow at a slower speed. Historical data on electric vehicle car sales are available at the individual country level. Still, projections on the same level for all countries in our analysis and ideally from a single source are not available. To reflect different speeds of the transition to EVs in different markets, we therefore combine two datasets: global IEA projections divided into three scenarios for different speeds of transition and the projections of Bloomberg28, which have only a single scenario but are divided into an emerging, a global, and a developed country perspective. We do this by applying the relative differences between the “global” projection and “emerging” and “developed” from Bloomberg to the three EV sales share projections of IEA until 2050. We fit these six projections to the data’s historical development to obtain a forecast for each country or region from the underlying dataset. First, we categorize the countries into developed or emerging according to S&P BMI29. Second, we change the respective projections’ (developed or emerging) starting year until it matches each country’s last value from the historical dataset (Fig. 1 I bottom). To expand from the literature values, in the absence of reliable projections, we assume the sales shares to be constant from 2051 to 2100.

Projection of fleet size

We model the number of vehicles in the fleet for each country. EIA forecasts the vehicle stock development in OECD and non-OECD countries until 205012, which we match to the list of emerging and developed countries in our analysis. We use these growth rates to obtain the future number of vehicles per country, starting from the historical fleet size (Fig. 1 IIA). From 2051 to 2100, we extend the projections by EIA in the following way: for developed countries, the fleet size is assumed to be constant as the number of vehicles in this region is already projected to be near-constant by EIA; for emerging countries, EIA projects strong growth until 2050, which we then reduce by 2% each year until 2100 to reflect the increased level of wealth and the associated expected saturation of the car market.

Projection of new vehicle registrations

To apply the previously calculated sales share to the development of the fleets, we need to derive the number of newly registered vehicles, which are so far unknown. The newly registered vehicles consist of i) new vehicles entering the fleet and ii) replaced vehicles that leave the fleet at their end of life (Fig. 1 IIb). The former is the difference between the vehicle stock of two consecutive years. For the latter, we assume a Gaussian-distributed vehicle lifetime. In a similar analysis, Märtz et al.21 used a static global lifetime of 12 years per vehicle. This, however, leads to discrepancies between the cumulative fleet size (the sum of all newly registered vehicles over their lifetime) and the target fleet size by EIA12. Also, Held et al.30 found that vehicle lifetimes differ significantly between countries. To minimize the error, we adjust the vehicle lifetime individually per country in a recursive optimization loop to fit the EIA fleet size forecast12. The resulting vehicle lifetimes are close to the ones identified by Held et al.30.

While this method allows for the matching of cumulative new registrations with the designated development of the fleet size in a manner that matches literature values for vehicle lifetimes, it has several limitations: (i) no explicit import or export of vehicles between countries, (ii) our probability function for vehicle lifetime is a step function for each country that is smoothened with a Gaussian distribution over five years while Held et al.30 used a continuous probability density function, (iii) historical effects such as the drastic drop in new vehicle registrations during the Covid pandemic in 2020 are propagated through the analysis. While the latter creates a propagating effect throughout the analysis, which appears to repeat the pattern that led to its creation, this should not be interpreted as a projection of the exact cause (e.g., a global pandemic) repeating itself. It suggests that the historic decline in vehicle sales during the pandemic leads to a non-replacement and, therefore, lower vehicle sales after one lifetime of the vehicles. In other words, the cars not sold during the pandemic will not have to be replaced at the end of their lifetime. Of course, considerable uncertainty is associated with this projection, but this is an intrinsic uncertainty of future data projection. If the drop in sales during the pandemic would not appear in future sales in one way or another, this would be just another assumption, i.e., assuming that cars would be replaced earlier or later than their usual lifetime. Therefore, we accept the repetitive historical behavior resulting from the selected method and the historical data. Combining new vehicle registrations with electric vehicle sales shares gives each country’s fleet composition over time.

Extrapolation until 2100

The datasets and projections used do not extend beyond 2050. However, many ICEs will be in the fleet after 2050, which might impair the carbon budgets. To derive the cumulative emissions until 2100, the projections must be extended. Any underlying predictions are assumed to be constant after the year 2050, except for fleet growth in emerging countries, which will likely continue beyond 2050. We thus fix the EV sales shares and the carbon intensity of grid electricity at their respective values of 2050 and do not assume further development. For fleet growth until 2050, the projections of EIA12 for developed and emerging countries are used. From 2051 to 2100, the fleet size is kept constant at the 2050 value for developed countries. For emerging countries, on the other hand, the ten-year average fleet growth rate as projected by EIA from 2040 to 2050 is reduced by 2% annually and used to project growth until 2100, taking increasing wealth and market saturation of the market into account.

Vehicle emissions

LCA of EVs

The lifecycle emissions of an EV are comprised of vehicle and battery manufacturing, as well as grid electricity used to charge the battery. For the car without a battery, we assume 4.56 kg CO2-eq per kg of vehicle mass after Buberger et al.31, where this value is assumed to drop to zero until 2100 (assuming decarbonization of the economy). Each car is assumed to carry a 50-kWh battery. For battery manufacturing, 100 kg CO2-eq per kWh of capacity is taken from Kelly et al.32. We linearly reduce this value to zero in 2100 with the same reasoning as for vehicle manufacturing. We take the carbon intensity of grid electricity from 2020 to 2040 from IEA33 for the stated policies scenario (STEPS), the sustainable development scenario (SDS), and the net-zero scenario (NZE) and apply a break-down into countries and regions34,35. In our analysis, we map the STEPS scenario onto the BAU, SDS to MoR, and NZE to the Optimistic scenarios. We further assume an identical evolution of specific emissions in all countries. The consumption of electricity is assumed to be 15 kWh/100 km.

LCA of ICEs

For manufacturing an ICE vehicle, the emissions are assumed to be the same as for an EV without a battery. The combustion of one liter of gasoline emits 3.183 kg CO2-eq.21. We do not distinguish between gasoline and diesel vehicles but assume the same emission factor for a generic ICE vehicle. We assume a constant consumption of 5.9 L/100 km of ICE cars and an annual distance traveled of 15,000 km per vehicle (both for ICE and EV).

Selection of alternative fuels

We assume a selection of power-to-liquid fuels and different biofuels, i.e., HEFA fuels (hydrogenated esters and fatty acids) from the conversion of soybean oil and yellow grease, and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) conversion of herbaceous biomass, of municipal solid waste (MSW), of forestry waste, and agricultural residues. For HEFA fuels, the two indicated pathways serve as the basis for calculating costs and emissions, but the actual feedstock base is more extensive and comprises other waste oils, fats, and greases such as used cooking oil (UCO).

Fuel emissions

We use emissions for biofuels from Dray et al.18, who derive the values adjusting for future hydrogen and electricity emissions (assuming zero emissions for renewable electricity). For biofuels, the emissions of the fuel mix consisting of different fuel pathways are derived from the specific emissions of the single pathways18 and the breakdown of pathways in the potential analysis36. The biofuel supply is then assumed to always have this composition36, which is not a function of the scenarios used in our analysis. The emissions of power-to-liquid fuels are derived from the ICAO report on the feasibility of the long-term aspirational goal to defossilize aviation37, where the emissions for PtL derived from direct air capture of CO2 for IS1 are assumed for BAU, from IS2 for MoR, and IS3 for Optimistic. We do not distinguish between emissions of CO2 derived from waste sources or the air but assume all CO2 to come from the air.

Fuel availability

The available amounts of alternative fuels for the road transport sector are assumed to be the by-products of the alternative aviation fuels that often cannot be produced selectively, e.g., in the Fischer-Tropsch pathway. Several regulatory bodies, such as the United States and the European Union, have created incentives for producing sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). We assume a global scale-up of SAF shares in the aviation sector as defined by the ReFuelEU Aviation38 (2% in 2025 up to 70% in 2050). Furthermore, we assume that in 2100, 100% of the jet fuel will have to be SAF. From 2050 to 2100, we will use a linear scale-up of these shares from 70% to 100%. As SAF are often produced with by-products in the middle distillate range, we assume that 39% of the SAF fuel volumes appear as road fuels (gasoline, diesel)36. These shares are then multiplied by the total SAF volumes that are derived by assuming aviation fuel demand to grow by 1.1–2.8% per year (lower end of the range: 1.1% annual growth until 2050 and no further growth; upper end of the range: 2.8% yearly growth until 2100; Fig. 6). In each of the three scenarios (BAU, MoR, Optimistic), the same availability of alternative fuels is applied, assuming aviation to be defossilized globally as announced by ReFuelEU Aviation38 irrespectively of the road fuel sector.

We use the maximum fuel production ramp-up rates from Dray et al.18 for biofuels and PtL fuels that cannot be exceeded. When biofuels reach their assumed maximum potential of 190 Mt/y of road fuels, no further growth is allowed, even though some reports indicate that further biomass potentials exist via the growth of lignocellulosic plants on marginal lands39,40,41,42. For PtL fuels, we do not assume a maximum potential as there is no fundamental limit to their production (assuming CO2 from DAC). Unless limited by the maximum biofuel potential, we assume the total road fuels to comprise 50% of biofuels and 50% of PtL fuels. Once the maximum production potential of 190 Mt/y for biofuels is reached, only the PtL fuels are assumed to be able to scale up further.

The transition to electric vehicles

The primary decarbonization strategy in the road transport sector is electrification43. Several countries and regions, such as the European Union, US states, Canada, and India, have announced a ban on internal combustion engines (ICE) until or before 204044. Combining EVs’ high efficiency with renewable electricity, the overall emissions of road-based transport could be brought to near zero (while already being locally emission-free). While many legislators recognize the long-term target, transitioning to electric vehicles requires a large-scale infrastructure adaptation, from establishing electricity generation, distribution, and transmission to local charging. This transition has already begun, but its completion will require time and large investments. Developing countries and remote regions will likely take more time in this process, and some sectors or regions may not be electrified at all. In this transitory phase, the fleet will comprise a growing share of electric vehicles and a remaining share of cars with internal combustion engines.

As the electrical grids are being decarbonized, the emissions of electric vehicles are also decreasing (towards zero for a fully renewable chain). In contrast, the emissions of ICEs depend on the fuel used. The emission reduction potential for fossil fuels is about 17% when all process steps in the supply chain are decarbonized45 while alternative fuels can decrease the emissions by 80–90% or even more46,47,48,49. The emissions from passenger cars and light-duty vehicles (LDV), therefore, depend on the speed of this transition (involving the generation of renewable electricity, electrical grids, EVs, and charging stations) and to which degree alternative fuels are used.

Figure 1 analyzes the transition to EVs based on renewable electricity availability and EV sales development in different regions. Three cases are defined: (i) a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, (ii) a middle-of-the-road (MoR) scenario, and (iii) an optimistic scenario. The scenarios’ sales shares50 and grid electricity emissions are based on the IEA scenarios for stated policies, sustainable development (compliant with the Paris climate goals), and the net-zero goal (limiting global warming to 1.5 °C), respectively. Additionally, we distinguish between developed and emerging countries29 because of their fundamentally differing underlying developments. While the markets in developed countries such as the US or most of the EU are saturated concerning the total number of vehicles, strongly growing economies such as China or India will experience significant growth in the vehicle fleet.

In developed countries, the sales share of EVs is projected to increase faster, mainly due to the higher available financial resources (both on a national and personal level) that allow to compensate for the higher cost of electric vehicles today. In the BAU scenario, the maximum EV sales share only reaches about 40%, leaving most of the future fleet composed of ICEs. In the MoR and optimistic cases, the sales shares of electric vehicles reach 80% or more, converting the fleet to mostly EVs by 2040.

The resulting emissions of the ICE fleet are already falling today, except for the BAU scenario in emerging countries (which see a significant increase and a plateau towards 2100), where the increasing number of ICE cars leads to still rising emissions. The emissions of EVs experience a peak in the 2030 s for developed countries and around 2040 for emerging countries. This behavior is explained by the quickly growing fleet of EVs on the one hand and the decreasing carbon intensity of the electricity grids (and production of vehicles and batteries) on the other. The emissions keep rising with the growing fleet of EVs until grid decarbonization overturns this dynamic. As this process happens faster in developed countries, the peak in EV emissions is seen in the 2030 s. Due to slower grid decarbonization, emerging countries peak in the 2040 s. The larger speed of electrification is also the reason why EV emissions are higher in the MoR (in emerging countries) or Optimistic scenarios (in developed countries) than in the BAU scenario. The different dynamics in electrification and grid decarbonization lead to the different order of scenarios in these two regions. In all scenarios and regions, the total emissions decrease from the BAU to the MoR and to the Optimistic scenario (see SI). These results agree with the findings of the IPCC AR6 WG III (Chapter 10)51, assuming similar emission reductions for the car and transport sectors (see SI for more information).

The scale of the problem

Most of the cumulative emissions are attributed to the ICEs in the fleet (remaining vehicles and newly registered ones, see Fig. 2). Figure 3 shows the cumulative emissions until the end of the century for the three scenarios broken down into vehicle type and time frame (today-2050 and 2051–2100). The emissions of the BAU scenario significantly exceed the carbon budget for all climate goals (1.5, 1.7, 2.0 °C): close to 300 Gt CO2-eq. are emitted until 2100, about two-thirds of which in the second half of the century. In this case, the largest share of emissions is due to the ICE fleet, which is decreasing in developed countries but increasing (although the respective sales share is decreasing) in emerging countries (see Supplementary Fig. 5 for more information). The yearly emissions drop insignificantly until the end of the century because the fleet increase in emerging countries compensates for the drop in emissions by electric vehicles, as can be seen clearly in the example of China (see emissions breakdown in Supplementary Fig. 5). In the MoR and Optimistic scenarios, the cumulative emissions stay below the two-degree budget but above the limit for a 1.5 °C-increase. The difference between the MoR and Optimistic scenarios is the latter’s faster and more extensive fleet electrification. This leads to a smaller ICE fleet and, thus, lower associated emissions, especially after 2050. If the ambitious electrification rates of these two scenarios can be reached, the Paris climate goal is achievable in the road-based transport sector. If, however, electrification should take a pace as in the BAU scenario or even slower, the climate goals are out of reach, and additional measures must be taken.

How do we reach the climate goals?

The road-based transport sector emits significant amounts of GHGs, which are not compliant with the climate goals in the business-as-usual case. A more considerable effort, including a diverse set of measures, may be required to limit emissions to a lower level in these cases. For each of the three scenarios, we analyze the effect of three measures to reach the climate goals (2.0, 1.7, 1.5 °C global warming until the end of the century).

Speed up current development—exclusively new electric cars

To avoid excessive emissions, a large ICE fleet using fossil fuels must be avoided, especially in the second half of the century. Thus, as a first measure, faster electrification is proposed—an obvious choice based on the projected emissions in the different scenarios (see emissions from ICEs and EVs in Fig. 3). We assume that from a given year on, only electric cars can be registered (Fig. 4). This goal has been set for 2035 in different regions of the world, i.e., the European Union and California, via a ban on conventional ICEs. Reaching this goal globally in 2035 would decrease the emissions significantly, especially in the BAU scenario, leading to lower cumulative emissions by about 270 Gt CO2-eq., until 2100. In the MoR and Optimistic scenarios, the reduction is still significant at about 50 Gt CO2-eq. These saved emissions are equivalent to moving the car sector by 0.7 °C or 0.1 °C closer (for the BAU or MoR/Optimistic scenarios) to its respective sector-related climate goals.

We find that the specific year of an ICE ban has only a minor influence on reaching the climate goals: even an ICE ban in 2050 would result in corresponding sector-specific emissions compatible with the Paris climate goals in all scenarios. Of course, an ICE ban presents a challenge, especially in emerging countries, where the electrical grid may not be adapted to the distributed loads, and there is a lack of charging infrastructure (including developing local grids). Likewise, countries with a distributed population may need help reaching full electrification soon due to the widespread infrastructure that must be implemented and EVs being most efficient in an urban environment. Nevertheless, it represents an effective instrument for reducing emissions, especially in the BAU scenario.

Limit car use globally—reduced fleet growth

The second proposed measure to reduce the emissions is a reduction of the fleet growth rate as projected by EIA12, which is used as a standard in all scenarios (Figs. 2, 4). In the EIA projection, the global car fleet is projected to grow from 1.4 billion today to about 2.2 billion in 205052. Significant growth is only expected in emerging countries, while the fleet size in developed countries is almost constant (Fig. 2). As a measure to reduce emissions, here we reduce the projected global growth by 0–100% and calculate cumulative emissions (Fig. 5). By continuing the projection, assuming a constant fleet size in developed countries after 2050 and gradually decreasing growth in emerging countries (by 2% annually, see), the global car fleet will reach 2.5 billion units at the end of the century. Limiting this growth rate reduces the number of vehicles without changing the projected electrification rate. This effectively cuts the number of newly registered cars, mainly affecting emerging countries with slower electrification rates. Consequently, the number of new ICEs entering the fleet is reduced, reducing the emissions. This effect is most significant in the BAU scenario, where the EV sales share reaches only 40% in emerging countries.

Use synergies in the system – alternative fuels as by-products from the aviation sector

Reducing emissions in the car sector does not necessarily require electrification. It can also be achieved by using alternative fuels with lower specific emissions than fossil fuels. Currently, these fuels are used in the car sector as either ethanol and biodiesel (mixed with gasoline and diesel) or in the aviation sector, where they are produced from plant oils and represent a core pillar of the defossilization strategy53. A significant volume increase in ethanol and biodiesel production would cause competition for land with food and fodder production and is likely of limited potential. As legislation in the EU and other regions requires rising shares of alternative fuels in aviation, the production volumes are expected to increase over the following decades. Various fuel pathways are being developed, using biological and non-biological carbon as a resource base to satisfy the demand. Most of these have in common that they are not selective, i.e., they not only produce jet fuel but a mix of different hydrocarbons, including gasoline54. It is likely that large amounts of gasoline as a by-product will become available from the aviation sector, which could help to reduce emissions in the automotive industry. To estimate these by-products’ amount, we assume that the required shares of alternative fuels in ReFuelEU Aviation38 (2% in 2025, rising to 70% in 2050) are reached globally, following the emission reduction goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 as suggested by IATA53. We use a fixed by-product share of 39% of road fuels concerning aviation fuel volumes36. Furthermore, aviation fuel burn is assumed to grow annually by 1.1–2.8%18, with growth estimates subject to large uncertainties. To cover a broad range of fuel demand in the aviation sector, we use a lower bound of 1.1% fuel demand growth until 2050 (and constant fuel demand after that) and an upper bound of 2.8% annual growth until 2100. The resulting by-product volumes are shown in Fig. 6, where we explicitly contrast the expected fuel production in these aviation growth scenarios with the theoretical maximum fuel production capacity18. While we do not further disaggregate techno-economic feasibility or policy risk, the upper and lower aviation growth bounds serve as a proxy for uncertainties in supply scale-up. We acknowledge that additional constraints—such as fuel selectivity, land use, and lifecycle emissions—could influence actual supply and identify these as areas for future analysis. A detailed treatment of land use and lifecycle emissions is beyond the scope of this paper. In the MoR and Optimistic scenarios, aviation by-products could cover the demand of the remaining ICE fleet in the 2050ies even for a slowly growing aviation sector. For a strong growth of aviation, even the remaining fuel demand in the BAU scenario could be covered towards the end of the century, where the expected fuel production from aviation does not exceed the capacities of expected maximum ramp-up rates of fuel production facilities18.

Assuming all the liquid by-products from aviation become available for road transport, significant emission reductions are achievable: in the BAU scenario, cumulative ICE emissions could decrease by 12–28% (49–115 Gt), by 23–42% (32–58 Gt) in the MoR, and by 31–33% (34–37 Gt) in the Optimistic scenario (Fig. 7). The overall impact on emissions is limited because of the time it takes to ramp up fuel production and the road-based transport sector’s larger fuel demand than the aviation sector’s supply. Assuming strong growth of the aviation sector (see SI for more information), the annual emissions of the car sector can be reduced by more than half towards the end of the century, irrespective of the scenario. Considering that alternative fuels will appear as by-products from this sector, their contribution towards reducing emissions in the car sector can thus be precious. A further reduction of ICE emissions would require larger volumes of by-products from, e.g., the shipping sector or through dedicated production (in the absence of demand-side measures). In this case, the maximum foreseeable output (Fig. 6, gray dotted) would cover the remaining fuel demand of the car sector in the 2040ies (for the MoR and Optimistic scenarios) or towards 2060 in the BAU scenario. Of course, the actual alternative fuel share will be determined by costs, which, in detail, exceeds the scope of this study.

For many people, personal road transport is an essential part of daily life and enables them to travel between families and communities or commute to work. It is also a significant source of global emissions, threatening to overburden the global ecosystem. Bringing our emissions to zero and maintaining our standard of living is one of the major challenges we face in this century. Accomplishing this task in the transport sector requires a global effort by switching to a renewable energy base. Considering the urgency and magnitude of the efforts and investments involved, a clear strategy for decarbonizing the car sector is required.

With the analysis above, we aim to quantify the effects of different pathways towards reducing emissions in the car sector. Below, the most important findings are summarized and discussed.

Emissions from the car sector represent a significant share of the total emissions and must be reduced to comply with climate goals

About 9.5% of global CO2 emissions are emitted by cars today55,56. If only stated policies are enacted, the cumulative emissions until 2100 will surpass the car sector’s share of the two-degree carbon budget. Additional efforts have thus to be made to reduce the emissions.

Emerging countries experience substantial growth in their car fleets, while developed countries have an almost constant number of vehicles

This is mainly due to the correlation between GDP and car ownership57, which leads to fleet growth occurring primarily in the large emerging economies of China, India, and Brazil. Therefore, an effective reduction of future emissions is tied to a strategy addressing both new registrations and existing cars in the fleet. A global effort to enable a quick transition to an electric vehicle infrastructure especially in the emerging economies could help to prevent the sale of a large number of ICE vehicles using conventional fuels.

Electrification is the most effective means of reducing new car’s emissions while maintaining equitable mobility

In most economies, EVs already achieve lower emissions than ICEs today. If electrification cannot be scaled up quickly, the car fleet will be composed of ICEs for a long time. To comply with the climate goals, these vehicles must be defossilized with alternative fuels. Otherwise, more drastic measures must be taken to limit global car sales or use. Because global fleet growth mainly happens in emerging economies, limiting car sales would hinder these economies’ growth. Considering that developed countries have contributed the most emissions to this day starting from the industrial revolution and the establishment of economies built on the conversion of coal and oil, this measure would be questionable to achieve an equitable distribution of efforts to prevent climate change. A more promising approach would be the establishment of an EV infrastructure in strongly growing countries to prevent the global growth of the ICE fleet. This could potentially happen via bilateral or global efforts including but not limited to a global emissions trading system that facilitates the financing of measures to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases where it is the most economical.

Alternative fuels are a suitable way to reduce the emissions of the remaining ICE fleet and are likely to be available in sufficient quantities as by-products from other sectors such as aviation

Alternative fuels are currently under development and can reduce specific emissions by more than 90%47. Sectors such as aviation and shipping depend on the continuous use of liquid fuels, which, together with regulatory decisions, will create a large market for alternative fuels. The production of these fuels is, in many pathways, not selective: by-products will be produced that could be used in the road transport sector to decrease the emissions of the remaining ICE fleet. For large-scale production, the costs of alternative fuels could drop to values below the market price of fossil fuels in most countries18,38,58,59,60. To establish a quick ramp-up of these production volumes, a global effort is required creating an (ideally unified) regulatory framework that allows to export alternative fuels to other markets and the necessary ecosystem to attract investments. To this end, a reliable and ambitious legislation ramping up the shares of alternative fuels and the creation of financial instruments to attract long-term investors needed to support the scale-up of the technology will be crucial.

The most effective strategy to reduce the car sector’s overall emissions relies on quick electrification and defossilization of the remaining ICE fleet with alternative fuels

As a global option for equitable and climate-friendly mobility, electrification requires renewable electricity and a large-scale charging infrastructure. This process will likely require decades to complete, and in the transitory phase, ICEs comprise a large fraction of the car fleet. The only way to defossilize these vehicles is by exchanging the fossil fuel by a renewable one. Alternative fuels can effectively reduce the emissions of the remaining fleet of ICEs at potentially competitive cost if produced at scale and if synergies with other sectors (aviation, shipping) are leveraged. With this strategy, new electric vehicles and the remaining ICEs can be addressed, and the automotive sector’s total emissions can be reduced most effectively. To this end, regulation should address this challenge with a technologically open but ambitious framework that allows the defossilization of vehicles with either electrification or alternative fuels and that accounts reliably and transparently the emissions created in either case. This will open a long-term perspective for investors required to finance the scale-up and establishment of infrastructures of both technologies. In the end, there is no need to be on the fence.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs44333-025-00051-7/MediaObjects/44333_2025_51_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-09-01 01:58:29.911006

But the Missouri National Guard unit I was embedded with didn’t know any of this on its convoy to New Orleans.
Some leaders in Kansas City, Missouri, are worried their city may be next.
“I do think Kansas City should be prepared, because this will probably happen to us,” said Kansas City Democrat Barbara Washington, as reported by the Kansas City Star.
All I have is my experience with that Missouri National Guard military police company a generation ago.","In 2005, as a reporter embedded with a Missouri National Guard unit in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, I witnessed one of the largest disaster relief operations in American history.

On the ground with the men and women of a Missouri Guard military police company, I was far removed from the decisions — and the blunders — that would ultimately mar the massive rescue effort. Instead, I saw firsthand how average Americans coped with the hardships and uncertainty of being thrown into a situation without precedent.

It was dirty and messy, and the outcome was uncertain. I ate MREs with the Guardsmen and chatted about their families and listened to concerns about their Constitutional duties as soldiers.

Now, the National Guard is on the streets of the District of Columbia, with live ammunition, summoned by President Donald Trump to assist in a hastily declared and thinly supported law enforcement mission. Trump is also considering other Democratic stronghold cities for such deployments, including Chicago and New York.

The contrast between the deployments could not be sharper.

Twenty years ago, the National Guard was called up in the thousands for a devastating national disaster. Today, the Guard is in DC on a partisan mission that breaks political norms. If Trump federalizes the Guard and sends it to other cities, it would likely violate the Posse Comitatus Act, a foundational 1878 law meant to limit the use of federal troops in law enforcement on American soil.

The storm that struck New Orleans on Aug. 29, 2005, was devastating. In addition to winds in excess of 100 mph that turned roofs into sails and toppled walls, Katrina also brought a surge of water that overwhelmed levees and flood walls and submerged 80% of the city. A citywide evacuation had been ordered, but some residents stayed, including many from the poorer sections of the city who didn’t have anywhere else to go. Thirty thousand people spent days in the shelter of last resort, the Louisiana Superdome, without lights or air conditioning, food or water, or functioning restrooms. Misery was widespread across the city, especially in the Lower Ninth Ward, a historically Black section of the city that experienced catastrophic flooding.

The hurricane left 1,800 people dead in New Orleans and across the Gulf coast and displaced more than a million. Katrina was also the costliest storm on record, with damage estimated at $161 billion.

But the Missouri National Guard unit I was embedded with didn’t know any of this on its convoy to New Orleans. When the soldiers of the 1138th Military Police piled into their Humvees and trucks at company headquarters at West Plains, Missouri, they had about as much information (or rather, misinformation) about the situation on the Gulf as did anyone who had been paying attention to the news. They expected out-of-control looting and general lawlessness. But the reports of looting were exaggerated and the most lawless element was among the New Orleans police, who shot 10 civilians, including four fatally.

Katrina showed how crucial federal funding is after a disaster. How much will remain?

Because I was with the Missouri National Guard unit every hour of every day on the convoy south, I knew what they were talking about. There were earnest discussions among the soldiers about what they would do if ordered to fire on American citizens for looting, and the consensus was that they would refuse. What looked like looting to one individual might just be survival. Somebody might be carrying a television to trade for food and water. Above all, they wanted to help people in need, by effecting rescues or bringing much-needed supplies.

Later, as I walked the French Quarter, I noted maroon-bereted 82nd Airborne soldiers on patrol with automatic rifles at hand. This was a disturbing sight in an American city, one that brought to mind third-world countries. But this was no banana republic. This was New Orleans in distress, and some regular Army troops, in addition to National Guard units from all 50 states, had been sent to help.

The National Guard has been deployed on American soil periodically for disaster relief or to assist local authorities with civil unrest. The latter includes the George Floyd protests in 2020, the LA riots of 1992, and at Kent State.

On May 4, 1970, members of the Ohio National Guard fired into a crowd of Vietnam war protestors on the Kent State University campus, killing four students. A photograph of one of the dead students, with a girl kneeling and crying out for help behind, shook the soul of America — and won the Pulitzer Prize.

The Ohio Guard had been sent to the campus by Gov. Jim Rhodes, at the request of the Kent mayor, after the ROTC building had been burned to the ground the previous night. The Guard, with bayonets fixed, was attempting to disperse a crowd of 2,000 demonstrators. The students threw rocks, and the soldiers responded with tear gas. Then, in the space of 13 seconds, the Guardsmen fired more than 60 shots at demonstrators.

It is unclear why the soldiers took kneeling positions and opened fire, although one of the survivors said there is audio tape evidence of the command being given. Eight Ohio Guardsmen were acquitted in 1974 after a judge declared, after a two-week trial, that the government had presented insufficient evidence to support the federal indictments.

The National Guard is generally exempt from the Posse Comitatus Act, as it is normally under the control of state governors, but it becomes subject when it is called up under federal service. The District of Columbia is a special case, because the district is under control of Congress and the president is, in effect, the governor of the district.

If Trump were to deploy the Guard elsewhere, there would be a host of legal challenges. But he has already demonstrated his willingness to expand the use of the military on U.S. soil, as his administration has authorized the Guard to be deployed to assist with “alien processing” in 20 states with Republican governors. The states with Democratic governors, including Kansas, would no doubt object.

Katrina alters local health care landscape, though underlying ills still the same

The militarization of immigration and law enforcement is disturbing. Trump is using it to punish jurisdictions that are Democratic strongholds, many of which have significant Black populations, and others that are hotbeds of dissent. His official justifications don’t pass the litmus test of truth. He claimed to deploy the Guard in D.C. to fight crime, despite violent crime there hitting a 30-year low, according to the Department of Justice.

Some leaders in Kansas City, Missouri, are worried their city may be next.

“I do think Kansas City should be prepared, because this will probably happen to us,” said Kansas City Democrat Barbara Washington, as reported by the Kansas City Star. “I think the actions of our president have shown that he is not open to equality for people of color.”

While other politicians doubt Trump will take interest in any city in a state as deeply red as Missouri, some worry the high crime rates of Kansas City and St. Louis may be enough of an excuse. Kansas, where 101 out of 105 counties went for Trump in 2024, may be relatively safe. Well, except for the city of Lawrence, which might just be blue enough to attract the president’s dictatorial gaze; it went for Kamala Harris by a margin of more than 2-1.

In D.C., the 2,200 Guard members have spent the past week mulching cherry trees and clearing homeless camps. That would be in keeping with Trump’s obsession with the value of real estate and his disregard for human life. But the true goal of the deployment appears to be a further test of just how much the American public will take before standing up to authoritarianism. Congress and the Supreme Court have repeatedly demonstrated their loyalty to Trump, so ultimately any change must come from the ballot box.

In the seven months Trump has been in power, he has upended convention and pursued an unchecked appetite for power. The American landscape has been transformed into a terrain fit for a dictator, with ever-expanding executive power, a masked secret cadre of ICE agents pursuing migrants and sometimes citizens, a crackdown on diversity and dissent, and the growing presence of an armed military in our cities.

How long will it be before there’s another 13 seconds in which the National Guard faces off against unarmed protestors and in the chaos leaves one or more “dead on the ground?” This is something Trump may be actually hoping for, because any act of violence serves as an excuse to call out more troops. And more troops means more intimidation, more control, more power.

Trump is building a case for martial law through a series of immigration and law enforcement “emergencies,” but only for those blue cities he’d like to punish or neutralize. Chicago, New York, Baltimore. It would only be a small step from there to declaring an election emergency. He wouldn’t have to cancel or postpone the 2026 midterms. Just the presence of armed troops at polling places to ensure a “fair” election might discourage enough voters to do the trick. He’s already vowed to end mail-in voting, an anti-democracy pledge that would have sunk any other president quicker than you can say Watergate.

Since Katrina, infrastructure shortcomings create resiliency fatigue

I don’t know what the National Guard troops deployed in D.C. are thinking, or what those who might be tasked with “alien processing” feel about it. All I have is my experience with that Missouri National Guard military police company a generation ago. But based on that, I suspect directing the Guard to deprive American citizens of their civil liberties might be more difficult than Trump thinks. Many will remember their oath is to the Constitution, not to any president or ideology.

Recently, the Trump administration placed on leave some 30 Federal Emergency Management Agency employees who signed an open letter warning of a Katrina-level disaster because of agency mismanagement. The Trump-appointed leadership, the letter said, was simply too inexperienced and too partisan to do their jobs.

The letter cited the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006, which exposed the federal government’s failures to prepare for disasters and deliver aid quickly.

There will never be another Hurricane Katrina.

But that’s only because the World Meteorological Organization retired the name after 2005. There will be other storms, equal to or worse than Katrina, and Trump administration ignores the signatories of the warning letter at our peril.

We find ourself in an age of storms.

To survive the current political hurricane, we must find the courage to stand up to political bullying, be guided by reason but moved by compassion, and be willing to help those among us who are in the most danger of being washed away.

The situation is without precedent.

Never before, not even during Watergate, has a U.S. president engaged in such an authoritarian power grab. If we were faced with one or two crises at a time, then it would be easier to know how to respond. But the entire federal government has been turned inside out and made the political instrument of one man. From the dismantling of the intelligence community to the purging of scientific integrity at public health and disaster response agencies, from the war on migrants to the squelching of dissent on college campuses, and now to the use of the military in law enforcement, the house Abraham Lincoln referred to in his 1858 speech is not just divided, but on fire.

“I want to speak plainly about the moment that we are in, and the actual crisis, not the manufactured one, that we are facing in this city, and as a state, and as a country,” Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, said Aug. 25 in Chicago. “If it sounds to you like I am alarmed, that is because I am ringing an alarm, one that I hope every person listening will heed.”

The odds that either of the Kansas Cities or Lawrence or any other blue dot in a red state will be targeted right now is low, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t respond to Pritzker’s tocsin. It will be dirty and messy, the outcome will be uncertain, and there will be a lot of talk about civil disobedience and our Constitutional obligations as citizens. We are beyond the guardrails of a two-party system and are now facing a party of one with ever-expanding executive power. It’s time for us to talk, at our kitchen tables and taverns and community centers, and decide what orders we’ll follow — and what kind of nation we want.

Natural gas is primarily methane, and leaks in pipelines can lead to serious environmental issues.
Furthermore, while it is cleaner than coal or oil, natural gas still produces both carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.","The Donald Trump-appointed head of the Environmental Protection Agency has proposed a new natural gas pipeline in the Northeastern United States, despite criticism from myriad experts on the matter.

What's happening?

According to Canary Media, EPA Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin is advocating for the construction of the Constitution pipeline, which would transport natural gas from Pennsylvania into New York, citing the potential to save New Englanders money on their energy bills.

The pipeline was a long-shuttered project, proposed by energy development company Williams in 2014. In 2016, the state of New York rejected the proposal's water quality certification. The project was ultimately scrapped in 2020 after prolonged legal challenges but was resurrected in May after New York Governor Kathy Hochul reached a deal with the Trump Administration for an offshore wind platform, in return for relaxing the state's restrictions on new gas pipelines.

Enter Zeldin, who touts the new pipeline as a means to lower energy costs in the Northeast by bringing more natural gas to the region's power plants.

Why is this pipeline important?

There's just one problem with Zeldin's argument: Experts say it isn't true. Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association, stated that the Constitution pipeline will not solve the region's insufficient natural gas supply problem.

""I am not aware of any large-scale gas supply projects into New England today,"" Dolan told Canary Media. ​""Until there is a way to increase that, I struggle to see how Constitution changes anything meaningful for us.""

Additionally, many Northeastern states are transitioning away from natural gas toward other forms of power generation.

""There certainly is an increasing demand for energy, particularly electricity,"" said Jeremy McDiarmid, managing director and general counsel for Advanced Energy United, per Canary Media. ​""But the narrative that natural gas is going to somehow create a big downward pressure on electricity and energy bills is just not proven out in the data.""

While natural gas isn't responsible for the kind of carbon pollution that coal or petroleum power plants are, it does produce its own forms of planet-heating pollution. Natural gas is primarily methane, and leaks in pipelines can lead to serious environmental issues. Furthermore, while it is cleaner than coal or oil, natural gas still produces both carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.

What's being done about the pipeline?

It's unclear what the pipeline's future is at this point, despite the administration's stance on it. The state of New York would still need to approve water quality permits before construction could begin.

In the meantime, experts say that a more effective strategy than building more pipelines would be to construct a more diverse system that is less reliant on natural gas.

In our daily lives, we can help reduce energy usage by switching to energy-efficient appliances and unplugging energy-hungry devices when they're not in use.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Constitution-pipelineimage-recUBQKqz4bolojxx.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 04:02:17.727328

Renault, meanwhile, saw a 2.9% global sales increase in Q1 2025, with electrified vehicles accounting for 44.2% of European sales [8].
Investment Opportunities The transition to electrified vehicles offers three key entry points: 1.","France’s automotive market is undergoing a seismic shift as electrified and hybrid vehicles displace internal combustion engines (ICE). By July 2025, battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) accounted for 16.8% of new car registrations, up 3.3 percentage points from July 2024, while hybrids captured 45.7% of the market, driven by full and mild hybrids [1]. Together, electrified vehicles now hold a 69.7% share, a stark contrast to ICE vehicles’ 27.3% [2]. This transition creates clear investment opportunities in automakers and suppliers positioned to capitalize on the shift.

Market Dynamics: Hybrid Dominance and BEV Resilience

Hybrids have emerged as the bridge between ICE and full electrification. Their 45.7% market share in July 2025 reflects consumer pragmatism—combining fuel efficiency with range flexibility [1]. Meanwhile, BEVs, though facing a 4.3% year-to-date decline in registrations compared to 2024, remain resilient. The Renault 5 E-Tech, for instance, dominated the BEV segment in France, selling 2,813 units in January 2025 and maintaining strong corporate fleet demand, which grew 70% year-on-year [3]. This resilience is bolstered by government incentives, including a revised ecological bonus and a social leasing program set to launch in September 2025 [4].

Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), however, face headwinds. Their market share fell to 7.2% in July 2025, down from 8.2% in July 2024, as consumers increasingly opt for either BEVs or conventional hybrids [1]. This trend underscores the importance of automakers like Renault and Stellantis, which are pivoting toward BEV-native platforms and affordable hybrids.

Strategic Automakers: Renault and Stellantis

Renault’s electrification strategy is a standout. The Renault 5 E-Tech has sold nearly 49,000 units since its 2025 launch, contributing to a 44% electrified vehicle share in Europe [5]. The company’s focus on B-segment EVs and hybrid models, coupled with global expansion in markets like South Korea, positions it as a key player. Similarly, Stellantis is leveraging its multi-energy platform strategy, with affordable models like the Fiat Grande Panda and Citroën e-C3 targeting a projected 18% EV market share in 2025 [6]. Its Atlante charging network and partnerships with European charge point operators further solidify its infrastructure advantage.

Financially, both automakers are navigating challenges. Stellantis reported a 14% revenue drop in Q1 2025 due to lower shipment volumes, but its hybrid market share rose to 15.5%, and BEV share hit 13% [7]. Renault, meanwhile, saw a 2.9% global sales increase in Q1 2025, with electrified vehicles accounting for 44.2% of European sales [8]. These figures highlight their ability to adapt to shifting demand.

Suppliers and Infrastructure: The Hidden Levers

While automakers grab headlines, suppliers like Bosch, Continental, and ZF are critical to France’s electrification. Though specific contracts in France are not detailed, these firms dominate the European EV ecosystem, supplying components such as batteries, power electronics, and optimized tires for commercial fleets [9]. For example, Continental’s white paper on electric mobility emphasizes tire solutions to reduce CO₂ emissions in electrified commercial vehicles [10].

Infrastructure investments are equally vital. France’s “battery valley” in Hauts-de-France, anchored by gigafactories from Automotive Cells Company and Verkor, aims for self-sufficiency in battery production by 2027 [11]. Meanwhile, Milence’s electric freight corridor from Barcelona to Lyon exemplifies the expansion of charging networks, supported by €1.5 billion in subsidies and a 45% investment tax credit [12]. These developments create tailwinds for suppliers and automakers alike.

Investment Opportunities

The transition to electrified vehicles offers three key entry points:

1. Automakers with strong BEV and hybrid portfolios: Renault and Stellantis are well-positioned, with Renault’s focus on affordability and Stellantis’ multi-energy platforms.

2. Suppliers in the EV value chain: Bosch and Continental’s roles in components and infrastructure provide recurring revenue streams.

3. Infrastructure developers: Companies expanding charging networks or battery production, such as Milence and ProLogium, benefit from government incentives.

However, risks persist. Consumer hesitation in H1 2025 led to a 6.4% drop in EV registrations, though this is expected to reverse with the social leasing program’s return [13]. Investors must also monitor PHEV declines and the pace of ICE phaseouts.

Conclusion

France’s automotive market is a microcosm of the global shift to electrification. While hybrids dominate today, BEVs and infrastructure investments are the long-term drivers. Automakers like Renault and Stellantis, alongside suppliers and infrastructure players, offer compelling opportunities for investors willing to navigate the transition’s complexities.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-01 02:01:48.172603

As of Monday, Sept. 1, Texas will have a whopping 835 new laws on the books.

These measures touch nearly every aspect of life, from education and healthcare to public safety, property rules and support for first responders. With so many changes coming at once, Texans can expect a variety of noticeable impacts on their daily lives, plus shifts in how some state agencies operate.

To catch you up ahead of the big day, The Texas Newsroom and partner stations across the state have broken down some of the most significant measures below — plus other noteworthy new laws you may not have heard about yet.

Restrictions on Texas land purchases for certain foreign-linked people

Senate Bill 17 bars individuals, companies and government-affiliated entities with ties to China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from buying most Texas real estate, including homes, commercial property and farmland.

Visa holders from those nations may purchase one residence to live in, but no additional properties. Violations carry criminal penalties for individuals and steep civil fines for companies. A lawsuit challenging the law is pending at the 5th U.S Circuit Court of Appeals.

Texas bans THC vapes and foreign-made e-cigarettes

Senate Bill 2024 makes it illegal to sell or advertise certain e-cigarettes, including those containing THC, kratom, kava, alcohol or mushrooms.

The law also bans e-cigarettes made in China and other designated foreign countries and expands the definition of e-cigarettes to include non-nicotine vapes. Additionally, SB 2024 restricts products that appeal to minors, such as those resembling food, school supplies, or cartoons.

Smoke shop owners across the state are already adjusting their inventories to comply. Of note: The law is separate from the ongoing debate in Texas over broader THC regulation.

‘Make Texas healthy again’

Senate Bill 25, known as the “Make Texas Healthy Again” law, requires medical schools to teach nutrition and adds new continuing education requirements for physicians. It also bars schools from taking away recess as punishment for younger students.

Starting in 2027, many processed foods with additives must carry a warning label stating the ingredient is not recommended for human consumption by a number of regulators. Supporters say the change will give Texans clearer information about food safety, while critics warn it could confuse shoppers or face legal challenges.

Texas to ban student DEI and LGBTQ+ clubs

Senate Bill 12 prohibits K-12 student organizations based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The law also expands parental oversight, granting access to students’ curriculum, mental and physical health records and requiring schools to notify parents when students request a nickname or different pronouns. Non-compliance by teachers may result in disciplinary action.

Critics warn the law strips much-needed support from LGBTQ+ youth, while supporters say it preserves parental rights and ends “woke DEI indoctrination.”

$1.5 Billion in funds for Texas’ film incentive program

Senate Bill 22 invests $1.5 billion in the Texas Moving Image Industry Program to attract film, TV shows, commercials, animation and video game production to the state.

The program has operated for nearly 20 years, but its budget was previously debated each session. Now, $300 million will be guaranteed every two years through 2035. Projects starting after Sept. 1 can apply for rebates of up to 31% of qualified in-state spending.

A coordinated campaign by Texas filmmakers and actors, like Matthew McConaughey and Taylor Sheridan, helped secure this legislative win by testifying at the Texas Capitol.

Patients to receive some test results on a delayed schedule

Senate Bill 922 delays the electronic release of certain medical test results for up to three days, giving doctors time to explain results to patients.

Previously, results for serious conditions — such as cancer or genetic diseases — were released immediately, sometimes leaving patients to receive life-changing information without guidance. Supporters say the change helps patients understand results in context.

Peer support network for first responders

House Bill 35 establishes a statewide peer support network for firefighters and EMS personnel. Modeled after a law enforcement program credited with reducing Texas police suicides, the network will connect first responders with confidential, peer-to-peer mental health support.

Advocates say the program could provide a vital lifeline for those coping with the stress and trauma of emergency work.

While the new law creating the support network goes into effect on Sept. 1, it’ll take a few months to ramp up: The program’s official launch isn’t expected until March 2026.

In the meantime, the state has filled in the gap by opening up its law enforcement peer support network to first responders — especially those involved in rescue and recovery efforts around July’s historic flooding.

New penalties for assaulting utility workers

Senate Bill 482 will increase penalties for assaulting utility workers, making it a third-degree felony and raising harassment to a Class A misdemeanor if the incident occurs while the worker is on duty.

Sponsored by Houston Sen. Carol Alvarado, the bipartisan measure was prompted by threats faced by utility crews restoring power after Hurricane Beryl.

“Despite these risks, utility workers remained on the front lines ensuring access to electricity, gas and telecommunications,” Alvarado said. “These changes ensure that utility workers receive the same level protection as other emergency personnel during times of crisis.”

The law covers workers in electricity, gas, telecommunications and pipeline industries and aims to give them the same protections as other emergency personnel.

Statewide alert system for agricultural and wildlife threats

House Bill 1592 will create a new statewide system that’ll centralize alerts about pests and diseases that threaten Texas plants and wildlife.

Right now, updates come from several state agencies, but under HB 1592 they’ll be compiled and managed online by the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Agency. Texans will also be able to sign up for electronic notifications.

Supporters say the change will help farmers and ranchers respond faster to invasive species — like the emerald ash borer, citrus psyllid and New World screwworms — which pose growing risks due to climate change and global trade.

Higher stakes for educators over ‘harmful materials’

Senate Bill 412 limits legal protections for teachers, librarians, medical professionals, and parents providing material deemed harmful to minors.

For decades, an “affirmative defense” protected those using such material for educational, scientific, medical, government or legislative purposes — but starting Sept. 1, that protection will no longer apply to educators or other non-officials, leaving it only for judges and law enforcement.

Supporters say the change closes a decades-old loophole, while critics warn it could drive self-censorship and limit access to legitimate educational content, including LGBTQ+, racial and sexual health materials.

Cities banned from using funds to assist with abortion access

Senate Bill 33 restricts local governments from using public funds to support women seeking abortions. It specifies that taxpayer money may not be given to either abortion providers or funds that assist with out-of-state abortion access. It also bans public funds from being used to offer help with child care, travel, lodging or other types of “logistical support” for abortion seekers.

Texas cities including Austin and San Antonio had previously set aside money to support organizations or individuals seeking out-of-state abortion care. Both cities attracted lawsuits from Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argued that the funds violated the Texas Constitution, as well as the state’s abortion bans.

Texas boosts resources for volunteer firefighters

Senate Bill 34 is designed to help rural and volunteer firefighters respond more effectively to wildfires. The law, prompted by the 2024 Panhandle fires that burned over a million acres, creates a statewide database of firefighting equipment to improve coordination and air support.

It also increases state funding for volunteer firefighters in areas the forest service identifies as high risk. Sen. Kevin Sparks, a Midland Republican who authored the law, said it addresses gaps that hindered response times during last year’s disasters.

“Despite the heroic efforts of the volunteer firefighters, response times were hindered by a lack of timely air support, poor communication between agencies and responders, largely due to incompatible equipment,” Sparks said earlier this year.

The IRS update applies to various types of electric vehicles, including used, new, and leased EVs, aligning with specific sections of the tax code.
In addition to the extended timeline for the tax credit, consumers have the option to receive the benefits as an instant rebate at the point of sale.
Notably, this instant rebate option allows consumers without a tax liability to also benefit from the credit.
As the deadline approaches, consumers are encouraged to explore their options and act accordingly to maximize the financial incentives available for their electric vehicle purchases.","A significant change in federal tax incentives for electric vehicle (EV) buyers is on the horizon, as consumers prepare for the impending expiration of tax credits valued at up to $7,500 after September 30. However, a recent update from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) suggests that there may still be options available for consumers looking to take advantage of these credits.

The tax breaks, which were eliminated as part of a Republican tax and spending measure passed in July, stipulate that the eligibility for a tax credit is contingent on the point at which the vehicle is “acquired.” Initial interpretations indicated that consumers needed to have the vehicle physically in their possession by the cutoff date. However, the IRS clarified that consumers can still qualify for the tax credit if they have a “written binding contract” in place and make a payment on or before September 30, regardless of when they take possession of the EV.

Ingrid Malmgren, senior policy director at Plug In America, emphasized that this IRS clarification provides a glimmer of hope for consumers who may not be able to drive off in their new vehicles by the deadline. “This means that if you can’t drive off in the clean vehicle of your dreams by Sept. 30, there is still hope,” she remarked.

The IRS update applies to various types of electric vehicles, including used, new, and leased EVs, aligning with specific sections of the tax code. Malmgren noted that consumers can secure their vehicles by ordering from a dealer or manufacturer, signing a contract, and making a deposit ahead of the deadline, with the further stipulation that the vehicle also meets certain eligibility criteria.

In addition to the extended timeline for the tax credit, consumers have the option to receive the benefits as an instant rebate at the point of sale. This provides the advantage of accessing funds more quickly without needing to wait until filing their annual tax return. Notably, this instant rebate option allows consumers without a tax liability to also benefit from the credit.

To ensure proper processing, taxpayers are advised to obtain a time-of-sale report from the dealer when they take possession of their EV or within three days following the pickup. This step is crucial to secure the tax benefits associated with the transaction.

Catalysts

About Sibanye Stillwater

Operates as a precious metals mining company in South Africa, the United States, Europe, and Australia.

What are the underlying business or industry changes driving this perspective?

Technological innovation and the rapid global adoption of battery electric vehicles are accelerating the substitution of platinum group metals, particularly palladium and platinum, in catalytic converters. This will likely erode Sibanye Stillwater's core PGM revenue and long-term earnings, as evidenced by downward revisions to light-duty vehicle and battery electric vehicle production forecasts.

Intensifying environmental regulations and increasing global expectations on sustainability are translating into higher compliance and remediation costs. This will raise recurring operational expenditure, compressing net margins and putting pressure on the company's ability to maintain profitability, especially in its South African and French operations which already face headcount and ramp-down challenges.

Persistent operational instability in South Africa, including labor unrest, safety incidents, aging mine infrastructure, and seismicity-induced stoppages, continues to threaten consistent production. This undermines revenue predictability and increases the risk of costly supply disruptions-which were highlighted by disappointing gold production and guidance cuts.

Excess supply and depressed near

and medium-term lithium prices have resulted in significant impairments and will continue to hinder the ramp-up and returns from new mining projects such as Keliber, placing long-term pressure on both Sibanye Stillwater's earnings resilience and its efforts to diversify away from PGMs.

Supply chain risks, rising resource nationalism, and tightening tax/regulatory regimes-particularly in South Africa, Zimbabwe, and potentially the U.S.-are likely to increase royalties and taxes over time and elevate expropriation risk. This will curtail after-tax returns and may necessitate further capital-intensive investments, restricting free cash flow and value creation for shareholders.

Sibanye Stillwater Future Earnings and Revenue Growth

Assumptions

How have these above catalysts been quantified?

This narrative explores a more pessimistic perspective on Sibanye Stillwater compared to the consensus, based on a Fair Value that aligns with the bearish cohort of analysts.

The bearish analysts are assuming Sibanye Stillwater's revenue will decrease by 0.1% annually over the next 3 years.

The bearish analysts assume that profit margins will increase from -3.2% today to 8.8% in 3 years time.

The bearish analysts expect earnings to reach ZAR 9.9 billion (and earnings per share of ZAR 3.47) by about August 2028, up from ZAR -3.6 billion today. The analysts are largely in agreement about this estimate.

In order for the above numbers to justify the price target of the more bearish analyst cohort, the company would need to trade at a PE ratio of 9.5x on those 2028 earnings, up from -26.6x today. This future PE is lower than the current PE for the US Metals and Mining industry at 12.9x.

Analysts expect the number of shares outstanding to remain consistent over the next 3 years.

To value all of this in today's terms, we will use a discount rate of 19.34%, as per the Simply Wall St company report.

Sibanye Stillwater Future Earnings Per Share Growth

Risks

What could happen that would invalidate this narrative?

The ongoing energy transition and electrification trends are expected to drive robust long-term demand for battery metals like lithium, nickel, and copper, as well as platinum group metals, supporting Sibanye Stillwater's future revenue growth and insulating earnings from a potential decline in commodity prices.

Strategic diversification into recycling, battery metals, and circular economy assets positions Sibanye Stillwater to benefit from increased sustainability requirements and supply chain localization for critical minerals, which could enhance revenue stability and support profit margins.

Operational efficiency improvements, restructuring, and mechanization projects in both South Africa and the U.S. have already led to reduced costs and increased margins, and continuing investment in such initiatives could sustainably raise net margins and earnings.

Recovery in PGM prices and anticipated supply deficits in both primary and secondary PGM markets after 2026, alongside disciplined cost management, create a favorable environment for stronger long-term EBITDA and free cash flow.

The company's strong balance sheet, improved liquidity position, and conservative capital allocation-alongside access to tax credits (such as the U.S. Section 45X credits) and government grants-reduce financial risk and could allow for renewed dividend payments and further investment, bolstering both revenue and profit prospects.

Valuation

How have all the factors above been brought together to estimate a fair value?

The assumed bearish price target for Sibanye Stillwater is ZAR19.5, which represents the lowest price target estimate amongst analysts. This valuation is based on what can be assumed as the expectations of Sibanye Stillwater's future earnings growth, profit margins and other risk factors from analysts on the more bearish end of the spectrum.

However, there is a degree of disagreement amongst analysts, with the most bullish reporting a price target of ZAR50.0, and the most bearish reporting a price target of just ZAR19.5.

In order for you to agree with the bearish analysts, you'd need to believe that by 2028, revenues will be ZAR112.2 billion, earnings will come to ZAR9.9 billion, and it would be trading on a PE ratio of 9.5x, assuming you use a discount rate of 19.3%.

Given the current share price of ZAR33.34, the bearish analyst price target of ZAR19.5 is 71.0% lower. Despite analysts expecting the underlying buisness to improve, they seem to believe the market's expectations are too high.

We always encourage you to reach your own conclusions though. So sense check these analyst numbers against your own assumptions and expectations based on your understanding of the business and what you believe is probable.

During the meeting, Awad emphasized that the Central Department for Climate Change plays a pivotal role in advancing Egypt’s climate commitments and strengthening coordination with both domestic and international partners. She underscored the urgency of equipping climate units across government ministries with the necessary training to accelerate the implementation of climate adaptation and mitigation measures.

The Ministry of Environment presented an assessment report evaluating how various ministries are addressing climate change. The report also introduced a guiding framework to help institutions align their sectoral action plans with Egypt’s National Climate Change Strategy 2050. In parallel, the ministry has begun developing an adaptation framework for the governorates of Qena and Kafr El-Sheikh, in partnership with Germany’s GIZ.

Ali Abu Senna, head of the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, noted that the ministry is currently digitizing its monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) system to track greenhouse gas emissions across key sectors including energy, agriculture, industry, and waste. The system also monitors climate adaptation and mitigation efforts, while documenting extreme weather events—such as heatwaves, cold spells, and unseasonal rainfall—and their impacts on vulnerable sectors, particularly agriculture.

Sharif Abdel Rahim, Assistant to the Minister for Climate Policy, highlighted the significance of Egypt’s interactive climate risk map. This tool identifies areas most vulnerable to climate risks and serves as a critical input for development planning. He reaffirmed Egypt’s commitment to its international climate obligations and the implementation of its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

Soha Taher, Head of the Central Department for Climate Change, outlined several key donor-supported initiatives currently underway. These include the EU-funded “EU Green” programme, the French Development Agency–backed Transformation of Financial Systems for Climate in Egypt project, and the ongoing preparation of Egypt’s first Biennial Transparency Report (1BTR) and Fifth National Communication (5NC) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, supported by the Global Environment Facility.

Egypt has thus far submitted three National Communications, in 1999, 2010, and 2016, and a Biennial Update Report in 2019. A fourth National Communication is currently under preparation.

The meetings took place on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Plus summit in Tianjin, which Madbouly is attending on behalf of Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi.

WATER DESALINATION AND ENERGY

Madbouly met with Qingyun Kong, president of Jiangsu Feng-hai New Energy Desalination Development, a company recommended by Chinese President Xi Jinping during their meeting on Saturday. The prime minister said Egypt is seeking to localise the manufacturing of components for desalination plants and aims to produce 10 million cubic metres of desalinated water per day in the next five to six years.

In a separate meeting with Ni Chen, chairperson of China Energy Engineering Corporation, Madbouly reiterated the 10 million cubic metre daily target and said Egypt’s future goal is to raise production to 30 million cubic metres per day.

The head of China Energy said his company intends to invest in seawater desalination and is in consultations with Egypt’s electricity ministry on cooperation in power generation. He added that the company plans to invest $1 billion in Egypt over the next five years and has moved its regional headquarters to Cairo, reflecting its confidence in the Egyptian market.

Madbouly also discussed Egypt’s goal of producing 42% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030 and its interest in energy storage. He invited the company to help localise renewable energy components, noting Egypt’s annual demand of 5-6 gigawatts, in addition to demand for energy exports to Europe.

SUEZ CANAL ECONOMIC ZONE

The prime minister also met with Zhu Di Fu, chairperson of the Chinese holding company TEDA, the industrial developer of the China-Egypt TEDA Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone.

Madbouly expressed his appreciation for TEDA’s successful model in attracting investment and said the development of the TEDA zone is a priority for the Egyptian government. He noted that an additional area would be allocated to the company within the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE).

“We look forward to attracting Chinese companies to work in the zone, especially in sectors that include renewable energy industries, electric vehicles, and their batteries,” Madbouly said, adding that he hopes the zone will also drive investment in water desalination.

The TEDA chairperson said that after ten years of operation in Egypt, the company has attracted 200 companies, injected $3bn in investments, paid $300m in taxes, and employed more than 10,000 workers.",https://images.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/08/542078839_1325783472925403_2565266915604912364_n.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 22:58:56.846955

With an expected completion date in the first half of 2027, Pampa Fidelia will supply enough energy to power 300,000 homes.

Juan Villavicencio, managing director of renewables and batteries at ENGIE Chile, noted the significant capabilities of renewable energy in Chile.

""In 2025 alone, we managed to connect 468 MW of green energy to the country's energy matrix, and today we are happy to celebrate this great achievement for our company, as well as for Chile,"" Villavicencio said.

As a major energy resource, wind farms are able to offer significant environmental benefits by providing a clean, renewable, and sustainable source of electricity while helping to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

""All this work is key to our ambition to have an installed capacity of 3.5 GW by 2027, of which more than 60% will be renewable energy and storage. Our transformation, along with the coal phaseout, is much more than a plan; it is a reality,"" Villavicencio said.

While North Carolina‘s population grew at the eighth-fastest rate in the U.S. over the past decade, Graham County declined by about 800 residents.
“People had to move away to find jobs,” says Lynn Cody, a Graham County commissioner for 20-plus years.
EcoKing’s new jobs are expected to pay an annual salary averaging $46,707 a year, about $1,100 more a year than the current Graham County pay.
Just before the first big meeting between Graham County leaders and EcoKing executives, Carpenter realized none of the N.C. team spoke Mandarin.","More than a decade after Graham County suffered an economic body blow with the closing of its biggest manufacturer, a Chinese company is stepping up with a planned $80.5 million to create 515 jobs in Robbinsville.

Foreign companies have announced investments of $43.5 billion and the promise of almost 65,000 jobs in the Tar Heel state over the previous 10 years. But mountainous Graham County, the third-least populous N.C. county, missed out.

“It’s an extremely rural county that doesn’t get a whole lot of looks,” says Solange Tricanowicz, a recruitment manager for the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina. That’s part of what made EcoKing Solutions’ jobs announcement in July such a major win for the far western edge of the state.

EcoKing Solutions says it will start manufacturing biodegradable paper products by next year for customers, including Chipotle and Panda Express. Plans call for 300 employees by 2027. Another 215 workers are expected after Duke Energy increases the site’s electrical capacity from 8 megawatts to 24 megawatts.

If EcoKing follows through on its promises, it will be the largest private employer in Graham County, which has about 8,050 residents and a labor force of 3,646.

Potential new industry offers hope for an area that lost 400 jobs when Stanley Furniture closed in 2014 after offering employment to generations of workers for three decades. While North Carolina‘s population grew at the eighth-fastest rate in the U.S. over the past decade, Graham County declined by about 800 residents. Robbinsville, the county seat about 90 miles west of Asheville, has a population of about 563 residents, about 190 fewer than in 2010.

“People had to move away to find jobs,” says Lynn Cody, a Graham County commissioner for 20-plus years. “We’re hoping this will bring some people back.” He calls EcoKing’s decision a “true blessing.”

EcoKing’s parent company started in 2008 in China, where it employs about 1,200 workers. The company started looking for a U.S. site more than a year ago because 80% of its products are sold to American fast-food restaurants and grocery stores, says John Lin, the vice president and project lead.

“Our clients like to use a product made in the U.S.A.,” says Lin, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Taiwan. He’s moving his family from Atlanta to Robbinsville.

While EcoKing started looking at expanding before the recent friction in U.S.-China trade relations, Lin says President Donald Trump’s threats of higher tariffs on the Asian nation helped push it forward. “Tariffs do affect us a lot,” he says.

The company will use the region’s forests to turn timber into wood pulp to make its products, helping avoid trade duties, says Lin. “We can say we’re made in the U.S.A. and then sell our products to the world.”

The U.S. had a $101 billion trade deficit with China during the first five months of this year, with $148.5 billion in imports and $48.6 billion in exports, government data shows. The deficit totaled more than $1.3 billion over the past four years.

EcoKing’s new jobs are expected to pay an annual salary averaging $46,707 a year, about $1,100 more a year than the current Graham County pay. Those wages are “incomparable” to the low wages earned by EcoKing workers in China, says Lin, but the company will benefit from lower shipping costs.

WHY ROBBINSVILLE

How did a company 7,500 miles away find tiny Robbinsville? It starts with the 2014 closing of the Stanley plant, says Josh Carpenter, director of the seven-county Mountain West Partnership, which oversees regional economic development.

Stanley’s 601,000-square-foot building is the county’s “largest roof,” Carpenter says. In 2016, Oak Valley Hardwood moved into a “postage stamp” portion of the building, and about 30 workers rough-milled lumber and shipped it to China, where it was turned into furniture and other products. That business closed at the start of the pandemic in 2020.

The previous business owner tried to market the building on his own without success. In late 2023, after Carpenter convinced the owner to use a broker, the building immediately began to attract attention from data centers and potential tenants because of its size and available electric power. The all-brick building is “built like a tank,” says Carpenter. “There’s nothing else like it in the county.”

EcoKing’s parent company was scouring several Southern states to locate its first U.S. factory. A phone call from its real estate broker in Atlanta set the wheels in motion,

says Carpenter.

EcoKing needed a big building because it wants to build three production lines here. “More space equals more production equals more people,” says Carpenter.

Recruiting a Chinese company presented unique circumstances. Just before the first big meeting between Graham County leaders and EcoKing executives, Carpenter realized none of the N.C. team spoke Mandarin. A day before the meeting, he recruited Western Carolina University business professor Yue Cai Hillon, who is from the same region in China as EcoKing’s parent company. That was an unexpected bonus, Carpenter says.

The rest of the project followed a fairly normal process. “As everyone is, they were enamored with the beauty of the place, first,” says Carpenter.

State and local incentives totaling about $7.5 million, which are tied to meeting job and investment targets, helped close the deal. About 60 Chinese-owned companies operate in the state, though scrutiny has tightened in recent years as trade relations became more tense, according to state economic development officials.

EcoKing expects to draw workers from a 45-minute drive, including Cherokee, Macon and Swain counties. It plans to invest at least $10 million prepping the property over the next year and will use as many local workers as possible, Lin says. Construction jobs will employ about 100 people. EcoKing plans a showroom in Robbinsville for new customers, bringing more exposure to the region.

County residents also helped sell the project, says Carpenter. EcoKing executives ”just kept saying, ‘You all are the nicest people.’” ■",https://images.businessnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EcoKing_main_image_web.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 03:00:07.775088

Across the country, state leaders are racing to fast-track wind and solar projects before the expiration of federal tax credits to support clean energy.

Colorado is directing state agencies to prioritize permits for projects that might qualify for the credits. Maine regulators are moving up timelines to purchase new power, hoping to give developers a head start on construction.

And renewable industry leaders are pressing governors and lawmakers to clear bureaucratic backlogs and connect projects to the grid in the narrow window that remains.

Federal clean energy tax credits have been essential to the financing of wind and solar projects across the country, and a key part of states’ plans to transition to wind and solar power.

Following President Donald Trump’s moves to quickly phase out those credits, pending projects have a tight time frame to start construction before their eligibility expires. But states have long struggled to speed up permitting decisions, reduce regulatory hurdles and add new power to the grid. And the clock is running out.

“Every month counts,” said Patty O’Keefe, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy nonprofit. “[The tax credits] are the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project that’s currently in the pipeline.”

Over the past few weeks, some governors have directed state agencies to fast-track permits for wind and solar projects. They have also urged utilities and regulators to ensure new power can quickly connect to the grid. Some state regulators have accelerated their timelines to sign contracts for new energy, in hopes of getting more projects started before the fast-approaching construction deadline.

But it’s unclear how quickly states can clear up the bureaucratic backlogs that have frustrated them for years. And any projects that don’t meet the deadlines will face significant additional costs, likely increasing consumers’ electricity bills.

“There are billions of dollars in tax credits that are part of [state regulators’] financial analysis,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. “If every project was unable to access those tax credits, that would be a substantial additional cost to utility ratepayers.”

Permitting

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, extended the federal government’s clean energy tax credits into the 2030s. The policy offered developers a 30% tax credit for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. A separate production credit for projects in operation offered money for every unit of clean electricity they generated.

State leaders say the credits have been key to the financing of wind, solar and other renewable energy projects. States with mandates to transition to clean electricity say the federal support was integral to their plans.

For renewable energy developments, the tax credits have brought project costs down 30-50%, said Mike O’Boyle, acting policy team director with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate and energy think tank.

But the landscape changed dramatically on July 4, when Trump signed a giant domestic policy measure that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.

“Quite a lot is at risk,” said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director with Evergreen Action, a climate-focused advocacy group.

Patterson said that wind and solar projects can take one to six years to move through state permitting programs. Unless states move urgently, projects that don’t already have permits are unlikely to advance in time to qualify for the tax credits.

Colorado leaders are trying to speed up that process. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered state agencies to expedite permits for projects that are eligible for the credits.

“We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly,” said Toor, of the Colorado Energy Office. “We’re focused on making sure that the state is not creating obstacles to projects moving forward.”

Toor said the state is hoping to advance “multiple gigawatts” of projects on an accelerated timeline before the credits expire. A gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes.

State officials and industry leaders said it’s hard to precisely quantify the scope of projects that could benefit from state actions to accelerate deployment. Federal data shows that states plan to add nearly 200 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery storage capacity by 2028. Collectively, those projects could power roughly 145 million homes.

Some states, including California, have created a streamlined “one-stop” permitting process through a single state agency, O’Boyle said. Those states are best equipped to get more projects underway.

“When those tools are in place, there is an ability to target and streamline permitting for specific projects, especially when such large cost reductions are at stake,” he said.

Michigan passed a similar permitting law in 2023, while Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is currently pushing for the creation of a state energy siting board.

O’Keefe, who is based in Minnesota, has called for that state and its municipalities to adopt SolarAPP+, a software platform that automates solar permitting for local governments and other jurisdictions.

Interconnection

Once clean energy developers have received approval from the state, they must wait for approval from grid operators before they can build their projects and plug into the power system. In many places, those “interconnection queues” have suffered from yearslong backlogs that have slowed the buildout of energy projects.

Now, some governors are pushing regulators and utilities to connect as many projects as possible before the tax credits expire.

In Maine, the state Public Utilities Commission kicked off an accelerated procurement process last month, seeking bids for nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy. That’s equivalent to roughly 13% of the state’s electricity usage. By moving up the timeline for developers to submit proposals to build new power projects, regulators hope to give them a better chance to start construction before the deadline.

Regulators in Oregon and Minnesota are also considering proposals to fast-track electricity procurements. And Toor, the Colorado official, said regulators there will open additional procurement windows to allow more projects to be considered. The letter from Polis, the Colorado governor, also referenced the Public Utilities Commission’s authority to override permit denials from local authorities.

In California, clean energy developers have called on state regulators to create a new solicitation for projects eligible for the tax credits, allowing them to begin construction sooner. The industry groups also called on state officials to streamline environmental review and permit approvals.

O’Boyle noted that California’s transmission system has surplus capacity at existing gas-fired power plant sites. Building wind and solar projects near those plants would allow them to plug into that infrastructure and quickly come online. State lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would promote the use of such “surplus interconnection.”

New York has 26 permitted but unbuilt wind and solar projects, New York Focus reported, totaling about 3 gigawatts of energy. Developers have only started construction on two of the large projects approved by the state in the past four years.

Clean energy advocates told the outlet that projects need approvals and agreements from multiple agencies before moving forward.

“Every last whisper of detail of the project has to be finalized before they generally let you start construction,” said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.

Industry leaders said Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul should order state regulators to coordinate with one another on permits, and direct the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to fast-track contracts for new clean energy. Leaders at the agency did not grant a Stateline interview request.

Jacqueline Esposito is a Long Island resident and director of advocacy at Waterkeeper Alliance.","Long Island has always been defined by our water. From the sparkling clarity of the Long Island Sound to the lifeblood in our aquifers, residents have long relied on these irreplaceable resources: springs, ponds, wells, and drinking taps. But growing evidence shows that legacy, and the trust we place in it, is now under serious threat from a commonly used yet highly toxic chemical that’s rampant in our environment.

A group of synthetic chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, has been detected in drinking water across Long Island and many other places around the world. Known as “forever chemicals,” these compounds are found in our water, air, fish, and soil because they don’t break down easily. These highly durable substances have been used in industrial and everyday consumer products since the 1950s to make them last longer. But that same strength means PFAS persist beyond these products and, due to limited or nonexistent regulation at all levels of government, they are able to travel through multiple pathways, lingering in our environment and bodies for decades.

As an unsurprising and arguably preventable consequence, a growing body of scientific research has linked PFAS to cancer, liver damage, thyroid disease, reproductive harm, and other serious health problems, even at extremely low levels of exposure, and is estimated to be contaminating the drinking water for 165 million people in America.

Waterkeeper Alliance, as part of a national monitoring initiative, recently released a report that found 98% of tested waterbodies were contaminated with one or more PFAS. Yet even as this evidence mounts, Lee Zeldin, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and former congressional representative for eastern Long Island, is preparing to roll back critical protections that limit these hazardous chemicals in our drinking water. The consequences for Long Islanders if he rolls back safeguards are stark: according to the Environmental Working Group, roughly 1.3 million New Yorkers, primarily on Long Island, rely on water systems that exceed the current federal thresholds for PFAS contamination that Zeldin is expected to roll back.

Zeldin faces a clear choice: stand with Long Islanders and protect our access to safe, clean drinking water or stand in the way. At a minimum, he must uphold and fully implement the EPA’s PFAS drinking water standards and invest in upgrades for wastewater treatment plants to remove these compounds. But the stronger path backed by scientists and public health experts is to go further. PFAS should be regulated as one hazardous class, not one chemical at a time. That would stop companies from simply replacing one toxic compound with another, and it would streamline testing, cleanup, and enforcement across original sources and pathways.

We cannot afford to weaken protections now. Long Islanders swim, drink, and fish in these waters. Our communities, health, and economy all depend on clean water. Zeldin knows this. As a member of Congress, he voted to limit PFAS in drinking water and hold polluters accountable. Now, as the head of EPA, he’s considering rolling back the very protections he once supported. He can’t have it both ways.

The world is racing towards a greener future, and the materials of tomorrow are being created today. For industries such as energy, high-tech manufacturing and construction to reach greater heights in advanced research and manufacturing, they require cutting-edge solutions. For over a century, Konoshima Chemical has been a leading Japanese company in materials and chemical research, development and manufacturing. More recently, its efforts in CO2 reduction, clean energy and transparent ceramics have garnered international attention.

The company is pioneering transparent ceramics, particularly Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (YAG), which is being adopted across industries. YAG ceramics fill a variety of niches, including scientific research, medical, defense, industrial, fusion energy and high-intensity laser systems. In particular, the ceramics’ high transparency enables stable, high-output lasers required for fusion research and advanced physics, as its large size and superior thermal and mechanical durability outperform those typically employed in single crystals. Konoshima Chemical’s ceramics are being evaluated as critical components in high-powered laser assemblies critical for experimental fusion reactors. Laser fusion energy systems utilize extremely powerful laser pulses to rapidly compress and heat fuel, creating the extreme temperatures and pressures necessary to ignite a controlled thermonuclear reaction that releases vast amounts of clean energy, much like stars.

Konoshima Chemical ensures stable quality and can customize the dopant concentration levels to user requirements. The company’s transparent ceramics have been well-received internationally, as evidenced by the ceramics’ adoption by NASA and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the United States. He sees the 10 to 20-centimeter segment as having the greatest potential for Konoshima Chemical’s global expansion, as the company is the only producer capable of achieving quality higher than that of a crystal. There is considerable potential in autonomous vehicles; however, production costs remain relatively high for the consumer market.

Takuma Factory

Konoshima Chemical’s ceramics have a wide variety of applications across industries and scientific disciplines. Its Bonded LuAG Ceramic Scintillators are a key component in ultra-high-resolution X-Ray imaging. Developed with Japan’s RIKEN and the High Luminance Photon Science Institute, this technology enables 200 nm resolution—nearing the theoretical limit of X-ray imaging. The detector uses LuAG:Ce ceramics, bonded with precision for unmatched clarity. It’s applied in advanced imaging systems for detailed biological and material studies.

Konoshima Chemical has been recognized for advancing material performance and efficiency, reducing carbon emissions and promoting a safer, more human-centric work environment. “Our factory emits a significant amount of CO2, and we recognized that this isn't sustainable for the future. That led us to consider what actions we could take,” Fukawa says. When the company began exploring CO2 recycling, synergies within the company emerged. Konoshima Chemical has developed an innovative technology that can convert emissions into a valuable material. The company is in the early stages of its long-term plan to establish a system that utilizes the carbonization technology it developed for producing carbonate compounds as a raw material, achieving factory-level net-zero CO2 emissions—a first in Japan. “Our system has potential applications beyond our own operations and could be adopted by other companies and industries,” he says. The company was awarded the Good Design Award, which has led to enquiries within Japan. Fukawa says that the company plans to promote it globally as it is well-suited for international use. While there are theoretical alternatives, Konoshima Chemical’s solution is already available. “If the right conditions are in place, it can be deployed anywhere in the world right away,” he says.

With 108 years of operation under its belt, Konoshima continues to innovate, push boundaries and find solutions for tomorrow’s challenges. As its transparent ceramics enable breakthroughs in energy and science, its CO2 recycling is turning emissions into building materials. The company is reshaping advanced manufacturing and positioning itself as an innovative leader as global industries seek sustainable, high-performance materials. Speaking on ceramics, Fukawa, the company’s goals, “Moving forward, we hope to expand our reach into the private sector and generate sales in those areas.”",https://www.theworldfolio.com/img_db/articles/article-68adb15a159db.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 20:59:24.288625

Of the 163 eligible coal plants, 11 are in Texas and six have been approved, including Parish’s operator, NRG Energy.
In June, the Environmental Protection Agency under Trump proposed a rule to eliminate the 2024 MATS rule completely.
But owners of the chemical plants should not act so surprised, said Neil Carman, a former regulator for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.
Carman pointed out that the heads of chemical companies have been in talks with Trump’s EPA since the election.","For Donna Thomas, smokestacks are a typical sight from her home in Fort Bend County, Texas. Since she was a child, she has seen the coal and natural gas-powered W.A. Parish Generating Station puff clouds of haze during the day and light up brightly at night. The facility — which has been around since 1958 — is both part of the background and all she thinks about.

Thomas is not alone. For decades, residents have expressed concerns over the pollution emitted from the Parish coal plant — a separate facility from the natural gas plant — and called for its closure. The plant, located about 30 miles southwest of downtown Houston, is ranked by Texas environmental regulators as one of the worst polluters in the state for certain hazardous emissions. These include mercury, a toxic heavy metal particularly harmful for children and pregnant people.

This year, mercury has been top of mind for environmental activists and residents like Thomas. In April, President Donald Trump announced an exemption for companies from implementing stricter Biden-era mercury regulations for two years. Of the 163 eligible coal plants, 11 are in Texas and six have been approved, including Parish’s operator, NRG Energy. In Missouri and Illinois, five coal plants have been exempted, and in Pennsylvania, all 12 of the coal plants seeking approval have been approved.

Then in July, Trump exempted chemical companies for two years from Biden’s 2024 HON Rule, a set of regulations that control hazardous air emissions from chemical plants called the Hazardous Organic National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants.

The Trump administration determined the exemptions are in the country’s best interest and represent a burden on industry, and that the technology is not available to meet stricter regulations. Companies like NRG agree.

However, critics say the Biden administration’s 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards — called MATS for short — and the HON Rule were long overdue and the two-year delay in implementing them is merely a tactic to protect industry profit margins at the expense of public health.

Moreover, critics point out that the MATS delay may be giving companies the freedom to ignore toxic air emission rules until the Trump administration repeals the Biden-era regulations altogether. In June, the Environmental Protection Agency under Trump proposed a rule to eliminate the 2024 MATS rule completely.

The two rules together have set off alarm bells for experts and environmentalists in Texas, home to one of the world’s largest petrochemical sectors and 11 coal-powered plants. The exemptions will run from 2027 — when the Biden rules were supposed to take effect — to 2029.

“We know these rollbacks are not good for anyone, especially for those that are community fenceline,” said Thomas, also the founder and president of the Fort Bend Environmental — a grassroots organization focused on environmental justice. “We have around 1,000 homes within three miles of Parish, so that’s going to affect all of them.”

A Two-Year Delay

The EPA has been working on stricter environmental regulations for chemical plants since the early 1990s. Only in 2020 did Biden’s EPA begin drafting new rules in earnest.

But owners of the chemical plants should not act so surprised, said Neil Carman, a former regulator for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

“The chemical industry has known for decades that this was all coming, but they don’t like rules, because it means they have to put on more pollution control and they have to do more leak inspections,” said Carman, now the clean air director for the Texas chapter of the Sierra Club. “These plants will always tell you safety first, safety first, but then you run into this thing called money.”

Of the 79 chemical facilities in Texas requesting exemptions, 15 have been approved, including 13 along the Gulf Coast and the so-called petrochemical corridor.

Carman pointed out that the heads of chemical companies have been in talks with Trump’s EPA since the election. In March, the administration announced that companies could apply for exemption from MATS, HON and seven other sets of emissions standards.

That same month, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin met with Dow Inc. Chairman-CEO Jim Fitterling to discuss regulations imposed by the Biden administration, according to public records and emails obtained by the Sierra Club.

In one email sent on March 17, Dow reps asked to discuss “clarity” on the EPA’s recent announcement that it will reconsider the HON rule and “Dow has met with the Office of Air and Radiation regarding an extension of the current compliance deadline, which is impossible to meet.”

In May, Zeldin met with Fitterling and other chemical company CEOs to discuss the industry at large. Then in July, Trump announced the exemptions for HON, including for two chemical plants in Louisiana and one in Seadrift, Texas, operated by Dow and its subsidiary Union Carbide.

In a statement to Capital & Main, a Dow spokesperson said that “safety and integrity are at the core of both companies’ operations” and the “extensions are appropriate and necessary to address the technical challenges and to ensure the continued safe and efficient operation of these facilities.”

Carman doesn’t buy it. He worked as an environmental regulator in Texas for 12 years. Even then, he said, companies never seemed to be able to find the budget to limit their emissions and chemical leaks. For him, it’s still the cost.

“A lot of these are old plants and so when they go in and do all this work,” Carman said, “they have to find a place where they’re going to put in new controls and they have to engineer it. They have to design it all. It’s months of planning, but these rules were out there. They knew they were coming. They just want two more years of delay.”

Limiting Mercury

When the EPA implemented the 2012 MATS rule, mercury emissions dropped 86% — or four tons — in five years.

In 2024, Biden’s EPA approved a rule to strengthen MATS by tightening the emissions standards for mercury by another 70% and reducing pollutants discharged through wastewater from coal-fired plants by more than 660 million pounds per year.

The rule could prevent as many as 11,000 premature deaths, 2,800 cases of chronic bronchitis and 130,000 asthma attacks, according to the EPA under Biden.

However, in April, Trump approved the exemptions for 47 coal-powered plants across the nation. As of mid-August, 70 are now exempted, including Parish.

“These rules were just so critically important to people’s health,” said Surbhi Sarang, senior attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund. The Trump administration “was doing this process that was just not transparent. I mean, there was no process. Whereas in rulemaking, there’s public comment. This is just like a presidential action that was kind of taken in a vacuum and then announced.”

In response to the exemption, Erik Linden, senior director of communications at NRG, said the time is needed and will be used to evaluate the technology for air quality systems and monitoring equipment for compliance.

“All existing MATS emission controls will be properly maintained and remain in service,” Linden said of the current MATS rules that began in 2012. The exemption would give NRG until 2029 to implement the changes.

However, in July, Trump’s EPA proposed eliminating Biden’s rule entirely by the end of the year. Interested parties had three weeks to submit comments, and the Environmental Defense Fund’s request for an extension was denied.

“Rule-making usually takes 12-18 months if not longer,” Sarang said. “They’re moving very quickly.”

All of this is alarming for residents living near industry. With the extent of the changes to environmental regulations coming down from the Trump administration, there’s a lot for Thomas, the Parish generating station neighbor, to process. But she hasn’t given up. Increasingly, Thomas is talking to her neighbors and fellow residents about fighting back.

This means sending letters to representatives in Texas and in Washington, D.C. Thomas said it pays to be loud.

Parish is “going to do the same thing it’s been doing,” Thomas said. “If the EPA does not put a stop to these [emissions] getting out, then everyone is going to pay for this with their lives and in their water and in their air.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2150754136.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 20:59:45.922644

""China is shaping the energy landscape through green energy transformation marking a paradigm shift in global energy market.","Beijing, China, Aug. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In the summer, scorching heat waves often send temperatures soaring beyond 45 C along the dry banks of the Jhelum River in Pakistan.

In a riverside village, local resident Ahmed reaches out to turn up the electric fan. As the room gradually cools down, his two children focus intently on their homework.

Just a few kilometers away from Ahmed's home, turbines at the Karot Hydropower Station spin at 100 revolutions per minute, continuously delivering clean electricity to surrounding regions.

Also benefiting from this power source are key residential and industrial load centers such as Gujranwala, Lahore and Rawalpindi in Pakistan.

With a total installed capacity of 720,000 kilowatts, the Karot Hydropower Station is expected to generate approximately 3.2 billion kilowatt-hours of clean electricity annually.

It could meet the daily electricity needs of around 5 million people and significantly alleviate Pakistan's power supply-demand gap, the Global Times learned from the China Three Gorges Corporation (CTG).

Dubbed ""Pakistan's Three Gorges Project,"" the Karot Hydropower Station is a flagship collaboration between China and Pakistan - both member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).

In recent years, SCO member states have actively advanced green energy transitions by introducing supportive policies and setting carbon reduction goals. Cooperation projects in hydropower, photovoltaics, wind energy, and nuclear energy have steadily moved forward.

In his speech in July 2024 at ""SCO Plus"" meeting in Astana, Kazakhstan, Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed that ""we should build a common home of prosperity and development. Modernization is the shared goal of all countries in the SCO.""

China proposes that 2025 be designated as the SCO Year of Sustainable Development so as to help us focus on fostering new forces for growth, Xi said, according to the Xinhua News Agency.

Today, China's clean energy blueprint stretches across the SCO landscape - from the Tianwan and Xudapu nuclear power plants, to the Turgusun Hydropower Station and Kapshagay photovoltaic station in Kazakhstan; the Issyk-Kul solar farm and Toktogul Hydropower Station in Kyrgyzstan; the Bukhara wind farm and Navoi photovoltaic plant in Uzbekistan; and the Karot Hydropower Station in Pakistan - all emerging as new growth drivers among SCO member states.

""With the regional green transformation is taking effect in SCO with China being its central driver, it is making meaningful contributions to international climate goals by shifting large economies toward low-carbon pathways,"" Muhammad Asif Noor, secretary general of the Pakistan-SCO Friendship Forum, told the Global Times.

Train local talents with widespread recognition

New energy cooperation between China and its SCO partners has actively contributed to economic growth and improved livelihoods. The Karot Hydropower Station - the first hydropower project under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) invested and developed by CTG - stands as a vivid example.

Pakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif said before that the Karot Hydropower Project, a major pilot project under the CPEC, would generate environment-friendly and cheap electricity, promoting green development in Pakistan, according to a Xinhua report in 2022.

Muhammad Aftab Alam is one of the many beneficiaries of the project. As the safety manager of the Karot Hydropower Station, he told the Global Times that ""as one of the builders of the project, I feel extremely proud! It not only provides affordable clean energy, but more importantly, it has nurtured a large number of skilled and experienced Pakistani professionals who are well-versed in standards. They are the future and hope of this country.""

Alam joined the Chinese company in 2015 and is now considered a ""veteran employee."" ""I have been deeply moved by the professionalism and dedication of my Chinese colleagues who remain committed to overseas projects, far away from their families. We've built a strong sense of teamwork,"" he said.

Before joining the Chinese enterprise, Alam worked at a local hydropower station. His motivation for joining the Karot project was to create a better educational environment for his children. ""My children receiving better education and me having the chance to work on a larger platform - that's my goal.""

By integrating China's ecological civilization philosophy into CPEC construction and adhering to international environmental and social sustainability standards, the Karot project has earned wide recognition, including winning several Pakistani awards on social responsibility and environmental development.

Alam has also reaped many personal benefits - all three of his children have been admitted to university, and his eldest daughter is currently pursuing a doctoral degree.

""I hope they can leave something meaningful on this land,"" said Alam, ""just like the Karot Hydropower Station I see before me.""

""China is leading the green transition in the SCO through joint ventures, sustainable infrastructure, and green technology sharing that open doors for employment, development, and industrialization,"" Noor said.

Boost economy, green lifestyle

The Karot project is not a standalone case in the successful green cooperation between China and SCO partners as they are pursuing shared goals of greener future and low-carbon growth when the world is facing growing pressure from climate change.

In the verdant grasslands of Kazakhstan, a striking sight unfolds across the vast horizon: A series of wind turbines standing tall against the backdrop of the sky. This is the Akmola wind power project cluster, a significant investment by a Chinese enterprise in the region.

With a total installed capacity of 221 megawatts, this project cluster is set to supply 843 million kilowatt-hours of green electricity annually, which translates to a remarkable reduction of 278,300 tons of standard coal consumption and a decrease of 686,600 tons in carbon dioxide emissions each year, according to a report by the People's Daily on August 26.

The wind turbines, along with the monitoring, control, and data collection systems in this project, are all equipped with Chinese technology, specifically designed to withstand the harsh climatic conditions of the region, characterized by long winters and extreme low temperatures.

In the rugged mountains of Uzbekistan's Zarafshan region, wind turbines now dot the horizon - a landmark of change brought by the Zarafshan wind power project. For local residents, harsh winters once meant enduring frequent blackouts and the daily struggle of life without electricity. ""Cold and darkness have given way to warmth and light,"" local resident Alisher told the Global Times.

This transformation stems from a Chinese-built wind farm that not only strengthens local energy security, but has also created new job opportunities. Once fully operational, the project is set to supply green electricity to 500,000 households and cut carbon dioxide emissions by 1.1 million tons annually.

""It marks a significant step toward Uzbekistan's energy transition and sustainable economic development,"" a project employee previously shared with the Global Times.

In another special humanitarian initiative, a Chinese company has partnered with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) to transform the Termez Cargo Center in Surkhandarya, Uzbekistan into a clean energy-powered hub. This solar upgrade, part of a broader climate action collaboration, marks a significant step toward sustainable energy solutions for emergency supply storage and transport, benefiting both refugees and host communities.

Besides large infrastructure projects, Chinese-brand new energy vehicles (NEVs) are also gaining momentum in many Central Asian cities, ushering a new trend of low-carbon transport. In the recently launched ""Green Mobility Week"" campaign in Kazakhstan's largest city, Almaty, Chinese-made electric busies gained popularity during the event. In many other Central Asian cities, Chinese-made NEVs have also attracted fans.

Together for sustainable future

China is ready to work with all sides to carry forward the Shanghai Spirit, strengthen unity and coordination, promote green development, write a new chapter of common development, and jointly build an even closer SCO community with a shared future, Xi said in a congratulatory letter to the Green Development Forum of SCO Countries in July 2024, according to Xinhua.

Xi pointed out that it is the consensus of SCO countries to protect the environment and promote green development. China, committed to the philosophy that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets, has in recent years unswervingly pursued a model of sound development featuring improved production, higher living standards and healthy ecosystems, leading to remarkable achievements in building a beautiful China, Xinhua reported.

The ""China-SCO Renewable Energy Cooperation Report 2024"" released during the SCO Energy Ministers Meeting on June 26 shows that SCO member countries contribute half of the global renewable energy installed capacity. By the end of 2024, the renewable energy generation capacity of SCO member countries had reached 2.31 billion kilowatts, which is 14.5 times that of the organization's founding and accounts for approximately 50 percent of the global total. In 2024, the newly installed renewable energy capacity in SCO member countries reached 420 million kilowatts, accounting for about 72 percent of the global new renewable energy capacity, with China contributing over 370 million kilowatts.

""China is shaping the energy landscape through green energy transformation marking a paradigm shift in global energy market. This paradigm shift means a fast-paced approach toward carbon neutrality supported by landmark technological transformation in China. China's role is pivotal because it brings not only financial resources and technological expertise, but also a developmental philosophy that aligns economic growth with climate change goals,"" Noor told the Global Times.

With leaders from more than 20 countries and heads of 10 international organizations set to participate, the upcoming SCO Summit 2025 is expected to pool consensus and steer the organization toward building a closer community with a shared future.

“These tenders will help deliver cleaner, more reliable and more affordable energy for Western Australian households and businesses,” Bowen said in the announcement.

Both tenders will be the first to implement a streamlined single-stage bidding process, consolidating technical and financial proposals, intended to shorten the tender duration from nine months to approximately six. This approach is designed to increase efficiency and support the timely signing of Capacity Investment Scheme Agreements (CISAs).

In an interview with ESN Premium, Nick Hawke, director of Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), recently said this move was a positive shift for the CIS scheme.

Potential proponents are advised to register before 10 October 2025 for both tenders, with bids to close on 7 November. Successful bids into Tenders 5 and 6 are expected to be announced in March 2026. You can find out more about registering via the official website.

At the recent Battery Asset Management Summit Australia 2025, Thimo Mueller, general manager, commercial at AusEnergy Services Ltd (ASL), formerly AEMO Services, confirmed that the results from Tender 3 of the CIS initiative will be released “in the coming weeks”.

National Capacity Investment Scheme programme development

The Western Australian tenders build upon the broader national CIS programme, which began with a pilot in 2023.

In December 2024, the Australian Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water announced the results of CIS Tender 1, which focused on the National Electricity Market (NEM), which spans Australia’s eastern and southern states.

This tender selected 19 renewable energy projects totalling 6.38GW of capacity, including eight hybrid power projects with 3.6GWh of storage.

The tender reportedly attracted 84 initial bids with a combined capacity of 27GW – approximately 4.5 times the tender capacity – demonstrating the strong market interest in the CIS model.

The successful Tender 1 projects included 2.8GW of solar generation and 3.6GW of wind capacity. Geographically, New South Wales and Victoria each secured seven projects, with New South Wales receiving 3.7GW plus 904MWh of battery storage, and Victoria gaining 1.6GW plus 1,458MWh of storage.

South Australia and Queensland rounded out the allocations with 574MW and 550MW of generation capacity, respectively, and Queensland also secured 1,200MWh of storage.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Australia-gold-mine-solar-pv-Western-Australia-Image-Pacific-Energy.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 20:59:29.345472

Beijing, China, Aug. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In the summer, scorching heat waves often send temperatures soaring beyond 45 C along the dry banks of the Jhelum River in Pakistan.

In a riverside village, local resident Ahmed reaches out to turn up the electric fan. As the room gradually cools down, his two children focus intently on their homework.

Just a few kilometers away from Ahmed's home, turbines at the Karot Hydropower Station spin at 100 revolutions per minute, continuously delivering clean electricity to surrounding regions.

Also benefiting from this power source are key residential and industrial load centers such as Gujranwala, Lahore and Rawalpindi in Pakistan.

With a total installed capacity of 720,000 kilowatts, the Karot Hydropower Station is expected to generate approximately 3.2 billion kilowatt-hours of clean electricity annually.

It could meet the daily electricity needs of around 5 million people and significantly alleviate Pakistan's power supply-demand gap, the Global Times learned from the China Three Gorges Corporation (CTG).

Dubbed ""Pakistan's Three Gorges Project,"" the Karot Hydropower Station is a flagship collaboration between China and Pakistan - both member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).

In recent years, SCO member states have actively advanced green energy transitions by introducing supportive policies and setting carbon reduction goals. Cooperation projects in hydropower, photovoltaics, wind energy, and nuclear energy have steadily moved forward.

In his speech in July 2024 at ""SCO Plus"" meeting in Astana, Kazakhstan, Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed that ""we should build a common home of prosperity and development. Modernization is the shared goal of all countries in the SCO.""

China proposes that 2025 be designated as the SCO Year of Sustainable Development so as to help us focus on fostering new forces for growth, Xi said, according to the Xinhua News Agency.

Today, China's clean energy blueprint stretches across the SCO landscape - from the Tianwan and Xudapu nuclear power plants, to the Turgusun Hydropower Station and Kapshagay photovoltaic station in Kazakhstan; the Issyk-Kul solar farm and Toktogul Hydropower Station in Kyrgyzstan; the Bukhara wind farm and Navoi photovoltaic plant in Uzbekistan; and the Karot Hydropower Station in Pakistan - all emerging as new growth drivers among SCO member states.

""With the regional green transformation is taking effect in SCO with China being its central driver, it is making meaningful contributions to international climate goals by shifting large economies toward low-carbon pathways,"" Muhammad Asif Noor, secretary general of the Pakistan-SCO Friendship Forum, told the Global Times.

Train local talents with widespread recognition

New energy cooperation between China and its SCO partners has actively contributed to economic growth and improved livelihoods. The Karot Hydropower Station - the first hydropower project under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) invested and developed by CTG - stands as a vivid example.

Pakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif said before that the Karot Hydropower Project, a major pilot project under the CPEC, would generate environment-friendly and cheap electricity, promoting green development in Pakistan, according to a Xinhua report in 2022.

Muhammad Aftab Alam is one of the many beneficiaries of the project. As the safety manager of the Karot Hydropower Station, he told the Global Times that ""as one of the builders of the project, I feel extremely proud! It not only provides affordable clean energy, but more importantly, it has nurtured a large number of skilled and experienced Pakistani professionals who are well-versed in standards. They are the future and hope of this country.""

Alam joined the Chinese company in 2015 and is now considered a ""veteran employee."" ""I have been deeply moved by the professionalism and dedication of my Chinese colleagues who remain committed to overseas projects, far away from their families. We've built a strong sense of teamwork,"" he said.

Before joining the Chinese enterprise, Alam worked at a local hydropower station. His motivation for joining the Karot project was to create a better educational environment for his children. ""My children receiving better education and me having the chance to work on a larger platform - that's my goal.""

By integrating China's ecological civilization philosophy into CPEC construction and adhering to international environmental and social sustainability standards, the Karot project has earned wide recognition, including winning several Pakistani awards on social responsibility and environmental development.

Alam has also reaped many personal benefits - all three of his children have been admitted to university, and his eldest daughter is currently pursuing a doctoral degree.

""I hope they can leave something meaningful on this land,"" said Alam, ""just like the Karot Hydropower Station I see before me.""

""China is leading the green transition in the SCO through joint ventures, sustainable infrastructure, and green technology sharing that open doors for employment, development, and industrialization,"" Noor said.

Boost economy, green lifestyle

The Karot project is not a standalone case in the successful green cooperation between China and SCO partners as they are pursuing shared goals of greener future and low-carbon growth when the world is facing growing pressure from climate change.

In the verdant grasslands of Kazakhstan, a striking sight unfolds across the vast horizon: A series of wind turbines standing tall against the backdrop of the sky. This is the Akmola wind power project cluster, a significant investment by a Chinese enterprise in the region.

With a total installed capacity of 221 megawatts, this project cluster is set to supply 843 million kilowatt-hours of green electricity annually, which translates to a remarkable reduction of 278,300 tons of standard coal consumption and a decrease of 686,600 tons in carbon dioxide emissions each year, according to a report by the People's Daily on August 26.

The wind turbines, along with the monitoring, control, and data collection systems in this project, are all equipped with Chinese technology, specifically designed to withstand the harsh climatic conditions of the region, characterized by long winters and extreme low temperatures.

In the rugged mountains of Uzbekistan's Zarafshan region, wind turbines now dot the horizon - a landmark of change brought by the Zarafshan wind power project. For local residents, harsh winters once meant enduring frequent blackouts and the daily struggle of life without electricity. ""Cold and darkness have given way to warmth and light,"" local resident Alisher told the Global Times.

This transformation stems from a Chinese-built wind farm that not only strengthens local energy security, but has also created new job opportunities. Once fully operational, the project is set to supply green electricity to 500,000 households and cut carbon dioxide emissions by 1.1 million tons annually.

""It marks a significant step toward Uzbekistan's energy transition and sustainable economic development,"" a project employee previously shared with the Global Times.

In another special humanitarian initiative, a Chinese company has partnered with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) to transform the Termez Cargo Center in Surkhandarya, Uzbekistan into a clean energy-powered hub. This solar upgrade, part of a broader climate action collaboration, marks a significant step toward sustainable energy solutions for emergency supply storage and transport, benefiting both refugees and host communities.

Besides large infrastructure projects, Chinese-brand new energy vehicles (NEVs) are also gaining momentum in many Central Asian cities, ushering a new trend of low-carbon transport. In the recently launched ""Green Mobility Week"" campaign in Kazakhstan's largest city, Almaty, Chinese-made electric busies gained popularity during the event. In many other Central Asian cities, Chinese-made NEVs have also attracted fans.

Together for sustainable future

China is ready to work with all sides to carry forward the Shanghai Spirit, strengthen unity and coordination, promote green development, write a new chapter of common development, and jointly build an even closer SCO community with a shared future, Xi said in a congratulatory letter to the Green Development Forum of SCO Countries in July 2024, according to Xinhua.

Xi pointed out that it is the consensus of SCO countries to protect the environment and promote green development. China, committed to the philosophy that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets, has in recent years unswervingly pursued a model of sound development featuring improved production, higher living standards and healthy ecosystems, leading to remarkable achievements in building a beautiful China, Xinhua reported.

The ""China-SCO Renewable Energy Cooperation Report 2024"" released during the SCO Energy Ministers Meeting on June 26 shows that SCO member countries contribute half of the global renewable energy installed capacity. By the end of 2024, the renewable energy generation capacity of SCO member countries had reached 2.31 billion kilowatts, which is 14.5 times that of the organization's founding and accounts for approximately 50 percent of the global total. In 2024, the newly installed renewable energy capacity in SCO member countries reached 420 million kilowatts, accounting for about 72 percent of the global new renewable energy capacity, with China contributing over 370 million kilowatts.

""China is shaping the energy landscape through green energy transformation marking a paradigm shift in global energy market. This paradigm shift means a fast-paced approach toward carbon neutrality supported by landmark technological transformation in China. China's role is pivotal because it brings not only financial resources and technological expertise, but also a developmental philosophy that aligns economic growth with climate change goals,"" Noor told the Global Times.

,Texas American Energy ,2025-08-31 23:20:11+00:00,ABC13 Houston,Over 800 new laws go into effect in Texas on Sept. 1. Here are some of the significant ones,"Alex Nguyen, The Texas Tribune",,,,,https://abc13.com/post/800-new-laws-go-effect-texas-sept-1-here-are-significant-ones/17704499/,"More than 800 new laws are about to take effect in Texas, bringing sweeping changes to the state's education systems, water infrastructure, and more.
A significant part of the law activated immediately, while another big chunk will take effect on Sept. 1.
Senate Bill 13 will give parents and school boards more power over what students can access in public school libraries.
Senate Bill 15, which received mixed support from both parties, will allow for certain single-family homes to be built on smaller lots.
Senate Bill 33 will ban cities or counties from using their money to support residents seeking abortions outside Texas.","More than 800 new laws are about to take effect in Texas, bringing sweeping changes to the state's education systems, water infrastructure, and more.

Gov. Greg Abbott signed 1,155 bills that came out of the regular legislative session, including over 200 laws that went into effect immediately, such as the school cellphone ban, the abortion ban clarification, the property tax cut, and increased oversight over the energy grid. Meanwhile, some won't activate until next year or until voters approve constitutional amendments in November, such as stricter bail policies and a $3 billion dementia research fund. In addition, there are 140 bills that the governor didn't take action on, including 34 that took effect immediately.

Most, however, will start on Sept. 1, the traditional date for laws passed during the regular session. Here are some notable measures that will soon take effect:

Senate Bill 1 lays out the state's new $338 billion two-year spending plan, with over 70% of the budget being reserved for education and health and human services. Some notable parts include spending to maintain and provide property tax cuts, a new school voucher program, additional funding for public schools, as well as investments in the state's energy, water, and broadband infrastructure.

The plan also initially included a $60 million measure that would have let Texas enter a federal summer lunch program for low-income kids, but Abbott vetoed it due to ""significant uncertainty regarding federal matching rates for this and other similar programs.""

Senate Bill 2 will create one of the country's largest school voucher programs, allowing parents to pay for their children's accredited private school tuition or other education-related expenses with public tax dollars. In most cases, each child will receive just over $10,000 per year, though students with disabilities could receive up to $30,000 in additional funding. Wealthier families with children already in private schools could also participate.

Texas can spend up to $1 billion during its upcoming two-year budget cycle, though the program's cost could rise significantly afterwards.

The law's passage followed years of fighting between GOP lawmakers, who framed the issue as providing school choice to parents, and Democrats and rural Republicans who said vouchers would harm public schools. Abbott threw his weight behind the effort to elect more pro-voucher Republicans and succeeded last year. SB 2 takes effect on Sept. 1, but the voucher program itself isn't expected to launch until the 2026-27 school year.

House Bill 2 will provide about $8.5 billion in new money to public schools, as districts across the state tackle long-running challenges following years of stagnant funding. From this pot, more than $4 billion will go toward raising educators' pay. The additional dollars will also be used for educator preparation, special education, safety requirements, and early childhood learning. A significant part of the law activated immediately, while another big chunk will take effect on Sept. 1. Some will roll out in future years.

Senate Bill 10 will require the visible display of the Ten Commandments on donated posters that are at least 16 by 20 inches in public school classrooms, which are attended by around 5.5 million students in Texas. While supporters said Christian teachings are important to understanding American history, critics said this law undermines the separation of church and state. Such laws have already faced legal challenges in Texas and other states. They include an Aug. 20 ruling from U.S. District Judge Fred Biery, which temporarily blocks the measure from taking effect for nearly a dozen school districts, including Austin, Houston, and Plano.

""This issue is likely to get to the United States Supreme Court,"" Biery said prior to the case's opening statements in San Antonio. Texas is expected to appeal his ruling.

Senate Bill 12 will extend the ban on diversity, equity, and inclusion policies to K-12 schools. In particular, it will prohibit school districts from factoring race, ethnicity, gender identity, or sexual orientation into hiring decisions. It will also bar schools from offering instructions, programs, and guidance that focus on sexual orientation or gender identity, including sponsoring student clubs such as Gender and Sexuality Alliance. The law's backers said the legislation gives parents more control over their children's education, while critics said it targets and censors marginalized groups, such as LGBTQ students. Some civil rights groups, including the ACLU of Texas, have launched a legal challenge against the law.

Senate Bill 13 will give parents and school boards more power over what students can access in public school libraries. These boards can also delegate this oversight process if 50 parents in the same district sign a petition for the creation of a local school advisory council. Supporters said the law will protect students from inappropriate content and give parents more control over what their children consume, while critics said it will lead to increased censorship of certain topics such as gender and race. Texas was already among the top states for book bans in recent years, according to PEN America.

Senate Bill 37 will give politically appointed regents more power over public universities, including by granting them more say over the hiring of administrators, as well as over some responsibilities that were traditionally held by faculty members. It will also create an office that can investigate universities for failures to comply with state laws, such as regarding DEI initiatives. The law's backers said it is needed to tackle what they consider to be liberal bias in universities and better align them with Texas's workforce demands. Critics, however, said the law will threaten academic freedom and undermine research.

House Bill 33, authored by Republican state Rep. Don McLaughlin, who was mayor during the Uvalde school shooting, will require law enforcement agencies across Texas to establish crisis response policies. Among several changes, the law will compel school districts and local law enforcement to meet annually in order to assess their emergency operations plans, resources, and capabilities. It will mandate law enforcement agencies and emergency medical service providers to complete training programs on how to respond to active shooters at primary and secondary schools. And following an actual shooting, these responders will also have to file a report detailing and evaluating their actions within several months to facilitate faster public access to information.

Senate Bill 7 will create a framework for funding water projects through the Texas Water Development Board and providing oversight over them, amid a broad effort to tackle the state's looming water crisis. Certain sections of the law would take effect in September 2027 if voters approve the constitutional amendment outlined by House Joint Resolution 7 in November. This ballot measure, if accepted, would allocate $1 billion each year from the state's sales and use tax revenue to the Texas Water Fund between 2027 and 2047.

Senate Bill 15, which received mixed support from both parties, will allow for certain single-family homes to be built on smaller lots. In particular, the law will ban big cities from requiring these homes to sit on more than 3,000 square feet of land, if they are being constructed in a new subdivision that is at least five acres in size. This is a drop from the 5,000 to 7,500 square feet of land that are commonly required in Texas's largest cities - except for Houston - according to a Texas Tribune analysis. While some lawmakers were wary about interfering in local control over the issue, supporters said the change will allow cities to build more housing and keep costs down.

Senate Bill 17 will ban governments, companies, and individuals who legally reside in China, North Korea, Russia, and Iran from owning land and properties in Texas. The governor also has the authority to add countries or entities to the list. The prohibition doesn't apply to U.S. citizens or permanent residents. The law's backers said this is about protecting resources and national security from hostile nations, while critics said SB 17 is discriminatory and will lead to racial profiling.

Senate Bill 33 will ban cities or counties from using their money to support residents seeking abortions outside Texas. The law followed Austin City Council's appropriation of $400,000 last year to help such individuals, prompting lawsuits from Attorney General Ken Paxton and a former council member. San Antonio City Council also allocated $500,000 for a reproductive justice fund in 2023, though it ended up not being used for abortion-related initiatives following a private lawsuit and much debate. It then approved $100,000 in April for abortion-related travel, which was temporarily blocked after Paxton sued.

House Bill 46 will expand the state's medical marijuana program to include patients with chronic pain, traumatic brain injury, and Crohn's disease. Physicians will also be able to prescribe inhalation via vaporized and aerosol products, such as vapes. This expansion will take effect while the Texas Legislature contemplates whether to regulate or ban hemp-derived THC products.

House Bill 229 will define man and woman based on biological reproductive systems and apply that definition across the state code. Government entities collecting vital statistics information will also have to use it. The law's backers said this is needed to protect women's rights and align with executive orders declaring that there are only two sexes. Critics said the law erases trans people from state records in Texas, home to one of the country's largest trans communities.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17705223_083125-ktrk-capitol-sw-img.png?w=1600,N,,2025-08-31 19:59:50.155623

Two complaints were filed against the California Air Resources Board (CARB). The Justice Department says CARB’s actions violate the Clean Air Act, which bars states from regulating vehicle emissions without a preemption waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Under the Biden administration, the EPA granted California waivers for two CARB regulations that imposed stricter emissions limits on heavy-duty trucks. Those rules were aimed at advancing California’s electric vehicle mandate and could be adopted by other states following California’s standards.

In June 2025, President Donald Trump signed congressional resolutions under the Congressional Review Act that nullified the EPA’s waivers. According to the DOJ, without those waivers, CARB is prohibited from enforcing its regulations, yet it is attempting to do so through the Clean Truck Partnership.

“Agreement, contract, partnership, mandate — whatever California wants to call it, this unlawful action attempts to undermine federal law,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson of the DOJ’s Environment and Natural Resources Division. “President Donald Trump and Congress have invalidated the Clean Air Act waivers that were the basis for California’s actions.

While the chargers have often been hidden under retail partners’ names such as Costco and Plaid Pantry, the new network ensures visibility on major mapping systems, including Tesla’s third-party charging program.

With a 96% positive PlugShare score, 90% session reliability, and 98% per-port uptime, Electric Era has become one of the most reliable providers in the industry. Nearly 70% of users are repeat customers, citing fast 200 kW charging speeds, dual CCS/NACS compatibility, and seamless tap-and-pay as standout features. The company, founded by former SpaceX engineer Quincy Lee, has applied aerospace-grade remote diagnostics and over-the-air repair methods to keep chargers operational, aiming to attract more retail and OEM partners like Ford, Rivian, and GM.

Fuel Retailers Urge DOT to Strengthen NEVI Guidance

NATSO, SIGMA, and the National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS) praised the U.S. Department of Transportation for addressing key challenges in the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) grant program while urging further refinements to ensure a consumer-focused, nationwide charging network. The groups commended the Interim Final Guidance for prioritizing sites that pair EV chargers with essential amenities—such as restrooms and foodservice—and for supporting site-host ownership models, which they argue will improve reliability and pricing.

The organizations recommended that states expedite funding for projects aligned with these priorities and reassess those that are not, establish clear criteria for when alternative fuel corridors are considered complete, allow for expansion at existing high-demand charging locations, and maintain the prohibition on commercial EV charging at interstate rest areas. They also cautioned against rate-of-return caps or revenue-sharing mandates, arguing these would deter private investment in a robust and competitive EV charging infrastructure.

ZM Trucks Opens U.S. Headquarters in Fontana

ZM Trucks, a manufacturer of zero-emission commercial vehicles, officially opened its new U.S. headquarters and assembly facility in Fontana, California, on August 28, 2025. The 9.67-acre site includes a 210,000-square-foot factory and marks the relocation of its regional headquarters to the region. The event featured the U.S. debut of the ZM8 commercial truck, reinforcing the company’s commitment to sustainable, cost-effective solutions for American fleets.

The grand opening follows key milestones this year, including the launch of the T75 fully electric terminal tractor and partnerships with logistics leaders such as Merlin Group and FleetNet. Despite policy uncertainty surrounding federal EV tax credits, emissions standards rollbacks, and shifting trade policies, ZM Trucks remains confident in its mission to help reduce transportation’s 28% share of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by delivering trucks with lower ownership costs and higher performance than diesel alternatives.

Teasers have revealed this updated version to boast a bolder, sleeker appearance that offers a host of new features for drivers to enjoy, such as sharper LED headlights and an updated NACS charging port compatible with Tesla’s Supercharger network.

The company took to Instagram to announce the revival of the model, which is advertised as a mass-produced EV model available to customers at an affordable price that will set the standard for future EVs to follow as the industry continues to grow.

You asked. We listened,” the post reads.

As of June 2025, electric vehicle sales represent around 35% of global vehicle sales and are expected to reach as much as 40% by 2030.

This is likely because EVs are not only cheaper on average than gas-powered vehicles — with prices still dropping for used models — but can also provide up to $1,500 in energy savings for gas and maintenance compared to gas-powered models as well.

Although the mining process for collecting materials like lithium to power EV batteries relies on dirty energy sources, which can emit several million tons of planet-heating gases into the air.

Research has found that we are still digging over 18.2 billion tons of coal, oil, and natural gas per year, which can only be replaced with cleaner energy sources if we are willing to work towards that transition.

In addition, a recent MIT study found that gasoline-powered vehicles, on average, emit about 350 grams of carbon pollution per mile over their lifetime, compared to only 200 grams per mile from EVs charged on the U.S. power grid, further highlighting the minimal environmental impact EVs have compared to gas-powered vehicles driven on a much broader scale.

In the first tests, charging at Walmart was about 42 cents per kilowatt-hour, which is a lower price than many private stations.
Total compatibility: plugs for everyone According to Walmart, it does not matter what electric car you have.","NEW YORK – Walmart has just jumped right into the world of electric cars, but no, it is not going to compete against Toyota and the others, instead they have announced that they are going to install thousands of electric chargers in the parking lots of their Walmart and Sam’s Club stores.

The country’s largest retailer wants to be the pioneer in setting up fast chargers in the parking lots of its stores, and intends to do it before 2030, that is why they have already started. Sustainability and… something more, don’t you think? They want people to come closer for their shopping and, between one thing and another, end up filling the cart! Innovation does not have to be separate from shopping and new customers, reports Union Rayo.

And pay attention, because they promise that their stations will be able to charge hundreds of miles of range in less than half an hour, and at a much lower price than other options. That means Walmart is going to be the best friend of drivers and the worst enemy of other brands! Charging the car and doing the shopping, all for less money and at the same time fighting pollution, is there a better plan?

Walmart’s new strategy

For now, Walmart has more than 5,200 stores across the country, that means if we look at it on a map, at least 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of one of its locations. So, taking advantage of this network, their plan becomes much more ambitious with the thousands of electric chargers they want to have available before the decade ends.

The process will be super easy, scan the charger code with the Walmart app itself, and charge the car! Fast, intuitive, and adapted to the digital era.

Cheap charging, less pollution

A gasoline car (a common one) emits more than five tons of pollutants per year. With an electric car, that disappears. That is why Walmart wants to emphasize that this step goes beyond business and is part of its commitment to a cleaner, more sustainable model.

And the wallet notices it too. Electric car owners spend up to 60% less on energy than those who use gasoline. In the first tests, charging at Walmart was about 42 cents per kilowatt-hour, which is a lower price than many private stations.

Total compatibility: plugs for everyone

According to Walmart, it does not matter what electric car you have. The chargers at their stations will be ready both for the CCS1 standard (used by most brands that are not Tesla), and for the NACS connector (popularized by Tesla and increasingly used by more manufacturers). So it does not matter if you drive a Ford, a Hyundai or a Tesla: you will be able to plug it in without any problem.

Charging and changing the model

Walmart is not only going to install chargers, what they are doing is standing right in the middle of the transportation transformation and saying: “here we are.” They want charging the car to become something everyday, easy and accessible for everyone. Going shopping, plugging in the car, and leaving with the bags… and the battery full. And here we all win, them on their side, the drivers on another… And the rest of the citizens win by emitting less pollutants.

And as if that were not enough, with this charger network they are stepping into a field where others like Ikea or some gas stations that have started to reinvent themselves are already present. Walmart, as always, is going to compete big. For now, all we can do is wish them luck and wait to see how these years develop with this plan!",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Flo-EV-chargers-790x474-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 19:00:22.880827

The summit brought together over 500 experts from across the public and private sectors, ranging from energy executives to environmental advocates, to explore innovations in energy, climate resilience, and sustainable growth.

This year’s theme was the energy transition, highlighting the interconnectedness of supply chains, environmental policy, and the urgent need for decarbonization. These themes align directly with NYLCV’s advocacy efforts, especially our push for investments in clean energy and transportation electrification across New York State.

Much of the conversation focused on the potential for business to utilize innovation and investment opportunities to drive progress as well as profits, a mindset that NYLCV highly encourages. As a nonpartisan organization committed to clean air, clean water, renewable energy, and open space, we know that the energy transition isn’t just necessary, it is an opportunity to reshape our economy for the better.

Global Discourse, Local Action

The summit offered a unique opportunity for NYLCV to engage with leaders from both the public and private sectors. The event explored topics ranging from offshore wind and compressed air energy storage to clean transportation and carbon markets, many areas where New York has already taken bold action.

Panels on emerging tech, such as long-duration storage and sustainable aviation fuel, underscored the importance of innovation in scaling emission reduction efforts. A particularly notable presentation by Canadian green energy company Hydrostor detailed how compressed air can be used to store off-peak energy and reduce reliance on peaker plants during times of high demand. Another presentation from an energy storage company highlighted how large-scale battery facilities can alleviate blackouts, a timely concern as heatwaves become more frequent in NYC. These technology applications reflect the same principles NYLCV supports in advocating for grid modernization and resilience at the state level.

Also highlighted was the growing momentum around environmental justice and community-based adaptation. Organizations like CORE, in conjunction with speakers such as Chelsea Clinton, emphasized the need for proactive rather than reactive resilience planning. This is particularly vital in in vulnerable areas facing exceptionally high climate risks. NYLCV’s efforts to increase local investment in parks and green infrastructure echoes this focus on equitable climate solutions that benefit historically marginalized communities.

National Voices Encourage State Leadership

Though the scale of the summit was global, many of the issues hit close to home. From electrifying bus fleets to building smarter, more equitable cities, NYCV’s priorities were reflected in nearly every conversation, a reminder that state and local governments can lead when federal efforts lag.

Former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, now with Bloomberg Philanthropies, delivered a keynote speech stressing the role individual states have in achieving climate targets. She emphasized that even in the absence of \ federal leadership, climate champions like New York must continue to lead on clean energy, emissions reductions, and environmental protections.

NYLCV’s mission to evaluate, endorse, and elect environmentally focused candidates remains essential in advancing this vision. Our work bridges the gap between grassroots advocacy and policy implementation, ensuring that ambitious climate goals are backed by political will and public support.

A Broader Perspective on the Energy Transition

Topics ranged broadly, from smart grid technologies to circular manufacturing. Whether discussing regenerative agriculture or advanced recycling systems, the summit reinforced that climate solutions must be integrated, interdisciplinary, and scalable.

Some other key insights from the conference included:

Expanding possibilities for public-private partnerships in funding the transition, including models supported by green banks and philanthropic capital, even in the face of unfavorable economic forecasts.

The need to better align climate finance and long-term infrastructure planning, particularly in high-cost, high-risk sectors like storage, carbon capture, and electrification.

Looking Ahead

NYLCV’s participation in Sustainability Week reaffirmed our role as a connector between local advocacy and national momentum. NYLCV remains committed to advancing policies that accelerate the energy transition, promote climate equity, and ensure that environmental leadership in New York continues to influence both national and global progress.",https://www.nylcv.org/wp-content/uploads/solar-copy-of-blog-header.png,N,,2025-08-31 19:00:26.210890

Utilities face several challenges as they address an increasing number of outages. About 83% of major U.S. power outages between 2000 and 2021 were driven by weather-related events, according to Climate Central.

As customers grapple with these rising power interruptions, 65% report that they’re frustrated with utilities’ impersonal communications.

However, utilities can now address this communications challenge by taking advantage of AI. Rather than simply reacting to outages as they happen, power providers can embrace intelligent, customized, and proactive messaging that humanizes these crises for their customers.

Utilities that adopt such options make customers happy. Those that have improved their communications have experienced increased customer satisfaction, according to the J.D. Power 2024 Electric Utility Business Customer Satisfaction Study. Partly due to enhanced communication, business customer satisfaction with electric utilities in 2024 increased 30 points on a 1,000-point scale.

A separate study from J.D. Power points to the pluses of using a suite of communication methods.

The J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Utility Digital Experience Study found that the largest electric, natural gas, and water utilities in the U.S. are not embracing the use of websites and mobile apps for communicating with customers – and they should be.

These are the most effective customer communication channels available to utilities, the study said.

Beyond Traditional Emergency Alerts: The Workflow Revolution

As the J.D. Power report suggests, boosting customer satisfaction requires adding new communication methods. Forward-looking utilities are no longer relying on traditional one-way emergency notifications.

Utilities can now send more detailed messages from multiple channels and customize them for customers in different locations or for those who speak different languages. This allows them to tailor messages to meet various customers’ needs. In addition, two-way communication is becoming more common. Customers are now able to communicate with their power providers about outages and other issues through various channels. They can text, call, email, send messages using chatbots on utility websites, or through utilities’ social media. They can also specify which type of communication they prefer.

AI plays a vital role in this evolution of emergency communication. AI enables more flexible workflows. These are a group of pre-set steps that perform specific tasks such as data manipulation. Workflows serve as the building blocks of communication–and with AI, these building blocks can be used over and over, rearranged, or assembled in various ways to meet different customers’ needs. As building blocks, workflows are part of a larger automated system that provides what’s needed to execute everyday tasks.

The Intelligence Factor: Purpose-built workflows that anticipate customer needs during crises

With AI, workflows can not only be rearranged; they can be built to predict what customers will need during emergencies. In real time, they can adjust and escalate messaging as emergency conditions evolve.

If, for instance, a utility needs to warn people in one location to evacuate because of a hurricane, flooding, or other crisis, the utility can increase the frequency of messaging. Utilities can also geotarget their messaging to specific, smaller portions of their territories.

In addition, intelligent workflows can coordinate customer communication with what’s happening in the field. This might mean that a small group of customers reports an outage, then the utility informs a larger, targeted group in the area affected that their power is out. As soon as more information is available, the utility will explain what’s happening in the field. A tree has fallen on a line, and it will take three hours to restore power, for example.

Hyper-Personalized Emergency Messaging

With intelligent workflows, messaging can be hyper-personalized at scale. Utilities can establish workflows that automatically select the optimal communication channels for each customer, based on their preferences. Power providers can also focus on cultural sensitivity, sending multilingual emergency communications that are more likely to help customers understand what’s happening when they face power interruptions–and how to respond. These messaging options help build customer trust. In their native language, customers learn more quickly and in greater detail about when a storm is coming or whether they need to find an alternative power source for their medical devices. Keeping customers informed in this way can reduce anxiety during service disruptions.

How Customer Responses Inform Emergency Response Priorities

Smart workflows allow two-way communication to take place in real time. As utilities receive input from customers about the timing and location of outages, they can gain critical awareness about the location of outages–and how much an outage affects specific customers–allowing utilities to prioritize their response. Thus, with customer feedback, utilities have a comprehensive situational awareness of what’s happening on the ground.

Intelligent workflows allow utilities to message about both emergency and non-emergency situations. They can automatically respond to real-time triggers such as hurricane warnings, red flag alerts about the potential for wildfires, and demand response programs. In these cases, organizations can send text, email, voice, and app notifications to customers based on their messaging preferences.

As they’re communicating with customers about emergencies, utilities can personalize and segment their messages based on customers’ location and customer profiles. These tailored communications are more relevant to customers and more likely to engage them.

Using Data From Customers to Identify Potential Problems

With the help of AI, utilities can anticipate and respond to customers’ needs. AI can analyze data that includes customers’ consumption history, weather forecasts, prices, and customer interactions. It can also analyze data from sensors and smart meters to predict potential equipment failures and schedule maintenance proactively, which can minimize downtime. This allows power providers to act on critical issues before they become problems.

Responding proactively builds trust in customers. Utilities can also build trust by turning regulatory requirements into opportunities.

Utilities must comply with specific requirements from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and state utility commissions about environmental, customer privacy, worker safety, reliability, and other issues. Intelligent workflows can help by creating opportunities to boost customer satisfaction.

For example, during a crisis, utilities are allowed to circumvent some regulations to contact customers without permission, and intelligent workflows make this happen quickly. This is important because it’s critical to deliver messages on time, especially for medically vulnerable customers. Those who may rely on electricity-powered medical devices learn as soon as possible that they may need to find an alternative way to power the devices, which helps these customers understand they can trust the utility to inform them about service interruptions when they need it most.

In addition, regulations call for utilities to conduct safety inspections of gas lines and electrical equipment periodically. Intelligent workflows can transform these visits into comprehensive home energy consultations. While inspectors are already on-site for safety checks, they can offer customized efficiency recommendations, identify rebate opportunities, and even schedule follow-up services. While customers might view these visits as intrusive, utilities could turn them into a valuable service that customers appreciate.

Customer satisfaction also increases when utilities communicate accurately and quickly during emergencies.

A J.D. Power residential customer satisfaction survey found that utilities that communicate effectively during outages and other emergencies score higher in customer satisfaction metrics than those that don’t communicate as well. When utilities proactively inform customers about outages, infrastructure improvements, utility programs, and services, or about ways to save on utility bills, they experience a positive increase in overall satisfaction.

How Consistent, Reliable communication strengthens community preparedness

Proactive and accurate communication also helps communities prepare for disasters.

During hurricanes, flooding, wildfires, and other natural disasters, utility services are critical to expediting emergency responses. For example, emergency responders need electricity to do their job, and customers may rely on electricity to power their medical devices or for cooling during heatwaves. When high winds and storms damage powerlines and substations, homeowners, businesses, and facilities such as hospitals and water treatment plants need to be informed quickly and accurately.

Intelligent workflows can provide the timely information that allows communities to prepare for and respond to disasters. These workflows also enable customers to report where and when outages occur, helping utilities make decisions that protect communities.

How AI Supports Technology Integration and implementation

As utilities cope with emergencies, they can take advantage of AI-powered workflows that work with numerous technologies. This yields seamless system integration. For example, the workflows can inform weather monitoring tools and systems.

This leads to real-time weather updates about challenges such as lightning and high winds. Utilities can also use advanced data analytics about issues such as customer preferences to escalate communications. They can integrate with supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems that pull together and analyze information from sensors and devices, allowing for automated control of equipment.

Utility-grade SCADA weather stations are designed for utilities and SCADA operations that rely on DNP3 and/or Modbus protocols, providing weather station measurements in a configurable, turn-key package. They include fast-to-field features that simplify installation and commissioning.

Utilities can use weather monitoring systems to activate alarms for notification and control based on specific weather criteria, including precipitation accumulation, high or low temperatures, and high wind speeds.

AI-powered workflow integration can improve utilities’ response to outages. For example, a single platform that integrates customer relationship management data with work data can give utilities visibility into and enhance efficiency in outage response efforts. By unifying these views onto one platform, utilities can more easily automate storm response, from logistics to communications to resource management.

With smart workflows, utilities can continue to embrace personalized messaging–based on customers’ language, location, and communication preferences, even during emergencies when millions of emergency interactions are needed.

Adopting Best Practices

To make the most of AI-powered messaging and intelligent workflows, utilities can adopt best practices. They should begin with clear objectives and should map out customer journeys – roadmaps of how customers interact with their power providers. These roadmaps can be used to identify automation opportunities.

Customer roadmaps aim to understand a customer’s perspective at various stages of interaction. This process involves understanding customers’ pain points and emotions. Utilities should begin this process by identifying their specific goals–improving satisfaction, retaining customers, or improving outage management, for example.

Organizations can then build profiles of varying customer segments, focusing on demographics, usage patterns, or specific needs. Utilities can create profiles for residential customers, businesses, low-income homeowners, or medically vulnerable customers, for instance.

Next, utilities can identify possible interactions such as phone calls, social media communication, or outage notifications. They can then determine which tools customers use in these interactions, including text, email, phone calls, or chatbots. Organizations should also identify the feelings and motivations underlying these communications. They can use surveys and interviews to pull together information about how customers are feeling and behaving during each type of interaction.

Using this information, utilities can determine which circumstances make customers unhappy. They can then identify opportunities to boost customer satisfaction. They can implement changes based on these maps. Organizations should constantly update the maps as more data becomes available.

During this process, it’s essential to integrate data–such as demographic information about customers–and ensure that workflows can adapt to changing customer needs and new regulations.

Prioritizing Human-Centered Design to Maintain Trust and Create Empathy

Customer roadmaps can help utilities focus on human-centered design, concentrating on the needs of customers and showing empathy for them. This can help develop relationships with customers that build trust and satisfaction.

The customer roadmaps help organizations understand customers’ motivations, preferences, and utility service challenges. In addition, utilities can turn to focus groups and interviews to understand their customers better.

As part of this process, utilities need to identify the challenges they want to address and the customers who are best suited to provide feedback about them. It’s essential to create a straightforward plan.

Human-centered design creates higher levels of customer engagement and helps customers feel more empowered.

Practical Applications of Smart Workflows

When utilities have identified challenges, created customer roadmaps, and focused on human-centered design, they can use these tools in emergency response. For example, with automated alerts from customers’ preferred channels, power providers can keep customers informed, reducing their anxiety during emergencies.

Intelligent workflows also benefit non-emergency communications. They can minimize billing and service notifications, reducing errors and delivering vital information promptly.

For example, utilities depend on automated billing to determine customers' bills. These are based on changing consumption rates. These systems integrate with smart meters and internet-connected devices that monitor usage in real time and base bills on actual consumption. Utilities can detect unusual usage patterns that might alert them to approaching service disruptions.

Smart meters enable automated and accurate meter readings, cutting the need for manual meter reading processes. This reduces the possibility of human errors, estimated bills, and disputes between consumers and utility providers.

Intelligent workflows also optimize workforce efficiency and shorten response times. Intelligent chatbots and other innovative tools allow customers to resolve problems quickly, which frees up staff to address different issues.

Case Study: Crisis Communication in Action

The Mansfield Municipal Electric Department, which serves 10,000 customers in northeast Massachusetts, realized many of the benefits of intelligent workflows for crisis response. The utility was seeking a more responsive and tailored way to message residents about outages. Mansfield Electric was using traditional messaging options that lacked personalization and speed. And the town of Mansfield’s mass notification system wasn’t sophisticated enough to target customers impacted by service disruptions. At the time, the town’s manual outreach programs were plagued by operational inefficiencies, leaving customers either unaware of or unprepared for emergencies.

Such challenges reflect growing pressures on utilities.

“Utilities today face unprecedented pressure to modernize without compromising compliance, cost, or customer trust,” said Scott McClintock, chief revenue officer at Convey. “At Convey, we empower them to do exactly that, delivering proactive, intelligent communications that meet the moment and evolve with customer expectations.""

A fast deployment of AI-powered messaging for Mansfield Electric

To address the moment’s challenges, Mansfield Electric chose Convey’s REACH Cloud Preference Center to meet its goals, rolling out the program in March 2024. Deployment time was short – only 45 days. Now, the town’s utility benefits from multichannel messaging – proactive updates via voice, text, and email that will help the utility respond to crises. The utility can now send timely, relevant information to help customers make informed plans during outages.

Town leadership has recorded personalized text-to-speech and voice messages, which create familiarity and trust among customers, especially during power emergencies. In addition, the REACH Cloud dashboard allows the utility to track community engagement.

As a result, Mansfield Electric has experienced improvements in customer satisfaction, reduced call volume, and operational efficiency – all improvements that will help the utility provide more effective emergency communications and response.

The Future of Emergency Communications

The next generation of intelligent workflows takes advantage of AI tools that are capable of interpreting, acting, and adapting in real time, moving from static scripts to dynamic, self-healing processes. This enables predictive maintenance, autonomous grid management, and the integration of new communication channels.

With AI-driven workflows, utilities deliver personalized service 24/7, reduce their support costs, improve employee productivity, and enhance customer satisfaction. In the future, these advantages will be expanded to the entire grid, which will include AI-enhanced grid intelligence, enabling autonomous decision-making and improved resiliency.

Utilities that implement advanced emergency communication will gain a competitive edge through more effective and personalized communications and improved public safety and resilience.

As the J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Utility Digital Experience Study pointed out, utilities must focus on modern communication strategies such as websites and mobile apps to boost customer satisfaction. Technology that focuses on showing empathy and the human element of emergency response is also essential.

The electric utility landscape will continue to evolve, and utilities must embrace a strategic approach to AI adoption, relying on the many new emergency response tools available as a result of AI.

Utilities that embrace intelligent, automated, and empathetic messaging are likely to thrive in an industry facing increasing climate-change-driven power disruptions.

""We’re no longer just a messaging company. With AI at the core of our strategy, Convey is redefining how regulated industries engage with their customers, seamlessly orchestrating journeys, reducing operational costs, and setting a new standard for intelligent communication,"" said Maulik Datanwala, CEO of Convey.",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-31 18:01:26.403928

Lawmakers are coming back to D.C. this week after their August recess. Starting Tuesday, they'll be back on Capitol Hill and facing a long to-do list, with the risk of a government shutdown looming in the background. Now, stop us if you've heard that one before. Joining us now to help preview what's on the agenda is NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales. Hi, Claudia.

CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good morning, Ayesha.

RASCOE: So I hope you enjoyed the recess. It sounds like there will be lots to take care of when lawmakers return. Where should we start?

GRISALES: Probably what you just mentioned, funding the government. That's likely the hardest job on tap. The deadline to do that is September 30. So when lawmakers get back, they'll have less than a month to approve regular appropriations bills. That's a process that can take months, and they're already very much behind. Many say it's a fantasy they'll get there. For example, many House Republicans just want to approve another stopgap measure that will keep funding levels static. Then, underlying all of this, we have seen this Republican-led Congress cede their power of the purse to the president again and again. For example, this summer, they passed a rescissions package from the White House that clawed back $9 billion in foreign aid and funding for public media. So we're expecting President Trump to have a lot to say here. And Democrats say they're going to fight these efforts in a new way.

RASCOE: So then the nearly evergreen question - could we be headed toward a shutdown at the end of the month?

GRISALES: It's possible. We have heard discussion that some lawmakers would approve a shorter-term stopgap measure, say for a month, for example, to give them time to negotiate. Democrats, for example, they have faced demands from their base to do more when it comes to these funding battles. For example, earlier this year, minority leader Chuck Schumer made way for a GOP stopgap spending plan to move forward, but he paid the price with a lot of blowback from the base. So Democrats are expecting to do a lot more fighting this time around. So that means Republicans could face a roadblock when it comes to passing a funding measure if Senate Democrats filibuster that effort.

RASCOE: The Jeffrey Epstein issue is also waiting for lawmakers to take it back up after garnering so much attention this summer. Where do things stand there?

GRISALES: Right. They're coming back - Republicans - to quite the crossroads here because they have heard demands from their own base about presenting more transparency on this case, and that they haven't delivered on campaign promises to release files related to this. Now, we did see the House Oversight Committee have a busy August. They issued subpoenas for documents and witness testimony. The Justice Department started turning over files from its investigation into Epstein to the committee, and the Republican chairman, James Comer of Kentucky, says he intends to make the records public. But Democrats are going to have a lot to say. They're arguing that Comer is slow-walking the process. They say the release will be far from comprehensive once the public gets to see it. And they have a key ally in Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie. He's teamed up with Democrats to try to force a vote on a full release of the records on the House floor come next week.

RASCOE: OK. Quickly, what else are you watching for from Congress?

GRISALES: Well, we know the Senate left in the midst of fighting over approving President Trump's nominees. That will likely pick up. And lawmakers will need to face the music on a lot of issues that boiled over during recess. Republicans saw a blowback on the major bill that they passed earlier this summer from Trump's demands. And Trump has also exerted more influence on the Federal Reserve. And we've seen a lot of chaos at the CDC and expect a lot from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. when he testifies later this week.

RASCOE: That's NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales. Thanks, Claudia.

The lithium market has experienced a dramatic decline since its peak in 2022, but recent data suggests a potential turnaround may be underway. After plummeting nearly 90% from its highs, prices have begun showing signs of recovery in mid-2025. For investors and industry participants, the critical question remains: Is lithium rebounding for real this time?

What Caused the Lithium Market Crash?

The Perfect Storm of Oversupply and Demand Slowdown

The lithium market experienced a dramatic decline from its 2022 peak, when prices reached approximately A$6,000/mt. By June 2025, prices had plummeted to four-year lows of US$610/t, representing a staggering 90% drop. This collapse resulted from multiple converging factors creating perfect market conditions for a price crash.

The rapid capacity expansion by producers globally coincided with slower-than-expected electric vehicle adoption rates in Western markets. Meanwhile, substantial inventory buildup throughout the supply chain created a significant oversupply situation that the market couldn't absorb quickly enough.

How Chinese Production Flooded the Market

Chinese producers played a particularly significant role in the market oversupply, aggressively expanding their lithium processing capacity between 2022-2024. This domestic production increase wasn't happening in isolation – it occurred alongside substantial imports from emerging producers in Africa and South America.

The combined effect created a supply glut that pushed prices down to levels where many operations became economically unviable. Chinese capacity expansion wasn't just about volume; it also included technological improvements that allowed processors to handle lower-grade resources more efficiently, further pressuring high-cost producers elsewhere.

What Are the Signs of a Lithium Market Recovery?

Recent Price Movements Show Positive Momentum

Recent market data indicates a potential recovery underway in the lithium sector. CIF China prices for 6% concentrate have risen to $945-955/mt, while other sources report prices between $778-858/mt. Though still far below the 2022 peak, these figures represent a significant improvement from June's four-year lows.

The upward trajectory suggests market sentiment may be shifting from bearish to cautiously optimistic. Price movements have been accompanied by increased trading volumes, particularly in Chinese spot markets, indicating genuine buyer interest rather than speculative activity.

Supply Rationalization Is Finally Taking Effect

The market is experiencing meaningful supply rationalization as unprofitable operations shut down:

Multiple Australian mines including Bald Hill and Ngungaju have suspended operations

High-cost Chinese operations have scaled back production significantly

Zimbabwe projects have reduced output in response to low prices

A significant mine closure in China due to licensing issues has removed approximately 3-8% of global lithium supply

This supply discipline is creating the conditions necessary for price recovery, with lithium carbonate futures in China responding positively, climbing 1.8% to 8,000 yuan/ton. The market appears to be entering a more balanced state after years of oversupply.

Chinese authorities have also implemented stricter enforcement of mining permits, specifically targeting operations contributing to oversupply conditions. This regulatory approach represents a strategic shift that could provide longer-term support for price stability.

How Strong Are the Demand Fundamentals?

EV Market Growth Continues Despite Headwinds

While EV adoption rates have slowed from their earlier explosive growth, the overall trajectory remains positive. China continues to lead global EV adoption, with steady growth in Europe and North America. Analysts project lithium demand growth of approximately 26% in 2025, reaching 1.46 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE).

BYD's rising popularity in the electric vehicle market has reignited investor attention toward the EV sector's long-term potential. The company's success demonstrates that consumer preferences are increasingly favoring electric models, supporting fundamental demand for lithium batteries.

Region EV Sales Growth (YoY) Market Penetration China 18-22% 31% Europe 12-15% 24% North America 15-18% 10% Global Average 16-20% 19%

Diversified Demand Sources Strengthen the Outlook

Beyond EVs, additional demand sources are emerging that provide resilience to the lithium market:

Grid-scale energy storage systems deploying at accelerated rates

Robotics and automation technologies requiring high-performance batteries

Consumer electronics with larger batteries and longer lifecycles

Industrial applications expanding beyond traditional uses

This diversification creates a more resilient demand profile less dependent on a single sector, potentially reducing future market volatility. Energy storage deployments in particular are growing at over 30% annually, creating significant new lithium demand that wasn't fully factored into earlier market projections.

How Are Companies Positioning for the Recovery?

Operational Strategies Reflect Cautious Optimism

Mining companies are implementing strategic plans in anticipation of market improvement:

Core Lithium has unveiled a restart plan for its mothballed project, with improved margins and an increased resource estimate of 48.5Mt @ 1.26% lithium

Major players like Rio Tinto, Albemarle, SQM, and Ganfeng are pursuing M&A opportunities and operational efficiencies

Cost reduction initiatives are widespread across the sector, with producers focusing on lowering break-even points

Innovative processing technologies are being deployed to improve recovery rates and reduce operating expenses

These actions indicate industry confidence in an eventual market recovery, though timing remains uncertain. Companies appear to be positioning for a multi-year upswing rather than a quick return to peak prices.

Investment Activity Shows Renewed Interest

Market participants are showing signs of renewed interest in the lithium sector:

Some fund managers, including Argonaut and Ten Cap, have reportedly taken positions against short-sellers

Analysts from major financial institutions, including CBA's Vivek Dhar, have begun calling the bottom of the market

Capital raising activities for lithium projects have seen improved investor reception

Strategic investments by automakers seeking to secure supply chains are increasing

This renewed investment interest suggests growing confidence that the worst of the downturn may be over. However, the investment community remains cautious, with most participants waiting for clearer signals before making major commitments.

Why Should Investors Remain Cautious?

Supply Disruptions May Be Temporary

While recent supply disruptions have helped prices recover, there's uncertainty about their longevity. The Chinese mine shutdown that sparked the recent rally could potentially be reversed if licensing issues are resolved. Analysts generally expect a more sustainable recovery in 2026 rather than immediately.

Commodity market bottoms typically involve a multi-month base-building phase, sometimes with price retests before a stronger uptrend emerges. History suggests that premature enthusiasm about price recoveries can lead to disappointing investment outcomes.

Inventory Levels Remain Elevated

Despite production cuts, significant inventory overhang persists throughout the supply chain:

China's chemical inventories have increased by approximately 35,000 tonnes since January 2025

This inventory buildup must be absorbed before a sustained price recovery can take hold

The market is still projected to have a modest surplus in 2025, with a potential transition to deficit only by 2026

Inventory Category Current Level Change vs. 12 Months Ago Months of Supply Raw Material Elevated +25% 3.2 Chemical Intermediates High +35% 2.8 Refined Products Moderate +10% 1.9

These inventory levels represent a substantial headwind that must be worked through before prices can sustain higher levels. The timeline for this inventory reduction depends on both production discipline and demand growth.

Price-Sensitive Supply Could Quickly Return

If prices stabilize or recover significantly, idled capacity could quickly restart:

Projects like Core Lithium's Finniss operation could resume production

Producers in regions like Zimbabwe, Nigeria, and China could re-enter the market

This elastic supply response could cap price recovery

Many operations that have been temporarily suspended maintain their equipment and permits, allowing for rapid restart once economics improve. This creates a ceiling effect for prices until demand growth can absorb both existing inventory and potential returning supply.

Alternative Investments Remain Attractive

Investor capital that exited lithium has found homes in other commodities, particularly gold. For lithium to attract significant investment flows back from safe-haven assets would require compelling evidence of a sustained recovery, not just short-term price movements.

Gold's historical role as a hedge against economic uncertainty has strengthened its appeal during lithium's downturn. Without a dramatic shift in broader economic conditions or a substantial acceleration in lithium demand, this capital reallocation may be slow to reverse.

What Are Customers and Partners Signaling?

Mixed Signals from End Users

Recent developments from lithium customers and joint venture partners present a mixed picture:

Liontown reported that US automaker Ford has reduced its committed purchase volumes

IGO fully impaired its stake in the Kwinana lithium hydroxide facility

Most producers with restart plans have not committed to specific timelines, preferring to wait for sustained price improvement

Cost reduction remains a primary focus across the industry

These signals suggest caution among major industry participants despite the recent price improvements. Battery manufacturers and automakers appear to be adopting a wait-and-see approach before making significant new commitments to lithium purchases.

""While we're seeing some positive price momentum, customers remain hesitant to lock in long-term contracts until they see clear evidence of sustained market recovery. The psychology of the market remains cautious after experiencing such dramatic price volatility."" – Industry analyst

What Price Level Would Confirm a New Bull Market?

The US$1,000/mt Threshold

Market analysts suggest that sustained prices above US$1,000/mt would provide stronger evidence of a new bull market in lithium. This level would support the economics of many currently idled operations and potentially trigger restart decisions. Until prices reach and maintain this threshold, the recovery remains tentative.

This price point is particularly significant because it represents a level where approximately 60-70% of global production capacity can operate profitably. Sustained trading above this level would indicate a fundamental shift in market dynamics rather than a temporary fluctuation.

Watching for Sustained Demand Growth

Beyond price levels, investors should monitor EV sales growth rates, particularly in China, Europe, and North America. Accelerating adoption would provide fundamental support for higher lithium prices. Additionally, energy storage deployment trends will offer insights into the diversification of lithium demand beyond the automotive sector.

Key metrics to watch include:

Monthly EV sales figures in major markets

Battery manufacturing capacity utilization rates

Grid-scale energy storage project announcements

Consumer electronics replacement cycles and battery capacity trends

Positive momentum across these indicators would suggest a robust foundation for sustained lithium price recovery.

How Should Investors Approach the Lithium Sector?

Selective Positioning Based on Cost Structure

Not all lithium producers are created equal. Companies with low-cost operations, strong balance sheets, and strategic partnerships are better positioned to weather continued volatility and capitalize on the eventual recovery.

Investors should focus on producers with:

First or second quartile cost positions

Diverse customer relationships beyond a single geography

Financial strength to withstand further market weakness

High-quality resources with favorable mineralogy

Clear path to value-added products rather than just raw materials

These characteristics provide resilience during market uncertainty while offering significant upside potential when prices recover more substantially.

Balancing Opportunity with Risk Management

While signs of recovery are emerging, the lithium market remains volatile. A balanced approach might include:

Establishing initial positions in quality producers with strong balance sheets

Maintaining cash reserves for potential market pullbacks

Diversifying across the battery materials supply chain

Setting clear price targets for both entry and exit

Focusing on companies with multiple potential catalysts beyond just lithium price recovery

This measured strategy acknowledges the potential for continued market volatility while positioning for long-term sector growth. Furthermore, investors might consider keeping an eye on Australia lithium innovations which could significantly impact production costs and efficiency.

FAQs About the Lithium Market Recovery

Will lithium prices return to 2022 peak levels?

Most analysts consider the 2022 price spike an anomaly driven by supply chain disruptions and panic buying. While prices are expected to recover from current lows, a return to those extreme levels is unlikely in the near term. A more sustainable price range of $1,000-2,500/mt appears realistic based on cost curves and demand projections.

How are Chinese EV sales affecting lithium demand?

Chinese EV sales continue to grow, though at a more moderate pace than in previous years. The success of manufacturers like BYD has highlighted the ongoing transition to electric mobility, supporting lithium demand fundamentals. China's domestic policies continue to favor EV adoption, providing a solid foundation for lithium demand growth.

What impact will new lithium extraction technologies have?

Direct lithium extraction technologies could potentially increase supply and lower costs, but widespread commercial deployment remains several years away. These technologies are unlikely to significantly impact the market before 2027-2028. Technical challenges and capital requirements for scaling these solutions mean they represent a longer-term evolution rather than an immediate disruption.

How are geopolitical factors influencing the lithium market?

Supply chain security concerns and geopolitical tensions have increased interest in developing lithium resources in politically stable jurisdictions. This could lead to premium pricing for non-Chinese supply in the medium term. Western governments are increasingly supporting domestic battery supply chains, creating potential advantages for producers in those regions. Additionally, India's lithium strategy is emerging as a significant factor in the global market.

Further Exploration

Lithium's position as a critical material for the energy transition ensures its long-term importance, despite current market challenges. The sector's recovery trajectory will likely be influenced by both macroeconomic factors and industry-specific developments in the coming years.

For investors, the current environment offers both risks and opportunities. Those with a longer-term perspective may find value in selectively building positions in quality producers while maintaining appropriate risk management strategies. As with any commodity market, timing will be challenging, but the structural growth story remains intact.

Monitoring key indicators across the supply chain – from mining activity to battery production to end-user demand – will provide valuable insights into the strength and sustainability of lithium's market recovery. In particular, developments in Argentina lithium insights and Thacker Pass production trends can offer early signals of how global supply dynamics are evolving.

According to a recent analysis by S&P Global, while lithium prices are showing signs of recovery, there remains debate about whether the rebound will be sustained in the longer term. Similarly, market observers at Stockhead have questioned if we're finally seeing the end of what they call the ""long lithium winter"" that has plagued the sector since 2022.

Just over a week ago, the Trump Administration ordered wind companies to stop construction on a wind farm off the Rhode Island coast.
Offshore wind power is particularly useful for the state because it produces at night, when solar power goes away.
President Trump put a moratorium on the development of new offshore wind projects on his first day in office.
More than 80 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been planned in the U.S., but their future has gotten murkier.","The Trump administration is cancelling $679 million in federal funding for ports to support the country's offshore wind industry, the latest move in President Trump's ongoing campaign against wind power.

Offshore wind is still a developing industry in the U.S., while Europe already has thousands of wind turbines in deep ocean waters. Those offshore turbines are dramatically larger than ones on land and require substantial infrastructure at ports for construction, from large assembly facilities to deepwater docks for ships that carry turbines out to sea.

Ports around the country hoped to seize the economic opportunity to become hubs for the wind industry. Under the Biden administration, 12 port projects from California to Virginia were granted funds, all of which the Trump administration said on Friday it was either withdrawing or cancelling.

""Wasteful wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America's maritime industry,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in announcing the decision. He said if possible, the funding would be redirected to ""address critical port upgrades.""

Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., who represents an area that lost funding, said in a statement, ""This is a new level of idiocracy, where the Trump administration is trying to destroy an entire sector of clean energy, kill thousands of good paying jobs, and drive up electricity prices for American consumers.""

Just over a week ago, the Trump Administration ordered wind companies to stop construction on a wind farm off the Rhode Island coast. Trump is a long-time critic of wind power, claiming it's expensive and kills birds. He has pushed for cuts to tax incentives for wind and solar, which analyses have shown could raise electricity prices around the country.

The wind industry is reeling from the recent decisions, a marked change from a few years ago when the growing demand for electricity spurred a surge in announcements for new wind projects.

""The federal [Trump] administration ran on rebuilding back America, building infrastructure, creating U.S. jobs, creating manufacturing – this project does all of that,"" said Chris Mikkelsen, executive director of the Port of Humboldt Bay, one of the ports that had its project funding canceled.

Bringing industry to a rural port

The federal grants were directed at creating wind manufacturing and logistics hubs, including in Maryland, Massachusetts and Staten Island in New York. The project that took the biggest hit is in Humboldt Bay in Northern California, which is losing out on more than $426 million.

The port is located in a rural part of the state, five hours north of San Francisco. For decades, it supported the local timber industry, which has waned significantly over the years. In 2022, the federal government held the first offshore lease for wind power in California, a sign the industry would be poised to take off. Mikkelsen says it represents a huge economic opportunity for his area.

""It's the biggest we've seen in the century, there's no doubt about it,"" Mikkelsen said. ""We're not talking about entry-level jobs. These are very skilled, very high-paying jobs. Jobs here in Humboldt County are in desperate need.""

The federal grant represented a significant part of funding needed for the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind Heavy Lift Marine Terminal Project, which would also leverage private and state investment. The port planned to use it to clean up and remediate polluted areas, build facilities for handling the turbine parts, dredge the waterway and build a larger wharf capable of handling pieces of steel longer than a football field.

With the funding cancellation, Mikkelsen says he hopes it's just a pause for the project, since California continues to push for renewable energy. The state has a goal of getting 100% of its electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2045. Offshore wind power is particularly useful for the state because it produces at night, when solar power goes away.

""This hurts a little bit, but it doesn't change our focus and it certainly doesn't change our outcome,"" Mikkelsen said. ""An administration can't change the fact that the U.S. has incredible energy demands.""

Turmoil for the wind industry

Electricity demand is growing across the country, especially as new data centers are built for artificial intelligence. Solar and wind projects produce cheaper energy on average than fossil fuels projects that run on natural gas and coal, though the cost can vary greatly depending on the location and type of project. The Biden administration set a goal of getting 30 gigawatts of power from offshore wind by 2030, enough for around 10 million homes. An analysis found that plan could create 77,000 jobs, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a federal research lab.

President Trump put a moratorium on the development of new offshore wind projects on his first day in office. In cancelling the Rhode Island wind project, the administration stated it was for the ""protection of national security interests,"" but did not elaborate on what those are specifically.

""We're not allowing any windmills to go up,"" Trump said earlier this week. ""Unless there's a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago, we don't allow windmills.""

More than 80 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been planned in the U.S., but their future has gotten murkier. Interest rates have gone up, making financing more challenging. Turmoil in the industry could also make it harder to attract investment. But many companies are hoping it's a passing phase, given the overall demand for electricity.

""We will have an offshore wind industry in this country because it's hard to imagine we can bring the kind of power we need to the coasts without it,"" said Jason Grumet, chief executive officer of the American Clean Power Association, a renewable energy industry group. ""But at the moment the industry is very worried because projects are being cancelled with virtually no rationale.""

Lawmakers are coming back to D.C. this week after their August recess. Starting Tuesday, they'll be back on Capitol Hill and facing a long to-do list, with the risk of a government shutdown looming in the background. Now, stop us if you've heard that one before. Joining us now to help preview what's on the agenda is NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales. Hi, Claudia.

CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good morning, Ayesha.

RASCOE: So I hope you enjoyed the recess. It sounds like there will be lots to take care of when lawmakers return. Where should we start?

GRISALES: Probably what you just mentioned, funding the government. That's likely the hardest job on tap. The deadline to do that is September 30. So when lawmakers get back, they'll have less than a month to approve regular appropriations bills. That's a process that can take months, and they're already very much behind. Many say it's a fantasy they'll get there. For example, many House Republicans just want to approve another stopgap measure that will keep funding levels static. Then, underlying all of this, we have seen this Republican-led Congress cede their power of the purse to the president again and again. For example, this summer, they passed a rescissions package from the White House that clawed back $9 billion in foreign aid and funding for public media. So we're expecting President Trump to have a lot to say here. And Democrats say they're going to fight these efforts in a new way.

RASCOE: So then the nearly evergreen question - could we be headed toward a shutdown at the end of the month?

GRISALES: It's possible. We have heard discussion that some lawmakers would approve a shorter-term stopgap measure, say for a month, for example, to give them time to negotiate. Democrats, for example, they have faced demands from their base to do more when it comes to these funding battles. For example, earlier this year, minority leader Chuck Schumer made way for a GOP stopgap spending plan to move forward, but he paid the price with a lot of blowback from the base. So Democrats are expecting to do a lot more fighting this time around. So that means Republicans could face a roadblock when it comes to passing a funding measure if Senate Democrats filibuster that effort.

RASCOE: The Jeffrey Epstein issue is also waiting for lawmakers to take it back up after garnering so much attention this summer. Where do things stand there?

GRISALES: Right. They're coming back - Republicans - to quite the crossroads here because they have heard demands from their own base about presenting more transparency on this case, and that they haven't delivered on campaign promises to release files related to this. Now, we did see the House Oversight Committee have a busy August. They issued subpoenas for documents and witness testimony. The Justice Department started turning over files from its investigation into Epstein to the committee, and the Republican chairman, James Comer of Kentucky, says he intends to make the records public. But Democrats are going to have a lot to say. They're arguing that Comer is slow-walking the process. They say the release will be far from comprehensive once the public gets to see it. And they have a key ally in Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie. He's teamed up with Democrats to try to force a vote on a full release of the records on the House floor come next week.

RASCOE: OK. Quickly, what else are you watching for from Congress?

GRISALES: Well, we know the Senate left in the midst of fighting over approving President Trump's nominees. That will likely pick up. And lawmakers will need to face the music on a lot of issues that boiled over during recess. Republicans saw a blowback on the major bill that they passed earlier this summer from Trump's demands. And Trump has also exerted more influence on the Federal Reserve. And we've seen a lot of chaos at the CDC and expect a lot from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. when he testifies later this week.

RASCOE: That's NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales. Thanks, Claudia.

GRISALES: Thank you. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",https://www.upr.org/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-08-31 17:01:41.371118

The Inflation Reduction Act earmarks $369bn for climate action, which aims to slash US emissions by roughly 40% by 2030, against a 2005 baseline.

Measures include 10 years of consumer tax credits to make heat pumps, solar panels, and electric heating, ventilation, and air conditioning more affordable.

Households could also receive up to $7,500 in tax credits to buy new clean vehicles, and $4,000 to buy used clean vehicles.

Roughly $30bn in targeted grant and loan programs is earmarked for states and electric utilities to accelerate the transition to clean electricity, and more than $20bn is set aside to support climate-smart agriculture practices.

The package also includes over $60bn to on-shore clean energy manufacturing in the US, and a further $60bn in environmental justice priorities to drive investments into disadvantaged communities.

Although this is a significantly scaled-back version of Joe Biden's original $3.5tn 'Build Back Better' spending plan, the president welcomed the bill, saying that Democratic senators had “sided with American families over special interests”.

“I ran for president promising to make government work for working families again, and that is what this bill does – period,” he said.

“This bill also makes the largest investment ever in combatting the existential crisis of climate change. It addresses the climate crisis and strengthens our energy security, creating jobs manufacturing solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicles in America with American workers.”

The bill passed by a margin of 51 to 50 on Sunday, and comes after 18 months of intense wrangling.

It also includes major legislation on healthcare and corporation tax, allowing the government to negotiate lower prices for prescription medicines for the over-65s provided by the Medicare health insurance programme.

A minimum 15% tax will apply to most corporations that make more than $1bn a year in profits.

The federal tax credit for electric vehicles, offering up to $7,500 for qualifying new models, has been a cornerstone of U.S. efforts to boost EV adoption since its expansion under the Inflation Reduction Act. But with the passage of the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” signed into law in July, this incentive is set to expire on September 30, 2025, creating urgency among consumers and automakers alike. Industry analysts have warned that the cutoff could dampen sales momentum, particularly as EV market penetration hovers around 8% of new vehicle sales, according to recent data from the Energy Department.

For insiders in the automotive sector, the deadline represents more than a consumer hurdle—it’s a pivot point for supply chains, pricing strategies, and competitive positioning. Manufacturers like Tesla and General Motors have ramped up promotions, but the abrupt end could exacerbate inventory gluts or force discounts that erode margins.

A Subtle Shift in IRS Guidance

Recent clarifications from the Internal Revenue Service have introduced a modest extension to this timeline, allowing buyers to secure the credit without taking immediate possession of the vehicle. As detailed in a Mashable article published on August 29, 2025, the IRS now defines a vehicle as “acquired” upon entering a written binding contract and making a payment—such as a nominal down payment or trade-in—by the September 30 deadline. This means delivery can occur later, providing breathing room for those navigating backorders or custom configurations.

This adjustment, outlined in IRS guidance released on August 21, stems from broader rules under the clean vehicle tax credit program. A CNBC report from August 26 highlights how this change favors buyers, potentially averting a last-minute rush that could strain dealership operations and logistics networks.

Implications for Market Dynamics

For EV industry executives, this wiggle room could stabilize fourth-quarter projections by encouraging orders that might otherwise be deferred. However, the extension is limited; contracts must be binding and non-refundable in most cases, per IRS stipulations, which could complicate financing arrangements tied to actual delivery.

Moreover, not all vehicles qualify—the credit applies only to models meeting strict criteria on battery sourcing, assembly location, and price caps. A list of eligible EVs, as compiled in a January 2024 Mashable piece, includes standouts like the Tesla Model Y and Chevrolet Bolt, though the roster has shrunk due to evolving regulations.

Strategic Considerations for Automakers

Automakers are already adapting: Ford and GM have issued dealer bulletins emphasizing the new rules to maximize sales before the cutoff, according to insights from a Yahoo Finance article dated August 24. This could lead to a surge in pre-orders, but it also raises questions about post-deadline pricing, where the absence of the credit might necessitate rebates or incentives to maintain volume.

Income limits remain a factor, capping eligibility at $150,000 for single filers and $300,000 for joint, as noted in NerdWallet’s July 2025 overview. For used EVs, a separate $4,000 credit also ends on September 30, adding another layer to purchasing decisions.

Looking Ahead to Policy Shifts

The broader policy context underscores uncertainty; the “Big Beautiful Bill” reflects a political recalibration away from subsidies, potentially signaling reduced federal support for electrification. Industry insiders speculate this could accelerate investments in domestic battery production to qualify for future incentives, if any emerge.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-e332d200-6b82-4a82-8860-e6de25bae149.jpeg,N,,2025-08-31 17:01:46.171233

This comes three years after the energy companies caused a major oil spill off the coast of Louisiana.

What's happening?

According to NOLA.com, the oil spill happened on the shrimping season's opening day in 2022. A Hilcorp oil tank fell into Terrebonne Bay and spilled about 14,000 gallons of oil into Lake Pelto.

WCC allegedly damaged the oil tank during a transfer. The lawsuit also blames Hilcorp, claiming that it never properly inspected the tank.

Louisiana state officials closed 33 square miles of oyster harvesting waters. Shrimp fishers stayed away from the area for fear of contamination and ultimately had an unsuccessful shrimping season.

Why is the oil spill concerning?

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit include shrimpers, boat owners, and seafood businesses. This oil spill has harmed people with many different livelihoods across the Gulf Coast.

Without consistent, quality products to sell, everyone in the shrimp industry risks being unable to provide for themselves.

""Fishermen are now confused on whether they should be taking a chance of going out to shrimp. Do you spend the money for supplies to get rejected at the dock for the sale of your shrimp?"" Kimberly Chauvin, co-owner of the David Chauvin Shrimp Company, said to the Houma Courier.

""And docks are worried that if we buy the shrimp, are we going to get paid by the processors or will they reject the shrimp? This is a no-win situation for us. Once we pay a fisherman, we don't get that money back. You just take a loss.""

This isn't the first time this has happened, either. Hilcorp was involved in over a dozen oil spills in 2021 following Hurricane Ida, according to NOLA.com. The oil company also paid out $920,000 after it was accused of dredging oyster reefs without a permit.

When oil spills happen, they don't just hurt people. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says that oil spills can cause severe illnesses and death in wildlife. It can also take a long time for animal populations to bounce back after an oil spill, and many don't rebound.

What's being done about the oil spill?

While the lawsuit can't reverse the oil spill, it aims to hold Hilcorp and WCC accountable for their actions.

The plaintiffs are accusing the companies of negligence and believe the companies have violated several environmental laws. They hope the lawsuit will help restore local ecosystems and ""repair reputational damage done to Terrebonne Bay's and Louisiana's seafood industry,"" per NOLA.com.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/shrimp-industry-lawsuitimage-rectVGCgPOobhYEuK-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 16:02:01.928857

Additionally, the DMV confirmed that discounted tolls tied to the CAV decal program will end too.","Starting October 1, 2025, a new government rule will end the EV HOV perk in California. Initially, California electric vehicle (EV) drivers were allowed to drive on high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes. The program, also known as the Clean Air Vehicle (CAV) decal program, will officially end after the federal government decided not to extend it.

According to the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and Air Resources Board, more than 500,000 vehicles in California will be affected by the new government rule.

EV Drivers Face Longer Commutes as HOV Lane Access Ends

Since 1999, the CAV decal program allowed EV drivers, plug-in hybrids, and hydrogen-powered vehicles to use the HOV lanes even with only one occupant. This incentive was so effective in encouraging clean vehicle adoption in California.

Unfortunately, this incentive will expire on September 30, 2025. This means that beginning October 1, EV drivers will have to follow the same occupancy rules as all other vehicles. Those found using the carpool lanes without passengers could face fines.

Additionally, the DMV confirmed that discounted tolls tied to the CAV decal program will end too.

“The federal government’s decision to eliminate this smart and popular program will hurt hundreds of thousands of California drivers,” the DMV said in a statement. “It’s a lose-lose situation and the state is now looking at other options to provide this service to Californians.”

Longer Commutes Ahead

Drivers will be forced to move back to the general-purpose lanes when CAV decal program comes to an end. This will add hours of traffic over the course of a week. For instance, in congested corridors like State Route 91, the decal saved drivers significant driving time. The removal of this perk will now see most motorists take 20 to 30 minutes more on the road each day.

Final Opportunity for Drivers Before the Program Ends

While the CAV decal program is ending, the DMV has created a short grace period for drivers who want to apply for the decal before it expires. The deadline is August 29, 2025. However, it is essential to note that their HOV lane access will expire on September 30, 2025. This is not an extension, but a last chance for those who had not applied to use the perk.

Why the Program Is Ending

The CAV program is ending because the federal government has not authorized single-occupant EVs to use carpool lanes. For California to renew these decals, it needs approval from the federal government. California state officials had hoped that the deal would continue through 2027, but they are bound by federal law.

Why Critics Call the Decision a Step Backward

Local groups like the Electric Vehicle Association of San Diego have opposed the move, saying that the decal program is a low-cost and high-impact policy that encouraged EV purchases and also eased congestion. Additionally, hundreds of thousands of drivers will now have to endure longer and more expensive commutes.

Will Ending HOV Lane Access Slow EV Adoption?

Experts have argued that incentives like HOV access have contributed to EV sales, especially in regions that experience heavy traffic, such as the Bay Area and Los Angeles. This incentive was so effective in encouraging clean vehicle adoption in California. It also had ambitious targets to ban the sale of gas-powered car sales by 2035.

Without access to the carpool lane perk, the other benefits, like tax credits, cheaper fueling, and lower maintenance costs, may not be enough to encourage households to buy or use EV vehicles.

Conclusion

The deadline to apply for a Clean Air Vehicle decal is August 29, 2025. However, all decals will expire on September 30, 2025. Therefore, starting October 1, 2025, only drivers who meet the standard carpool occupancy rules will be able to use the HOV lanes. Single-occupant EVs will not enjoy the privilege anymore.",https://www.grada3.com/us/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DMV.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 17:01:32.844064

In a major regulatory reversal, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has officially withdrawn its 2024 proposal to strengthen wastewater discharge limits for meat and poultry processing facilities. The agency cited potential disruptions to the U.S. meat supply, facility closures, and significant job losses as key reasons behind the decision.

Originally developed under the Biden administration, the proposal would have required facilities to adopt new wastewater treatment technologies, a move environmental groups hailed as long overdue. But industry stakeholders, led by the National Pork Producers Council (NPPC), warned the rule would impose crippling costs on meat processors and threaten plant viability nationwide.

""The EPA's withdrawal reduces future compliance costs for this vital American industry and helps support affordable food prices and cost of living,"" the agency noted in a summary statement, aligning the move with President Donald Trump's deregulatory priorities and his broader campaign to combat the ""cost-of-living crisis.""

Job Losses and Supply Chain Disruption Weighed Heavily

EPA's original analysis projected that up to 16 plants could close under the preferred regulatory scenario. In the final action document signed by Administrator Lee Zeldin, the agency estimated the no-rule option avoids the closure of between 10 and 93 plants, potentially preventing the loss of 3,199 to 26,657 American jobs.

The agency emphasized lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, when processing disruptions led to severe meat shortages and price spikes. ""Even impacts considered economically achievable could pose serious threats to the nation's food supply,"" the EPA warned.

Industry Applauds ‘Common-Sense' Decision

The NPPC welcomed the rollback, calling it a victory for science-based, economically viable regulation.

""The National Pork Producers Council applauds the Trump administration and EPA Administrator Zeldin for taking a common-sense approach,"" said NPPC President Duane Stateler, a pork producer from McComb, Ohio.

The group stated that stringent permitting changes under the Clean Water Act (CWA) would have forced sweeping upgrades and costly compliance burdens across the meat sector, reducing capacity and driving up prices for consumers.

Environmental Groups Decry Missed Opportunity

Conversely, environmental advocates criticized the decision, arguing it favors short-term economics over long-term sustainability. Groups that had sued EPA to act on slaughterhouse discharges said even the proposed rule's preferred option would have cut nitrogen by just 10% and phosphorus by 37%-while a more ambitious alternative could have reduced those discharges by 83% and 94%, respectively.

The decision effectively ends a two-year public comment process, during which environmental and industry groups clashed over how to balance environmental justice, clean water goals, and the economic realities of meat processing in the U.S.

What's Next for EPA and the Meat Sector?

The decision signals a continued pivot away from aggressive environmental enforcement in favor of economic resilience and supply chain stability, a hallmark of the Trump administration's policy framework.

Yet critics warn that without stronger safeguards, rural waterways and low-income communities near processing plants will continue to bear the brunt of pollution from the $200 billion U.S. meat industry.",https://www.agrolatam.com/files/image/63/63197/68b361d074ea0_600_315!.png?s=eb6d254dabda9749cda292f9aad90b5f&d=1756588437,N,,2025-08-31 18:01:33.489826

Just over a week ago, the Trump Administration ordered wind companies to stop construction on a wind farm off the Rhode Island coast.
Offshore wind power is particularly useful for the state because it produces at night, when solar power goes away.
President Trump put a moratorium on the development of new offshore wind projects on his first day in office.
More than 80 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been planned in the U.S., but their future has gotten murkier.","The Trump administration is cancelling $679 million in federal funding for ports to support the country's offshore wind industry, the latest move in President Trump's ongoing campaign against wind power.

Offshore wind is still a developing industry in the U.S., while Europe already has thousands of wind turbines in deep ocean waters. Those offshore turbines are dramatically larger than ones on land and require substantial infrastructure at ports for construction, from large assembly facilities to deepwater docks for ships that carry turbines out to sea.

Ports around the country hoped to seize the economic opportunity to become hubs for the wind industry. Under the Biden administration, 12 port projects from California to Virginia were granted funds, all of which the Trump administration said on Friday it was either withdrawing or cancelling.

""Wasteful wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America's maritime industry,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in announcing the decision. He said if possible, the funding would be redirected to ""address critical port upgrades.""

Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., who represents an area that lost funding, said in a statement, ""This is a new level of idiocracy, where the Trump administration is trying to destroy an entire sector of clean energy, kill thousands of good paying jobs, and drive up electricity prices for American consumers.""

Just over a week ago, the Trump Administration ordered wind companies to stop construction on a wind farm off the Rhode Island coast. Trump is a long-time critic of wind power, claiming it's expensive and kills birds. He has pushed for cuts to tax incentives for wind and solar, which analyses have shown could raise electricity prices around the country.

The wind industry is reeling from the recent decisions, a marked change from a few years ago when the growing demand for electricity spurred a surge in announcements for new wind projects.

""The federal [Trump] administration ran on rebuilding back America, building infrastructure, creating U.S. jobs, creating manufacturing – this project does all of that,"" said Chris Mikkelsen, executive director of the Port of Humboldt Bay, one of the ports that had its project funding canceled.

Bringing industry to a rural port

The federal grants were directed at creating wind manufacturing and logistics hubs, including in Maryland, Massachusetts and Staten Island in New York. The project that took the biggest hit is in Humboldt Bay in Northern California, which is losing out on more than $426 million.

The port is located in a rural part of the state, five hours north of San Francisco. For decades, it supported the local timber industry, which has waned significantly over the years. In 2022, the federal government held the first offshore lease for wind power in California, a sign the industry would be poised to take off. Mikkelsen says it represents a huge economic opportunity for his area.

""It's the biggest we've seen in the century, there's no doubt about it,"" Mikkelsen said. ""We're not talking about entry-level jobs. These are very skilled, very high-paying jobs. Jobs here in Humboldt County are in desperate need.""

The federal grant represented a significant part of funding needed for the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind Heavy Lift Marine Terminal Project, which would also leverage private and state investment. The port planned to use it to clean up and remediate polluted areas, build facilities for handling the turbine parts, dredge the waterway and build a larger wharf capable of handling pieces of steel longer than a football field.

With the funding cancellation, Mikkelsen says he hopes it's just a pause for the project, since California continues to push for renewable energy. The state has a goal of getting 100% of its electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2045. Offshore wind power is particularly useful for the state because it produces at night, when solar power goes away.

""This hurts a little bit, but it doesn't change our focus and it certainly doesn't change our outcome,"" Mikkelsen said. ""An administration can't change the fact that the U.S. has incredible energy demands.""

Turmoil for the wind industry

Electricity demand is growing across the country, especially as new data centers are built for artificial intelligence. Solar and wind projects produce cheaper energy on average than fossil fuels projects that run on natural gas and coal, though the cost can vary greatly depending on the location and type of project. The Biden administration set a goal of getting 30 gigawatts of power from offshore wind by 2030, enough for around 10 million homes. An analysis found that plan could create 77,000 jobs, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a federal research lab.

President Trump put a moratorium on the development of new offshore wind projects on his first day in office. In cancelling the Rhode Island wind project, the administration stated it was for the ""protection of national security interests,"" but did not elaborate on what those are specifically.

""We're not allowing any windmills to go up,"" Trump said earlier this week. ""Unless there's a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago, we don't allow windmills.""

More than 80 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been planned in the U.S., but their future has gotten murkier. Interest rates have gone up, making financing more challenging. Turmoil in the industry could also make it harder to attract investment. But many companies are hoping it's a passing phase, given the overall demand for electricity.

""We will have an offshore wind industry in this country because it's hard to imagine we can bring the kind of power we need to the coasts without it,"" said Jason Grumet, chief executive officer of the American Clean Power Association, a renewable energy industry group. ""But at the moment the industry is very worried because projects are being cancelled with virtually no rationale.""

While the supporting documentation for the proposed changes to the use of offshore wind resources has been marked as for internal use only, the proposed policy changes would entail the withdrawal and cancellation of 12 offshore wind grants and projects currently under development. The restructuring of the grants and shifting of these projects to maritime infrastructure, which is centered around shipbuilding, as well as the historical sources of energy policy, would have to start the restoration of the infrastructural systems of energy, which are foundational and core to the policies of America. This ultimately needs to be done in a way to secure the shipbuilding and general maritime capabilities of America as a whole.

The changes as proposed have raised great concern, particularly amongst proponents of renewables. These shift changes are argued to be aimed at stalling the advancement of offshore wind power, utilizing the potential available offshore resources in the United States. Such arguments are counter-refuted by salient figures in government who emphasize the offshore wind policy shift as being key to strengthening national security as well as energy stability for the future of the country.

The DOT and MARAD Focus on Maritime Dominance

The decision by the DOT and MARAD to discontinue funding offshore wind projects demonstrates the Biden administration’s intention to focus on the revitalization of the US shipbuilding industry. In a statement, the DOT explained that the funding would be redirected to increasing shipbuilding capacity and developing further domestic energy projects. The government also reiterated its intention to more fully utilize the nation’s energy resources, indicating that the emphasis on offshore wind projects was a misallocation of time and resources to more pressing and crucial maritime priorities.

Granted, this decision has attracted the ire of those who support renewable energy projects. However, the stance of the DOT and MARAD is that the projects are essential to securing the country’s energy and maritime independence.

Impacted Projects and Locations

Withdrawn by the DOT and the MARAD, the grants cover offshore wind projects with major terminals and port developments in several states across the US. The most affected would be the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind in California, which has lost funding worth $427 million. The Salem Wind Port in Massachusetts and the Norfolk Offshore Wind Logistics Port in Virginia will also be adversely impacted. The former will lose $33.8 million, while the latter will lose $39 million. Even smaller projects like the Wind Port, being developed by the Bridgeport Port Authority in Connecticut, and the Portsmouth Marine Terminal in Virginia, will also be adversely affected.

All these ports were meant to support the advancing offshore wind industry by providing the storage, maintenance, and transportation infrastructure for the wind energy equipment, including turbines and monopiles. The grants, which were meant for the development of these facilities to meet the demands of offshore wind projects, were set under false expectations and have now, unfortunately, been retracted.

Burdock, along with many industry experts, bashed the government for cutting funding as, “reversing decades of net gain on clean, renewable energy policy, energy transition, and job creation.” As she highlighted, “Granting funding for the offshore wind ports offers an infrastructure upgrade which supports many sectors and does not solely target wind energy. Any funding cuts will likely slow down the initiatives taken nationally to gain energy dominance and ensure energy security.”

For the sake of job retention in the fishing and maritime industry, Burdock agrees that funding towards the development of wind ports should continue, as it will gain a great deal of investment to help meet the country’s energy demand. It was suggested that the withdrawal of these offshore wind renewable energy grants could result in the U.S. losing its global dominance in renewable energy, a great deal of jobs and economic opportunities, and more.

Renewable Energy Support Regardless of Obstacles

In spite of the grant withdrawal difficulties, the U.S. has invested heavily in offshore wind and hydrogen renewable energy in the last few years. In 2023, President Joe Biden stated that in the United States, 18 offshore wind shipbuilding projects were in development, with 3.5$ billion in capital pledged to 12 manufacturing facilities and 13 ports to support the offshore wind supply chain.

The Biden administration has also noted that these investments in renewable energy are resulting in the creation of new jobs in shipyards across the country in Louisiana, Florida, Michigan, and other states. These jobs include building crew transfer vessels and specialized ships for offshore wind installation. The wind energy projects still underway serve to show the commitment to promoting offshore clean energy, even while funding has been restricted for some ports.

Realignment of the Spending Priorities to Conventional Energy and National Security in Maritime Affairs. The cancelled projects fund withdrawals, as argued by DOT and MARAD, should now fund the reconstruction of the traditional maritime infrastructure, which is considered vital for national security. ‘Flexible Directorate of Marine Affairs and Deputy Secretary of Transportation, Senior’- it would also permit the country to bolster the maritime capacity and energize the traditional energy infrastructure. The goal of the government is to achieve, for the first time, the long-term energy security of the country while developing a military shipbuilding base, which would also be capable of meeting the national defense demands of the country.

Duffy also termed the focus of projects on offshore wind ‘wasteful,’ arguing that there are better uses of those resources for the betterment of the country’s maritime industry.

Conclusion: Does this set a step back for the progress of offshore wind?

Although the decision to withdraw funding for offshore wind terminals and ports and the subsequent impact on the sails of offshore renters has ruffled feathers within the renewables industry, the government’s view is a pronounced example of interweaving energy and defense priorities. The reallocation of the nearly $700 million in grants is a case in point, signifying a regain of focus on traditional energy and maritime infrastructure.

The Siteot application reflects a setback in all clean and sustainable ambitions for the offshore wind industry. The rest of the country, along with the U.S. renewable energy sector, is waiting to find out how the planned U. S. energy and maritime strategy will affect future expansion for offshore wind and renewables. Facing Ottero challenges, clean energy advocates are positive that expanding offshore wind and expendable infrastructure will take center stage in tomorrow’s eco-era vision – and fund it.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/US-Wind-Port-Funding-Cuts-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 19:03:35.625248

Geo-Energie Jura AG began geothermal simulation tests in June to test how well water can flow through the rock in a future reservoir.

The simulation included temperature measurement at 3,986 meters and a borehole casing at 3,800 meters. The testers calibrated eight seismometers after placing them at the bottom of the borehole. Water injection activity started on July 8 and stopped on July 14 after reaching the threshold twice. Various testing and monitoring continued until July 31.

Scaling the testing in stages to pause for analysis, as the company has done, is vital to reducing earthquake risks. By the end of testing, researchers recorded 3,387 very low-magnitude seismic events that quickly decreased as water injections stopped.

To ensure safety, researchers continuously monitor activity and collect data. The second phase will include geothermal reservoir stimulation if it continues to meet safety guidelines.

Geothermal heat derives from beneath the surface. It's harnessed by power plants, heat pumps that directly heat and cool buildings, and enhanced geothermal systems such as the Geo-Energie Jura AG project to create electricity. As the hot water or steam from the underground reservoir reaches the surface, it drives turbines connected to electricity generators.

Hot springs and geysers are naturally occurring hydrothermal sources of this energy. However, sometimes drilling wells is necessary.

This energy source can transform society thanks to its reliable and limitless supply from the planet's constantly replenished internal heat. Unlike solar or wind, it's available regardless of the weather. Its low carbon emissions also reduce pollution, enabling a cleaner and healthier environment for all.

Plus, the savings on home systems can be massive.

The average payback period to offset installation is five to 10 years, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Once built, these systems have lower maintenance costs than HVACs and can increase home resale value, according to ABE Heating and Cooling.

Some states and local governments may also provide incentives for homes and businesses to install them. On average, these systems can reduce energy bills by as much as 70%.

With billions of dollars tied to environmental justice and greenhouse gas reduction programs, the stakes are incredibly high for communities, advocates, and policymakers working to ensure that resources reach those most affected by pollution and climate change. For readers following the intersection of climate action and public accountability, this case is a clear example of how legal frameworks are shaping the future of environmental policy. Learn more about climate and environmental justice issues here.

Background: The EPA’s Environmental Justice Block Grants

The Environmental Justice (EJ) block grants were designed to channel federal funding into communities disproportionately impacted by environmental hazards—places where industrial pollution, unsafe drinking water, and climate change impacts often intersect with racial and economic inequities. These grants aim to empower local organizations, grassroots movements, and state and tribal governments to implement solutions that address environmental health risks while promoting long-term resilience.

However, disputes can arise when grantees and the federal government clash over compliance, reporting, or implementation. In this case, a recipient of one of these block grants sued the EPA after the agency moved to terminate the funding. The plaintiff argued that the termination was unlawful and would harm communities relying on the project.

The Court’s Ruling

The judge ultimately sided with the EPA, dismissing the lawsuit and affirming the agency’s authority to terminate grants under certain circumstances. The decision emphasized the discretion federal agencies hold in managing taxpayer-funded programs, particularly when concerns arise over accountability, performance, or compliance with program guidelines.

While the ruling brings closure to this specific dispute, it also sets a precedent that could influence future cases. Notably, ongoing legal challenges around the EPA’s administration of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund—a multibillion-dollar program created under the Inflation Reduction Act—may now look to this case as a reference point.

Why This Matters for Climate Policy

The dismissal of this lawsuit underscores several critical points:

Federal Oversight and Accountability: Agencies like the EPA have broad discretion to ensure grants are used effectively. If performance or compliance issues arise, termination is a tool they can legally use.

Ripple Effects for Other Programs: Similar litigation tied to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which is central to reducing U.S. emissions while boosting clean energy projects, may be influenced by this precedent.

Impact on Communities: While the ruling clarifies legal authority, it also raises concerns that sudden funding cuts could leave vulnerable communities in limbo—particularly those that rely heavily on EJ block grants to address ongoing environmental health crises.

For communities disproportionately affected by climate change, the consistency and stability of funding streams are just as important as the existence of the programs themselves. The challenge ahead is balancing oversight with reliability so that frontline organizations can plan long-term solutions without fear of abrupt financial disruption.

Looking Ahead: Implications for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund

The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund represents one of the most ambitious federal climate investments in U.S. history, dedicating $27 billion to clean energy projects, emissions reductions, and community-driven climate initiatives. With lawsuits already emerging over how funds are awarded and whether certain organizations qualify, this recent dismissal could embolden the EPA’s authority to defend its decisions and terminate funds when necessary.

However, advocates caution that the agency must tread carefully. If enforcement and oversight are perceived as overly heavy-handed, it could discourage smaller grassroots organizations from applying—precisely the groups that environmental justice funding is meant to empower.

Sustainable Action and the Path Forward

The court’s ruling is a reminder that climate action does not take place in a vacuum. Legal battles, federal oversight, and political debates all shape how resources are distributed—and whether vulnerable communities truly benefit.

As the U.S. accelerates its transition toward clean energy and more equitable climate solutions, transparency and accountability will remain key. But so too will stability, ensuring that projects can grow and thrive without fear of sudden funding disruptions.

The dismissal of the EPA grant termination lawsuit closes one chapter, but it opens the door to broader discussions about how we protect, administer, and deliver climate funding at scale. At the core is a fundamental truth: effective climate action depends not just on bold commitments, but on ensuring those commitments reach the communities that need them most.",https://sustainableactionnow.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/output-onlinepngtools-7.png,N,,2025-08-31 18:01:45.653066

Neither Ellomay nor its independent public accountants have reviewed or consulted with the Luzon Group , Ellomay Luzon Energy or Dorad with respect to the financial results included in this press release.","TEL-AVIV, Israel, Aug. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ellomay Capital Ltd. (NYSE American; TASE: ELLO) (“Ellomay” or the “Company”) , a renewable energy and power generator and developer of renewable energy and power projects in Europe, Israel and USA, today reported the publication in Israel of financial statements as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 of Dorad Energy Ltd. (“ Dorad ”), in which Ellomay indirectly held, as of June 30, 2025, approximately 9.4% through its indirect 50% ownership of Ellomay Luzon Energy Infrastructures Ltd. (formerly U. Dori Energy Infrastructures Ltd.) (“ Ellomay Luzon Energy ”).

On August 31, 2025, Amos Luzon Entrepreneurship and Energy Group Ltd. (the “ Luzon Group ”), an Israeli public company that currently holds the remaining 50% of Ellomay Luzon Energy, which, in turn, held 18.75% of Dorad as of June 30, 2025, published its quarterly report in Israel based on the requirements of the Israeli Securities Law, 1968. Based on applicable regulatory requirements, the quarterly report of the Luzon Group includes the financial statements of Dorad for the same period.

The financial statements of Dorad as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. Ellomay will include its indirect share of these results (through its holdings in Ellomay Luzon Energy) in its financial results for this period. In an effort to provide Ellomay’s shareholders with access to Dorad’s financial results (which were published in Hebrew), Ellomay hereby provides a convenience translation to English of Dorad’s financial results.

On July 22, 2025, Ellomay Luzon Energy acquired an additional 15% of Dorad’s share capital as a result of its exercise of a right of first refusal granted to it under Dorad’s articles of association and shareholders’ agreement, and therefore the Company’s current indirect share of Dorad is approximately 16.9%.

Dorad Financial Highlights

Dorad’s revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2025 – approximately NIS 566.8 million.

Dorad’s operating profit for the three months ended June 30, 2025 – approximately NIS 56.9 million.

Dorad’s loss for the three months ended June 30, 2025 mainly results from an increase of approximately NIS 72.7 million in financing expenses compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 due to NIS/USD exchange rate differences in connection with deposits denominated in USD. Certain of Dorad’s expenses (natural gas acquisition and maintenance costs) are also denominated in USD.

Dorad notes in its financial statements that on June 13, 2025, the State of Israel launched operation “Rising Lion” against Iran, as part of the Iron Swords war, for the purpose of removing the nuclear and missile threat against Israel. As a result of this operation, and in view of the high risk to lives and property from the ballistic missile attacks and unmanned aerial vehicles that were launched against Israel by Iran in response, strict restrictions were imposed on the Israeli home front that included, inter alia, restrictions on gatherings and restrictions on movement. In addition, as a result of closing the Israeli airspace, hundreds of thousands of Israelis were delayed in returning to Israel. As part of the restrictions on gatherings and movement, the Israeli economy began operating in a state of emergency whereby only essential businesses were allowed to open and the schools and higher education system shifted to online learning, two instructions that resulted in substantial damage to the Israeli economy. On June 24, 2025, an agreement was reached regarding a ceasefire, after which the Israeli economy resumed operating in full capacity. Dorad’s revenues in June 2025 decreased by approximately 22% compared to the same month in the previous year, including due to the military operation. As this is an event beyond Dorad’s control, and factors such as the continuation or cessation of the fighting may affect Dorad’s estimates, as of the date of approval of Dorad’s financial statements (August 14, 2025), Dorad was unable to assess the extent of the impact of the war and the operation on its business activities and results in the medium and long term. Dorad continues to monitor developments on the matter on an ongoing basis and is examining the implications for its operations and the value of its assets.

Based on the information provided by Dorad, the demand for electricity by Dorad’s customers is seasonal and is affected by, inter alia, the climate prevailing in that season. The months of the year are split into three seasons as follows: summer – June-September; winter – December-February; and intermediate (spring and autumn) – March-May and October-November. There is a higher demand for electricity during the winter and summer seasons, and the average electricity consumption is higher in these seasons than in the intermediate seasons and is even characterized by peak demands due to extreme climate conditions of heat or cold. In addition, Dorad’s revenues are affected by the change in load and time tariffs – TAOZ (an electricity tariff that varies across seasons and across the day in accordance with demand hour clusters), as, on average, TAOZ tariffs are higher in the summer season than in the intermediate and winter seasons. Therefore, the results presented for the quarter ended June 30 , 202 5 , which include the intermediate month s of April and May and the summer month of June , are not indicative of full year results. In addition, due to various reasons, including the effects of the increase in the Israeli CPI impacting interest payments by Dorad on its credit facility , the results included herein may not be indicative of second quarter results in the future or comparable to second quarter results in the past .

A convenience translation of the financial results for Dorad as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 and as of and for each of the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 is included at the end of this press release. Ellomay does not undertake to separately report Dorad’s financial results in a press release in the future. Neither Ellomay nor its independent public accountants have reviewed or consulted with the Luzon Group , Ellomay Luzon Energy or Dorad with respect to the financial results included in this press release.

These numbers do not include emissions from increased fossil fuel production linked to efficiency gains from Microsoft's technology, the Alpines told Business Insider.
""We're talking about Microsoft providing the technology to oil companies to dramatically increase fossil fuel production,"" Holly said.
Amazon has also worked with drillers to help simulate their oil production in a bid to maximize their output.
They also need to draw clear lines in the sand, such as no AI or cloud deals to explicitly expand fossil fuel production.""","Will and Holly Alpine loved their jobs at Microsoft, which made quitting to protest the company's work with the oil and gas industry a terrifying experience.

The Seattle-based couple worked in the company's responsible AI and sustainability divisions, respectively, and were heavily involved in internal groups pushing the company to become greener. He had worked at Microsoft since 2020, and she had been there since 2014.

During their final few years at Microsoft, the couple said they raised concerns with internal memos about how the company's tech was helping the oil and gas industry expand fossil fuel production.

""I had concerns that the tools I was helping build were being weaponized by bad actors, and I was concerned about the lack of accountability,"" Will, 36, told Business Insider.

Eventually, they realized they could create more change if they left the company. ""We had reached a conclusion that, within reason, we did everything we could from the inside constructively — and there was no one else pushing from the outside,"" Holly, 33, said.

Microsoft declined to comment. The company has committed to becoming carbon negative by 2030.

Leaving Microsoft

In early 2024, the couple left their jobs and launched the Enabled Emissions Campaign to raise awareness of Microsoft's work with the fossil-fuel industry and put pressure on the Big Tech giant from the outside.

Leaving their stable tech jobs has been the ""most ambitious and challenging period of our lives,"" Will said.

The decision also came with some serious lifestyle changes.

The couple has had to ""cut their cost of living dramatically,"" Holly said, although being vegan meant they were ""already used to living affordably"" by eating ""lots of rice and beans.""

The couple also takes part in the sharing economy ""wherever possible,"" participates in their local ""Buy Nothing"" group, and buys most goods secondhand. Will said that, as an engineer, he embraces DIY.

They also decided to be child-free, which helped them avoid the ""major expense of child-rearing,"" Holly told Business Insider.

""We are privileged tech workers, we had stable finances, no kids; we just decided, you know, if not us, who? We should take the leap and just kind of trust in the universe that it's going to work out,"" she said.

Microsoft's oil and gas ties

Microsoft's overall carbon emissions increased by 23.4% between 2020 and 2024, according to the company's most recently published figures.

These numbers do not include emissions from increased fossil fuel production linked to efficiency gains from Microsoft's technology, the Alpines told Business Insider.

According to a 2019 Microsoft press release, the application of its cloud, Internet of Things, and machine learning technology by a subsidiary of oil and gas giant ExxonMobil was anticipated to ""expand production by as much as 50,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day by 2025.""

Microsoft declined to provide a more up-to-date estimate.

That is the equivalent of 6,356,475 metric tonnes of CO2 being emitted in one year, according to modelling from the Green Web Foundation, a non-profit. It's also more than half of the entire carbon footprint that Microsoft reported in 2019, on one contract.

""We're talking about Microsoft providing the technology to oil companies to dramatically increase fossil fuel production,"" Holly said. ""Those increases in emissions are not counted in any of Microsoft's reporting.""

Microsoft's work with the oil and gas industry preceded the generative AI boom, and the Alpines say AI is helping to ramp up fossil fuel production. AI could already help increase fossil fuel production by up to 10-15%, cutting oil recovery rates while increasing recovery rates of oil and gas, per a 2020 Barclays report.

""It has fundamentally reshaped the economics of fossil fuel extraction, and generative AI is a layer of innovation on that that's really increased the scale,"" Holly said.

Microsoft isn't the only Big Tech giant with ties to the oil and gas industry. Amazon has also worked with drillers to help simulate their oil production in a bid to maximize their output. While Google once had connections to the industry, it pledged to stop selling its machine learning platform for oil exploration use cases in 2020, following employee backlash.

Launching the Enabled Emissions Campaign

The Enabled Emission Campaign's primary goals are to highlight how companies use technology to increase the production of fossil fuels and call for guardrails for this use.

""We think Big Tech companies should stop enabling the problem that they claim to be solving, and Big Tech must account for and disclose the full climate impact of the contracts they sign, especially with fossil fuel clients,"" Will said. ""So that means measuring these enabled emissions, and not just their own operational footprints. They also need to draw clear lines in the sand, such as no AI or cloud deals to explicitly expand fossil fuel production.""

The couple spends their days focusing on policy advocacy, deep research, fundraising, and coalition-building.

Fundraising for the campaign has been tricky. ""A lot of folks are not actually even aware of this work happening, so it's kind of an awareness-raising first before we can even get to that fundraising,"" Holly said.

The EEC has raised a pre-seed round from an anonymous individual donor who is known to the couple. The funding has allowed them to sustain themselves financially for the time being, but Holly said the couple had ""traded short-term stability for the opportunity to address a long-term crisis.""

An added difficulty has been the US's policy landscape during Donald Trump's second term, with the administration rolling back tax credits that benefited the clean energy sector.

""We haven't been inside Microsoft since Trump 2.0, but we've witnessed a shift of backsliding in climate commitments as partially driven by the race for AI supremacy,"" Will said, adding that there was no response from Microsoft when Trump pulled the US from the Paris climate accord for the second time.

Microsoft can't feasibly claim to want to be carbon negative while helping oil majors increase their output, Holly added. She hopes the EEC will help move the needle and push the company to break these ties.",https://i.insider.com/685d16a93d5881a51c1c1c76?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-08-31 16:00:42.902984

What Economic Factors are Supporting Battery Storage Adoption?

Falling Costs and Improved Economics

The economics of battery storage have improved dramatically in recent years, with the global average cost declining to under $300 per kWh in 2024. This price reduction has been driven by technological advancements, manufacturing scale, and increased competition among suppliers.

The cost trajectory continues to move downward, with experts suggesting that if prices reach $250 per kWh, the cost of storing electricity could fall to approximately $60 per MWh. This would significantly enhance profit margins for operators and accelerate deployment across various applications. Additionally, recent battery recycling breakthrough technologies are helping to further reduce overall costs and environmental impact.

Competitive Positioning Against Conventional Power

Recent research demonstrates that in markets like Germany, utility-scale solar installations with integrated battery storage have become more economical than gas-fired power plants. This cost advantage represents a pivotal shift in the energy landscape, as it enables renewable energy systems to compete directly with conventional generation on both reliability and price.

The improved economics are driving investment in innovative projects like the world's first 24-hour solar PV facility announced for Abu Dhabi. This $6 billion initiative by Masdar aims to develop 5 GW of solar capacity paired with 19 GWh of battery storage, scheduled to come online in 2027.

What Technological Advancements are Enhancing Battery Storage Systems?

Battery technology continues to evolve rapidly, with manufacturers now offering guarantees of 10,000 charge-discharge cycles while maintaining over 80% battery health throughout that lifespan. These advancements in durability and performance are critical for utility-scale applications where reliability and longevity directly impact financial returns.

What makes Odoo relevant to renewable manufacturing is its customizability.
How to choose the right ERP for renewable manufacturing in 2025 Choosing ERP is less about a feature checklist and more about fit and focus.
The bottom line Renewable manufacturing is messy, fast, and unforgiving, but it rewards teams that impose light, honest structure on the chaos.","The renewable energy boom has grown up. Solar panel lines no longer look like hobby labs; they run at breathtaking tempo, swapping recipes and cell formats mid-shift. Wind-turbine manufacturers balance discrete assembly with project-style logistics and field service. Battery and power-electronics makers juggle chemistry, traceability, and fast-moving compliance. Even small shops—fabricating racking, inverters’ sheet metal, cable harnesses, EV-charger enclosures, heat pump components—now need the kind of planning discipline that used to be reserved for big aerospace. In 2025 the question isn’t “Do we need ERP?” It’s which ERP helps you plan production, prove traceability, control cost, and run greener—without burying a lean team in complexity.

This guide ranks seven manufacturing ERPs that stand out for renewable-energy makers this year. The emphasis is pragmatic: short time to value, real shop-floor traction, and capabilities that matter for green hardware—serial/lot traceability, BOM and routing control, quality, supplier collaboration, project and service management, and signals that support sustainability reporting (think: material provenance, scrap and rework capture, energy-aware scheduling, downstream maintenance data). The list reflects the diversity of renewable manufacturing, from boutique component shops to growing OEMs and multi-site groups. You’ll see options that fit a ten-person operation and others that suit a multi-entity organization with centralized purchasing and consolidated reporting.

Before diving in, one more word on “supporting renewable energy.” There isn’t a single magical “green” module that makes an ERP eco-friendly. What helps in the real world are solid manufacturing foundations—clean item masters and BOMs, routings that mirror how work is actually done, accurate consumption and scrap capture, reliable supplier and batch records—and then the openness to connect with MES, IoT, LCA tools, and carbon-accounting apps. Keep that lens in mind as you read.

1) MRPeasy — The right-sized manufacturing ERP for solar, storage, and clean-tech component makers

MRPeasy sits at the top because it does what many renewable manufacturers need most: it elevates day-to-day planning and control without dragging the team through an 18-month rollout. The platform is unapologetically manufacturing-first—BOMs, multi-level BOMs, and routings are first-class citizens; work orders are easy to launch; and capacity planning ties to real work centers and calendars. For a small-to-midsize shop printing battery-pack brackets today and building inverter subassemblies tomorrow, that clarity translates to fewer shortages, a steadier promise date, and margins you can actually trust.

The heartbeat of MRPeasy for renewable makers is its production planning. You can model each product’s routing step by step—say, cut-and-bend, weld, powder coat, assemble, end-of-line test—and assign times, resources, and skills. When demand lands, the system generates work orders that respect those constraints instead of inventing a schedule that only exists on paper. Because lot and serial tracking are baked in, you can link every inverter chassis or combiner box to the exact material batches and process steps that created it. That’s critical for warranty, for field service, and for the growing set of audits in solar, storage, and grid hardware.

MRPeasy also shines in purchasing and inventory. Renewable makers live and die by lead times and minimum order quantities: aluminum extrusions, resin cartridges, rare connectors, insulated busbars, adhesive tapes—each with its quirks. The software gives planners clean reorder points, shortage flags, and purchase suggestions that tie back to the jobs that need the parts. As a result, buyers aren’t ordering “because we’re nervous” but because upcoming work actually requires it. When a supplier changes spec or lot certifications, the traceability chain stays intact, which makes customer conversations calm instead of frantic.

For those building to order, MRPeasy’s quoting and job costing keep you honest. You can price a new inverter model or a bespoke racking design using real BOMs and routings, then watch the actuals as the order flows. That feedback loop is what eliminates the slow bleed of under-quoted work. Add quality checkpoints to routings, capture scrap and rework where it happens, and you have data to improve yield and reduce waste—two levers that are as “green” as they are profitable.

Just as important, MRPeasy manufacturing ERP software plays well with others. Most renewable shops already run accounting in QuickBooks or Xero, use CAD and PLM, and increasingly connect machines through lightweight MES or IoT. MRPeasy’s API and CSV connectors are straightforward, so you can push finished-goods and cost data to accounting, import items and BOMs from engineering, or feed shop-floor data collectors without hiring an army of integrators. It’s not a clinical ERP with claims processing, and it’s not trying to be; it’s focused manufacturing control that a small team can learn and love.

There are limits. If you’re a multi-entity DSO-style organization with elaborate consolidations or a global enterprise with deep EHS tooling, other systems on this list will go further on that axis. But for the most common renewable-manufacturing realities—small to midsize teams building physical things, juggling supply risk, needing clean traceability and predictable throughput—MRPeasy is the fastest path to a calmer, greener operation.

2) Oracle NetSuite — The financial backbone for multi-entity clean-tech groups

NetSuite earns its place because many renewable energy businesses graduate from a single shop to a portfolio of entities: a manufacturing arm, a service company that installs and maintains systems, and a distribution unit. When that happens, you need serious multi-entity finance, centralized purchasing, and consolidated reporting. NetSuite is excellent at that. It offers robust general ledger, dimensions, intercompany eliminations, and procurement frameworks that let a central team buy for several factories and service regions at once, while still giving each site the inventory visibility it needs.

For renewable manufacturers, the draw is the “hub-and-spoke” model. Procurement can standardize supplier contracts for aluminum, PCBs, fasteners, and power semiconductors, then allocate stock where production needs it. You can give plant managers dashboards that focus on open POs, inbound containers, and vendor performance while keeping CFO-level control of spend and cash. Add the suite’s project accounting and you can track the cost of a new line, a pilot program, or a product transfer as a true project, not just a guess in a spreadsheet.

On the sustainability front, NetSuite’s value is data hygiene and extensibility. Clean item masters, consistent units of measure, landed cost handling, and lot/serial fields set the stage for downstream reporting in ESG and carbon apps. The marketplace is huge, so there are ready ways to plug in MES, PLM, LCA, and carbon-accounting tools. NetSuite itself won’t model every nuance of a wind nacelle’s manufacturing routing or a cell assembly line; the trick is to integrate specialized shop-floor systems and keep finance and supply chain truthful and timely. If you are a scale-up with investors scrutinizing gross margin, cash conversion, and compliance, NetSuite gives you credible numbers at the speed you need.

3) Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central — The Microsoft-centric path to disciplined operations

For manufacturers who live inside the Microsoft world—Teams, SharePoint, Power BI—Business Central is a comfortable, capable ERP. It covers the essentials of finance, inventory, purchasing, and production in a way that fits small and midsize organizations. The native reporting through Power BI is a boon for renewable makers who want to build dashboards showing scrap trends by product family, on-time completions, supplier OTIF, or inventory turns for critical components.

Business Central is good at the process discipline that renewable operations crave. You can codify approval workflows for spend, standardize item and vendor records, and create BOMs and routes that the shop can actually follow. Manufacturers often add a light MES or barcoding app to make data capture painless on the floor, then let Power Automate move information between engineering, production, and procurement. And because everything speaks Microsoft, adoption is easier: the same identity, the same UI ideas, the same reporting vocabulary.

The caution here is to size the manufacturing features against your reality. If you are running a sophisticated battery line with recipe management and complex co-products, Business Central may need add-ons to match your process depth. If you are fabricating enclosures, assembling inverter stacks, winding coils, or building EV-charger pedestals with straightforward routings, it’s more than enough. Many renewable firms pair Business Central with PLM or CAD connectors to keep BOMs in sync, and the result is a tidy, maintainable stack.

4) Acumatica — Open, API-first ERP for growing clean-tech makers

Acumatica’s reputation in manufacturing comes from an open API and modern architecture that make it friendly to integrate and extend. For renewable manufacturers who plan to add plants, shift production between regions, or connect to an expanding constellation of apps (MES, IIoT, quality, service), that openness pays off every month. The manufacturing edition supports BOMs and routings, material planning, production orders, and multi-warehouse inventory with the sort of clarity a production planner can live in all day.

What makes Acumatica appealing to clean-tech is how well it handles multi-location inventory and project accounting. If you’re supporting a pilot line in one site, a maturing line in another, and contract manufacturing in a third, you can keep a single truth for items and costs while respecting local realities. For companies that mix product and project revenue—say, you build a standard product but also run customer-funded engineering projects—Acumatica ties the financials together in a way that doesn’t require an army of spreadsheets.

On the sustainability side, the platform’s flexibility helps capture the operational signals you need for greener decisions: scrap by work center, overtime spikes that hint at energy peaks, vendor performance that correlates with quality escapes. Acumatica won’t claim to be a carbon-calculator, but it captures the ground-truth data those tools need. With a healthy ecosystem of partners, you can bolt on barcoding, configure-to-order portals, and carbon or LCA reporting without bending the core system out of shape.

5) Infor CloudSuite Industrial (SyteLine) — Deep manufacturing DNA for complex assemblies

Infor CSI, known to many as SyteLine, brings serious manufacturing depth to the table, which can be a strong fit for renewable OEMs building complex products like wind turbine components, utility-scale inverters, or battery energy storage systems with field service. Its planning engine understands multi-level BOMs, alternate routings, engineered-to-order variations, and the daily grind of rescheduling when a supplier slips or a test station goes down. If your world involves tight engineering change control and heavy configuration, CSI is worth a look.

Infor’s quality and traceability features are mature, and the system handles lot/serial tracking in a way auditors appreciate. For renewable firms, that means cleaner warranty investigations and faster root-cause loops when something in the field needs attention. The service management capabilities also help once your gear leaves the factory: you can connect installations, warranties, spare parts, and maintenance visits back to the way each unit was built. That feedback is a quiet superpower for improving designs and reducing lifetime environmental impact.

CSI is bigger and denser than lighter ERPs on this list. It tends to fit organizations that already have defined processes and want a system to enforce them at scale. For smaller shops making brackets or harnesses, the learning curve may feel steep; for mid-market OEMs with a lot of moving parts, the rigor pays for itself.

6) Epicor Kinetic — A modernized classic for discrete manufacturing in clean energy

Epicor Kinetic is the cloud evolution of a long-running manufacturing ERP, and it shows well in the discrete world: job management, advanced scheduling, MES, quality, and field service. Renewable manufacturers that assemble racking systems, inverter cabinets, turbines’ subassemblies, or power-electronics cabinets often like Kinetic’s combination of shop-floor execution and planning. The scheduling board and job traveler concepts are familiar to production folks, which speeds adoption.

Kinetic’s quality module supports nonconformances, corrective actions, inspections, and the usual suspects that keep auditors happy. The MES options make it easier to gather operator time, machine states, and production counts without living in paper. Those nuts-and-bolts improvements translate to greener operations indirectly: less rework, fewer scrap piles, and data you can actually analyze. If you carry serialized finished goods, the traceability is adequate, and you can track components as lots or serials depending on what the industry demands.

Epicor’s ecosystem is large, so you can find connectors for CAD/PLM, e-commerce portals, and service-management tools. For renewable firms that want a mature, industrial ERP that is still actively modernized, Kinetic hits a reasonable balance. It asks for a thoughtful implementation—no ERP does the thinking for you—but once routings, resources, and quality plans mirror reality, it hums.

7) Odoo Manufacturing — A configurable, budget-friendly path for agile green makers

Odoo is the oddball on purpose. It’s a modular ERP that can be as light or as expansive as you need, and its Manufacturing, Inventory, Purchase, and Accounting apps cover the basics well. For renewable manufacturers on a budget, or for those who want to prototype processes quickly, Odoo is an appealing canvas. You can model BOMs, checkpoints, and work centers, track lots and serials, and use barcodes on the floor without breaking the bank.

What makes Odoo relevant to renewable manufacturing is its customizability. If your process does not fit neatly into a standard ERP flow—maybe you blend make-to-order with kitting, or you run lab recipes alongside discrete assembly—you can use Odoo Studio and the large partner network to shape screens and workflows. The result can be surprisingly elegant for small teams, especially when paired with its website, CRM, and helpdesk modules for a cohesive front-to-back experience.

It has trade-offs. Odoo’s strength is breadth and modifiability, not deep out-of-the-box manufacturing depth for every edge case. Governance matters: decide what you will configure and what you will standardize. For many clean-tech startups and component makers, the combination of low entry cost, quick wins in inventory discipline, and a path to integrate with LCA or carbon apps later is exactly what they need to get moving.

How to choose the right ERP for renewable manufacturing in 2025

Choosing ERP is less about a feature checklist and more about fit and focus. Start by mapping what you truly do. Are you a component shop with frequent engineering changes? A line-builder with recipe-like steps and strict quality gates? An OEM that sells equipment plus multi-year maintenance contracts? The more clearly you describe your reality, the faster vendors can show you the path that works.

If you are a small to midsize manufacturer producing solar racking, EV-charger hardware, cable assemblies, sheet-metal enclosures, inverter subassemblies, or similar, the fastest route to better days is an MRP-first system that your team can actually run. That is why MRPeasy tops this list. You will get clean item masters, BOMs, and routings in weeks, not quarters. Purchasing will stop guessing. The shop will stop overpromising. And you will start to trust your margins. For many clean-tech makers, that is the real sustainability win: a process that wastes less material, less energy, and fewer human hours.

If you are a mid-market organization with several legal entities, centralized procurement, and board-level consolidation needs, a finance-forward ERP such as NetSuite or Dynamics 365 Business Central will likely anchor your stack. Pair it with specialized manufacturing or MES where needed. The finance backbone will give investors and lenders the confidence they expect, while your operations team gets the day-to-day tools to plan, buy, and build with fewer surprises.

If you are a complex OEM—think wind components, utility-scale inverters, or BESS containers with field service—systems like Infor CloudSuite Industrial or Epicor Kinetic can match your depth. You will invest more in implementation, but you will get rigorous scheduling, quality, and service management that stand up to audits and warranty demands. Your sustainability improvements will come partly from the sheer discipline of the system and partly from the data now available to feed product engineering and EHS reporting.

There is also a builder’s path with Acumatica and Odoo. You value openness and want to integrate your ERP with homegrown cloud services, IoT gateways, or LCA tools. You may be running multiple sites with different levels of maturity. The key is to protect the core—items, BOMs, routings, inventory—and let the edges innovate. This approach pairs well with renewable firms that iterate fast and aren’t afraid to refine processes every quarter.

Regardless of platform, a few practices separate successful ERP programs from stalled ones. First, make the master data boring. Decide on naming conventions for items, units, revisions, and suppliers. Agree on how you will structure BOMs and routings. Boring up front saves months later. Second, instrument the bottleneck. In many clean-tech shops the constraint is coating/curing, end-of-line test, or a single machine center. Put that center on a big screen: queue length, average job age, and completion rate. Nothing is greener than eliminating rework at the constraint. Third, close the loop. Capture scrap and rework at the step where it happens and route that fact to engineering and purchasing. Renewable makers survive or fail on yield; an ERP that makes yield visible, case by case, is a quiet superpower.

Finally, think of sustainability reporting as a harvest, not a separate farm. When staff book the correct lot, clock the right step, enter an NCR with cause codes, or record a supplier certificate, they are planting the seeds for carbon and compliance reporting later. You do not need a sustainability module to begin; you need to trust your operational data. From there you can bolt on carbon or LCA tools that read the truth out of your ERP and turn it into the disclosures customers, investors, and regulators expect.

The bottom line

Renewable manufacturing is messy, fast, and unforgiving, but it rewards teams that impose light, honest structure on the chaos. That is exactly what ERP is supposed to bring. In 2025, MRPeasy is the most compelling first choice for small and midsize renewable makers because it matches how they actually build things: with BOMs and routings, with finite capacity, with imperfect suppliers and even more imperfect spreadsheets. It lets you plan, execute, and trace without waiting a year for payoff.",,N,,2025-09-01 04:01:42.467981

Across the country, state leaders are racing to fast-track wind and solar projects before the expiration of federal tax credits to support clean energy.

Colorado is directing state agencies to prioritize permits for projects that might qualify for the credits. Maine regulators are moving up timelines to purchase new power, hoping to give developers a head start on construction.

And renewable industry leaders are pressing governors and lawmakers to clear bureaucratic backlogs and connect projects to the grid in the narrow window that remains.

Federal clean energy tax credits have been essential to the financing of wind and solar projects across the country, and a key part of states’ plans to transition to wind and solar power.

Following President Donald Trump’s moves to quickly phase out those credits, pending projects have a tight time frame to start construction before their eligibility expires. But states have long struggled to speed up permitting decisions, reduce regulatory hurdles and add new power to the grid. And the clock is running out.

“Every month counts,” said Patty O’Keefe, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy nonprofit. “[The tax credits] are the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project that’s currently in the pipeline.”

Over the past few weeks, some governors have directed state agencies to fast-track permits for wind and solar projects. They have also urged utilities and regulators to ensure new power can quickly connect to the grid. Some state regulators have accelerated their timelines to sign contracts for new energy, in hopes of getting more projects started before the fast-approaching construction deadline.

But it’s unclear how quickly states can clear up the bureaucratic backlogs that have frustrated them for years. And any projects that don’t meet the deadlines will face significant additional costs, likely increasing consumers’ electricity bills.

“There are billions of dollars in tax credits that are part of [state regulators’] financial analysis,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. “If every project was unable to access those tax credits, that would be a substantial additional cost to utility ratepayers.”

Permitting

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, extended the federal government’s clean energy tax credits into the 2030s. The policy offered developers a 30% tax credit for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. A separate production credit for projects in operation offered money for every unit of clean electricity they generated.

State leaders say the credits have been key to the financing of wind, solar and other renewable energy projects. States with mandates to transition to clean electricity say the federal support was integral to their plans.

For renewable energy developments, the tax credits have brought project costs down 30-50%, said Mike O’Boyle, acting policy team director with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate and energy think tank.

But the landscape changed dramatically on July 4, when Trump signed a giant domestic policy measure that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.

“Quite a lot is at risk,” said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director with Evergreen Action, a climate-focused advocacy group.

Patterson said that wind and solar projects can take one to six years to move through state permitting programs. Unless states move urgently, projects that don’t already have permits are unlikely to advance in time to qualify for the tax credits.

Colorado leaders are trying to speed up that process. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered state agencies to expedite permits for projects that are eligible for the credits.

“We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly,” said Toor, of the Colorado Energy Office. “We’re focused on making sure that the state is not creating obstacles to projects moving forward.”

Toor said the state is hoping to advance “multiple gigawatts” of projects on an accelerated timeline before the credits expire. A gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes.

We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly.

– Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office

State officials and industry leaders said it’s hard to precisely quantify the scope of projects that could benefit from state actions to accelerate deployment. Federal data shows that states plan to add nearly 200 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery storage capacity by 2028. Collectively, those projects could power roughly 145 million homes.

Some states, including California, have created a streamlined “one-stop” permitting process through a single state agency, O’Boyle said. Those states are best equipped to get more projects underway.

“When those tools are in place, there is an ability to target and streamline permitting for specific projects, especially when such large cost reductions are at stake,” he said.

Michigan passed a similar permitting law in 2023, while Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is currently pushing for the creation of a state energy siting board.

O’Keefe, who is based in Minnesota, has called for that state and its municipalities to adopt SolarAPP+, a software platform that automates solar permitting for local governments and other jurisdictions.

Interconnection

Once clean energy developers have received approval from the state, they must wait for approval from grid operators before they can build their projects and plug into the power system. In many places, those “interconnection queues” have suffered from yearslong backlogs that have slowed the buildout of energy projects.

Now, some governors are pushing regulators and utilities to connect as many projects as possible before the tax credits expire.

In Maine, the state Public Utilities Commission kicked off an accelerated procurement process last month, seeking bids for nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy. That’s equivalent to roughly 13% of the state’s electricity usage. By moving up the timeline for developers to submit proposals to build new power projects, regulators hope to give them a better chance to start construction before the deadline.

Regulators in Oregon and Minnesota are also considering proposals to fast-track electricity procurements. And Toor, the Colorado official, said regulators there will open additional procurement windows to allow more projects to be considered. The letter from Polis, the Colorado governor, also referenced the Public Utilities Commission’s authority to override permit denials from local authorities.

In California, clean energy developers have called on state regulators to create a new solicitation for projects eligible for the tax credits, allowing them to begin construction sooner. The industry groups also called on state officials to streamline environmental review and permit approvals.

O’Boyle noted that California’s transmission system has surplus capacity at existing gas-fired power plant sites. Building wind and solar projects near those plants would allow them to plug into that infrastructure and quickly come online. State lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would promote the use of such “surplus interconnection.”

New York has 26 permitted but unbuilt wind and solar projects, New York Focus reported, totaling about 3 gigawatts of energy. Developers have only started construction on two of the large projects approved by the state in the past four years.

Clean energy advocates told the outlet that projects need approvals and agreements from multiple agencies before moving forward.

“Every last whisper of detail of the project has to be finalized before they generally let you start construction,” said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.

Industry leaders said Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul should order state regulators to coordinate with one another on permits, and direct the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to fast-track contracts for new clean energy. Leaders at the agency did not grant a Stateline interview request.

The BBB ends EV tax credits and home charger incentives by Sept 30, making many EVs costlier.

Removing incentives and penalties will spike new EV sales pre-Sept, then cause a trough; used EV prices jump.

Cutting support undermines US EV competitiveness, risks battery-belt jobs, and cedes leadership to China.

The Big Beautiful Bill will end EV tax incentives by 30 September, including on the installation of home charging equipment. Incentives for public EV charging infrastructure, as well as renewable energy generation, are being cut. It also removes the penalties on carmakers if they make gas guzzlers. It removes both the carrot and stick that supported cleaner cars, making gas cars cheaper, and many EVs more expensive, and all more difficult to charge.

The EV tax incentives have been in place since 2008, and the 2022 revisions currently give a tax rebate of up to $7,500 on purchasing certain new EVs, and $4,000 on used ones. These tax incentives apply to both BEVs and PHEVs, although there are very specific limitations on which vehicles and buyers they apply to.

Looking more broadly, in a world where EVs are rapidly increasing their share of the market and the future of transport is electric, America has dropped out of the race, leaving China to win. A sharper focus on the narrow US EV landscape shows EV sales will spike between now and September 30 -- then they will hit a major trough. Used EV prices will spike, and lower-income buyers will have less access to affordable EVs, new or used.

The world is moving to EVs, but the US is no longer

Making US EVs less competitive

Dropping the EV tax incentive will have major implications in the more affordable EV market. The Chevy Equinox EV, starting at $33K, has shot out the lights in sales so far this year, while the Ford Mustang Mach-E, starting at $37K, has stalled. The Equinox, after the tax rebate, will come in at around $26K, a lot cheaper than the more basic Nissan Leaf. Take away the rebate, and the Equinox will go head-to-head with the likes of the base Hyundai Kona.

Volvo vs Tesla

With the tax rebate in place, both the Tesla Model Y and 3, and the Hyundai Ioniq 5 compete very favorably with the Mustang Mach-E. Remove the tax break and the Mach-E's value-for-money equation improves immeasurably. The current opposition will have to compete against the likes of the Hyundai Ioniq 6, the new Toyota BZ, and the Volvo EX30.

The cars currently excluded are made outside the USA, or major components like batteries come from other countries. Their level of affordability would depend on whatever tariffs survive the vagaries of TACO.

The battery belt

The EV economy goes beyond cars

Huge industries have risen on the demands of electrification and clean energy, and in terms of EVs, the battery belt. After the supply chain disruptions of COVID, manufacturers started investing heavily in battery development and manufacture. They found the ideal set of parameters in Georgia, North and South Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky.

The so-called battery belt offered the perfect mixture of lots of affordable land, road and rail infrastructure, and skilled labor at affordable prices. These states were also seen as home to emerging R&D hubs, essential to high-tech industry.

Money and jobs

By 2023, more than $90-billion had been invested in this belt, and over 70,000 jobs were been created. When EV sales fall, as they will in the short term, or rise less slowly in the medium term, it will affect the battery belt, the billions invested in it, and the tens of thousands of jobs created to support its growth.

The battery belt runs through red states, and when politics do not align with the local economy, politics is usually the loser. We will see.

EVs not affected by the BBB

EVs are still more expensive on average than gas cars, but the gap is narrowing as EV battery prices fall. Just over 20 EV models currently qualify for the tax break, but there are now nearly 70 EV models in the US market, up from 34 in 2022. Over 60% of US buyers have a favorable view toward EVs, especially with purchase prices and cost of ownership falling rapidly. People are buying EVs, even when there is no tax incentive.

The trend is toward more expensive models, with fewer than a third costing less than the average price. So the rich get the nice cars, while the less wealthy get it in the shorts.

Global competitiveness

While the US is doing the equivalent of playing Age of Empires in reverse, EV market share is rocketing globally. China is by far the biggest car market in the world, and around half of new cars sold there are EVs. The Chinese EV industry is not staying in China, with Europe rapidly seeing (and buying) Chinese EVs. The rest of the world is following suit, with Chinese EV sales booming as near as Mexico.

People are buying Chinese EVs not because they are cheaper, which they are, but because their value proposition is so good. The best of Tesla can probably hold its own in EV technology, but not in the tech-price equation anymore.

By moving away from EVs and the infrastructure that supports its growth, the US has opted out of the biggest thing in automotive history since the Model T. American ingenuity has always started in the home market, from where it went to conquer the world. When the home market is throttled by ideology-driven policy, the US will lose the race.

US drivers want EVs, and they will get them. They just won't be made with US technology.",https://static0.pocketlintimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cybertruck-feature-jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 14:04:18.502223

Flooding along the Second Broad River exposed the area’s vulnerability to heavy rainfall five years ago, when rising water smashed debris into a main line and cut off running water to Forest City and the nearby towns of Ellenboro and Bostic.

Repair work following the storm revealed more problems.

Erosion along the river left Forest City’s sewer system and raw water intake at risk of flood damage, but the town didn’t have the money to fix it. Federal emergency management officials told town officials that they would be a good fit for a new grant program aimed at pre-disaster mitigation.

Through its Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Grant program, FEMA awarded Forest City $2.6 million for improvements to the town’s water and sewer systems. The project was well into the planning and design process when the federal government revoked the grant.

FEMA announced the end of the BRIC program and canceled all applications from fiscal years 2020 through 2023 on April 4, calling the program created during President Donald Trump’s first term “wasteful and ineffective” in press releases.

In total, 72 North Carolina communities with active BRIC-funded projects worth about $225 million were affected.

Town officials across the state told Carolina Public Press that the mitigation projects they view as essential to keeping their communities safe are now caught in a federal political battle in Washington.

“I don't consider water and sewer projects to be political or woke,” Town Manager Janet Mason said.

Neither did a bipartisan group of 80 members of Congress, which released a letter addressed to Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and acting FEMA Administrator David Richardson shortly after the grant program’s termination, urging them to reverse the decision.

“BRIC funds are spurring communities across the country to strengthen their resilience to extreme weather, and forgoing these critical investments will only make it harder and more expensive for communities to recover from the next storm,” the letter read.

Instead, the legislators suggested that FEMA and Congress work together to improve the grant program’s application review and funding distribution processes.

Sen. Thom Tillis and Rep. Chuck Edwards, both North Carolina Republicans, helped craft the letter. Rep. Don Davis, a Democrat representing the northeastern part of the state, and Rep. Alma Adams, a Democrat representing Charlotte, were the other two members of North Carolina’s Congressional delegation to add their signatures.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to CPP’s request for a comment on pushback from lawmakers and local governments over the ending of the BRIC program.

Meanwhile, the communities with active BRIC-funded projects have been left to wait as the future of those funds is litigated in court. North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson joined 19 other U.S. states in suing Noem and Richardson last month, arguing that FEMA’s termination of the grant program was illegal.

The lawsuit has three components.

First, it argues that a 2006 federal law protecting FEMA from being dissolved also prevents the government from “substantially reducing FEMA’s mitigation functions.”

Secondly, the complaint states that FEMA’s refusal to spend funds directed towards the BRIC grant program by Congress violates the legislature’s power of the purse, as granted by the Constitution.

Lastly, it claims that Richardson and his predecessor Cameron Hamilton, who was removed from his position as acting FEMA administrator on May 8, did not have legal authority to end the BRIC program because neither were ever confirmed by the U.S. Senate.

Those plaintiff states won a small victory on Aug. 5 when a United States District Judge placed an injunction on preventing the federal government from spending the BRIC funds until the court gives a final decision.

As noted in the lawsuit, FEMA had planned to return about $882 million of the BRIC funds to the U.S. Treasury and another $4 billion to its Disaster Relief Fund, which is reserved for post-disaster spending.

While many BRIC-funded projects in North Carolina have been put on pause as the federal money is withheld, some projects which have begun construction using already-obligated funds continue to advance.

Such is the case with Princeville, a low-lying community in Edgecombe County which was awarded $11 million to develop a 53-acre plot of land outside of the floodplain which encompasses much of the town.

Princeville Mayor Bobby Jones told CPP that the town continues to draw BRIC funds to work on the project.

Other communities, like Salisbury in Rowan County, are actively searching for alternative funding sources to complete their BRIC projects.

Salisbury was previously awarded $22.5 million through BRIC to relocate its existing water treatment facilities to a location more resilient to flooding. Utilities director Jason Wilson told CPP that the site of the new facilities is shovel-ready, which the city hopes makes it an attractive candidate for other grant programs.

The city intends to apply for FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, which unlike BRIC is a post-disaster relief program. Salisbury is eligible to apply since Rowan County was included in the federally declared disaster area following Hurricane Helene.

The City of Lumberton is also searching for a new source of funding for stream restoration, wetland preservation and trail construction projects, which it received a $1.9 million BRIC grant for several years ago.

The Robeson County city, which sits on the Lumber River, has been working since 2016 to develop land it bought from property owners following Hurricane Matthew into an expansive public trails system.

Deputy City Manager Brandon Love told CPP that he’s optimistic that the city will find an alternate source of funding to keep the project moving forward, but it’s nonetheless a disappointing development after years of planning.

“Getting caught up in the politics of things going on in Washington is hitting home here at the local level,” Love said, “and that’s unfortunate.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6b933b5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1258x660+0+6/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0b%2Fe7%2Ff21b6b3442b8affbbe1e072651b1%2Fscreenshot-2024-12-17-100215.png,N,,2025-08-31 14:06:11.152029

The governor signed a law the following year authorizing the energy commission to penalize oil companies for excessive profits.
The law also required oil companies to report more data on their operations to the state.
Newsom’s office thanked the energy commission for voting to postpone implementing a penalty, saying it was a “prudent step” toward stabilizing the oil market.
Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.","California energy regulators Friday put the brakes on plans requiring oil companies to pay a penalty if their profits climb too high, a temporary win for the fossil fuel industry two years after the governor declared the state had “finally beat big oil.”

The postponement by the California Energy Commission until 2030 comes after two oil refineries accounting for roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity announced their plans to close in the coming months. The commission has the power to implement a penalty but has not done so since it was given that authority in 2023.

The penalty was considered a landmark piece of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s government and the state’s ambitious goals to curb climate change. The state faces challenges in its efforts to take on the oil industry while ensuring a stable and affordable fuel supply. His administration is also proposing to temporarily streamline approvals of new oil wells in existing oil fields in an effort to maintain a stable fuel supply.

Siva Gunda, the commission’s vice chair, said the state is not “walking back” its efforts to wean itself off fossil fuels but must prioritize protecting consumers at the gas pump.

“I personally truly believe that this pause will be beneficial to ensure that this mid-transition is smooth,” he said.

The commission still plans to set rules that would require oil refineries to keep a minimum level of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when refineries go offline for maintenance.

Jamie Court, the president of Consumer Watchdog who supported the law, said the energy commission’s vote is “basically a giveaway to the industry.”

“I’m really disheartened and disgusted by Newsom,” he said. “I feel like this is just a total about-face. And in the end it’s going to result in greater price spikes.”

But the Western States Petroleum Assn. recommended that the state postpone a penalty for 20 years.

“While today’s action by the CEC stopped short of a full statutory repeal or a 20-year pause, it represents a needed step to provide some certainty for California’s fuels market,” CEO Catherine Reheis-Boyd said in a statement. “The vote demonstrates the CEC’s understanding that imposing this failed policy would have likely exacerbated investment concerns contributing to California’s recent refinery closures.”

In 2022, Newsom called the Legislature into a special session to pass a law aimed at holding oil companies accountable for making too much money after a summer of record-high gas prices in California. The governor signed a law the following year authorizing the energy commission to penalize oil companies for excessive profits.

The law also required oil companies to report more data on their operations to the state. It created an independent division at the commission to oversee the oil and gas industry and provide guidance to the state on its energy transition.

Newsom’s office thanked the energy commission for voting to postpone implementing a penalty, saying it was a “prudent step” toward stabilizing the oil market.

“When Governor Newsom signed this legislation two years ago, he promised that we would utilize the new transparency tools to look under the hood of our oil and gas market that had been a black box for decades,” spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said in a statement. “We did exactly that.”

Julia Stein, deputy director of a climate institute at UCLA School of Law, said state officials are still intent on advancing their efforts to transition away from fossil fuels.

“But I think there is also a sense at the state level that we’re entering a different phase of the transition where some of these problems are going to be presented more acutely,” she said. “And folks are kind of now trying to understand how they’re going to approach that in real time.”

California has the highest gas prices in the nation, largely due to taxes and environmental regulations. Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.

The commission has not determined what would count as an excessive profit under the policy.

Setting a penalty could be risky for the state because it could unintentionally discourage production and drive prices up, said Severin Borenstein, an economist and public policy professor at UC Berkeley.

“It’s pretty clear they are shifting toward more focus on affordability and recognition that the high prices in California may not be associated with the actual refinery operations,” he said of state officials.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/340e6c1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3515x1845+0+248/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa2%2F47%2Fb5ccf6a04d8da0ea84ab0e889574%2F2fe26bac33774cb1bc9e9287d3e5e9f1.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 14:05:26.373760

,Clean Energy ,2025-08-31 17:00:57+00:00,www.nytimes.com,"Chevron's Boss Says the World Will Need Oil for a 'Long, Long Time' - The New York Times","Jordyn Holman, www.nytimes.com, jordyn-holman",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/31/business/chevron-oil-mike-wirth.html,"The International Energy Agency has predicted that global demand for oil and gas could peak by the end of the decade.
Chevron’s profits have drifted downward along with oil prices, which many analysts expect will continue falling.
Even if they are, once oil demand reaches a level where it’s no longer growing, it’s unlikely to drop off quickly.
When the world stops using oil and gas, we’ll stop looking for it.
Our company is built to work through cycles, because it’s the nature of the energy business.","“We don’t create demand, we meet demand.”

That’s how Mike Wirth, the chief executive of Chevron, describes the way his company works. So long as the world is using oil and gas, Chevron and others have a responsibility to provide those fuels affordably and reliably, he said, “because it advances human progress.”

Chevron, the second-largest oil company in the United States behind Exxon, pumped a record amount of oil and gas last quarter, about 3.4 million barrels a day. President Trump has promised to make it easier for oil companies to get permits for even more drilling. Chevron also recently completed a $53 billion acquisition of Hess after prevailing in a protracted legal battle with its rival Exxon.

But not all is well. The International Energy Agency has predicted that global demand for oil and gas could peak by the end of the decade. Oil prices have fallen as plentiful supplies meet weaker demand, in part because of the economic turmoil generated by Mr. Trump’s trade war. Chevron’s profits have drifted downward along with oil prices, which many analysts expect will continue falling.

Mr. Wirth, who joined Chevron more than 40 years ago and has led the company since 2018, is making changes that he says will set the company up for the future. Last year, he moved Chevron’s headquarters to oil-rich Texas from California, where it was based since its founding in the 1870s. This year, the company announced it would lay off up to 20 percent of its work force, or around 9,000 people, by the end of 2026.

Even if they are, once oil demand reaches a level where it’s no longer growing, it’s unlikely to drop off quickly. It’s more likely to stay at a plateau.

So demand is going to be around for a long, long time. Oil production is what’s known as a depletion business. As we produce barrels, they can’t be produced again. You have to invest in new supply, even if demand’s not growing.

We are investing in new technologies, like hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, lithium and renewable fuels. They are growing fast but off a very small base. We need to do things that meet demand as it exists and then evolve as demand evolves.

Will it ever make sense for Chevron to stop looking for places to drill and focus its efforts on renewable energy sources?

One day, I’m sure it will make sense to do that. Probably a long time from now. When the world stops using oil and gas, we’ll stop looking for it.

But to stop beforehand runs the risk of creating a lot of adverse consequences in terms of the world not having the energy that it needs.

President Trump is eager for energy prices to fall. Is that a good thing for Chevron?

Our company is built to work through cycles, because it’s the nature of the energy business. Prices go up, prices come down, you don’t know when they’re going to do either one.

We have to maintain a healthy portfolio and a strong balance sheet to navigate cycles.

We don’t really run the business based on today’s price or the short-term price. We run it based on a long-term view of markets.

Can you point me to a policy from the Trump administration that has had an impact on your business, good or bad?

I’ll give you a very specific one, and it’s a change from the prior administration.

The United States has tremendous offshore resources in the Gulf of America. Under President Biden, his administration was reducing the number of lease sales and the quality of acreage that was available.

The Trump administration has reversed that and has returned regular lease sales to their program.

That’s a policy change that will ensure that there is a regular flow of exploration opportunities for our industry to go out and see what we can find. That’s a good thing for our economy.

What does Chevron do better than Exxon?

The difference is in the culture of the companies. We put a real premium on partnership. We put a premium on diversity and inclusion. We put a premium on getting the best out of our work force and using that to deliver solutions for communities, governments and customers.

In our industry, strategies are easy to copy. Assets you can buy, technologies you can license. Cultures are harder to build, and they are a differentiator.

Speaking of culture, you moved Chevron’s headquarters to Texas from California. What does that do to the company’s culture?

I don’t think culture is tied to where a company’s headquarters are. It’s really tied to the values of the company.

We’ve got employees in a hundred different countries around the world, and so our culture doesn’t live in a place, it lives in our people and behaviors.

You are cutting 20 percent of the work force. What is it like, as a chief executive, to lay off so many people?

In a commodity business, costs always matter. We have to stay competitive, and the most difficult thing we do is downsize our work force.

The way we protect the most jobs for the most people is by remaining competitive. Companies that don’t remain competitive at some point either don’t exist anymore, or they get acquired by somebody else, or an activist investor comes in and changes things. We have to take control of our own future.

At a time when there’s a discussion about preventing climate change and serving shareholders, how do you want to be remembered as the chief executive of Chevron?

As somebody who was able to balance out all these competing interests.

If you look at some of the European companies in our industry, they have lost a lot of relevance because they embarked on a strategy that said, “We’re going out of the oil and gas business.” It turns out the world is not out of the oil and gas demand business.

These companies took themselves out of being competitive. Their shareholders are unhappy about that. At any public company, but certainly in an industry like ours, we have be very mindful of all of these competing interests. We’re not engaged in idealism. We’ve got to be pragmatic and real.

Do you see the oil and gas industry as a contributor to climate change?

Human activity is a contributor to climate change. We supply energy that is used. If humans did not consume energy or consume oil and gas, we wouldn’t be in business.

But is Chevron able to provide more options or push customers in a different direction?

We’re trying to do that today, with renewable fuels that come from renewable feedstocks, and we’re going to start up one of the world’s largest green hydrogen projects later this year. We’re investing in lithium technology. We’re trying to create choices.

These technologies are more expensive than the current technologies, and so they need to find customers.

Tell me about your upbringing and your parents. You’re from Colorado, and your dad was an executive at Coors.

My dad was not actually on the brewing side. He was a ceramic engineer and was involved in making porcelain products.

My mother was an artist. I had this right brain, left brain upbringing. I wanted to be a journalist at one point, actually. But I was also very good at math and science, and I think that came from my father.

He was a big influence on my career path.

What’s a piece of advice from him that you still reflect on?

It was more of an example that he set. I worked in a factory one summer — graveyard shift from 11 at night until seven in the morning. It was part of the business that made ashtrays, which were distributed to bars and had the Coors logo on them.

My dad had a habit of walking the shop floor. He knew what people’s kids were doing. He knew who won the high school football game on Friday night. Everybody there felt like they knew him. He was just known as Dave.

That was an important lesson for me. Treating everybody with respect and decency was the key to his success, not being a Ph.D.

I’ve heard you are known for writing personalized notes to co-workers.

It’s a simple way to take the lesson that I learned from my father.

When I visit our operations around the world, people prepare for the visit. They explain to me what they’re doing, and they take a lot of time to help me understand their part of the business.

A simple note that thanks them for what they did and acknowledges the specific content that we talked about, says that “I see you, I see what you do, I value what you’re doing, I appreciate it.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/31/multimedia/31biz-corneroffice-chevron-pcfv/31biz-corneroffice-chevron-pcfv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 14:04:35.277415

Conclusion: Navigating Challenges and Seizing Opportunities for Sustainable Travel As federal policies evolve, Georgia’s electric vehicle industry is at a crossroads.","The recent federal policy changes are reshaping Georgia’s electric vehicle (EV) industry, influencing both buyers and the future of sustainable travel in the US. These shifts bring new challenges and opportunities for the state, which has long been a hub for EV manufacturing. As federal incentives diminish, the cost of electric vehicles may rise, making it more difficult for consumers to embrace this cleaner mode of transportation. Georgia’s evolving role in this industry will impact the broader US market, while the push for sustainable travel faces significant hurdles. Understanding these changes is crucial for buyers, manufacturers and policymakers alike.

Federal Policy Shifts and Their Impact on Georgia’s EV Industry

On July 4, the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act marked a turning point for the U.S. electric vehicle market. One of the most notable provisions of the bill is the removal of federal tax credits for EV purchases, effective by the end of September. This policy change has shaken the industry, casting uncertainty on future growth prospects, especially in states like Georgia, which have heavily invested in EV manufacturing. Tax breaks for American battery manufacturers will also expire by 2030, further complicating the financial landscape for the EV industry.

The elimination of these incentives is already having a noticeable impact. Research conducted by Atlas Public Policy revealed that more clean energy projects were cancelled in the first quarter of 2025 than in the previous two years combined. Cancellations and downsized projects have amounted to approximately $14 billion in lost investments, including a significant $1 billion factory planned for Statesboro, Georgia. These setbacks suggest that the momentum in Georgia’s EV sector may be slowing, putting the state’s ambitious goals at risk.

State Leadership’s Response and Optimism

Despite these challenges, Georgia’s state officials and industry leaders remain confident in the future of the state’s electric vehicle sector. Public Service Commissioner Tim Echols emphasized that Georgia’s efforts to establish a strong EV industry were not entirely dependent on federal support. While acknowledging the role tax credits played in stimulating the industry’s growth, he asserted that Georgia’s focus is shifting toward creating a self-sustaining supply chain for EVs.

The state’s commitment to building an independent EV ecosystem is central to the long-term vision. Skye Golann, Policy Manager at the Electrification Coalition, stated that developing a robust American supply chain for critical minerals, such as lithium, will be essential for the future of Georgia’s EV industry. These minerals, which are required for battery production, are still largely processed overseas, particularly in China. However, efforts are underway to mine and process these materials domestically, especially in states like Nevada and North Carolina.

The Role of Federal Incentives in the EV Growth Boom

The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in 2022, played a pivotal role in accelerating EV adoption. With provisions for tax credits, subsidies and incentives for EV purchases and related infrastructure, the IRA spurred investment in EV batteries, charging stations and critical minerals. As a result, the industry saw a three-fold increase in investments in key areas such as battery production and refining. In Georgia, federal support helped establish several major EV-related facilities, including a $178 million grant for Solvay Specialty Polymers’ battery-grade polyvinylidene fluoride plant and a $80 million award to Blue Bird for its electric school bus manufacturing plant.

These federal incentives have been crucial in driving both local and national growth in EV adoption. In 2023, a record 1.3 million EVs were sold in the U.S., fueled by incentives such as the $7,500 credit for new EV purchases and the $4,000 or 30% tax break for used EVs. However, with the federal tax credits now on the chopping block, the affordability of EVs may take a hit, particularly as the average transaction price for EVs remains significantly higher than for gas-powered vehicles. According to Cox Automotive, the price gap between EVs and traditional cars currently stands at around $10,000.

The Pricing Challenge and Its Impact on Buyers

As the federal incentives phase out, Georgia’s EV market may face a new set of challenges. The price of electric vehicles remains the biggest barrier to adoption. Despite the growing number of affordable EV options, the higher initial cost of EVs compared to their gasoline counterparts continues to discourage many potential buyers. The average EV price has remained elevated, with the latest data from Cox Automotive showing that EVs still cost $10,000 more than comparable gas-powered vehicles.

The removal of federal incentives could further exacerbate the affordability issue. According to Stephanie Streaty, Director of Industry Insights at Cox Automotive, these price differences make it harder for many consumers to consider making the switch to an electric vehicle. With tariffs, interest rates and other headwinds, the market may struggle to reach its full potential without the support of these critical incentives.

The Future of Battery Manufacturing and the Domestic Supply Chain

Battery production plays a central role in the success of the electric vehicle industry and Georgia is positioning itself to become a major player in this sector. However, challenges remain in developing a domestic supply chain for the materials required to produce lithium-ion batteries. The U.S. is home to just 1% of the world’s lithium reserves, meaning that the country remains heavily reliant on imports, particularly from China.

General Motors (GM) and Hyundai are already taking steps to build out their operations in the U.S., including in Georgia. GM, for instance, has announced plans to co-manufacture six new EV models with Hyundai, focusing on electric vans for the North American market. Meanwhile, Hyundai has committed to bringing more suppliers to the U.S. to reduce reliance on overseas production.

However, even as manufacturers shift their focus to domestic production, many battery-related projects in Georgia have already been delayed or cancelled. Notably, in January, Freyr Battery, a Norwegian company, called off its planned battery manufacturing plant in Newnan, Georgia. Similarly, Aspen Aerogels suspended construction of a plant in Statesboro, opting instead to expand operations in China. These setbacks underscore the challenges the state faces as it attempts to build a competitive domestic supply chain.

Conclusion: Navigating Challenges and Seizing Opportunities for Sustainable Travel

As federal policies evolve, Georgia’s electric vehicle industry is at a crossroads. While state officials and industry leaders remain optimistic about the sector’s long-term potential, challenges such as the elimination of tax credits and reliance on overseas battery production could slow down progress. However, the state’s continued investments in EV manufacturing, combined with efforts to develop a domestic supply chain for critical minerals and battery components, offer hope for the future.

For U.S. buyers, these policy changes mean that the affordability and accessibility of electric vehicles may take a step backward. The removal of federal tax credits is expected to increase the cost of EVs, making it harder for many consumers to embrace sustainable travel. However, with the rise of rebates, dealer discounts and the eventual growth of domestic manufacturing, the shift towards cleaner, greener transportation is likely to continue—albeit at a more gradual pace.

As Georgia strives to become a leader in the EV revolution, its success will depend on overcoming these obstacles and seizing opportunities for innovation. For now, the road ahead is uncertain, but with continued commitment to sustainability and resilience, Georgia’s electric vehicle industry may still have the potential to drive the future of sustainable travel in the U.S.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Travel-in-the-US.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 14:04:21.843085

When Democratic legislators on Capitol Hill began crafting the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, they were intent on wielding the federal government’s power to create industrial momentum via investment in areas such as renewable energy, U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper said.

Now, if temporarily, that momentum has been lost.

“The IRA, we knew, was an unprecedented effort to push this country in the direction of renewable energy and long-term sustainability, and it’s to a big part been derailed,” he said.

The Democrat representing Colorado met with food manufacturing and restaurant owners, solar power stakeholders and city officials in Durango on Friday outside Peak Food & Beverage in Bodo Industrial Park.

Hickenlooper, standing under a 114-panel solar array installed by Shaw Solar on Peak Food & Beverage’s roof, championed renewable energy as path to long-term sustainability.

He also wagged his finger at the Trump administration’s and Republican efforts to rollback the IRA’s federal funding for renewable energy programs, warning federal funding freezes and canceled grants will slash millions of jobs and inflate energy prices around the country.

The momentum created by federal investments most often first benefits large urban areas, overlooking rural communities. That’s why the IRA included the Rural Energy for America Program, Hickenlooper said, so that rural America would not be left behind in what he described as a “great transition” from costly coal mining operations to renewable energies such as wind and solar power.

He said in an interview with The Durango Herald withholding federal funding from renewable energy initiatives hurts red states at which two-thirds of IRA renewable energy investments were aimed, and it’s in the self-interest of U.S. House representatives in those states to claw back funding.

“It’s their small businesses in their red states that are at risk,” he said. “And either they’re going to step up to the plate and get it done and reclaim a lot of those investments the federal government was making in their states, or they’re going to turn their backs.”

If representatives choose the latter option and snub their constituents, the voters should replace them, Hickenlooper said.

La Plata Electric Association CEO Chris Hansen said the recent federal policy changes are making solar energy projects 40% more costly than they were just several months ago.

“We are striving every day to deliver affordable electricity, affordable energy for our members, that’s going to get tougher,” he said.

The Trump administration’s tariffs have impacted the costs of all energy sources, not just renewables like solar, wind and batteries, he said. Steel, aluminum, copper and other vital elements of the energy economy are more expensive.

“A recent analysis shows that by the middle of next decade, this policy change and the tariffs that go with it could increase bills by about $280 per year per family,” he said. “Think about that for a moment. Adding about $300 to everybody’s electricity bills.”

That hurts low-income families most, he said.

Stakeholders say federal funding benefited their operations

Tailwind Nutrition CEO and founder Jeff Vierling said REAP funding allowed Tailwind to install a 55 kilowatt solar array on its sports food product manufacturing facility.

The solar array generates more electricity than the facility consumes, pumping more electrical power back into the grid. But that’s just where the benefits start, he said.

Tailwind’s retail partners such as REI require it to meet annual carbon emission reduction targets; its customers value outdoors, recreation and being environmentally conscious, making renewable energy important to its brand; and Tailwind wouldn’t have been able to afford the solar array without funding from REAP.

Tailwind’s energy costs are monumentally down as well, Vierling said. Its electricity bill in June this year was $286 compared with $1,541 in June 2024.

“That’s quite a bit of savings, and that savings that we’re realizing on a monthly basis, we’re putting right back into growing Tailwind, growing jobs here in the community,” he said.

Peak Food & Beverage CEO and co-founder Kris Oyler said his 40%-employee-owned company pays its 275 employees a living wage between $24 an hour to an average of $27 and rents space to small-business tenants. Although the company activated its solar array in March, Oyler expects to save about $8,000 in utility expenses annually.

“That helps our economic viability in the industry,” he said. “The restaurant industry typically has very low margins, so anywhere where we can save, I tell my team, look for nickels and pennies whenever they can.”

Peak Food & Beverage is in a better position to pay its workers a living wage, and keeps its renters’ utility costs down because of federal funding opportunities such as REAP, he said.

Durango Solar Works owner Derek Wadsworth said despite setbacks such as the Trump administration’s federal funding freeze, solar energy continues to trend toward sustainable growth. But federal support “is about to vanish.”

He said renewable energy, particularly solar and battery storage, are “deployable, employable and affordable.”

Durango Solar Works added approximately 2 megawatts, or 5 million kilowatt-hours, to the grid in 2024. When one considers all the contributions by other solar installers, which have continued to become more common over the past two decades, renewable energy’s transition from small scale to large scale becomes clear, he said.

The solar industry provides jobs with living wages directly and indirectly, supporting other businesses in concrete excavation, heat pumps and other electricians, he said.

And, he added, although solar infrastructure isn’t free, its fuel source – sunshine – is.

“We all thrive when energy is cheap,” he said. “Solar and storage are currently offering some of the lowest energy sources in the world. Maybe it isn’t the right solution everywhere, but it certainly works really well here in Colorado.”

Hickenlooper said the federal rolling back of renewable energy support is a “reckless effort to abandon so many of the investments we’ve been making over a long period of time.”

He said he’s hopeful Democrats can still work with moderate Republicans in a bipartisan effort to restore investments into win, solar and other renewable energies. But that requires keeping pressure on elected officials.

“Make no mistake, there has been a tipping point. This great transition is not going to go back, and efforts to slow it are economically costly,” he said.

President Trump put a moratorium on the development of new offshore wind projects on his first day in office.
More than 80 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been planned in the U.S., but their future has gotten murkier.","The Trump administration is cancelling $679 million in federal funding for ports to support the country's offshore wind industry, the latest move in President Trump's ongoing campaign against wind power.

Offshore wind is still a developing industry in the U.S., while Europe already has thousands of wind turbines in deep ocean waters. Those offshore turbines are dramatically larger than ones on land and require substantial infrastructure at ports for construction, from large assembly facilities to deepwater docks for ships that carry turbines out to sea.

Ports around the country hoped to seize the economic opportunity to become hubs for the wind industry. Under the Biden administration, 12 port projects from California to Virginia were granted funds, all of which the Trump administration said on Friday it was either withdrawing or cancelling.

""Wasteful wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America's maritime industry,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in announcing the decision. He said if possible, the funding would be redirected to ""address critical port upgrades.""

Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., who represents an area that lost funding, said in a statement, ""This is a new level of idiocracy, where the Trump administration is trying to destroy an entire sector of clean energy, kill thousands of good paying jobs, and drive up electricity prices for American consumers.""

Just over a week ago, the Trump Administration ordered wind companies to stop construction on a wind farm off the Rhode Island coast. Trump is a long-time critic of wind power, claiming it's expensive and kills birds. He has pushed for cuts to tax incentives for wind and solar, which analyses have shown could raise electricity prices around the country.

The wind industry is reeling from the recent decisions, a marked change from a few years ago when the growing demand for electricity spurred a surge in announcements for new wind projects.

""The federal [Trump] administration ran on rebuilding back America, building infrastructure, creating U.S. jobs, creating manufacturing – this project does all of that,"" said Chris Mikkelsen, executive director of the Port of Humboldt Bay, one of the ports that had its project funding canceled.

Bringing industry to a rural port

The federal grants were directed at creating wind manufacturing and logistics hubs, including in Maryland, Massachusetts and Staten Island in New York. The project that took the biggest hit is in Humboldt Bay in Northern California, which is losing out on more than $426 million.

The port is located in a rural part of the state, five hours north of San Francisco. For decades, it supported the local timber industry, which has waned significantly over the years. In 2022, the federal government held the first offshore lease for wind power in California, a sign the industry would be poised to take off. Mikkelsen says it represents a huge economic opportunity for his area.

""It's the biggest we've seen in the century, there's no doubt about it,"" Mikkelsen said. ""We're not talking about entry-level jobs. These are very skilled, very high-paying jobs. Jobs here in Humboldt County are in desperate need.""

The federal grant represented a significant part of funding needed for the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind Heavy Lift Marine Terminal Project, which would also leverage private and state investment. The port planned to use it to clean up and remediate polluted areas, build facilities for handling the turbine parts, dredge the waterway and build a larger wharf capable of handling pieces of steel longer than a football field.

With the funding cancellation, Mikkelsen says he hopes it's just a pause for the project, since California continues to push for renewable energy. The state has a goal of getting 100% of its electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2045. Offshore wind power is particularly useful for the state because it produces at night, when solar power goes away.

""This hurts a little bit, but it doesn't change our focus and it certainly doesn't change our outcome,"" Mikkelsen said. ""An administration can't change the fact that the U.S. has incredible energy demands.""

Turmoil for the wind industry

Electricity demand is growing across the country, especially as new data centers are built for artificial intelligence. Solar and wind projects produce cheaper energy on average than fossil fuels projects that run on natural gas and coal, though the cost can vary greatly depending on the location and type of project. The Biden administration set a goal of getting 30 gigawatts of power from offshore wind by 2030, enough for around 10 million homes. An analysis found that plan could create 77,000 jobs, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a federal research lab.

President Trump put a moratorium on the development of new offshore wind projects on his first day in office. In cancelling the Rhode Island wind project, the administration stated it was for the ""protection of national security interests,"" but did not elaborate on what those are specifically.

""We're not allowing any windmills to go up,"" Trump said earlier this week. ""Unless there's a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago, we don't allow windmills.""

More than 80 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been planned in the U.S., but their future has gotten murkier. Interest rates have gone up, making financing more challenging. Turmoil in the industry could also make it harder to attract investment. But many companies are hoping it's a passing phase, given the overall demand for electricity.

""We will have an offshore wind industry in this country because it's hard to imagine we can bring the kind of power we need to the coasts without it,"" said Jason Grumet, chief executive officer of the American Clean Power Association, a renewable energy industry group. ""But at the moment the industry is very worried because projects are being cancelled with virtually no rationale.""

In May, the DOJ filed lawsuits against New York and Vermont, arguing that state laws requiring oil companies to contribute billions of dollars into funds to pay for damage caused by climate change were unconstitutional.

The legal challenge against New York alleges that the state’s “superfund” law is a “transparent monetary-extraction scheme” designed to fund the state’s infrastructure projects with money from out-of-state businesses.

“The Superfund Act is a brazen attempt to grab power from the federal government and force citizens of other States and nations to foot the bill for its infrastructure wish list,” the DOJ wrote in the 29-page complaint.

In both lawsuits, the Justice Department cited a Jan. 20 executive order signed by President Donald Trump declaring a national energy emergency to speed up permitting of energy projects, roll back environmental protections, and withdraw from an international pact to fight climate change. DOJ lawyers allege that the state climate change laws imperil domestic energy production.

New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, signed by then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2019, requires the state to reduce its excess greenhouse gas emissions and authorizes it to seek up to $75 billion in damages from fossil fuel companies. Regulations for the new law have yet to be issued, which prompted a lawsuit from green groups seeking the state to post them.

New York is also facing a lawsuit filed by 22 Republican attorneys general who argue that the law will do little to blunt the impact of climate change while passing on the costs to the state’s consumers in the form of higher energy bills. The outcome of that case is still pending.

In the rapidly evolving landscape of clean energy technologies, a surprising hero may be emerging from an unlikely source: mining waste. These byproducts and leftover materials from extraction processes contain significant quantities of critical minerals essential for renewable energy systems, batteries, and other clean technologies. What was once discarded as an environmental liability is increasingly recognized as a valuable secondary resource that could strengthen domestic supply chains while reducing environmental impact.

Research from the Colorado School of Mines demonstrates remarkable potential: extracting even small percentages of minerals from existing mine waste could replace significant portions of current U.S. imports for clean energy materials, potentially transforming the global mining waste for clean energy supply chain.

What Makes Mining Waste Valuable for Clean Energy?

Mining waste contains abundant quantities of minerals crucial for clean energy applications. When mining companies extract targeted minerals like copper and gold, they typically focus on separating these specific materials while discarding the rest as tailings or waste rock. However, these ""leftovers"" frequently contain substantial concentrations of other valuable minerals.

The strategic value of mining waste lies in its accessibility. These materials have already been excavated, crushed, and partially processed—eliminating the most resource-intensive and environmentally disruptive steps of mining. By developing advanced extraction methods for these pre-processed materials, companies can access critical minerals with significantly lower energy requirements and environmental impacts.

Furthermore, utilizing existing mining waste solutions reduces the need for new land disturbance, minimizes habitat destruction, and presents opportunities to remediate legacy mining sites while extracting valuable materials—effectively turning environmental liabilities into assets.

How Abundant Are Critical Minerals in Mining Waste?

Surprising Mineral Concentrations in Existing Waste

A comprehensive analysis of thousands of ore samples from 54 active U.S. hard rock metal mines revealed remarkable concentrations of critical minerals in mining waste. According to Elizabeth Holley and colleagues at the Colorado School of Mines, extracting just 1% of certain minerals from mining byproducts could replace all current U.S. imports of those materials.

Many critical minerals exist in these waste repositories at concentrations comparable to primary ore deposits. In some cases, waste piles contain higher concentrations of certain minerals than the original targeted metals, presenting a compelling case for reprocessing these materials.

The abundance varies by mine type and mineral. Copper mine tailings frequently contain significant amounts of cobalt and molybdenum, while iron ore waste often holds rare earth elements and vanadium. These concentrations represent vast untapped resources sitting in plain sight.

Statistical Overview of Critical Minerals Recovery Potential

Critical Mineral Recovery Rate Needed to Replace Imports Primary Clean Energy Applications Rare Earth Elements 10-30% Wind turbines, EV motors Lithium 20-40% Batteries, energy storage Cobalt 15-25% Batteries, solar panels Nickel 30-50% Batteries, hydrogen production Copper 10-20% Transmission, solar panels, EVs Graphite 60-90% Batteries, fuel cells

While some minerals would require higher recovery rates to meet domestic demand, the potential remains significant. Even partial recovery could substantially reduce import dependencies and strengthen supply chain resilience for critical clean energy materials.

Why Is Mining Waste Reprocessing Gaining Momentum?

Supply Chain Security Concerns

Recent global disruptions have highlighted the vulnerability of critical mineral supply chains. Western nations face significant dependencies on a small number of countries for essential materials:

China controls approximately 60% of rare earth element processing globally

Over 70% of cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo

Indonesia dominates nickel production with nearly half of global supply

Supply disruptions during recent global crises exposed systemic vulnerabilities

These dependencies create economic and national security risks that mining waste recovery could help mitigate by establishing domestic sources of critical materials. As U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright noted, ""For too long, the United States has relied on foreign actors to supply and process the critical materials that are essential to modern life and our national security.""

Environmental Benefits of Waste Reprocessing

Reprocessing mining waste offers multiple environmental advantages compared to new mining operations:

Reduces the need for new land disturbance and habitat destruction

Decreases water consumption by up to 60% compared to primary mining

Lowers energy requirements by 40-75% for most minerals

Minimizes acid mine drainage and other pollution from existing waste piles

Creates opportunities for site remediation during reprocessing

By extracting additional value from already disturbed sites, mining waste recovery represents a more sustainable mining transformation to meeting mineral demands for clean energy technologies.

What Technologies Enable Mining Waste Recovery?

Innovative Extraction Methods

New technologies are transforming the economics and feasibility of recovering minerals from waste:

Advanced bioleaching uses specialized microorganisms to extract metals from low-grade waste

Electrochemical recovery systems can selectively remove specific metals from solution

Hydrometallurgical processes enable selective extraction without high-temperature processing

Machine learning algorithms optimize recovery rates and reduce chemical usage

Nanotechnology enhances separation efficiency for complex mineral mixtures

These technologies continue to advance, with ongoing research improving selectivity, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. As extraction technologies mature, previously uneconomical waste resources become viable sources of critical minerals.

Carbon Capture Integration

Some mining wastes offer an additional benefit beyond mineral recovery—they can sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere:

Magnesium and calcium-rich mining tailings naturally absorb CO₂ through mineral carbonation

Enhanced mineral carbonation techniques accelerate this process

Studies show that some nickel mine tailings can capture more carbon than the mine's operations emit

This dual-purpose approach creates carbon-negative mineral recovery operations

By combining mineral recovery with carbon sequestration technology, mining waste reprocessing could contribute to both the supply of clean energy materials and climate change mitigation efforts.

How Economically Viable Is Mining Waste Recovery?

Cost-Benefit Analysis

The economics of mining waste recovery are increasingly favorable due to several factors:

Rising critical mineral prices improve recovery economics (lithium prices increased 400% from 2020-2023)

Processing costs continue to decline with technological improvements

Environmental compliance costs for waste storage are avoided

Government incentives and funding support development of domestic supply chains

Transportation costs are minimized by using existing mine infrastructure

As demand for critical minerals continues to grow—with projections indicating a tripling of demand by 2030 and quadrupling by 2040 to meet clean energy transition goals—the economic case for mining waste recovery strengthens further.

Case Study: Successful Waste Recovery Projects

Several projects demonstrate the economic viability of mining waste recovery:

Rio Tinto's Kennecott Copper Mine (Utah) – Recovers tellurium, gold, and silver from copper processing waste, generating significant additional annual revenue

Phoenix Tailings (Massachusetts) – Extracts rare earth elements from iron ore tailings using carbon-free processes powered by renewable energy

Jervois Mining's Idaho Cobalt Operations – Reprocessing historic mine waste to recover cobalt for EV batteries while remediating environmental issues

These operations showcase how companies can create new revenue streams while addressing environmental concerns through innovative waste reprocessing.

What Government Initiatives Support Mining Waste Recovery?

U.S. Federal Programs and Funding

The U.S. government has implemented several programs to accelerate mining waste recovery:

Department of Energy committed nearly $1 billion for unconventional mining efforts in 2024

$250 million specifically targeted for recovering minerals from mining byproducts

Critical Minerals Innovation Hub established to develop new extraction technologies

Inflation Reduction Act provides tax incentives for domestic critical mineral production

Defense Production Act authorities activated to support critical mineral supply chains

These initiatives reflect growing recognition of mining waste's strategic importance for domestic supply chain security and clean energy transition.

International Approaches

Other countries are also pursuing mining waste recovery strategies:

European Union's Critical Raw Materials Act includes targets for recovering minerals from waste

Australia's Critical Minerals Strategy prioritizes recovery from existing mines

Canada's Critical Minerals Innovation Fund supports waste reprocessing projects

Chile requires new copper mines to include plans for reprocessing tailings

This global momentum demonstrates broad recognition of mining waste's potential as a resource rather than merely an environmental liability.

What Challenges Must Be Overcome?

Technical Limitations

Despite the potential, significant challenges remain:

Complex mineralogy makes selective extraction difficult

Some critical minerals exist in ultra-low concentrations

Energy requirements for processing fine-grained materials can be substantial

Water management in processing operations requires careful planning

Scaling laboratory successes to commercial operations involves engineering challenges

Ongoing research and development efforts focus on addressing these limitations through improved extraction methods, process optimization, and innovative approaches to mineral separation.

Regulatory and Permitting Hurdles

Regulatory frameworks often impede waste reprocessing:

Mining waste classified as hazardous material in some jurisdictions

Permits for reprocessing can be as complex as new mine permits

Liability concerns for disturbing stabilized waste facilities

Unclear ownership of historic mining wastes

Lack of specific regulatory pathways for waste reprocessing

Streamlining regulatory processes specifically for waste reprocessing projects could accelerate adoption while maintaining necessary environmental safeguards.

How Could Mining Waste Transform the Clean Energy Supply Chain?

Potential Impact on U.S. Mineral Independence

Mining waste recovery could significantly reduce U.S. import dependence:

Potential to supply 25-40% of domestic critical mineral needs by 2030

Could eliminate imports for certain minerals like manganese and vanadium

Would create resilience against supply disruptions and price volatility

Enables faster scaling of domestic clean energy manufacturing

By developing domestic sources of critical minerals from existing waste, the U.S. could reduce geopolitical vulnerabilities while accelerating clean energy deployment.

Long-term Sustainability Benefits

Beyond immediate supply chain benefits, mining waste recovery contributes to long-term sustainability:

Creates circular economy for mineral resources

Reduces lifecycle environmental impacts of clean energy technologies

Transforms environmental liabilities into economic assets

What Does the Future Hold for Mining Waste Recovery?

Emerging Research Directions

Research continues to improve mining waste recovery potential:

Developing mineral-specific extraction techniques

Creating modular, mobile processing units for remote sites

Integrating artificial intelligence for data-driven mining operations

Exploring zero-waste recovery systems

Investigating biological remediation combined with mineral recovery

These research efforts promise to expand the range of recoverable minerals and improve the economics of waste reprocessing.

Industry Transformation Potential

The mining industry itself may be transformed by waste recovery:

Shift from single-mineral to multi-mineral extraction business models

Integration of waste recovery into initial mine planning

Development of specialized waste recovery companies

Creation of mineral recovery parks where multiple companies process different elements

New revenue streams from carbon credits for CO₂ sequestration

This transformation could reshape mining economics and practices, creating a more sustainable and efficient industry aligned with clean energy transition goals.

How Can Mining Waste Recovery Be Accelerated?

Policy Recommendations

Several policy changes could accelerate mining waste recovery:

Create streamlined permitting pathways specifically for waste reprocessing

Establish tax incentives for critical minerals recovered from waste

Develop certification standards for sustainably recovered minerals

Fund demonstration projects at commercial scale

Support workforce development for specialized recovery skills

These policies would address key barriers to widespread adoption while supporting industry development.

Investment Opportunities

The sector presents various investment opportunities:

Technology companies developing specialized extraction processes

Mining companies diversifying into waste recovery

Environmental remediation firms expanding into mineral recovery

Infrastructure development for processing facilities

Specialized equipment manufacturing for waste processing

As Brian McNulty at the University of British Columbia notes, the ""opportunity is vast"" and could ""energize people in government as well as industry to take a closer look at what we're mining.""

FAQs About Mining Waste and Clean Energy Supply Chains

What are the most valuable minerals found in mining waste?

Mining waste contains numerous valuable minerals for clean energy applications, with the most economically significant being copper, nickel, cobalt, lithium, rare earth elements, manganese, and vanadium. The specific concentration varies by mine type, with copper mine tailings often containing significant cobalt and molybdenum, while iron ore waste frequently contains rare earth elements and vanadium.

How does mining waste recovery compare to recycling electronics?

Both mining waste recovery and electronics recycling contribute to circular material flows, but they address different parts of the supply chain. Mining waste recovery accesses minerals that were previously uneconomical to extract during original mining operations, while electronics recycling recovers minerals from end-of-life products. Mining waste typically contains lower concentrations of minerals but exists in much larger volumes, making it complementary to electronics recycling efforts.

Could mining waste recovery eliminate the need for new mines?

While mining waste recovery can significantly reduce the need for new mines, it cannot completely eliminate it. Current waste streams contain substantial amounts of critical minerals, but growing demand for clean energy technologies will likely require some new primary production. However, waste recovery can reduce the environmental footprint of mineral production and extend the timeline for developing new mines.

What role can mining waste play in carbon sequestration?

Certain types of mining waste, particularly those rich in magnesium and calcium silicates, naturally absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through a process called mineral carbonation. This process can be accelerated through various technologies, potentially allowing mine sites to become carbon sinks rather than sources. When combined with mineral recovery operations, this creates a dual benefit of supplying critical minerals while reducing atmospheric CO₂.

How does the energy required for waste processing compare to new mining?

Processing mining waste typically requires 40-75% less energy than extracting the same minerals from virgin ore. This efficiency comes from the waste already being crushed and partially processed, eliminating the most energy-intensive steps of mining. Additionally, waste processing facilities can more easily be powered by renewable energy due to their smaller scale and flexibility in location.

Transforming Liabilities into Strategic Assets

Mining waste represents a significant opportunity to strengthen clean energy supply chains while addressing environmental challenges. By developing and deploying advanced recovery technologies, the United States and other countries can reduce their dependence on imported critical minerals, minimize the environmental impact of resource extraction, and accelerate the transition to clean energy.

The transformation of mining waste from environmental liability to strategic asset demonstrates how innovative approaches can simultaneously address economic, environmental, and security challenges. With continued investment in research, supportive policy frameworks, and commercial-scale demonstration projects, mine reclamation innovation could become a cornerstone of sustainable critical mineral supply chains for the clean energy transition.

As demand for critical minerals continues to grow—with battery metals alone contributing 85% of total demand growth over the past two years—mining waste recovery offers a pragmatic path forward that balances supply security with environmental stewardship.

The federal Department of Energy has again extended the operational life of units 3 and 4 of the Eddystone Generating Station.

The order runs through Nov. 26. The previous extension expired on Aug. 28. The plant was due to be retired by Constellation Energy in May.

The units can produce a combined 760 megawatts.

Ensuring these units remain operational minimizes the risk of generation shortfall that could lead to unnecessary power outages, the government said.

“With unprecedented energy demand and resource retirements outpacing new generation additions, the country is facing an energy emergency. Today’s order proves that the Trump administration is dedicated to confronting this critical issue,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “This administration considers power outages and soaring energy costs to be unacceptable.”

As outlined in DOE’s Grid Reliability Evaluation, power outages could increase by 100 times in 2030 if the U.S. continues to take reliable power offline, the DOE said.

According to the administration, in a December 2024 filing at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, PJM Interconnect stated that its preliminary analysis shows “substantial increases” in load additions and that “its resource adequacy concerns are increasing at an extraordinary pace.”

There are some who don’t see the need for the plant remain open, according to Canary Media, which states that it is “Clean energy journalism for a cooler tomorrow.”

“Advocates fear that these directives, taken together with recent executive orders and other DOE moves, signal the Trump administration’s commitment to keeping every fossil-fuel plant running, no matter the consequences.

“In total, just over 38 gigawatts’ worth of power plants are slated to close between now and the end of 2028, more than two-thirds of which is coal.

“Blocking all planned closures of fossil-fueled power plants would be disastrous for efforts to decarbonize the U.S. power grid — and also for consumers, who are already navigating fast-rising power bills. It could cost utility customers billions of dollars each year to prop up this unnecessary infrastructure, according to an August report from research firm Grid Strategies.”",https://www.delcotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25153685755115-1.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-08-31 13:02:46.105369

Years of underinvestment in Cuba’s transmission network and power plants have led them to run below capacity, with the country’s energy supply falling far below its demand.

In addition to localised power outages, in the last eight months, Cuba has experienced four nationwide blackouts. In May, Cuba’s electricity demand rose to 3.05 GW, compared to 2.58 GW in March, as the supply stood at around 1.9 GW. This means that on average, the government can meet between 50 to 70 percent of Cuba’s energy needs.

The regular blackouts have led people across the country to invest in charcoal stoves, rechargeable batteries and fans, as well as other vital products to use during outages when confronted with soaring temperatures, which many can barely afford.

In March, when Cuba’s national electrical grid collapsed, most of the island’s population of 10 million was left without power, including those in the capital of Havana. Popular tourist hotels had to rely on generators, while many had no access to power at all. The regular blackouts prompted anti-government demonstrations in 2021, 2022, and 2024, and the problem persists.

Jorge Piñón, a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin’s Energy Institute, said that solving Cuba’s energy crisis would take between three and five years and up to $8 billion in investment.

The crisis comes from years of underinvestment and mismanagement of Cuba’s energy infrastructure, which has placed a significant burden on the country’s existing electricity grid, with little public funds to invest in improvements or in the development of renewable energy projects. Cuba’s National Electric System was developed after 1959 and has been poorly maintained and updated since, due to years of political and economic instability. This has led to issues that can normally be easily fixed, such as transmission line failures, causing widespread outages.

In 2024, the Antonio Guiteras oil-fired power plant ground to a halt, and instead of backup systems coming online to provide power, the outdated systems were unable to detect the system faults, which spurred a nationwide blackout.

In addition to years of underinvestment and a lack of maintenance, Cuba has long relied on substandard fuel, which has strained the system. The Caribbean country depends heavily on domestic, poor-quality heavy crude oil, which is corrosive because of its high sulphur content, adding to the rapid ageing of the country’s power plants.

Cuba’s thermal power plants, powered by crude oil or fuel oil, have become increasingly less reliable in recent years and now run below capacity due to issues like fuel shortages and corrosion. It was not only last year that the 330 MW Antonio Guiteras plant broke down, as the facility has long been difficult to keep running due to the inability of the operator to acquire the parts needed to repair it. This is an issue seen across many of Cuba’s power plants, including the Lidio Ramón Pérez and Máximo Gómez thermal plants. From January to May this year, Cuba’s power plants combined were running at an overall average daily capacity of around 34 percent.

Cuba imports fuel, but its trade links are far from stable. It has relied on neighbouring Venezuela for oil for years, but heavy sanctions on Venezuelan energy in recent years by the United States have led to underinvestment in the South American country’s crude supply, resulting in unstable export volumes.

In recent months, Mexico has sent higher levels of crude to Cuba, with state-owned Pemex shipping an all-time high of 39 shipments of crude and refined products to Havana at a value of over $850 million between May 29 and June 27. This value is similar to that of the total amount of oil shipped from Mexico to Cuba over the previous two years, at around $1 billion.

China has increased support for Cuba in recent years to help alleviate the burden on the government to fix the ongoing energy crisis. China is developing 92 solar parks that could provide over 2 GW of clean electricity, over half of which is expected to be operational by the beginning of 2026. This supports the Cuban government’s goal of achieving an energy mix of 24 percent renewables by 2030. China is also helping the Caribbean Island to modernise its grid by introducing photovoltaic technology, to eventually reduce Cuba’s heavy reliance on fossil fuels.

The government has long talked about diversifying Cuba’s energy mix, with significant potential to develop its solar, wind, and sugarcane biomass resources. However, a lack of investment, inadequate policies and complex bureaucracy have led to severe delays in development in the past. Now, without modernisation, the grid is not stable enough to add new large-scale renewable energy connections. Therefore, foreign investment in improvements to Cuba’s transmission infrastructure and renewable energy sector could finally support a transformation in the coming years.

Public, media and expert amnesia about nuclear power’s ineffectiveness is a driving factor in its resurgence

By Michael Turton / Contributing Reporter

In the run-up to the referendum on re-opening Pingtung County’s Ma-anshan Nuclear Power Plant last month, the media inundated us with explainers. A favorite factoid of the international media, endlessly recycled, was that Taiwan has no energy reserves for a blockade, thus necessitating re-opening the nuclear plants. As presented by the Chinese-language CommonWealth Magazine, it runs: “According to the US Department of Commerce International Trade Administration, 97.73 percent of Taiwan’s energy is imported, and estimates are that Taiwan has only 11 days of reserves available in the event of a blockade.”

This factoid is not an outright lie — that would be too easy to spot. Instead it is an abuse of reason. Industrial use accounts for over half of Taiwan’s electricity demand. Most of that, along with a considerable chunk of Taiwan’s commercial demand, would collapse in the event of a blockade. What is left of residential demand (less than 20 percent of demand on a good day) and a handful of shops and factories could run for months on coal and renewables, as Ko Yun-ling (柯昀伶) and Chao Chia-wei (趙家緯) pointed out in a piece at Taiwan Insight earlier this year.

This construct thus presented to readers a simple morality play: Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) policy bad! Nukes good! Energy security! Many writers reinforced this by connecting the nuke plant shut-downs to DPP policy and not to the fact that spent fuel pools were full and the plants had reached their planned lifetimes.

Writing on the referendum, the well-known site Domino Theory cited Chao, research director at the Taiwan Climate Action Network, who argued a blackout in 2017 “increased support for nuclear power by fostering anxiety about Taiwan’s energy supply.” The blackout occurred “even though all three nuclear plants were operational at the time.”

NUCLEAR UNRELIABLE

Years have passed since the closure of the plants in the north, and the public has forgotten how nuclear power actually functioned. Chao’s comment shows how public forgetting, even expert forgetting, is an important factor in the resurgence in local support for nuclear power. In fact, the unreliability of the nuclear plants caused the blackout. The reason the electricity system was operating at its margin was that reactors were offline. A reactor at the Jinshan Nuclear Power Plant had been offline for three years at that point.

As the redoubtable Timothy Ferry observed in the News Lens in October of that year: “This past June 10, following the closure of the Jinshan Nuclear Power Plant and prior to the restart of Kuosheng [Nuclear Power Plant] reactor-1, nuclear power fell to as low as 3 percent of Taiwan’s power generation when maintenance problems at the Ma-anshan plant took one of its reactors offline for weeks.”

A 2016 piece by Ferry predicted thin power reserves in the coming summers because reactors were out of service.

“Data provided by the Atomic Energy Council shows that since 2002, the nation’s three nuclear power plants have experienced a total of 29 trigger events,” the Taipei Times editorialized in August of 2017.

“In contrast to the international concerns about Taiwan’s energy security,” the Financial Times described, speaking of the current referendum, “the domestic debate has centered on air pollution and economic growth.”

Hardly surprising, given the fearmongering about electricity, a staple of Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) propaganda since the early 2000s. The educational system is a weeding out system, and it instills in people a visceral fear of being weeded out of the international economy, a fear reinforced by the nation’s lack of international recognition. Contextualizing nuclear power as an economic growth driver appeals to that fear.

“Taiwanese have long heard that nuclear power is the cure-all to the nation’s energy problems,” the 2017 editorial cited above pointed out. The recent referendum was driven by that magical thinking.

Proponents leveraged fear by pointing out how Taiwan needs power to drive the AI boom, with the unspoken corollary that Taiwan would be weeded out if there was no AI boom. Never mind that it will be years before any nuclear power plant can be up and running again, yet the AI need is already materializing. The obvious move is to ramp up renewables, which now supply around 13 percent of Taiwan’s power. But instead, the Taiwan People’s Party referendum, which was supported by the KMT, has the nation talking about nuclear power. That diversion is its entire purpose.

Moreover, the “pollution” claims about nuclear power conceal how “emissions-free” nuclear power is used to maintain Taiwan’s inefficient, heavily-subsidized, high carbon economy, as I have written before. For example, in 2008, during the debates over the now-dead Fourth Nuclear Power Plant, a Taiwan News editorial observed that “environmentalists estimate that over 83 percent of the alleged annual carbon dioxide reduction of 18 million tons claimed for Nuclear Four could be realized simply by vetoing plans by the Formosa Plastics Group to build a steel refinery on the Yunlin coast”.

LOSS OF REWARDS

Etta Lee (李若慈), a masters student at National Taiwan University (NTU), last year did fieldwork in Hengchun Township (恆春) in Pingtung County that explored local support for the nearby nuclear power plant. On Facebook she observed: “When central and local policy debates focus on technology and safety, for most residents it is less about supporting extension or restarting than about worrying about the economic consequences of the suspension of nuclear plants — such as reduced jobs, cancellation of rewards or loss of local infrastructure resources that politicians fear.”

Locals, she notes (especially in the Kenting peninsula where there is little industry and tourism is in dire straits), are responding pragmatically to the risks and uncertainties of their economic existence “in a highly dependent and non-choice structure, rather than a positive identification of nuclear energy itself.” Fear is a powerful motivator.

The Hengchun peninsula has a large population of indigenous community. That too is an old pattern with nuclear power. Everyone is familiar with how the indigenous people on Taitung County’s Orchid Island (Lanyu, 蘭嶼) were tricked into accepting low-level nuclear waste. In 2012, then-Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator (now Vice President) Hsaio Bi-khim (蕭美琴) was alerted by locals to drilling in Hualien County’s Sioulin Township (秀林). Hsiao discovered that Taipower was looking for potential sites for geological disposal of Taiwan’s high level nuclear waste. Taipower had not bothered to seek permission or even to inform the locals of the drilling program. The township’s residents are largely indigenous.

Etta Lee also collected local stories about similar trickery in the development of the Ma-ashan plant. The locals were told that the site was ideal for an international port, one that would have spanned the entire end of the peninsula. Plans for the port were even posted on local bulletin boards. Then one day it suddenly became a nuclear power plant, and the international port was given to Taichung.

WHY MA-ANSHAN?

Why was the referendum about Ma-anshan? Because it is about as far from Taipei as one can get and still be in Taiwan. There was no reason restarting the northern nuclear power plants could not have been included. Distance from the colonial core was an important part of the appeal of the referendum, an appeal echoed in the proposals following its failure to store nuclear waste on the islands off of China.

Moreover, had the northern reactors been included, attention would have been drawn to the KMT’s role in ensuring their closure, and to local residents’ objections to the nuclear power plants and nuclear waste storage. Finally, as I noted a few months ago, there was little threat a successful referendum could actually result in re-opening the plant. Years will pass before a site for storing spent fuel is identified, storage constructed, the fuel removed, safety evaluations conducted and the plant re-started.

David Reid in 2011 wrote for this paper on the Fourth Nuclear Plant in New Taipei City’s Gongliao District (貢寮), noting that hundreds of billions of New Taiwan dollars had been spent on the plant with no electricity generation in sight. The plant was mothballed in 2015.

“What if that same amount of money had been invested in renewable energy projects beginning from 1997?” he asked. “These projects would have begun to generate power in a much shorter time frame,” he answered, while also driving development of a local renewable energy industry.

Nuclear power not only crowds out spending on renewables, it crowds out discussion and development of them.

For the KMT the referendum was a success. Foreign commentators dutifully forwarded its construction of Taiwan’s energy policy and its criticisms of the DPP, masked as “reporting.” Observers were quick to point out that it might make DPP President William Lai (賴清德) soften his stance on nuclear power, as if he hadn’t been indicating that since the fall of 2023 when he was a presidential candidate. The referendum was overwhelmingly supported but failed to pass, committing the KMT to nothing.

Why ZEV Mandates Matter for Carbon Markets While ZEV mandates are also framed as consumer or affordability issues, they also impact carbon markets, given that transportation is a major source of emissions.
In Canada, a rollback of the ZEV mandate could similarly tighten compliance markets by making it harder to meet overall reduction goals.
In short, dismantling ZEV policies doesn’t just affect consumers; it reshapes the supply-demand balance in carbon markets.","With the federal carbon tax now repealed, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has turned his attention to another flagship Liberal climate policy: the Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate. The mandate requires automakers to steadily increase the share of electric vehicles in their sales—20% by 2026, climbing to 100% by 2035.

Poilievre has stated that scrapping the policy will be a priority for the Conservative Party this fall, framing it as a matter of affordability and consumer choice. This move is not surprising. ZEV mandates are highly visible, consumer-facing policies, and that makes them politically vulnerable.

A Familiar Political Playbook

This is another major Liberal climate policy the Conservatives have targeted, following the federal fuel charge, which Mark Carney repealed following the election. Both were framed not specifically as environmental measures, but as affordability issues. While abstract carbon pricing mechanisms or industrial regulations can feel distant, gas prices and the availability of affordable vehicles impact voters more directly, making this framing more tangible and effective.

The ZEV mandate is also under pressure from other directions. Canada’s auto sector faces headwinds from global tariffs and federal EV rebates expired earlier this year. Without incentives, EV adoption and supply in Canada may slow, making it more challenging to meet targets and mandates. Automakers, meanwhile, are lobbying for looser rules or delayed targets, given challenges to the sector from trade tensions with the U.S.

ZEV Mandates in the U.S.

ZEVs are also subject to a political tug-of-war south of the border. From the outset of his second term, President Trump pledged to eliminate California’s ZEV mandates, and within months, congressional actions and the “One Big Beautiful Bill” effectively repealed key state authorities and ended federal EV tax credits of up to USD 7,500, which will expire on 30 September. The result has been a slowdown in EV sales and new legal battles, with California working to override the gap through state rebates, mandates, and the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS).

Why ZEV Mandates Matter for Carbon Markets

While ZEV mandates are also framed as consumer or affordability issues, they also impact carbon markets, given that transportation is a major source of emissions. If ZEV adoption slows, the sector’s emissions will remain higher for longer. That, in turn, may increase demand for compliance credits in regulated carbon markets.

In California, weaker EV adoption could mean upward pressure on California Carbon Allowance (CCA) prices and on credits under the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), given slower emissions reductions compared to the target. In Canada, a rollback of the ZEV mandate could similarly tighten compliance markets by making it harder to meet overall reduction goals. In short, dismantling ZEV policies doesn’t just affect consumers; it reshapes the supply-demand balance in carbon markets.",https://www.clearbluemarkets.com/hubfs/Blog%20images/Blog%20images-Oct-18-2024-02-11-54-2389-PM.png,N,,2025-08-31 13:02:17.735831

Colorado is directing state agencies to prioritize permits for projects that might qualify for the credits. Maine regulators are moving up timelines to purchase new power, hoping to give developers a head start on construction.

And renewable industry leaders are pressing governors and lawmakers to clear bureaucratic backlogs and connect projects to the grid in the narrow window that remains.

Federal clean energy tax credits have been essential to the financing of wind and solar projects across the country, and a key part of states’ plans to transition to wind and solar power.

Following President Donald Trump’s moves to quickly phase out those credits, pending projects have a tight time frame to start construction before their eligibility expires. But states have long struggled to speed up permitting decisions, reduce regulatory hurdles and add new power to the grid. And the clock is running out.

“Every month counts,” said Patty O’Keefe, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy nonprofit. “[The tax credits] are the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project that’s currently in the pipeline.”

States scramble to complete renewable energy projects before tax credits expire

Over the past few weeks, some governors have directed state agencies to fast-track permits for wind and solar projects. They have also urged utilities and regulators to ensure new power can quickly connect to the grid. Some state regulators have accelerated their timelines to sign contracts for new energy, in hopes of getting more projects started before the fast-approaching construction deadline.

But it’s unclear how quickly states can clear up the bureaucratic backlogs that have frustrated them for years. And any projects that don’t meet the deadlines will face significant additional costs, likely increasing consumers’ electricity bills.

“There are billions of dollars in tax credits that are part of [state regulators’] financial analysis,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. “If every project was unable to access those tax credits, that would be a substantial additional cost to utility ratepayers.”

Permitting

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, extended the federal government’s clean energy tax credits into the 2030s. The policy offered developers a 30% tax credit for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. A separate production credit for projects in operation offered money for every unit of clean electricity they generated.

State leaders say the credits have been key to the financing of wind, solar and other renewable energy projects. States with mandates to transition to clean electricity say the federal support was integral to their plans.

For renewable energy developments, the tax credits have brought project costs down 30-50%, said Mike O’Boyle, acting policy team director with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate and energy think tank.

But the landscape changed dramatically on July 4, when Trump signed a giant domestic policy measure that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.

“Quite a lot is at risk,” said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director with Evergreen Action, a climate-focused advocacy group.

Patterson said that wind and solar projects can take one to six years to move through state permitting programs. Unless states move urgently, projects that don’t already have permits are unlikely to advance in time to qualify for the tax credits.

Colorado leaders are trying to speed up that process. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered state agencies to expedite permits for projects that are eligible for the credits.

“We’re making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly,” said Toor, of the Colorado Energy Office. “We’re focused on making sure that the state is not creating obstacles to projects moving forward.”

Toor said the state is hoping to advance “multiple gigawatts” of projects on an accelerated timeline before the credits expire. A gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes.

State officials and industry leaders said it’s hard to precisely quantify the scope of projects that could benefit from state actions to accelerate deployment. Federal data shows that states plan to add nearly 200 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery storage capacity by 2028. Collectively, those projects could power roughly 145 million homes.

Some states, including California, have created a streamlined “one-stop” permitting process through a single state agency, O’Boyle said. Those states are best equipped to get more projects underway.

“When those tools are in place, there is an ability to target and streamline permitting for specific projects, especially when such large cost reductions are at stake,” he said.

Michigan passed a similar permitting law in 2023, while Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is currently pushing for the creation of a state energy siting board.

O’Keefe, who is based in Minnesota, has called for that state and its municipalities to adopt SolarAPP+, a software platform that automates solar permitting for local governments and other jurisdictions.

Interconnection

Once clean energy developers have received approval from the state, they must wait for approval from grid operators before they can build their projects and plug into the power system. In many places, those “interconnection queues” have suffered from yearslong backlogs that have slowed the buildout of energy projects.

Now, some governors are pushing regulators and utilities to connect as many projects as possible before the tax credits expire.

In Maine, the state Public Utilities Commission kicked off an accelerated procurement process last month, seeking bids for nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy. That’s equivalent to roughly 13% of the state’s electricity usage. By moving up the timeline for developers to submit proposals to build new power projects, regulators hope to give them a better chance to start construction before the deadline.

Regulators in Oregon and Minnesota are also considering proposals to fast-track electricity procurements. And Toor, the Colorado official, said regulators there will open additional procurement windows to allow more projects to be considered. The letter from Polis, the Colorado governor, also referenced the Public Utilities Commission’s authority to override permit denials from local authorities.

In California, clean energy developers have called on state regulators to create a new solicitation for projects eligible for the tax credits, allowing them to begin construction sooner. The industry groups also called on state officials to streamline environmental review and permit approvals.

O’Boyle noted that California’s transmission system has surplus capacity at existing gas-fired power plant sites. Building wind and solar projects near those plants would allow them to plug into that infrastructure and quickly come online. State lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would promote the use of such “surplus interconnection.”

New York has 26 permitted but unbuilt wind and solar projects, New York Focus reported, totaling about 3 gigawatts of energy. Developers have only started construction on two of the large projects approved by the state in the past four years.

Clean energy advocates told the outlet that projects need approvals and agreements from multiple agencies before moving forward.

“Every last whisper of detail of the project has to be finalized before they generally let you start construction,” said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.

Badenoch said it was ""absurd"" the UK was leaving ""vital resources untapped"" while ""neighbours like Norway extracted them from the same sea bed"".
Her plan echoes US President Donald Trump's pledge to ""drill, baby, drill"" and embark on new oil and gas exploration.
In 2023, then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak granted 100 new licences to drill in the North Sea which he said at the time was ""entirely consistent"" with net zero commitments.","Kemi Badenoch has said her party will remove all net zero requirements on oil and gas companies drilling in the North Sea if elected.

The Conservative leader is to formally announce the plan to focus solely on ""maximising extraction"" to get ""all our oil and gas out of the North Sea"" in a speech in Aberdeen on Tuesday,

She will claim that net zero measures mean households end up ""paying the price through higher energy bills"".

The Labour government has committed to banning new exploration licences. A spokesperson said: ""We'll take no lectures from Kemi Badenoch. Every family and business paid the price of the Conservatives' failure to secure the UK's energy.""

Exploring new fields would ""not take a penny off bills"" or improve energy security and would ""only accelerate the worsening climate crisis"", a government spokesperson warned.

Badenoch signalled a significant change in Conservative climate policy when she announced earlier this year that reaching net zero would be ""impossible"" by 2050.

Successive UK governments have pledged to reach the target by 2050 and it was written into law by Theresa May in 2019. It means the UK must cut carbon emissions until it removes as much as it produces, in line with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.

Now Badenoch has said that requirements to work towards net zero are a burden on oil and gas producers in the North Sea which are damaging the economy and which she would remove.

The Tory leader said a Conservative government would scrap the need to reduce emissions or to work on technologies such as carbon storage.

Badenoch said it was ""absurd"" the UK was leaving ""vital resources untapped"" while ""neighbours like Norway extracted them from the same sea bed"".

Her plan echoes US President Donald Trump's pledge to ""drill, baby, drill"" and embark on new oil and gas exploration. It is a reversal of former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which channelled billions of dollars into clean energy.

In 2023, then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak granted 100 new licences to drill in the North Sea which he said at the time was ""entirely consistent"" with net zero commitments.

Since then, major energy companies such as BP have U-turned on the level of investment in renewables to focus on increasing oil and gas production in order to boost profitability.

Tessa Khan, executive director of Uplift, a research and campaign group, said Badenoch's plan was ""reckless"" and would not ""bring down energy bills"".

""These rules are the bare minimum to needed hold the industry to account, and removing them will simply mean more emissions, more environmental harm and more handouts to oil and gas giants at the nation's expense,"" she said.

Reform UK has said it will abolish the push for net zero if elected.

But Liberal Democrat environment spokesperson Tim Farron said scrapping requirements to reduce emissions ""is nothing short of irresponsible environmental vandalism"".

He said the UK ""should be setting our sights on leading the world in clean energy, in off shore wind, instead of falling back to a dependency on fossil fuels"".

Research shows that 2024 was the first calendar year where the average temperature exceeded 1.5°C.

This made it the hottest year since records began in 1850, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, which is managed by the European Commission and uses data from the European Union's space programme.

The UK was one of 200 countries to sign the Paris Agreement who agreed to ""pursue efforts"" to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C and keep them ""well below"" 2.0C above those recorded in pre-industrial times.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/468a/live/43964620-85fc-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 14:05:05.225120

In Missouri and Illinois, five coal plants have been exempted, and in Pennsylvania, all 12 of the coal plants seeking approval have been approved.
Then in July, Trump exempted chemical companies for two years from Biden’s 2024 HON Rule, a set of regulations that control hazardous air emissions from chemical plants called the Hazardous Organic National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants.
But owners of the chemical plants should not act so surprised, said Neil Carman, a former regulator for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.
Carman pointed out that the heads of chemical companies have been in talks with Trump’s EPA since the election.","This story was originally published by Capital & Main.

For Donna Thomas, smokestacks are a typical sight from her home in Fort Bend County, Texas. Since she was a child, she has seen the coal and natural gas-powered W.A. Parish Generating Station puff clouds of haze during the day and light up brightly at night. The facility — which has been around since 1958 — is both part of the background and all she thinks about.

Thomas is not alone. For decades, residents have expressed concerns over the pollution emitted from the Parish coal plant — a separate facility from the natural gas plant — and called for its closure. The plant, located about 30 miles southwest of downtown Houston, is ranked by Texas environmental regulators as one of the worst polluters in the state for certain hazardous emissions. These include mercury, a toxic heavy metal particularly harmful for children and pregnant people.

This year, mercury has been top of mind for environmental activists and residents like Thomas. In April, President Donald Trump announced an exemption for companies from implementing stricter Biden-era mercury regulations for two years. Of the 163 eligible coal plants, 11 are in Texas and six have been approved, including Parish’s operator, NRG Energy. In Missouri and Illinois, five coal plants have been exempted, and in Pennsylvania, all 12 of the coal plants seeking approval have been approved.

Then in July, Trump exempted chemical companies for two years from Biden’s 2024 HON Rule, a set of regulations that control hazardous air emissions from chemical plants called the Hazardous Organic National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants.

The Trump administration determined the exemptions are in the country’s best interest and represent a burden on industry, and that the technology is not available to meet stricter regulations. Companies like NRG agree.

However, critics say the Biden administration’s 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards — called MATS for short — and the HON Rule were long overdue and the two-year delay in implementing them is merely a tactic to protect industry profit margins at the expense of public health.

Moreover, critics point out that the MATS delay may be giving companies the freedom to ignore toxic air emissions rules until the Trump administration repeals the Biden-era regulations altogether. In June, the Environmental Protection Agency under Trump proposed a rule to eliminate the 2024 MATS rule completely.

The two rules together have set off alarm bells for experts and environmentalists in Texas, home to one of the world’s largest petrochemical sectors and 11 coal-powered plants. The exemptions will run from 2027 — when the Biden rules were supposed to take effect — to 2029.

“We know these rollbacks are not good for anyone, especially for those that are community fenceline,” said Thomas, also the founder and president of the Fort Bend Environmental — a grassroots organization focused on environmental justice. “We have around 1,000 homes within 3 miles of Parish, so that’s going to affect all of them.”

A two-year delay

The EPA has been working on stricter environmental regulations for chemical plants since the early 1990s. Only in 2020 did Biden’s EPA begin drafting new rules in earnest.

But owners of the chemical plants should not act so surprised, said Neil Carman, a former regulator for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

“The chemical industry has known for decades that this was all coming, but they don’t like rules, because it means they have to put on more pollution control and they have to do more leak inspections,” said Carman, now the clean air director for the Texas chapter of the Sierra Club. “These plants will always tell you, ‘Safety first, safety first,’ but then you run into this thing called money.”

Of the 79 chemical facilities in Texas requesting exemptions, 15 have been approved, including 13 along the Gulf Coast and the so-called petrochemical corridor.

Carman pointed out that the heads of chemical companies have been in talks with Trump’s EPA since the election. In March, the administration announced that companies could apply for exemption from MATS, HON, and seven other sets of emissions standards.

That same month, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin met with Dow Inc. Chairman-CEO Jim Fitterling to discuss regulations imposed by the Biden administration, according to public records and emails obtained by the Sierra Club.

In one email sent on March 17, Dow reps asked to discuss “clarity” on the EPA’s recent announcement that it will reconsider the HON rule and “Dow has met with the Office of Air and Radiation regarding an extension of the current compliance deadline, which is impossible to meet.”

In May, Zeldin met with Fitterling and other chemical company CEOs to discuss the industry at large. Then in July, Trump announced the exemptions for HON, including for two chemical plants in Louisiana and one in Seadrift, Texas, operated by Dow and its subsidiary Union Carbide.

In a statement to Capital & Main, a Dow spokesperson said that “safety and integrity are at the core of both companies’ operations” and the “extensions are appropriate and necessary to address the technical challenges and to ensure the continued safe and efficient operation of these facilities.”

Carman doesn’t buy it. He worked as an environmental regulator in Texas for 12 years. Even then, he said, companies never seemed to be able to find the budget to limit their emissions and chemical leaks. For him, it’s still the cost.

“A lot of these are old plants and so when they go in and do all this work,” Carman said, “they have to find a place where they’re going to put in new controls and they have to engineer it. They have to design it all. It’s months of planning, but these rules were out there. They knew they were coming. They just want two more years of delay.”

Limiting mercury

When the EPA implemented the 2012 MATS rule, mercury emissions dropped 86 percent — or 4 tons — in five years.

In 2024, Biden’s EPA approved a rule to strengthen MATS by tightening the emissions standards for mercury by another 70 percent and reducing pollutants discharged through wastewater from coal-fired plants by more than 660 million pounds per year.

The rule could prevent as many as 11,000 premature deaths, 2,800 cases of chronic bronchitis, and 130,000 asthma attacks, according to the EPA under Biden.

However, in April, Trump approved the exemptions for 47 coal-powered plants across the nation. As of mid-August, 70 are now exempted, including Parish.

“These rules were just so critically important to people’s health,” said Surbhi Sarang, senior attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund. The Trump administration “was doing this process that was just not transparent. I mean, there was no process. Whereas in rulemaking, there’s public comment. This is just like a presidential action that was kind of taken in a vacuum and then announced.”

In response to the exemption, Erik Linden, senior director of communications at NRG, said the time is needed and will be used to evaluate the technology for air quality systems and monitoring equipment for compliance.

“All existing MATS emission controls will be properly maintained and remain in service,” Linden said of the current MATS rules that began in 2012. The exemption would give NRG until 2029 to implement the changes.

However, in July, Trump’s EPA proposed eliminating Biden’s rule entirely by the end of the year. Interested parties had three weeks to submit comments, and the Environmental Defense Fund’s request for an extension was denied.

“Rulemaking usually takes 12-18 months if not longer,” Sarang said. “They’re moving very quickly.”

All of this is alarming for residents living near industry. With the extent of the changes to environmental regulations coming down from the Trump administration, there’s a lot for Thomas, the Parish generating station neighbor, to process. But she hasn’t given up. Increasingly, Thomas is talking to her neighbors and fellow residents about fighting back.

This means sending letters to representatives in Texas and in Washington, D.C. Thomas said it pays to be loud.

Parish is “going to do the same thing it’s been doing,” Thomas said. “If the EPA does not put a stop to these [emissions] getting out, then everyone is going to pay for this with their lives and in their water and in their air.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/coal-creek-station.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-08-31 12:05:02.840153

What was called the Solar for All program aimed to expand access to onsite solar power systems and community solar arrays, specifically targeting low-income and disadvantaged communities across the state.

“The effect of the decision to revoke NH’s Solar For All grant will simply be that the affordable housing in New Hampshire is less affordable,” said Sam Evans-Brown, executive director of Clean Energy NH. “These grant dollars were going to be used to provide significant savings to people at a time when electric bills are skyrocketing.”

Phil Coupe, co-founder of ReVision Energy, the state’s largest solar installer, said President Donald Trump’s administration energy policy is “explicitly designed to harm the renewable energy industry while propping up a declining fossil fuel industry.”

ReVision has been responsible for several publicly funded installations in the state, including arrays for the towns of Exeter, N.H., and Jaffrey, N.H., in Kingston, N.H., for energy-provider Unitil Corp., and other commercial enterprises, such as Blasty Bough Brewing Co. in Epsom, N.H.

The state of New Hampshire even touted the Solar for All program, exclaiming on a website page as recently as June the benefits it would bring to low-income households. That page on the New Hampshire Department of Energy website has since disappeared with a “Page Not Found” notation.

As of this writing, the Solar for All page remains posted on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency website.

Noting an award amount of $43,510,000 for New Hampshire, the EPA described the project as follows: “The New Hampshire Department of Energy (NHDOE), The New Hampshire Community Loan Fund, and New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority have jointly designed a comprehensive and complementary approach to bring the benefits of residential-serving community solar to those least able to afford this new technology.“

The Solar for All program was wrapped into the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, initiated by Democrats in Congress and ultimately signed by then-President Joe Biden, also a Democrat.

The current Republican majority in Congress, at the behest of Trump, eliminated the funds as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), even as states such as New Hampshire were gearing up for installations for qualified homeowners.

In a social media post on X (formerly known as Twitter), EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said: “In some cases, your tax dollars were diluted through up to FOUR pass-through entities, each taking their own cut off the top! The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.”

Dan Weeks, ReVision’s vice president of business development, called the move a disappointing “11th-hour clawback.”

“It is the latest in a series of attacks from Washington on the cheapest, most abundant energy resources we have, which will only serve to raise energy costs for all Americans while putting countless electricians and other energy professionals out of work,” Weeks said.

High energy costs hit low-income households the hardest, according to Weeks.

“Although more and more homes and businesses are investing in solar to lower their energy costs, low-income folks and renters have been generally locked out because of the upfront cost and state opposition to shared community solar,” Weeks said.

“The federal Solar for All program was starting to change that, with $43 million in funding for New Hampshire already approved by Congress and awarded to the state to provide thousands of low-income families access to rooftop and community solar,” he added.

Evans-Brown questioned the legality of clawing back previously-approved funds.

“The congressional record established during the debates over the OBBBA clearly shows that Congress did not intend for that bill to retroactively claw back funds that had already been obligated,” he said. “This means that instead of going towards a program that would have enhanced energy independence and affordability, your tax dollars will now go towards expensive and unnecessary legal battles.”

Several states and organizations have indicated they are going to challenge the clawback in court.

In a joint statement, the state’s two U.S. representatives and two U.S. senators — all Democrats — said: “This unlawful action would directly contradict our shared goal of lowering costs for American households.”

According to the statement from U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas (1st CD), U.S. Rep. Maggie Goodlander (2nd CD), U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, and U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan, several organizations within the Granite State were poised to deploy the money in various energy-saving projects.

They said the Community Loan Fund planned to use this funding to support energy projects for up to 20 resident-owned manufactured home communities. Similarly, New Hampshire Housing planned to use this funding to install community solar on workforce housing projects. The state Department of Energy, as the lead applicant, planned to expand community energy programs across the state for communities not covered by its partners.

Their comments were contained in a letter to EPA chief Zeldin.

“These projects were designed to reduce costs for low-income households and would reduce utility bills for those households by 20 percent or more,” the delegation said. “These organizations are already preparing to put this money to work and are incurring costs to do so. By rescinding these grants, the Administration would force costs onto nonprofits and deny low income households much-needed relief from increasing energy costs.”

Weeks said ReVision remains “committed to expanding solar access however we can. We wish the federal government would make good on its promises to help scale this vital work for citizens in need.”

In his blog post statement, ReVision’s Coupe said most Americans remain committed to clean energy alternatives.

“Innovations in solar panel manufacturing, cutting-edge battery storage technologies, electric transportation, and heat pump efficiency are continuing domestically and abroad, illuminating the fact that the clean energy genie is out of the bottle and even magical thinking and extreme political acts by the fossil fuel-funded Trump administration are incapable of putting it back in,” said Coupe.

Zeldin recently toured the state as part of his advocacy for the Constitution Pipeline project, which would link natural gas supplies in Pennsylvania to Northeast markets. It was first proposed in 2012 but canceled in 2020 because of opposition and permitting obstacles in New York and elsewhere.

“I hope that New York and other states will take a look at it again, because all of us are facing energy prices that are too high, so we want to have more supply so that we can reduce people’s costs,” Ayotte said during Zeldin’s visit.

The minerals left behind from previous mining activities in already established mines could provide all the raw material required to build clean energy technologies, according to the study.
However, the study showed that this “waste” is often full of other useful materials, including dozens of critical minerals.
Critical minerals can be described as ‘critical’ if they are considered to have a role in a country’s strategically important economic sectors.
The IEA predicts that demand for critical minerals will need to triple by 2030 and quadruple by 2040 if we hope to achieve net-zero emissions.","The United States is racing to develop its critical minerals industry to reduce reliance on China for metals and minerals, even through controversial actions such as deep-sea mining activities. However, a recent study suggests that it may be easier for the U.S. to access critical minerals than once thought, by developing new operations in existing mines.

An analysis of active U.S. mines, published in New Scientist in August, shows that accessing the leftover ore discarded in many U.S. mines is packed with a wide range of critical minerals. The minerals left behind from previous mining activities in already established mines could provide all the raw material required to build clean energy technologies, according to the study. Even if just a fraction of these minerals is recovered, it could help meet the growing U.S. demand for critical minerals without the need for imports or the development of new, environmentally damaging mines.

However, accessing these minerals could be challenging, according to the authors. This is because, at present, most mining activities focus on extracting specific types of minerals, such as copper and gold, rather than accessing the full array of metals and minerals that may be available. Mining for copper and gold requires excavating the ore, crushing it, and then separating the main product using a range of metallurgical processes. The excess rock and metal are typically discarded as mining waste. However, the study showed that this “waste” is often full of other useful materials, including dozens of critical minerals.

Critical minerals can be described as ‘critical’ if they are considered to have a role in a country’s strategically important economic sectors. This varies country to country depending on the most common applications. Many emerging critical mineral markets are closely linked to the expansion of the renewable energy sector, which relies heavily on various metals and minerals for equipment and operations.

Demand for critical minerals increased significantly in 2024, with lithium demand rising by 30 percent, while the demand for nickel, cobalt, graphite, and rare earths rose by between six and eight percent. Higher demand was largely driven by energy applications such as electric vehicles, battery storage, renewables, and grid networks, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). While for battery metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and graphite, the energy sector has contributed 85 percent of the total demand growth over the past two years. The IEA predicts that demand for critical minerals will need to triple by 2030 and quadruple by 2040 if we hope to achieve net-zero emissions.

To conduct the study, Elizabeth Holley and her colleagues at the Colorado School of Mines assessed thousands of ore samples and production data, representative of mines from across the U.S., to estimate the volume of other minerals present in 54 active hard rock metal mines, which could be extracted. The study showed that extracting just one percent of certain minerals from mining byproducts could replace all current U.S. imports. However, some minerals would need an extraction rate of between 10 and 90 percent to meet the U.S. demand, and others, such as gold, platinum, and palladium, would likely still need to be imported, even if they are recovered at 100 percent from mining byproducts.

New mining operations focusing on enhanced mineral recovery from existing mines could significantly reduce the U.S. reliance on metal and mineral imports, a move that President Trump has supported since coming into office. Trump has stated plans for new mining activities, and even the controversial launch of deep-sea mining operations, to reduce the U.S. dependence on China for its minerals and strengthen the domestic supply chain.

In August, the U.S. Department of Energy announced almost a billion dollars in funding for unconventional mining efforts, with $250 million focused on recovering minerals from mining byproducts. U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said, “For too long, the United States has relied on foreign actors to supply and process the critical materials that are essential to modern life and our national security.”

The study shows that investment in better extraction practices from active mines could reduce the financial and environmental burden of the domestic critical mineral industry while providing vast quantities of essential minerals. Brian McNulty at the University of British Columbia in Canada said the “opportunity is vast” and “Hopefully it energises people in government as well as industry to take a closer look at what we’re mining.”

While there is huge potential to improve mining extraction processes, significant investment needs to be made in research and development to make this possible. The expertise and equipment must be improved to use mines to their full potential, which could ultimately lead to huge long-term savings, as well as less damage to the environment.

“Our Florida springs are something unique, not just to Florida but to the country,” Fine said.
They test water quality, take photos of underwater vegetation, count birds and more, seeking to spot any big changes that may require action.","Seen from the air, a Florida freshwater spring is a bit of liquid heaven, luring humans and wildlife to enjoy its aquamarine cool. With at least 1,000 of them — more than any other state — the springs serve as beaches for large swaths of central and northwestern Florida far from the ocean, with teenagers backflipping from docks and snorkelers peering into the crystalline depths.

But these treasures are under threat from agricultural pollution, rapid development and climate change.

Some places, such as fast-growing Zephyrhills, have paused some construction as it struggles to stay within limits on the drinking water it can withdraw from a vast underground aquifer. Zephyrhills is home to Crystal Springs, source of the bottled water named after the town and several other brands.

“We really had to do something,” said Steven Spina, a member of the town council. “A lot of residents thought it was a good thing. People were happy to see us take a breath.”

Covering an estimated 100,000 square miles, the underground Floridan Aquifer is the source of 90% of the state's drinking water. Because of the porous nature of the bedrock, millions of gallons of water find their way to the surface in the form of clear, clean springs that, in turn, feed into rivers.

The highest concentration of springs are in Central and North Florida, including most of the 30 “first magnitude” springs — those that discharge at least 65 million gallons of water every day. All but four are considered polluted.

“We just have too much pollution going into the ground and too much water coming out of the ground,” said Ryan Smart, executive director of the nonprofit Florida Springs Council. “And when you get that combination, you end up with springs that are no longer blue and vibrant and full of life.”

Agriculture, development are main threats

In rural Florida, runoff from fertilizers and pesticides used in farm fields is a major part of the problem. Fertilizers containing phosphates and nitrogen promote algae blooms that can suffocate a spring. Livestock waste contributes, too.

“When that algae covers everything, then you lose all of the seagrasses. The seagrasses are the forests of the water,” Smart said. “Then you begin to lose the biodiversity. And it even puts our drinking water at risk.”

ALSO READ: Pollution, overpumping and hurricanes are taking a toll on Crystal River's springs

Elsewhere in Florida, rampant development is the threat. With over 1,000 people moving to Florida every day, more housing subdivisions are sprouting, along with the roads, strip malls, restaurants, golf courses and everything else that comes with them.

That means more paved surfaces that keep rainwater from percolating down into the aquifer and more pollutant-laden runoff from lawn fertilizers, parking lots, ever-widening roads and sometimes septic tanks. It also means more and more people, many of whom enjoy tubing, paddleboarding, kayaking and swimming in the springs.

It gets so busy in summer at some springs located in state and local parks that entry is halted by late morning. At Ichetucknee Springs State Park north of Gainesville, the daily limit of 750 tubers on the upper river is often reached within an hour after the park opens.

Kaelin Gibbs, on vacation in June with his family from Georgia, was swimming in the Blue Hole Spring along the Ichetucknee River.

ALSO READ: Florida adopts revised plans to improve water quality

“This is simply incredible; the water is cool and clear,” said Gibbs. “We’ve been to Florida’s beaches and to Orlando. There is no comparison to how beautiful this spring is.”

But that's in peril, said Dennis Jones, a Republican former legislator deeply involved in springs issues. He said the volume of permits being issued for water use isn't sustainable.

“You cannot keep taking water out of the aquifer because it’s not an endless supply,” Jones said.

Phosphate mining has also taken a toll on springs. Their operations require a great deal of water, which reduces water pressure available for springs. Some have died almost completely from mining and other factors, including White Sulphur Springs in North Florida, which was a sacred place for Native Americans and later a tourist resort that attracted famous visitors such as Henry Ford and Theodore Roosevelt.

A more subtle threat to the health of springs involves Earth's changing climate. It is altering rainfall patterns around the globe, threatening the balance that feeds Florida's springs.

In addition, some springs along the coasts are facing an intrusion of saltwater, according to the Southwest Florida Water Management District. Four major springs are becoming increasingly brackish because of sea level rise and declining rainfall.

""As a result, freshwater vegetation has a hard time surviving in this saltier environment and unwanted vegetation moves in,"" the district said in a website post.

State laws to protect springs remain stalled

Florida spends billions every year on water quality projects, including about $800 million this year for Everglades restoration work. State funding for springs runs about $50 million a year, according to state documents.

Two state efforts at improving springs' quality, both about a decade old, remain bottled up in court and administrative challenges. One would strengthen rules for permits to draw water from the major springs. The other would enhance rules to reduce the amount of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphates that goes into springs that are considered impaired.

Jones said lobbying by powerful agricultural interests and related political pressures have blocked progress on the nitrogen reduction plan that was expected to take about 20 years.

ALSO READ: Advocacy group's lawsuit claims Florida is failing to protect springs and waterways

“We’ve burned up almost 10 years and they haven’t got on stage one. We got more nitrates now than when we started,"" Jones said.

In Congress, Republican U.S. Rep. Randy Fine recently filed a bill that would create a Florida Springs National Park across several counties, centered around the Ocala National Forest. Fine said in a statement the designation would protect the springs and increase funding.

“Our Florida springs are something unique, not just to Florida but to the country,” Fine said.

Bottling companies get cheap permits for water

It costs bottling companies just $115 for a permit allowing them to withdraw millions of gallons of water in perpetuity. But they do pay local taxes.

Blue Triton, the company that bottles Zephyrhills water, pays about $600,000 a year in taxes for things like schools, public safety and so forth, Spina said.

“They are one of our largest taxpayers,” he said.

Though they have challenges, Florida's freshwater springs have energetic friends, too.

Michelle Jamesson loves the springs; she grew up swimming in one and is determined to help protect them for future generations. She volunteers for SpringsWatch Citizen Science Program, coordinating and working with other volunteers for monthly tests on the Wekiva River, north of Orlando.

""Our vision is to decentralize energy access and create an open network where anyone can earn by powering the future of mobility.""

DeCharge is currently operating a pilot program in New York and Los Angeles, with further expansion into Washington, D.C., Maryland, Virginia, and other areas on the horizon.

How does it work? DeCharge lets property owners install its chargers. The property owners set prices and stand to benefit financially from real-time payments and long-term revenue sharing, per the report.

DeCharge's business model addresses a critical need: as of early 2025, only 183,000 public charging ports were available in the U.S., well short of the 1.2 million needed by 2030, according to Department of Energy estimates cited by E+E Leader.

Additionally, the platform uses decentralized blockchain for payments and AI for various other tasks, such as load balancing and pricing optimization.

Without the resources of a giant corporation or a municipal government, DeCharge is seeking new and innovative solutions to doing business in the EV market in ways that will hopefully not just appeal to the early adopters, but also newer EV users.

If you already drive or are in the market for an EV, using solar panels can further increase the benefits of owning one.

Installing solar panels on your home can dramatically reduce the costs associated with EV ownership, as charging with home solar energy is cheaper than using public charging stations or relying on the grid. EnergySage's free tools make it easy to compare quotes from vetted local installers and save up to $10,000 on solar installation.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DeChargeimage-recSUCbSG5KaUeIdv-e1756566583160.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 12:03:36.968661

For Fleet Managers, Sustainability Managers and Finance Managers, this announcement is significant. All-solid-state batteries are widely seen as the next step in electric vehicle (EV) technology, offering higher energy density, faster charging, and improved safety compared to today’s lithium-ion batteries. However, bringing ASSBs to mass production at a commercially viable cost remains a key challenge.

Why this matters for fleets

A breakthrough in electrode production is central to reducing the cost of solid-state batteries and speeding up their availability in commercial vehicles. Nissan’s collaboration with LiCAP focuses on dry electrode technology, which eliminates the costly drying and solvent recovery stages used in traditional battery manufacturing.

By removing these steps, the dry electrode method could:

Lower battery costs, making EVs more financially attractive for fleet procurement.

Cut environmental impact, aligning with sustainability targets and emissions reduction plans.

Simplify manufacturing, potentially leading to faster scale-up of production capacity.

For fleets, the potential outcome is more affordable EVs with longer driving ranges, higher durability, and faster charging – all critical factors in reducing downtime and improving total cost of ownership.

LiCAP’s technology advantage

LiCAP brings its proprietary Activated Dry Electrode® technology, which offers improved production efficiency and better performance compared to traditional solvent-based methods. This addresses one of the biggest bottlenecks in scaling up ASSB production – maintaining efficiency at high volumes.

Nissan’s roadmap

Nissan opened its ASSB pilot production line in January 2025 and has committed to launching its first EVs equipped with in-house developed solid-state batteries by fiscal year 2028. The partnership with LiCAP is expected to accelerate this timeline by solving key manufacturing hurdles.

For fleet operators planning long-term replacement schedules, this signals that solid-state EVs may be on the market within the next vehicle cycle – offering lower running costs and longer lifespans. Finance Managers in particular should note the potential impact on residual values as next-generation battery technology enters the fleet market.

What it means for sustainability goals

Solid-state batteries are expected to offer higher energy density, which translates into longer driving range without increasing battery size. For organisations with sustainability targets, the shift to solid-state will support deeper emissions reductions, especially in applications where vehicles cover high daily kilometres.

Nissan’s move to reduce environmental impact in the production process itself – by cutting solvents and drying requirements – adds another layer of sustainability benefits.

Key takeaway for fleets

Nissan’s partnership with LiCAP is not just an R&D milestone – it’s a signal that the next leap in EV technology is moving closer to commercialisation. Fleet Managers should factor solid-state timelines into medium-term planning, as the technology could reshape both procurement decisions and cost models before the end of the decade.",https://fleetevnews.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Nissan-X-Trail-e-Power-STL-hybrid-drive-mode-button.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 14:04:27.177419

All major permits for the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 development project have been secured.
Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 is expected to include two liquefaction trains capable of producing approximately 13 Mtpa of LNG, which could increase the total liquefaction capacity of the Port Arthur LNG facility from approximately 13 Mtpa for Phase 1 to up to approximately 26 Mtpa.
Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, which is currently under construction, is expected to achieve commercial operations in 2027 and 2028 for trains 1 and 2, respectively.
Sempra Infrastructure is a subsidiary of Sempra (NYSE: SRE), a leading North American energy infrastructure company.","Sempra Infrastructure, a subsidiary of Sempra (NYSE: SRE), and EQT Corporation (NYSE: EQT) today announced a 20-year definitive sales and purchase agreement (SPA) for the supply of 2 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) offtake from the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 development project in Jefferson County, Texas. Pursuant to the SPA, EQT will purchase the LNG on a free-on-board basis at a price indexed to Henry Hub, Sempra said.

The Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 development project is strategically positioned to help meet global energy demand and has attracted strong interest from prospective LNG buyers. In July 2025, Sempra Infrastructure signed a definitive 20-year SPA with JERA Co., Inc. for 1.5 Mtpa of LNG offtake. Earlier this month, Sempra Infrastructure expanded its strategic alliance with ConocoPhillips with a 20-year SPA for 4 Mtpa of LNG offtake from the proposed project. Future phases are also in the early development stage.

In September 2023, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted project approval, followed by an export authorization from the U.S. Department of Energy in May 2025, allowing LNG exports to countries without a free-trade agreement with the United States. All major permits for the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 development project have been secured.

Further advancing the project, Sempra Infrastructure also previously announced that Bechtel had been selected to deliver the engineering, procurement and construction of the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 facility. With continued momentum in the project’s development, Sempra Infrastructure continues to target making a final investment decision on the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 project in 2025.

Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 is expected to include two liquefaction trains capable of producing approximately 13 Mtpa of LNG, which could increase the total liquefaction capacity of the Port Arthur LNG facility from approximately 13 Mtpa for Phase 1 to up to approximately 26 Mtpa. Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, which is currently under construction, is expected to achieve commercial operations in 2027 and 2028 for trains 1 and 2, respectively.

The development of the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 project remains subject to various risks and uncertainties, including completing the required commercial agreements, securing and/or maintaining all necessary permits, obtaining financing and reaching a final investment decision, among other factors.

For Guinea, the symbolism of the Kaleta station appearing on national currency is not accidental.","Guinea’s journey from crippling energy shortages to becoming a regional electricity exporter has been symbolically enshrined on its 20,000-franc banknote. The image of the Kaleta Hydropower Station, now central to the country’s power supply, captures more than just infrastructure, it tells the story of a nation reshaping its energy future through hydropower and international cooperation.

For decades, Guinea’s vast rivers earned it the title of the “Water Tower of West Africa.” Yet paradoxically, over 70 percent of its electricity was generated from costly and polluting fuel oil. The fragile grid imposed daily blackouts, stifled industrial growth, and left communities dependent on the noisy hum of diesel generators after sunset.

This reality began to change in August 2015 when the Kaleta Hydropower Station was commissioned on the Konkouré River. Built by the China International Water and Electric Corporation (CWE), the 240-megawatt facility added 1.125 billion kilowatt-hours of clean energy annually, meeting nearly half of the country’s power deficit at the time. A modern transmission network was simultaneously constructed, extending electricity access beyond Conakry to 11 prefectures, many of which received reliable power for the first time.

In 2021, the momentum was reinforced by the commissioning of the larger Souapiti Hydropower Station, also developed by CWE upstream. Together, Kaleta and Souapiti now generate 690 megawatts, supplying over 80 percent of Guinea’s electricity demand. Their impact has been profound: the nation’s reliance on fuel oil has been drastically reduced, and Guinea has transitioned from a power-deficient country into a net exporter of renewable energy. Neighboring countries such as Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, and Sierra Leone are now being supplied with Guinean electricity.

Local voices testify to this transformation. “Before Kaleta was built, power outages were common in our community. We experienced them almost daily, sometimes lasting for hours,” recalled Alhassane Bangoura, a translator who worked on the project and later joined the operations team. Today, he and other Guinean technicians maintain the facility independently, thanks to extensive training provided by Chinese engineers.

At the height of construction, more than 1,500 local jobs were created. Beyond employment, a deliberate skills-transfer program was established. Nearly 100 Guinean trainees were sent either to China or to local universities for specialized study. Those who first trained at Kaleta went on to mentor new recruits at Souapiti, ensuring continuity and building local technical capacity. This emphasis on knowledge sharing was described by CWE’s market development director, Chen Qiuhan, as essential for long-term sustainability: “Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.”

The projects have had visible social ripple effects. Rural communities have been electrified for the first time, small enterprises now operate with greater efficiency, and children study under steady lighting rather than candle flames. Equipment donations and community engagement programs have reached thousands of residents, while cultural exchanges between Chinese engineers and Guinean locals deepened trust during construction.

Hydropower’s growing role in Guinea also aligns with broader continental trends. Africa is estimated to hold 12 percent of the world’s hydropower potential, however, less than 10 percent of that capacity has been harnessed. In Guinea, the Konkouré River alone is expected to host multiple future projects that could cement the country as an energy hub in West Africa.

Environmentalists have, however, raised important questions. While hydropower is renewable, it is not without ecological costs. Reservoirs alter river ecosystems, affect fish populations, and can displace communities. In Guinea’s case, concerns around resettlement and biodiversity loss accompanied both Kaleta and Souapiti, reminding stakeholders that sustainability must balance energy access with environmental stewardship.

Nevertheless, the projects have been hailed as milestones in Africa-China cooperation in infrastructure and green energy. For Guinea, the symbolism of the Kaleta station appearing on national currency is not accidental. It signals the pride of a nation once shackled by power shortages, now positioning itself as a driver of energy integration in West Africa.

As night falls over the Konkouré valley, the lights from Kaleta glitter across the landscape, illuminating homes, schools, and factories. The glow also extends beyond Guinea’s borders, powering communities in neighboring countries. For many, those lights stand as proof that sustainable energy development, when paired with knowledge transfer and regional cooperation, has the potential to reshape economies and societies alike.",https://africasustainabilitymatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/3967089530822349314.png,N,,2025-08-31 14:05:22.968167

Jeep brand sales saw a 2% increase.","The U.S. car industry has had its share of struggles since its heyday.

General Motors used to control about 50% of the U.S. car market and, along with Ford and Chrysler, the Detroit Big 3 held about 85% of the U.S. market through the 1960s.

Even through the 90s, the Big 3s market share was above 70%, and it didn't dip below 50% until 2008.

However, over the last 17 years, automakers from Japan and Korea have successfully toppled Detroit's dominance.

Ford and GM sales combined represented at least 50% of U.S. sales every year until 2001, and fell below 33.3% for the first time in 2012.

While there are numerous reasons for the decline, one of the most obvious is that U.S. cars have a reputation for lacking in quality.

Consumer Reports recently ranked car brands on their reliability using data from its annual reliability surveys.

Consumer Reports Top 5 reliable auto brands:

Subaru

Lexus

Toyota

Honda

Acura

The first U.S. car company to make the list is GM Brand Buick at 11. Ford checks in at 13, Chevy at 16, and Tesla at 17.

Stellantis doesn't rank until Jeep makes an appearance at 19.

Stellantis recalls another 219,000 vehicles due to rearview camera issue

Stellantis has a new CEO focused on retaking the company's place as one of the country's top automakers. But its latest recall won't help it turn things around.

Chrysler parent company Stellantis STLA is recalling 219,577 Ram ProMaster vans and Dodge Journey vehicles in the U.S. due to an issue with the rearview camera that could diminish the driver's view, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Saturday.

Earlier this summer, Chrysler issued a voluntary recall of 250,651 Pacifica and Voyager minivans model years 2022-2025.

Recalls are a recurring problem for Chrysler. Last year, the brand recalled more than 211,000 SUVs and pickup trucks due to a software malfunction that could disable the vehicles' electronic stability control systems.

Chrysler also recalled 67,180 300s due to another side airbag issue that could cause the device to rupture.

Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa commits to the U.S. market with latest moves

Antonio Filosa, Stellantis' new CEO, has recommitted to the U.S. market by moving the CEO's office back to Michigan and plans to invest billions in U.S. manufacturing.

Since Tesla does not do press loaners like other automakers do, I rented this Model Y off Turo for a week. It's a Long Range, Dual-Motor All-Wheel-Drive model, the one packing a 75-kilowatt-hour battery and good for an EPA-rated 329 miles of range. And thanks to a raft of improvements inside and out, the Model Y is now a significantly better car than it's ever been—one with a nicer interior, better technology, more overall comfort, more range, more striking looks, and packing the best adaptive high beams I have ever tested in my career. All that and a bag of chips for around $45,000, before any incentives or tax breaks, as long as those last.

As you'll see in the video above, the Model Y remains the total package EV. Maybe it's not the fastest-charging EV these days. Nor is it the fastest, period. And there are many areas where rivals are beginning to outpace it, if they have not already. But can you find all of those things rolled into one car that's as good as this one, at this price point? The answer is not really.

Yes — but in moderation | Opinion,"The McClatchy California Editorial Board, David McNew",,,,,https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/editorials/article311777957.html,"Thanks to electric vehicles, demand for oil has been steadily declining in California.
Gavin Newsom introduced a plan in July that would fast-track oil drilling in California — allowing thousands of additional wells in Kern County, which is already producing 75% of the state’s crude oil.
But the sudden threat of high prices should not trigger a major expansion of California oil drilling.
It makes no sense, for example, for California to export state-produced oil to neighboring states like Nevada and Arizona.
“We’ve continued to have conversations with Valero,” Siva Gunda, vice chair of the California Energy Commission, told a state Assembly committee.","Thanks to electric vehicles, demand for oil has been steadily declining in California. But for now — and for at least another decade or two — cars in our state continue to run primarily on gasoline.

That’s creating a supply-and-demand problem that’s been driven home by current circumstances. Two major refineries — a Phillips 66 facility in Southern California and a Valero plant in Benicia — are scheduled to close in less than a year.

The closures set off alarm bells ringing loudly enough to inspire our eco-friendly governor who normally rants about “Big Oil” to act.

Gavin Newsom introduced a plan in July that would fast-track oil drilling in California — allowing thousands of additional wells in Kern County, which is already producing 75% of the state’s crude oil. The proposal is expected go to the state Legislature in September.

This is coming from a governor who once set a goal of phasing out oil production statewide by 2045.

Now Newsom is being accused of giving up on the “green utopia” and caving to Big Oil in an attempt to better position himself for a run for president.

The governor, however, sees it as a balancing act.

“We are all the beneficiaries of oil and gas. No one’s naive about that,” Newsom said at a press conference. “So it’s always been about finding a just transition, a pragmatism in terms of that process.”

He’s got the basic idea right, but shortcutting environmental review to speed up production could have damaging consequences. And given that Donald Trump has declared a de facto war on clean energy, what we need now is a climate hero willing to push back on the president, rather than someone introducing a watered-down version of “drill-baby-drill.”

This it the wrong time for the governor to retreat — or even appear to retreat — from his commitment to clean energy. This should strictly be about how to decrease our dependence on oil in the best way possible.

Gas for $8.43 a gallon?

Nobody wants to see a huge spike in gas prices, certainly not to the $8.43-a-gallon level that USC business professor Michael Mische has predicted.

But the sudden threat of high prices should not trigger a major expansion of California oil drilling. Not when there are other solutions.

It makes no sense, for example, for California to export state-produced oil to neighboring states like Nevada and Arizona.

And it may make sense — at least on a temporary basis — to allow the import of less-expensive, conventional gasoline from other states rather than relyingonly the cleaner-burning, California blend. Some environmental experts say that will have a minimal effect on air quality.

“Even some advocates of the cleaner formulation a few decades ago argue that the benefits are likely now much smaller as engine technology has improved,” writes Severin Borenstein, faculty director of Energy Institute at Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. “It is possible that the clean air benefits of our special formulation are no longer large enough to justify the costs.”

Also, expanding the network of EV chargers — and making sure they are well maintained — would encourage drivers to go electric, reducing the demand for gasoline. So would backfilling the tax credits canceled by Trump.

What is the plan?

The major thrust of Newsom’s 10-year plan, which is based on recommendations from the California Energy Commission, is to fast track permitting of new oil wells in two ways:

One, which focuses entirely on Kern County, calls for certifying a county zoning ordinance and its accompanying environmental impact report. That would shield the county from legal challenges from environmental groups that oppose the EIR, which allows the blanket permitting of new wells — as many as 2,700 per year — rather than requiring a review of each one individually.

The other proposal, called plug-to-drill, would streamline permitting of new wells throughout the state, with a catch: Petroleum companies would have to agree to properly plug and abandon two existing wells for every new one they drill.

State officials also are working to stabilize refinery capacity. The Energy Commission has been negotiating to prevent the Benicia plant from closing next April, but there has been no public indication of how that’s going.

“We’ve continued to have conversations with Valero,” Siva Gunda, vice chair of the California Energy Commission, told a state Assembly committee. “They’re confidential in nature.”

Allow limited new drilling

The Newsom proposal also includes a total ban on fracking, codifying an earlier ban that took effect in 2024. That’s a huge plus.

Plug-to-drill also has benefits. It would help clean up the orphan wells that past oil drillers left behind, creating a toxic nightmare for some disadvantaged communities like Arvin in Kern County, where releases of flammable gases triggered evacuations several years ago.

Orphan wells — so called because there is no one on the hook to bill for the cleanup — can continue to leak methane and volatile organic compounds like benzene and toluene. California has a program to cap them, funded by state, federal and industry dollars, but it’s a long, slow and expensive process.

Plug-to-drill could lead to hundreds more wells being capped, while boosting the crude oil supply by a relatively modest amount, spread throughout various parts of the state.

Plug-to-drill would not override local jurisdictions.

AB 3233, which was signed into law last September and allows counties and cities to “limit or prohibit oil and gas operations or development,” would remain in effect.

Several agencies, including the city and county of Los Angeles, have either passed prohibitions on new drilling or are considering it.

Start closing the book on Big Oil

While some amount of new drilling may be necessary, the residents of Kern County who have suffered ill effects from oil wells located practically in their back yards deserve to be assured that any future oil development will undergo proper review.

That won’t happen if the state swoops in and approves a drilling plan drafted by a county board that’s obviously pro-industry, rather than allowing a court to decide whether the latest iterations of the zoning ordinance and EIR are adequate.

Gov. Newsom does have a duty to ensure that California has an adequate and reasonably affordable supply of gasoline. This cannot lead to slowing California’s transition to zero-emission energy sources.

It’s time to start closing the book on Big Oil, rather than starting a whole new chapter — something state lawmakers should keep in mind when considering the governor’s plan.",https://www.sacbee.com/public/latest-news/qgdjgq/picture293342179/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/US-NEWS-CALIF-OIL-INDUSTRY-GET.JPG,N,,2025-08-31 10:59:23.452277

Just over a week ago, the Trump Administration ordered wind companies to stop construction on a wind farm off the Rhode Island coast.
Offshore wind power is particularly useful for the state because it produces at night, when solar power goes away.
President Trump put a moratorium on the development of new offshore wind projects on his first day in office.
More than 80 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been planned in the U.S., but their future has gotten murkier.","The Trump administration is cancelling $679 million in federal funding for ports to support the country's offshore wind industry, the latest move in President Trump's ongoing campaign against wind power.

Offshore wind is still a developing industry in the U.S., while Europe already has thousands of wind turbines in deep ocean waters. Those offshore turbines are dramatically larger than ones on land and require substantial infrastructure at ports for construction, from large assembly facilities to deepwater docks for ships that carry turbines out to sea.

Ports around the country hoped to seize the economic opportunity to become hubs for the wind industry. Under the Biden administration, 12 port projects from California to Virginia were granted funds, all of which the Trump administration said on Friday it was either withdrawing or cancelling.

""Wasteful wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America's maritime industry,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in announcing the decision. He said if possible, the funding would be redirected to ""address critical port upgrades.""

Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., who represents an area that lost funding, said in a statement, ""This is a new level of idiocracy, where the Trump administration is trying to destroy an entire sector of clean energy, kill thousands of good paying jobs, and drive up electricity prices for American consumers.""

Just over a week ago, the Trump Administration ordered wind companies to stop construction on a wind farm off the Rhode Island coast. Trump is a long-time critic of wind power, claiming it's expensive and kills birds. He has pushed for cuts to tax incentives for wind and solar, which analyses have shown could raise electricity prices around the country.

The wind industry is reeling from the recent decisions, a marked change from a few years ago when the growing demand for electricity spurred a surge in announcements for new wind projects.

""The federal [Trump] administration ran on rebuilding back America, building infrastructure, creating U.S. jobs, creating manufacturing – this project does all of that,"" said Chris Mikkelsen, executive director of the Port of Humboldt Bay, one of the ports that had its project funding canceled.

Bringing industry to a rural port

The federal grants were directed at creating wind manufacturing and logistics hubs, including in Maryland, Massachusetts and Staten Island in New York. The project that took the biggest hit is in Humboldt Bay in Northern California, which is losing out on more than $426 million.

The port is located in a rural part of the state, five hours north of San Francisco. For decades, it supported the local timber industry, which has waned significantly over the years. In 2022, the federal government held the first offshore lease for wind power in California, a sign the industry would be poised to take off. Mikkelsen says it represents a huge economic opportunity for his area.

""It's the biggest we've seen in the century, there's no doubt about it,"" Mikkelsen said. ""We're not talking about entry-level jobs. These are very skilled, very high-paying jobs. Jobs here in Humboldt County are in desperate need.""

The federal grant represented a significant part of funding needed for the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind Heavy Lift Marine Terminal Project, which would also leverage private and state investment. The port planned to use it to clean up and remediate polluted areas, build facilities for handling the turbine parts, dredge the waterway and build a larger wharf capable of handling pieces of steel longer than a football field.

With the funding cancellation, Mikkelsen says he hopes it's just a pause for the project, since California continues to push for renewable energy. The state has a goal of getting 100% of its electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2045. Offshore wind power is particularly useful for the state because it produces at night, when solar power goes away.

""This hurts a little bit, but it doesn't change our focus and it certainly doesn't change our outcome,"" Mikkelsen said. ""An administration can't change the fact that the U.S. has incredible energy demands.""

Turmoil for the wind industry

Electricity demand is growing across the country, especially as new data centers are built for artificial intelligence. Solar and wind projects produce cheaper energy on average than fossil fuels projects that run on natural gas and coal, though the cost can vary greatly depending on the location and type of project. The Biden administration set a goal of getting 30 gigawatts of power from offshore wind by 2030, enough for around 10 million homes. An analysis found that plan could create 77,000 jobs, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a federal research lab.

President Trump put a moratorium on the development of new offshore wind projects on his first day in office. In cancelling the Rhode Island wind project, the administration stated it was for the ""protection of national security interests,"" but did not elaborate on what those are specifically.

""We're not allowing any windmills to go up,"" Trump said earlier this week. ""Unless there's a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago, we don't allow windmills.""

More than 80 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been planned in the U.S., but their future has gotten murkier. Interest rates have gone up, making financing more challenging. Turmoil in the industry could also make it harder to attract investment. But many companies are hoping it's a passing phase, given the overall demand for electricity.

""We will have an offshore wind industry in this country because it's hard to imagine we can bring the kind of power we need to the coasts without it,"" said Jason Grumet, chief executive officer of the American Clean Power Association, a renewable energy industry group. ""But at the moment the industry is very worried because projects are being cancelled with virtually no rationale.""

By Jon Caldara

Disclosure: Gov. Jared Polis wrote much of this column.

The epitaph on Jared Polis’ gubernatorial gravestone will simply read, “He knew better, but would not stand up to his own party.”

For seven years, our hyperprogressive legislature has sent him one industry-killing bill after another. And he kept signing them, even when he knows they are bad policy, economically devastating, and even if they go against his strongest-held convictions.

One such strongly held conviction is his faith in technology.

In the tech world, the man’s no slouch. As much as I’d like to tease Polis for just being a rich kid who got richer putting his momma’s greeting-card company online, the fact is he made fortunes many times over in varied tech ventures. And most importantly, he understands what the coming artificial intelligence revolution can bring for humanity in general, but also the endless opportunities it could bring Colorado in particular.

So then why did he agree to make Colorado the first state in the nation to effectively stamp out AI development by signing Senate Bill 24-205? This law will repel AI companies from providing us their services or locating here. The AI revolution could skip Colorado.

SB-205 was designed by the “we see oppression even before it exists” crowd. They are going to stamp out discrimination from — get this — software code. Starting next year, the law outlaws “algorithmic discrimination” in AI with ridiculously costly compliance regulations.

Polis clearly laid out why 205 is terrible law in what read like a veto statement. But, since he can’t veto much of anything, he crapped all over the bill in — get this — his bill-signing statement.

So, let’s let his own words explain why he shouldn’t have signed it.

Polis noted laws against discrimination focus on intentional efforts, writing, “This bill deviates from that practice by regulating the results of AI systems use, regardless of intent.”

He’s right. A baseball bat can be used in a hate crime, but the bat manufacturer didn’t intend it for that. There are already myriad laws, regulations and codes against discrimination. If AI is used to discriminate, shouldn’t we employ all that existing legal enforcement first?

The law doesn’t target outcomes — it regulates computer code that doesn’t even exist yet. Liberals used to say code is speech and therefore protected. Those liberals are extinct.

Polis goes on to say the new law will, “create a complex compliance regime for all developers and deployers of AI” through “significant, affirmative reporting requirements.”

Again, he is right. One reason the internet turned into the economic super engine it is was early on the feds had a “hands off the internet” policy to let the industry first develop. Now Colorado is the first state with a “hands all over AI” policy while it is in its infancy. Those hands will strangle this baby.

Small, innovative AI developers will be the first driven out of Colorado. It’s confusing how the left hates big business yet builds regulatory regimes that only big businesses can afford to navigate. Add it to the list of how progressives hate the little guy.

Polis knew this law is an economy killer: “I am concerned about the impact this law may have on an industry that is fueling critical technological advancements across our state for consumers and enterprises alike.”

“Government regulation that is applied at the state level in a patchwork across the country can have the effect to tamper innovation and deter competition in an open market. To that end, the important work of protecting customers from discrimination and other unintended consequences of nascent AI technologies is better considered and applied by the federal government.”

Again, he’s right. Ironically, Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill had a 10-year “hands off AI” moratorium — a smart move Polis supported. But leave it to Republicans to strip it out.

Polis understands why what he signed is horrid. That’s why he included a call for fixing, delaying or repealing SB24-205 in the upcoming special session.

For the sake of Colorado, free speech and a better future where America isn’t at the mercy of China’s AI, I hope Polis spends the political capital needed to fix his obvious regret.

He built his fortune online, but now he’s logging off Colorado’s AI future.",https://completecolorado.com/wp-content/uploads/7ef93286df6aa0a174533988bffcea70.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 11:00:07.376498

And renewable industry leaders are pressing governors and lawmakers to clear bureaucratic backlogs and connect projects to the grid in the narrow window that remains.

Federal clean energy tax credits have been essential to the financing of wind and solar projects across the country, and a key part of states' plans to transition to wind and solar power.

Following President Donald Trump's moves to quickly phase out those credits, pending projects have a tight time frame to start construction before their eligibility expires. But states have long struggled to speed up permitting decisions, reduce regulatory hurdles and add new power to the grid. And the clock is running out.

""Every month counts,"" said Patty O'Keefe, Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy nonprofit. ""(The tax credits) are the financial backbone of nearly every renewable energy project that's currently in the pipeline.""

Over the past few weeks, some governors have directed state agencies to fast-track permits for wind and solar projects. They have also urged utilities and regulators to ensure new power can quickly connect to the grid. Some state regulators have accelerated their timelines to sign contracts for new energy, in hopes of getting more projects started before the fast-approaching construction deadline.

But it's unclear how quickly states can clear up the bureaucratic backlogs that have frustrated them for years. And any projects that don't meet the deadlines will face significant additional costs, likely increasing consumers' electricity bills.

""There are billions of dollars in tax credits that are part of (state regulators') financial analysis,"" said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. ""If every project was unable to access those tax credits, that would be a substantial additional cost to utility ratepayers.""

Permitting

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022, extended the federal government's clean energy tax credits into the 2030s. The policy offered developers a 30% tax credit for investments in energy projects that don't produce carbon emissions. A separate production credit for projects in operation offered money for every unit of clean electricity they generated.

State leaders say the credits have been key to the financing of wind, solar and other renewable energy projects. States with mandates to transition to clean electricity say the federal support was integral to their plans.

For renewable energy developments, the tax credits have brought project costs down 30-50%, said Mike O'Boyle, acting policy team director with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan climate and energy think tank.

But the landscape changed dramatically on July 4, when Trump signed a giant domestic policy measure that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.

""Quite a lot is at risk,"" said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director with Evergreen Action, a climate-focused advocacy group.

Patterson said that wind and solar projects can take one to six years to move through state permitting programs. Unless states move urgently, projects that don't already have permits are unlikely to advance in time to qualify for the tax credits.

Colorado leaders are trying to speed up that process. Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered state agencies to expedite permits for projects that are eligible for the credits.

""We're making sure that those projects move to the front of the line for permitting actions and those reviews are done quickly,"" said Toor, of the Colorado Energy Office. ""We're focused on making sure that the state is not creating obstacles to projects moving forward.""

Toor said the state is hoping to advance ""multiple gigawatts"" of projects on an accelerated timeline before the credits expire. A gigawatt can power about 750,000 homes.

State officials and industry leaders said it's hard to precisely quantify the scope of projects that could benefit from state actions to accelerate deployment. Federal data shows that states plan to add nearly 200 gigawatts of wind, solar and battery storage capacity by 2028. Collectively, those projects could power roughly 145 million homes.

Some states, including California, have created a streamlined ""one-stop"" permitting process through a single state agency, O'Boyle said. Those states are best equipped to get more projects underway.

""When those tools are in place, there is an ability to target and streamline permitting for specific projects, especially when such large cost reductions are at stake,"" he said.

Michigan passed a similar permitting law in 2023, while Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is currently pushing for the creation of a state energy siting board.

O'Keefe, who is based in Minnesota, has called for that state and its municipalities to adopt SolarAPP+, a software platform that automates solar permitting for local governments and other jurisdictions.

Interconnection

Once clean energy developers have received approval from the state, they must wait for approval from grid operators before they can build their projects and plug into the power system. In many places, those ""interconnection queues"" have suffered from yearslong backlogs that have slowed the buildout of energy projects.

Now, some governors are pushing regulators and utilities to connect as many projects as possible before the tax credits expire.

In Maine, the state Public Utilities Commission kicked off an accelerated procurement process last month, seeking bids for nearly 1,600 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy. That's equivalent to roughly 13% of the state's electricity usage. By moving up the timeline for developers to submit proposals to build new power projects, regulators hope to give them a better chance to start construction before the deadline.

Regulators in Oregon and Minnesota are also considering proposals to fast-track electricity procurements. And Toor, the Colorado official, said regulators there will open additional procurement windows to allow more projects to be considered. The letter from Polis, the Colorado governor, also referenced the Public Utilities Commission's authority to override permit denials from local authorities.

In California, clean energy developers have called on state regulators to create a new solicitation for projects eligible for the tax credits, allowing them to begin construction sooner. The industry groups also called on state officials to streamline environmental review and permit approvals.

O'Boyle noted that California's transmission system has surplus capacity at existing gas-fired power plant sites. Building wind and solar projects near those plants would allow them to plug into that infrastructure and quickly come online. State lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would promote the use of such ""surplus interconnection.""

New York has 26 permitted but unbuilt wind and solar projects, New York Focus reported, totaling about 3 gigawatts of energy. Developers have only started construction on two of the large projects approved by the state in the past four years.

Clean energy advocates told the outlet that projects need approvals and agreements from multiple agencies before moving forward.

""Every last whisper of detail of the project has to be finalized before they generally let you start construction,"" said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.

Industry leaders said Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul should order state regulators to coordinate with one another on permits, and direct the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to fast-track contracts for new clean energy. Leaders at the agency did not grant a Stateline interview request.

Board Chair of Waterkeepers Florida Jen@MatanzasRiverkeeper.org (904) 471-9878 Rachel Silverstein, Ph.D. Miami Waterkeeper Rachel@MiamiWaterkeeper.org (619) 787-3161","Florida, Statewide | August 19, 2025 — The Environmental Defense Alliance and Waterkeepers Florida have filed a lawsuit against Lee M. Zeldin, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for failing to adopt water quality protections concerning toxic and cancer-causing chemicals in Florida’s waters.1

Water quality criteria for dozens of toxic chemicals that affect human health are supposed to be reviewed and updated by state environmental protection agencies, like the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), every three years in order to keep pace with updates in scientific research and new information. These toxic pollutants include known carcinogens like benzene and other chemicals found in fumigant pesticides and industrial solvents. However, many of Florida’s water quality criteria have remained woefully outdated since the 1990s.

“Florida has the largest recreational fishery in the United States and the second largest seafood industry. It only makes sense to protect Florida waters and Floridians from toxic chemicals that accumulate in our fish,” says Lisa Rinaman, St. Johns Riverkeeper.

In January of 2022, the Environmental Defense Alliance and Waterkeepers Florida sent a petition to EPA urging the agency to make a determination that new and revised water quality criteria in Florida are necessary to protect human health and meet the requirements of the Clean Water Act. After months of dialogue, EPA issued a determination on December 1, 2022 acknowledging that Florida’s 1990s-era human health criteria for priority toxic pollutants did not protect Florida’s people and waterways, and asserted that new and revised water quality criteria are needed. Specifically, EPA identified 40 priority toxic pollutants regulated by Florida that needed updated criteria, and 37 additional priority toxic pollutants that Florida had no criteria for, despite Clean Water Act requirements.2

EPA gave FDEP 12 months to adopt new and revised water quality criteria, but that time lapsed with no action. As a result, on December 1, 2023, EPA published a proposed rule to establish new and revised human health water quality criteria for 73 priority toxic pollutants in the state of Florida.3 These rules were scheduled to be finalized in late 2024 or early 2025, but were not promulgated when President Donald Trump issued an executive order instructing all federal agencies not to promulgate new rules. In response to this inaction, the Environmental Defense Alliance and Waterkeepers Florida have filed a Complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida (Jacksonville Division) against Administrator Zeldin to compel him to finalize those rules as the Clean Water Act requires.

“The goal of the Clean Water Act is to ensure that all U.S. waterways are ‘fishable and swimmable,&rsquop; but lax enforcement from our state and federal environmental protection agencies has prevented that goal from becoming a reality” says Waterkeepers Florida Chair, Jen Lomberk. “Floridians deserve water that is clean and safe enough to swim in and fish from.”

Miami Waterkeeper, Dr. Rachel Silverstein, who has been involved in this effort since 2016 added, “The people of Florida deserve to be protected from exposure to toxic chemicals — especially after decades of living with unacceptably high levels of cancer-causing and neurotoxic pollutants. This is a much-needed action to protect Floridians, our water, and our wildlife.”

David Ludder, attorney for the Environmental Defense Alliance added, “The executive order issued by President Trump does not supersede or suspend the requirements of the Clean Water Act. Among those requirements is a congressional mandate that the Administrator of EPA promulgate water quality criteria no later than 90 days after EPA publishes proposed criteria determined to be necessary to protect fishing and shellfishing uses of waters.”

Conclusion The expiration of the $7,500 EV tax credit and the OBBBA’s policy shifts mark a pivotal moment for investors.","The federal tax credit for electric vehicles (EVs), offering up to $7,500 for new models, is set to expire on September 30, 2025. While the IRS has provided a narrow window for buyers to secure the credit by entering binding contracts and making payments before the deadline, the broader implications of this expiration—and the policy shifts reshaping the EV landscape—demand a strategic reevaluation of investment opportunities in EV infrastructure and battery technology.

The Urgency of Policy-Driven Market Shifts

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed into law in July 2025, has accelerated the phaseout of federal EV tax credits, creating a sense of urgency for investors. The OBBBA terminates the New Clean Vehicle Tax Credit (Section 30D) and the Used Clean Vehicle Tax Credit (25E) for vehicles acquired after September 30, 2025, while also phasing out incentives for EV infrastructure by June 30, 2026 [1]. This abrupt policy shift has already triggered a $6 billion cancellation of battery manufacturing projects and raised concerns about the U.S. losing its competitive edge in the global EV race [2].

However, the OBBBA is not a complete retreat from clean energy. Energy storage projects collocated with solar and wind facilities retain eligibility for tax credits until 2032, with a 40% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for storage systems meeting domestic content thresholds [3]. This creates a critical window for investors to capitalize on grid-scale battery storage, which is essential for stabilizing renewable energy grids and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

Long-Term Viability of Green Energy Sectors

Despite the OBBBA’s restrictions, the long-term viability of green energy sectors hinges on technological advancements and state-level incentives. For instance, California’s $55 million Fast Charge California Project offers up to 100% of installation costs for DC fast chargers, prioritizing equitable access in disadvantaged communities [4]. Similarly, states like Oregon and Colorado have introduced robust rebates and tax credits for EV purchases, with Oregon’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program offering up to $7,500 in combined incentives [5]. These state-level programs mitigate the loss of federal support and underscore the importance of diversifying investment strategies across federal and state channels.

Battery technology remains a cornerstone of this transition. While the OBBBA eliminates the 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit, which previously supported domestic battery production, grid-scale energy storage retains partial reprieve through extended ITCs [6]. This shift signals a pivot from transportation-focused battery demand to grid applications, where companies can leverage existing manufacturing capabilities to meet evolving energy needs.

Strategic Investment Opportunities

Energy Storage Infrastructure: With the OBBBA extending tax credits for energy storage until 2032, investors should prioritize projects that pair storage with solar and wind facilities. The 40% ITC for storage systems, coupled with a 12-month grace period for construction, provides a clear incentive for rapid deployment [3].

State-Level EV Incentives: Investors should monitor state programs like California’s CALeVIP and Oregon’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program, which offer direct financial support for EV adoption and infrastructure. These programs are less vulnerable to federal policy shifts and provide stable returns [4][5].

Battery Supply Chain Resilience: While the OBBBA introduces foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions, domestic battery manufacturers can still benefit from grid-scale storage demand. Companies that adapt their supply chains to meet MACR thresholds (material assistance cost ratios) will gain access to tax credits and long-term contracts [6].

Conclusion

The expiration of the $7,500 EV tax credit and the OBBBA’s policy shifts mark a pivotal moment for investors. While federal support for EVs is waning, the transition to a low-carbon economy remains inevitable, driven by declining battery costs and state-level innovation. By focusing on energy storage, grid-scale applications, and state incentives, investors can navigate the post-deadline landscape and position themselves for long-term gains in the green energy sector.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-31 10:59:35.282979

Along 4.5 miles of the Grand Calumet River alone, the program has cleaned up some 2 million cubic yards, enough to fill up more than 600 Olympic-size swimming pools.
On the Far South Side of Chicago, the Grand Calumet becomes the junction where the Calumet River and the Little Calumet meet, the latter of which eventually flows into the Cal-Sag Channel.
Industry, however, is not the only threat to these ecosystems along the Grand Calumet River; so are invasive species such as the purple loosestrife.
The same has been said of the invasive common reed along the Grand Calumet system.","Just north of the clamor on the Indiana Toll Road in East Chicago, an inconspicuous side street leads to Roxana Marsh on the Grand Calumet River. Songbirds chirp and great blue herons rest by the water in this hidden urban oasis.

Across from the marsh, a chemical plant interrupts the natural landscape. Buildings like it have dominated life in the region since heavy industry moved in from Chicago in the 1800s; today, 75% of East Chicago is zoned for industry. The impact has reverberated along the river ecosystem, once considered one of the world’s most contaminated waterways.

It didn’t catch fire like Cleveland’s infamously polluted Cuyahoga River did in 1969, said Emily Stork, regional ecologist from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, who was leading a recent tour for educators in the Calumet Region.

But, she added, it has suffered some of the worst industrial abuses in the Great Lakes basin.

“It was a very messed-up river,” Stork said.

The Grand Calumet River’s 13 miles meander across northwest Indiana, flanked by old and new industries, such as steel mills, meatpackers and oil refineries, which dumped a noxious mix of heavy metals and chemicals into its waters before federal regulations. Over the last 15 years, more than two-thirds of the waterway has been slowly brought back to life through concerted efforts to remove or cap toxic muck.

The Great Lakes Legacy Act — which aims to address areas of concern in the basin where longtime industrial contamination has caused environmental degradation — has funded 34 remediation projects across the region since 2004, removing or capping almost 7 million cubic yards of contaminated sediment. Along 4.5 miles of the Grand Calumet River alone, the program has cleaned up some 2 million cubic yards, enough to fill up more than 600 Olympic-size swimming pools.

But there’s still a long way to go.

Flowing west from Miller Beach in Gary, the river splits between Hammond and East Chicago — most of its waters heading north to drain into Lake Michigan through the Indiana Harbor, the rest flowing toward Illinois. On the Far South Side of Chicago, the Grand Calumet becomes the junction where the Calumet River and the Little Calumet meet, the latter of which eventually flows into the Cal-Sag Channel.

Joel Perez, project director for the southern Lake Michigan rim at The Nature Conservancy, who was part of the Calumet tour, grew up nearby and recalls the overgrown brush and the auto tires that used to litter the marsh.

“That really sucked — living next to this body of water (that) I couldn’t use,” Perez said.

Despite advances in recent years, the waterway remains a work in progress; the remediated sites still need care and maintenance, and almost 4 miles of the river have yet to be addressed. A project for the second half of the east branch is in the design phase and will include closing the Gary Sanitary District’s Ralston Street Lagoon after a cleanup and containment plan that began 14 years ago. The U.S. EPA estimates all necessary actions will be completed between 2027 and 2030, and that the waterway will be delisted as an area of concern possibly by 2031.

Even as the federal agency faces budget cuts — with the Trump administration proposing to slash it by 55% for the next fiscal year — the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which houses the legacy act, has not been targeted for elimination. The initiative also tends to garner bipartisan support in Congress; the U.S. Senate passed a bill in December to reauthorize it for five more years and eventually increase its funding from $475 million to $500 million.

Toxic sediment

The pollutants that were pumped into the river, unregulated for decades, pose the biggest threat to its ecosystem. But so does the accumulation of sediment, which can significantly reshape physical habitats and the life they sustain, Stork said. For instance, Roxana Marsh used to be a pond, but industrial sediment made it shallow.

Tall, dense invasive common reeds were then able to move in and stifle native plants. It made the area inaccessible to migratory birds that had long used the place as a rest stop.

“Even if birds wanted to use it, they would have gotten sick,” Stork said.

So much sediment had accumulated that, had it been removed in its entirety, that section of the river would have been an unnatural 15 feet deep — and wouldn’t have been able to support life at the bottom, according to Stork.

“Man, this must’ve been something before industry came in,” said Dan Martin, a Chicago schoolteacher, as he looked out onto the marsh during the recent tour.

That beauty is slowly coming back. At the marsh, remediation returned 19 acres of habitat to birds such as black-crowned night herons, bald eagles and sandpipers. Most visitors to this and other restored portions of the river are birdwatchers who are familiar with the area’s salience in the region’s migratory corridor.

Driving east from the marsh, Stork passed a stretch of the river not yet remediated, between Indianapolis Boulevard and Kennedy Avenue. Nearby, a former DuPont chemical plant is undergoing a U.S. EPA-required $26.6 million cleanup by current and former owners. Also nearby, a USS Lead Superfund site, where lead and arsenic are the main contaminants, is being cleaned up.

On another 5 miles along the eastern stretch of the river, the U.S. EPA enforced a cleanup project in the 2000s that had U.S. Steel remove almost 800,000 cubic yards of sediment next to the corporation’s Gary Works facility.

Some industries and local companies proactively participate in projects like the remediation along segments of the river, each of which requires collaboration among several agencies and stakeholders and can be yearslong, multimillion-dollar endeavors.

“We have to take it one bite at a time,” Stork said.

Typically, the U.S. EPA supplies two-thirds of the funding for legacy act projects, but these also need support from local sponsors such as nonprofits including The Nature Conservancy or state agencies such as the Department of Natural Resources. In northwest Indiana, at least $191 million in federal and nonfederal funds have been spent to date for cleanup of the Grand Calumet over the past 15 years.

Black-eyed Susans sprout from where power line poles meet the ground, replacing artificial turf that the Northern Indiana Public Service Co. had previously installed.

“It looks like a bad haircut,” Stork laughed.

The utility company is working with project partners to bring the area back to life. For instance, it collaborated with the U.S. EPA and state agencies to remove 14,600 cubic yards of contaminated sediment and cap another 30,000 cubic yards from a 0.4-mile stretch of the river that ends at the Illinois state line. Invasive vegetation was also removed and replaced by native shrubs and trees.

The first remediated section on the river’s east branch, the Seidner Dune and Swale Nature Preserve in Hammond, is managed by the Shirley Heinze Land Trust and The Nature Conservancy after a multiagency acquisition and restoration project.

“Stepping here is like stepping back in time,” Stork said.

The landforms at the preserve are remnants of glaciation. The dunes were once beach ridges from when Lake Michigan’s meltwater reached farther inland.

Dune and swale systems are globally rare; this topographic variation — upland in the dunes, lowland in the swales — combines with the region’s unique confluence of biomes — particularly oak savanna, prairie and wetlands — to pack a lot of biodiversity into the preserve’s 42 acres. According to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, almost 300 species of plants have been identified on-site, including several rare ones with strict habitat requirements.

A wild turkey flapped its wings, taking off as the group of educators walked a 1-mile loop trail that once was a railroad bed. A wildfire blew into the preserve in March, Stork said, killing woody invasives, scorching shrubs and clearing the way for wildflowers to bloom.

“It really opened this up,” said Alexis Dalton, conservationist and manager of natural areas at the Lake County Parks and Recreation Department in Indiana.

Another threat

Vibrant wildflowers dotted the landscape, hues of violet, lilac and indigo dominating the view. They were verbena, blazing stars and purple loosestrife.

Stork walked into the tall grasses and rooted out one of the latter.

“I just did remarkably well there,” Stork said with a laugh. Being a perennial plant, the deep roots of the purple loosestrife normally complicate its removal.

A mechanical hum grew louder toward the western end of the property, where a Resco Products refractory plant stands in stark contrast to the surrounding wetlands.

Industry, however, is not the only threat to these ecosystems along the Grand Calumet River; so are invasive species such as the purple loosestrife. A single one of these plants can produce 1 million to 3 million seeds each year, which can stay in the riverbank without germinating for up to two decades.

“We’re never going to run out of it,” Stork said.

The same has been said of the invasive common reed along the Grand Calumet system. Scientists believe it originated in Eurasia and was accidentally introduced to North America in the late 18th or early 19th century via ship ballast water, establishing itself along the Atlantic Coast and spreading across the rest of the continent in the 20th century. Nowadays, it is the most common type of reed in North America, and, in the Midwest, it has displaced native reeds from wetland habitats near roadsides and waterways with heavy human traffic.

The reeds once blocked the view of the Grand Calumet from the dune and swale, but on the southern side of that section of the river, most have been removed. Yet, across the water, a seemingly impenetrable wall of the invasive plants sways in the wind, several feet tall.

Even after remediation, the consequences of human activity make the area a priority for restoration and conservation work.

“The project never ends,” said Jessica Fernandez, crew lead at The Nature Conservancy.

For instance, at Roxana Marsh, project partners have now turned their efforts toward improving accessibility for the general public, given that the area is still somewhat tucked away.

The recent immersive tour of the area was another effort between the conservancy, the state and the Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant to share the region’s recovery and success story with educators and equip them to teach their students about it.

The ecosystem’s substantial improvements should be celebrated, Stork added.

“For these communities to have this much natural habitat, with this now clean river, is a very big upgrade,” she said. “It’s in their backyard and they don’t know that (restoration) happened.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ctc-l-calumet-restoration-20_232061496.jpg?w=1024&h=645,N,,2025-08-31 10:01:10.907773

The prime minister called for a clear timeline for TEDA’s expansion and indicated the possibility of granting the company new industrial areas in emerging urban centres, including New Alamein City and the New Administrative Capital.

He said these plans were reinforced in talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who reiterated Beijing’s support for Chinese firms investing in Egypt.

Egypt is particularly keen to attract companies working in renewable energy, electric vehicles (EVs), battery manufacturing, and water desalination, Madbouly added.

TEDA, operating in Egypt since 2008, has so far attracted 200 companies, channelled $3 billion in investments, contributed $300 million in taxes, and created more than 10,000 jobs.

Zhu Difu described Egypt as a model of successful cooperation and confirmed the company’s intention to expand its SCZone footprint, building on its track record in energy, petrochemicals, electronics, textiles, and advanced industries.

He also reviewed ongoing energy projects developed in collaboration with Egypt’s Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy, highlighting opportunities to expand into water desalination as the zone broadens its scope.

The TEDA Egypt-China Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone, located in Ain Sokhna at the southern entrance of the Suez Canal, is strategically positioned to connect Asia, Africa, and Europe.

Water desalination and renewable energy

Separately, Madbouly announced plans to increase Egypt’s desalination capacity to 10 million cubic metres per day within five years, up from the current 1.4 million cubic metres per day, while localizing plant components.

He met with Ni Chen, Chairman and General Manager of China Energy Engineering Corporation (CEEC), to discuss the country’s renewable energy and energy storage ambitions.

Madbouly said Egypt aims to generate 42 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2030 and is counting on CEEC’s support to localise renewable energy components.

Ni Chen outlined plans to invest $1 billion over five years to establish Egypt as a regional hub, expand into seawater desalination, and continue joint energy generation projects, with technologies increasingly produced locally.

CEEC has operated in Egypt since 2009, completing 14 projects and relocating its regional headquarters to Cairo.

Ni Chen praised Egyptian government support and highlighted the company’s readiness to scale up investments in renewable energy, desalination, and energy storage.

Ni Chen announced that the company plans to expand into seawater desalination in Egypt alongside its existing renewable energy and energy storage projects, while confirming ongoing consultations with the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy on joint generation initiatives and pledging to localize its technologies within the country.

The meetings underscore Egypt’s ongoing effort to bolster industrial and green technology partnerships with Chinese investors, positioning the SCZone as a gateway for advanced industries and a hub for regional trade, manufacturing, and sustainable development.

Just over a week ago, the Trump Administration ordered wind companies to stop construction on a wind farm off the Rhode Island coast.
Offshore wind power is particularly useful for the state because it produces at night, when solar power goes away.
President Trump put a moratorium on the development of new offshore wind projects on his first day in office.
More than 80 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been planned in the U.S., but their future has gotten murkier.","The Trump administration is cancelling $679 million in federal funding for ports to support the country's offshore wind industry, the latest move in President Trump's ongoing campaign against wind power.

Offshore wind is still a developing industry in the U.S., while Europe already has thousands of wind turbines in deep ocean waters. Those offshore turbines are dramatically larger than ones on land and require substantial infrastructure at ports for construction, from large assembly facilities to deepwater docks for ships that carry turbines out to sea.

Ports around the country hoped to seize the economic opportunity to become hubs for the wind industry. Under the Biden administration, 12 port projects from California to Virginia were granted funds, all of which the Trump administration said on Friday it was either withdrawing or cancelling.

""Wasteful wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America's maritime industry,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in announcing the decision. He said if possible, the funding would be redirected to ""address critical port upgrades.""

Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., who represents an area that lost funding, said in a statement, ""This is a new level of idiocracy, where the Trump administration is trying to destroy an entire sector of clean energy, kill thousands of good paying jobs, and drive up electricity prices for American consumers.""

Just over a week ago, the Trump Administration ordered wind companies to stop construction on a wind farm off the Rhode Island coast. Trump is a long-time critic of wind power, claiming it's expensive and kills birds. He has pushed for cuts to tax incentives for wind and solar, which analyses have shown could raise electricity prices around the country.

The wind industry is reeling from the recent decisions, a marked change from a few years ago when the growing demand for electricity spurred a surge in announcements for new wind projects.

""The federal [Trump] administration ran on rebuilding back America, building infrastructure, creating U.S. jobs, creating manufacturing – this project does all of that,"" said Chris Mikkelsen, executive director of the Port of Humboldt Bay, one of the ports that had its project funding canceled.

Bringing industry to a rural port

The federal grants were directed at creating wind manufacturing and logistics hubs, including in Maryland, Massachusetts and Staten Island in New York. The project that took the biggest hit is in Humboldt Bay in Northern California, which is losing out on more than $426 million.

The port is located in a rural part of the state, five hours north of San Francisco. For decades, it supported the local timber industry, which has waned significantly over the years. In 2022, the federal government held the first offshore lease for wind power in California, a sign the industry would be poised to take off. Mikkelsen says it represents a huge economic opportunity for his area.

""It's the biggest we've seen in the century, there's no doubt about it,"" Mikkelsen said. ""We're not talking about entry-level jobs. These are very skilled, very high-paying jobs. Jobs here in Humboldt County are in desperate need.""

The federal grant represented a significant part of funding needed for the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind Heavy Lift Marine Terminal Project, which would also leverage private and state investment. The port planned to use it to clean up and remediate polluted areas, build facilities for handling the turbine parts, dredge the waterway and build a larger wharf capable of handling pieces of steel longer than a football field.

With the funding cancellation, Mikkelsen says he hopes it's just a pause for the project, since California continues to push for renewable energy. The state has a goal of getting 100% of its electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2045. Offshore wind power is particularly useful for the state because it produces at night, when solar power goes away.

""This hurts a little bit, but it doesn't change our focus and it certainly doesn't change our outcome,"" Mikkelsen said. ""An administration can't change the fact that the U.S. has incredible energy demands.""

Turmoil for the wind industry

Electricity demand is growing across the country, especially as new data centers are built for artificial intelligence. Solar and wind projects produce cheaper energy on average than fossil fuels projects that run on natural gas and coal, though the cost can vary greatly depending on the location and type of project. The Biden administration set a goal of getting 30 gigawatts of power from offshore wind by 2030, enough for around 10 million homes. An analysis found that plan could create 77,000 jobs, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a federal research lab.

President Trump put a moratorium on the development of new offshore wind projects on his first day in office. In cancelling the Rhode Island wind project, the administration stated it was for the ""protection of national security interests,"" but did not elaborate on what those are specifically.

""We're not allowing any windmills to go up,"" Trump said earlier this week. ""Unless there's a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago, we don't allow windmills.""

More than 80 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been planned in the U.S., but their future has gotten murkier. Interest rates have gone up, making financing more challenging. Turmoil in the industry could also make it harder to attract investment. But many companies are hoping it's a passing phase, given the overall demand for electricity.

""We will have an offshore wind industry in this country because it's hard to imagine we can bring the kind of power we need to the coasts without it,"" said Jason Grumet, chief executive officer of the American Clean Power Association, a renewable energy industry group. ""But at the moment the industry is very worried because projects are being cancelled with virtually no rationale.""

They can skip the two-year queue for high-voltage grid connections—regardless of whether these projects are for gas, wind, solar, geothermal, or even new-age nuclear.

“Our grid isn’t short on opportunity — it’s short on time,” said Carson Kearl, Enverus senior analyst for energy and AI. “These grid interconnections are up for grabs for new power projects when these coal plants roll off.

“The No. 1 priority for Big Tech has changed to [speed] to energy, and this is the fastest way to go in a lot of cases,” Kearl told Fortune.

American coal power plunged from 50% of the nation’s grid as recently as 2005 down to just 16% and falling today, courtesy of the shale gas drilling rush and the rise of renewables. But coal still represents more than half of the grid’s carbon emissions. While wind and solar power are emission-free, switching to new gas plants still represents a 60% emissions reduction from coal.

In the last two decades, as more coal plants closed, U.S. power emissions plummeted 40%, accounting for more than 75% of the nation’s total decline in carbon dioxide emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

The energy research firm Enverus estimates that at least 70 gigawatts of retired coal power capacity—enough to power 50 million homes, or almost 100 data centers—can be converted to clean (or cleaner) power sources.

Power generator and utility owner Xcel Energy (No. 319 on the Fortune 500) is in the process of converting old coal plants to both gas-fired and renewable power from Minnesota to Texas. And many more projects are on the way in the years to come, said Xcel chairman and CEO Bob Frenzel.

“Tech is looking for speed, they’re looking for electricity and, in some cases, we have both,” Frenzel told Fortune. “We’ve been able to use those interconnections quite successfully to repower with more efficient and more clean energy resources.”

Switching to wind, solar, gas, nuclear, and more

Most new power construction in the U.S. is currently concentrated on solar, wind, and accompanying battery energy storage, but the Trump administration’s war on renewables—just when the country needs more power—means wind and solar tax credits expire after 2027.

The clean energy projects underway largely will get built—some utilizing coal interconnections—but much more coal-to-gas switching will occur to meet the needs of AI, especially in gas-rich regions such as Pennsylvania, Texas, and Colorado.

“We as an industry are racing to meet the needs of this new critical national security asset,” Frenzel said of the AI boom. “We’re excited about the opportunity, but it’s going to take an all-hands approach to get it done.

“After [renewable tax credits expire], we as a country must commercialize other assets. Gas is a great bridge fuel, and we’re going to continue to use a lot of gas,” Frenzel added.

In the 2030s, new nuclear and geothermal power facilities will come online, he said, but those generation sources require more development time and permitting hurdles.

In Sherburne County, Minnesota, Xcel is retiring its legacy coal plant, taking the first unit offline last year and fully closing it by 2030. In its place, Xcel is developing an array of solar, wind, and battery power. The project includes the longest-duration battery storage in the country, a 100-hour battery system developed by Form Energy. The goal is to power a data center hub there, Frenzel said. Xcel and Meta are working together on a Minnesota project. Amazon also recently bought adjacent land, although its plans are currently paused.

In the Texas Panhandle, Xcel just converted its Harrington coal plant to gas-fired power. Up next, is the nearby Tolk coal facility also slated for a switch to gas. Xcel plans to build about 2 gigawatts of new wind and solar power in the area to meet oil and gas industry electrification needs, as well as for the transformation of a crypto mining site into a data center complex, Frenzel said.

Likewise, Xcel is almost finished converting its Pawnee coal plant in Colorado to gas-fired power. Xcel’s Hayden coal plant in Colorado is slated for closure in 2028, and geothermal power is under consideration for that site. Xcel is working with data center developer QTS in the state.

In a more unique twist on coal-to-gas switching, the Intermountain coal plant in Utah is switching to gas, but it’s also utilizing a green hydrogen blend with the gas to make it burn cleaner. And some coal-to-gas involves using battery storage as well. The AES Petersburg coal plant in Indiana is switching to a gas-fired and battery storage combo complex.

Elsewhere in the country, even coal-to-nuclear plans are underway. Bill Gates’ TerraPower is developing a next-generation nuclear plant slated to open by 2030 on an expedited schedule—in a partnership with Sabey Data Centers—utilizing the interconnections of the Naughton coal and gas plant, which will start closing next year.

Still, even as coal plant retirements were moved up in recent years, some are being pushed backwards again toward their original closure dates now that the grid is being strained and the Trump administration is championing coal power.

For instance, Maryland’s last coal plant, Brandon Shores, was slated to close this year, but will now stay up until 2029 as a power bridge for the AI boom. Likewise, the J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan was extended from its May closure date until at least November.

The Trump administration’s orders to keep “beautiful clean coal” alive are only temporary. The plants are still going to close; they just received stays on their execution dates.

The “clean coal” phrasing was part of a lobbying and marketing push for more modernized—and less dirty—coal plants about 15 years ago, but the language has largely disappeared outside of the White House as coal continues to be replaced by renewables and cleaner, cheaper gas.

The coal lobbying group, Americans for Balanced Energy Choices, rebranded in 2008 as the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity. They gave up on that in 2019, changing to the more succinct and generically named America’s Power. Since then, utilities and railroads have left the group, leaving its membership only to coal companies.

Big Appalachian gas opportunity

In July, about 85 miles west of Homer City in Pennsylvania, it was announced by the project’s developers that the old Bruce Mansfield coal plant, padlocked in 2019, would be converted to gas-fired power as the new Shippingport Power Station to help fuel the AI revolution.

That same day, the developers also publicized the largest natural gas producer in the Appalachia region, EQT, would supply both the Shippingport and Homer City projects with a combined 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of gas supplies.

“Just to put this in perspective, that’s enough natural gas to power two of New York City. Scale matters,” EQT CEO Toby Rice told Fortune. “Homer City and Shippingport are just the first steps of multiple steps in multiple projects, because I do believe that cluster effect is real. They already have connections to the grid, which is a huge fast pass.”

EQT is ready to help lead an AI tech boom in Pennsylvania and the broader Appalachia region with the advantage that it’s home to the largest natural gas field in the country, the Marcellus Shale. And EQT has its own pipeline business to connect directly to data centers as needed.

Rice is leading the charge to make natural gas as clean as possible, through improved technology and upcoming carbon capture and storage projects. It incudes a marketing push—after all, “natural gas” sounds much nicer than “methane.” “People need to understand the natural gas decarbonization train has not slowed down,” he said.

Rusty Hutson, the CEO of gas producer Diversified Energy agrees. Methane is the product, he said, and the producers don’t want to waste the gas in emissions. “We want to sell it. At the end of the day, going through a pipeline and going through a meter is much more beneficial to us than any emissions are,” Hutson told Fortune.

While EQT will focus on drilling new wells to feed the AI beast, Diversified operates more mature gas wells that are often unwanted by the biggest players.

“Data centers, especially in the Appalachian basin, are going to be a huge demand on natural gas,” Hutson said. “We can’t afford to lose any production because other companies are focused on the drill bit and not really on existing wells and existing operations. That’s where we come in to maintain and produce those wells in an efficient manner to keep them in production for longer.”

As Rice and Hutson argued, the trend is much bigger though than an Appalachia story. Enverus’ Kearl said the AI race may very well be won or lost based on how rapidly old coal plants can be repowered to other generation sources nationwide.

“Repowering isn’t just a cost play—it’s a political and logistical shortcut to growing 24/7, low-carbon power,” Kearl said.",https://images.inkl.com/s3/article/lead_image/22447599/GettyImages-2158433068-e1756391445997.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 14:06:02.435007

A federal tax break for consumers who buy or lease electric vehicles will disappear after Sept. 30. However, consumers may have a little bit of wiggle room on that time frame, according to a new document released by the Internal Revenue Service.

The tax credits, worth up to $7,500, were scrapped as part of a Republican tax and spending measure passed in July. The law says consumers don't qualify for a tax break if the EV is ""acquired after"" Sept. 30.

Some observers initially thought that meant an EV had to be ""placed in service"" by that date — meaning that consumers had to be in physical possession of the car.

However, the IRS clarified that's not the case.

watch now

If a taxpayer acquires an EV by having a ""written binding contract in place"" and makes a payment on or before Sept. 30, they'd be entitled to claim the federal tax credit when they eventually take possession of the vehicle — even if that's after Sept. 30, the IRS said in a set of answers to frequently asked questions issued Aug. 21.

""This means that if you can't drive off in the clean vehicle of your dreams by Sept. 30, there is still hope,"" said Ingrid Malmgren, senior policy director at Plug In America, a nonprofit advocating for a quicker transition to electric cars.

The IRS update applies to used, new and leased EVs, according to the IRS document. They correspond with sections 25E, 30D and 45W of the tax code, respectively.

""You can order the vehicle from the dealer or manufacturer, sign the contract, put down a deposit by Sept. 30 and take possession of it later,"" Malmgren said.

Making a payment might also mean making a vehicle trade-in, Malmgren said.

Of course, the vehicle and consumer would still need to meet certain eligibility criteria to qualify for a federal tax credit.

Consumers can still receive the tax credit as an instant rebate when taking possession of the vehicle, Malmgren said, instead of waiting to file their annual tax return next year.

Aside from getting the money more quickly, there's an additional benefit: Consumers who choose to get the tax credit at the point of sale don't need to have a tax liability in order to get the funds.

Taxpayers should ensure they get a time-of-sale report from the dealer when picking up their EV or within three days of picking it up, according to the IRS.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108190440-1756150645100-gettyimages-2164804485-20240729-a7407660.jpeg?v=1756150674&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-08-31 10:59:42.959145

And that is a difference that, for places like Pampa Clemesí, means everything.","We are in the 21st century but not everywhere in the world. There is a place in Peru where it seems time stopped decades ago. It is called Pampa Clemesí and, although it is right next to the largest solar plant in the country, its neighbors are still living in the dark!! Literally. Less than a kilometer away from a plant that generates clean energy for half the country, there are houses that do not even have a plug. Not one.

Bathed in light… but not electric.

The plant in question is the Rubí Power Plant, a huge complex of solar panels that began installation in 2018 and that, in 2024, officially became the largest solar generator in Peru. It produces about 440 GW a year. With that, entire cities are supplied. But Pampa Clemesí, 600 meters away, still uses flashlights and candles at night, that energy is not for them…

Promises that never arrive

The company responsible, Orygen, says it has invested in a plan to electrify the area. Some panels have even been donated to the neighbors. But without batteries or converters, those panels are not much use, they have the materials but not the means. And here lies the paradox: electricity travels hundreds of kilometers to Lima or Arequipa, but it does not cross the 600 meters that separate the plant from the town!

Moquegua, the region where all this is, is one of the sunniest places on the planet. Ideal for solar energy. Peru knows this and that is why renewables are growing at a good pace: only in 2024, growth was 96%. Even so, that has not brought development for everyone. On the contrary: technological progress goes one way, and the basic needs of towns like Pampa Clemesí go another, creating a major gap in the Peruvian population.

The challenge of renewables

It is especially sad because Peru is not only a country that bets on renewables, but also the second largest producer of copper in the world, a key material for all this. Where does that copper go? To export. Where do the investments go? To wherever there are profits. Areas with small populations, like Pampa Clemesí, are not on that priority list.

Orygen insists that it is part of the state plan to electrify the town and that it has already invested 800,000 dollars in a first phase. But the reality is completely different, the houses are still without light, without refrigerators, without the possibility of charging a phone or turning on a radio. Nothing. And meanwhile, from their windows, the neighbors see the plant lit up every night as if it were a city. A shining mirage that is useless to them. How unfair!

And of course many of us think that the energy transition is worthless if it leaves out the most vulnerable, you can produce all the gigawatts in the world, but what good is it if that energy does not serve to give every house in the world a simple plug?

Energy transition but not for everyone.

Energy poverty is real, and not only in remote areas of Africa or Asia, also in Latin America, also in Peru, also in a town that lives in the shadow (or rather the glow) of a plant that symbolizes the future… The future of who? In their case, it only confirms that they remain trapped in the past year after year while the world moves forward.

Renewable energy is necessary, yes, but it also has to be fair. If not, we will be changing technology but not the model and we will be condemning the same people to the same fate. And that is a difference that, for places like Pampa Clemesí, means everything.",https://unionrayo.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/5d41d1a0-5e4e-11f0-abc2-f594647315a9.jpg-1.jpeg,N,,2025-08-31 08:59:14.888170

Supporters of the technology say wave energy is an endlessly renewable and always reliable source of power.
However, wave energy remains the poor relation of other, better-known renewables, and has not been successfully commercialized at a large-enough scale.
“The Achilles heel of wave energy is in the costs of maintenance and inspection,” he told AFP.
AI power demand Braverman’s Eco Wave Power is already thinking ahead, having identified dozens more sites in the United States that could be suitable for similar projects.","SAN PEDRO, United States (AFP) — Floating blue paddles dance on the waves that lap a dock in the Port of Los Angeles, silently converting the power of the sea into useable electricity.

This innovative installation may hold one of the keys to accelerating a transition away from fossil fuels that scientists say is necessary if the world is to avoid the worst effects of climate change.

“The project is very simple and easy,” Inna Braverman, co-founder of Israeli start-up Eco Wave Power, told AFP.

Looking a little like piano keys, the floaters rise and fall with each wave.

They are connected to hydraulic pistons that push a biodegradable fluid through pipes to a container filled with accumulators, which resemble large red scuba tanks.

When the pressure is released, it spins a turbine that generates electrical current.

If this pilot project convinces the California authorities, Braverman hopes to cover the entire 13-kilometer (eight-mile) breakwater protecting the port with hundreds of floaters that together would produce enough electricity to power 60,000 US homes.

Supporters of the technology say wave energy is an endlessly renewable and always reliable source of power.

Unlike solar power, which produces nothing at night, or wind power, which depends on the weather, the sea is always in motion.

And there is a lot of it.

Tough tech

The waves off the American West Coast could theoretically power 130 million homes — or supply around a third of the electricity used every year in the United States, according to the US Department of Energy.

However, wave energy remains the poor relation of other, better-known renewables, and has not been successfully commercialized at a large-enough scale.

The history of the sector is full of company shipwrecks and projects sunk by the brutality of the high seas. Developing devices robust enough to withstand the fury of the waves, while transmitting electricity via underwater cables to the shore, has proven to be an impossible task so far.

“Ninety-nine percent of competitors chose to install in the middle of the ocean, where it’s super expensive, where it’s breaking down all the time, so they can’t really make projects work,” Braverman said.

With her retractable dock-mounted device, the entrepreneur believes she has found the answer.

“When the waves are too high for the system to handle, the floaters just rise to the upward position until the storm passes, so you have no damage.”

The design appeals to Krish Thiagarajan Sharman, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

“The Achilles heel of wave energy is in the costs of maintenance and inspection,” he told AFP. “So having a device close to shore, where you can walk on a breakwater and then inspect the device, makes a lot of sense.”

Sharman, who is not affiliated with the project and whose laboratory is testing various wave energy equipment, said projects tend to be suited to smaller-scale demands, like powering remote islands.

“This eight-mile breakwater, that’s not a common thing. It’s a rare opportunity, a rare location where such a long wavefront is available for producing power,” he said.

AI power demand

Braverman’s Eco Wave Power is already thinking ahead, having identified dozens more sites in the United States that could be suitable for similar projects.

The project predates Donald Trump’s administration, but even before the political environment in Washington turned against renewables, the company was already looking beyond the US.

In Israel, up to 100 homes in the port of Jaffa have been powered by waves since December.

By 2026, 1,000 homes in Porto, Portugal should be online, with installations also planned in Taiwan and India.

Braverman dreams of 20-megawatt projects, a critical capacity needed to offer electricity at rates that can compete with wind power.

And, she said, the installations will not harm the local wildlife.

“There’s zero environmental impact. We connect to existent man-made structures, which already disturb the environment.”

Promises like this resonate in California, where the Energy Commission highlighted in a recent report the potential of wave energy to help the state achieve carbon neutrality by 2045.

“The amount of energy that we’re consuming is only increasing with the age of AI and data centers,” said Jenny Krusoe, founder of AltaSea, an organization that helped fund the project.

“So the faster we can move this technology and have it down the coastline, the better for California.”",https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/08/AFP__20250831__72VG2C3__v1__HighRes__UsEnvironmentEnergyOceans.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 08:59:19.721080

Just over a week ago, the Trump Administration ordered wind companies to stop construction on a wind farm off the Rhode Island coast.
Offshore wind power is particularly useful for the state because it produces at night, when solar power goes away.
President Trump put a moratorium on the development of new offshore wind projects on his first day in office.
More than 80 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been planned in the U.S., but their future has gotten murkier.","The Trump administration is cancelling $679 million in federal funding for ports to support the country's offshore wind industry, the latest move in President Trump's ongoing campaign against wind power.

Offshore wind is still a developing industry in the U.S., while Europe already has thousands of wind turbines in deep ocean waters. Those offshore turbines are dramatically larger than ones on land and require substantial infrastructure at ports for construction, from large assembly facilities to deepwater docks for ships that carry turbines out to sea.

Ports around the country hoped to seize the economic opportunity to become hubs for the wind industry. Under the Biden administration, 12 port projects from California to Virginia were granted funds, all of which the Trump administration said on Friday it was either withdrawing or cancelling.

""Wasteful wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America's maritime industry,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in announcing the decision. He said if possible, the funding would be redirected to ""address critical port upgrades.""

Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., who represents an area that lost funding, said in a statement, ""This is a new level of idiocracy, where the Trump administration is trying to destroy an entire sector of clean energy, kill thousands of good paying jobs, and drive up electricity prices for American consumers.""

Just over a week ago, the Trump Administration ordered wind companies to stop construction on a wind farm off the Rhode Island coast. Trump is a long-time critic of wind power, claiming it's expensive and kills birds. He has pushed for cuts to tax incentives for wind and solar, which analyses have shown could raise electricity prices around the country.

The wind industry is reeling from the recent decisions, a marked change from a few years ago when the growing demand for electricity spurred a surge in announcements for new wind projects.

""The federal [Trump] administration ran on rebuilding back America, building infrastructure, creating U.S. jobs, creating manufacturing – this project does all of that,"" said Chris Mikkelsen, executive director of the Port of Humboldt Bay, one of the ports that had its project funding canceled.

Bringing industry to a rural port

The federal grants were directed at creating wind manufacturing and logistics hubs, including in Maryland, Massachusetts and Staten Island in New York. The project that took the biggest hit is in Humboldt Bay in Northern California, which is losing out on more than $426 million.

The port is located in a rural part of the state, five hours north of San Francisco. For decades, it supported the local timber industry, which has waned significantly over the years. In 2022, the federal government held the first offshore lease for wind power in California, a sign the industry would be poised to take off. Mikkelsen says it represents a huge economic opportunity for his area.

""It's the biggest we've seen in the century, there's no doubt about it,"" Mikkelsen said. ""We're not talking about entry-level jobs. These are very skilled, very high-paying jobs. Jobs here in Humboldt County are in desperate need.""

The federal grant represented a significant part of funding needed for the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind Heavy Lift Marine Terminal Project, which would also leverage private and state investment. The port planned to use it to clean up and remediate polluted areas, build facilities for handling the turbine parts, dredge the waterway and build a larger wharf capable of handling pieces of steel longer than a football field.

With the funding cancellation, Mikkelsen says he hopes it's just a pause for the project, since California continues to push for renewable energy. The state has a goal of getting 100% of its electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2045. Offshore wind power is particularly useful for the state because it produces at night, when solar power goes away.

""This hurts a little bit, but it doesn't change our focus and it certainly doesn't change our outcome,"" Mikkelsen said. ""An administration can't change the fact that the U.S. has incredible energy demands.""

Turmoil for the wind industry

Electricity demand is growing across the country, especially as new data centers are built for artificial intelligence. Solar and wind projects produce cheaper energy on average than fossil fuels projects that run on natural gas and coal, though the cost can vary greatly depending on the location and type of project. The Biden administration set a goal of getting 30 gigawatts of power from offshore wind by 2030, enough for around 10 million homes. An analysis found that plan could create 77,000 jobs, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a federal research lab.

President Trump put a moratorium on the development of new offshore wind projects on his first day in office. In cancelling the Rhode Island wind project, the administration stated it was for the ""protection of national security interests,"" but did not elaborate on what those are specifically.

""We're not allowing any windmills to go up,"" Trump said earlier this week. ""Unless there's a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago, we don't allow windmills.""

More than 80 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been planned in the U.S., but their future has gotten murkier. Interest rates have gone up, making financing more challenging. Turmoil in the industry could also make it harder to attract investment. But many companies are hoping it's a passing phase, given the overall demand for electricity.

""We will have an offshore wind industry in this country because it's hard to imagine we can bring the kind of power we need to the coasts without it,"" said Jason Grumet, chief executive officer of the American Clean Power Association, a renewable energy industry group. ""But at the moment the industry is very worried because projects are being cancelled with virtually no rationale.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4000x2250+0+113/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9c%2F40%2F97cbef974be09cc587e87281a2b3%2Fap23345773091464.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 08:59:27.887232

He also issued a day-one executive order temporarily halting all onshore and offshore wind project permitting.
“The only way that dying industry can stay alive is by having unfair advantages, and the Trump administration appears willing to be the avenue by which it gets those advantages.” The Trump administration is reportedly planning on attempting to block yet another offshore wind project—the Maryland Offshore Wind Project, which was approved by the Biden administration in December.
Just weeks ago, the DOI announced it was canceling authorization of the Lava Ridge onshore wind project in southern Idaho, which was also approved last December.
On Friday the Department of Transportation announced it would be canceling $679 million in federal funding supporting the development of 12 offshore wind projects.","Donald Trump has made no secret of his personal distaste for wind energy, issuing attacks on the renewable resource, without evidence, as either the “most expensive form of energy” or “driving the whales crazy.”

Meanwhile, his administration has taken its campaign against wind to a new phase. The acting head of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a stop work order last week to the developer of Revolution Wind, a 704-megawatt offshore wind project off the coast of Rhode Island. The project was fully permitted, and construction was 80 percent complete. It was expected to start operating in 2026, delivering clean electricity to power more than 350,000 homes across Rhode Island and Connecticut.

Environmental advocates say the administration’s August 22 directive is unprecedented and even illegal.

“There’s no basis in the law to stop construction on a project that has been fully permitted,” Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at Conservation Law Foundation, told Sierra. She called the Trump administration’s explanation for its stop work order “very thin,” noting it included a vague reference to national security concerns that appears to be unexplained.

All offshore foundations had been installed and 45 out of the 65 turbines had already gone up when the stop work order was issued for Revolution Wind, according to project developer Orsted. The company said in a statement that it is “evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously,” including through potential legal proceedings.

The order marks the second time the Trump administration has tried to block development of an offshore wind project. In April, the Department of the Interior issued a stop work order for Empire Wind located offshore of New York, though in that case construction was just beginning. The halt was then lifted in May and development has since resumed.

Elected officials in southern New England, including the governors of Rhode Island and Connecticut, slammed the Trump administration’s move and said they would fight to reverse the order.

“Stopping this work just before the finish line—that is an attack on our economy,” said Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee. The project was supporting over 1,000 union jobs and nearly $1.3 billion in investment in the state.

It was also expected to provide a critical source of reliable and affordable power at a time of rising electricity demand. Blocking it will likely lead to rising electricity prices for consumers and greater risks of supply shortages and interruptions to the power grid. “Delaying the project will increase risks to reliability,” ISO New England, the region’s grid operator, said in a statement.

Without offshore wind, states in the region will have an even more difficult time meeting their statutory greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, slowing progress in the fight against climate change. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha warned that if Revolution Wind is stopped, the state’s signature climate law mandating 45 percent emissions reductions by 2030 is “dead in the water.”

President Trump, who dismisses climate science and has called climate change a hoax, launched a full-scale assault on renewable energy starting on his first day back in office in January. He declared a national energy emergency that deliberately excluded solar and wind. He also issued a day-one executive order temporarily halting all onshore and offshore wind project permitting.

“Solar is the way of the future, as is wind, and they are both now competitive if not outcompeting fossil fuels [on a cost basis]. The only way that dying industry can stay alive is by having unfair advantages, and the Trump administration appears willing to be the avenue by which it gets those advantages.”

In July, the Department of the Interior announced a memorandum increasing federal review processes and adding more red tape to assessments of solar and wind projects. “This isn’t oversight. It’s obstruction that will needlessly harm the fastest-growing sources of electric power,” Jason Grumet, CEO of American Clean Power Association, a clean energy trade group, said in response. The DOI also announced an order ending the so-called preferential treatment for these energy sources, which includes a directive for the Trump administration to consider revoking permits for already-approved solar and wind projects that are facing legal challenges.

Daly said it is “entirely unprecedented” for the federal government to try to revoke authorizations or block already-permitted projects, mainly because it is so brazenly unlawful. Yanking back permits risks creating regulatory instability and chaos that could threaten all kinds of development, she explained. The move to try to stymie the completion of Revolution Wind, Daly said, is solely “meant to serve fossil fuel companies” that supported Trump’s presidential bid to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars.

“Solar is the way of the future, as is wind, and they are both now competitive if not outcompeting fossil fuels [on a cost basis],” Daly told Sierra. “The only way that dying industry can stay alive is by having unfair advantages, and the Trump administration appears willing to be the avenue by which it gets those advantages.”

The Trump administration is reportedly planning on attempting to block yet another offshore wind project—the Maryland Offshore Wind Project, which was approved by the Biden administration in December.

Just weeks ago, the DOI announced it was canceling authorization of the Lava Ridge onshore wind project in southern Idaho, which was also approved last December. On the same day it made that announcement, August 6, the agency announced its completion of an expedited environmental review for a major Utah coal project.

“All of these actions are making it clear that there is not an energy emergency. There’s a fossil fuel emergency for the people who make billions of dollars off the destruction of communities and the planet.”

In addition to ramping up and expediting fossil fuel leasing, the administration is also forcing coal plants that were scheduled to shut down to remain operating. The Department of Energy has now issued several emergency orders to keep uneconomic and polluting coal-fired power plants online. Those orders come at the same time the administration is actively trying to shut down solar and wind, which have become the cheapest sources of electric power.

On Friday the Department of Transportation announced it would be canceling $679 million in federal funding supporting the development of 12 offshore wind projects. In a press release, the DOT referred to these wind projects as “doomed.”

“All of these actions are making it clear that there is not an energy emergency. There’s a fossil fuel emergency for the people who make billions of dollars off the destruction of communities and the planet,” Patrick Drupp, director of climate policy for the Sierra Club, told Sierra. “It’s only going to harm Americans, both with their health and their pocketbooks.”

The moves by the Trump administration to obstruct renewables and bolster fossil fuels come at a time when the planet is facing a climate emergency, scientists warn. The 10 hottest years in recorded history have all occurred in the last decade, with 2024 registering as the hottest year yet and the first full year in which global average temperatures exceeded 1.5°C above preindustrial levels. It is very likely that the 1.5° temperature mark will continue to be breached over the next five years, the World Meteorological Association reported in May. Scientists have warned that exceeding 1.5°C risks unleashing even more devastating—and potentially irreversible—climate change impacts and that every increment of warming avoided matters in terms of mitigating the societal and ecological harms.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-31 08:59:40.103196

Xcel Energy, a major utility company, has been at the forefront of this transition, converting coal plants into gas-fired and renewable energy facilities.
The shift to natural gas is also being accelerated by developments in the Appalachian region, where EQT Corporation is playing a key role.
The Trump administration’s pro-coal stance has temporarily extended the operational lifespans of some retiring coal plants, such as Maryland’s Brandon Shores and Michigan’s J.H.
Meanwhile, coal industry groups have shifted their messaging from “clean coal” to more generic branding, reflecting the industry’s diminishing influence as renewables and gas gain traction.","The AI data center boom is prompting a resurgence in the repurposing of retired coal plants across the United States, as developers and utilities convert these aging facilities into hubs for renewable and natural gas-powered energy generation. With electricity demand projected to surge by up to 60% through 2050 to support AI infrastructure, the race to repower these plants is intensifying due to their preexisting grid interconnections, which allow for faster deployment than new projects. This trend is being driven by the need for speed and reliability in energy supply, as highlighted by Enverus senior analyst Carson Kearl: “Our grid isn’t short on opportunity — it’s short on time” [1].

Coal has played a dominant role in U.S. electricity generation for decades, but its share has steadily declined from over 50% in 2005 to just 16% today, largely due to the rise of shale gas and renewables. Despite this decline, coal still accounts for more than half of the nation's electricity-related carbon emissions. Converting coal plants to natural gas is seen as a key transition strategy, offering a 60% reduction in emissions compared to coal. Enverus estimates that at least 70 gigawatts of retired coal capacity—enough to power 50 million homes—can be repurposed into cleaner energy sources [1].

Xcel Energy, a major utility company, has been at the forefront of this transition, converting coal plants into gas-fired and renewable energy facilities. For instance, the company is repowering the Harrington coal plant in Texas to gas-fired generation and is also developing new wind and solar projects in the region. In Minnesota, Xcel is decommissioning the Sherburne County coal plant and replacing it with a mix of solar, wind, and battery storage, including a 100-hour battery system from Form Energy. These projects align with the broader goal of supporting data center growth, with Xcel and Meta already collaborating on a joint initiative [1].

The shift to natural gas is also being accelerated by developments in the Appalachian region, where EQT Corporation is playing a key role. The company is supplying natural gas to projects such as the Homer City Energy Campus and the Shippingport Power Station, both of which are being repurposed from former coal facilities. EQT's CEO, Toby Rice, emphasized the significance of the Mountain Valley Pipeline in enabling the AI power boom by transporting gas from the Marcellus Shale to markets in the Southeast and beyond [2]. This infrastructure is critical for meeting the rising energy demands from data centers and other AI-driven operations.

While renewable energy remains the long-term objective, current regulatory and policy uncertainties—such as the expiration of wind and solar tax credits after 2027—have led to an increased reliance on natural gas as a “bridge fuel.” Companies like Xcel Energy are leveraging this interim period to build scalable and flexible energy solutions. However, the industry also anticipates a future where new nuclear and geothermal facilities can contribute to the grid, albeit with longer lead times. In the meantime, gas-powered projects, combined with battery storage and hydrogen blends, offer a pragmatic solution to meet the urgent energy needs of the AI era [1].

The Trump administration’s pro-coal stance has temporarily extended the operational lifespans of some retiring coal plants, such as Maryland’s Brandon Shores and Michigan’s J.H. Campbell facilities. These extensions are not seen as permanent but rather as short-term adjustments to support the transition period. Meanwhile, coal industry groups have shifted their messaging from “clean coal” to more generic branding, reflecting the industry’s diminishing influence as renewables and gas gain traction. Despite this, coal companies are adapting by focusing on gas production and decarbonization efforts, including carbon capture and storage, to remain relevant in the evolving energy landscape [1].

Campbell coal plant in Michigan was extended from its May closure date until at least November.
It incudes a marketing push—after all, “natural gas” sounds much nicer than “methane.” “People need to understand the natural gas decarbonization train has not slowed down,” he said.
“Data centers, especially in the Appalachian basin, are going to be a huge demand on natural gas,” Hutson said.","Switching to wind, solar, gas, nuclear, and more

Most new power construction in the U.S. is currently concentrated on solar, wind, and accompanying battery energy storage, but the Trump administration’s war on renewables—just when the country needs more power—means wind and solar tax credits expire after 2027.

The clean energy projects underway largely will get built—some utilizing coal interconnections—but much more coal-to-gas switching will occur to meet the needs of AI, especially in gas-rich regions such as Pennsylvania, Texas, and Colorado.

“We as an industry are racing to meet the needs of this new critical national security asset,” Frenzel said of the AI boom. “We’re excited about the opportunity, but it’s going to take an all-hands approach to get it done.

“After [renewable tax credits expire], we as a country must commercialize other assets. Gas is a great bridge fuel, and we’re going to continue to use a lot of gas,” Frenzel added.

In the 2030s, new nuclear and geothermal power facilities will come online, he said, but those generation sources require more development time and permitting hurdles.

In Sherburne County, Minnesota, Xcel is retiring its legacy coal plant, taking the first unit offline last year and fully closing it by 2030. In its place, Xcel is developing an array of solar, wind, and battery power. The project includes the longest-duration battery storage in the country, a 100-hour battery system developed by Form Energy. The goal is to power a data center hub there, Frenzel said. Xcel and Meta are working together on a Minnesota project. Amazon also recently bought adjacent land, although its plans are currently paused.

In the Texas Panhandle, Xcel just converted its Harrington coal plant to gas-fired power. Up next, is the nearby Tolk coal facility also slated for a switch to gas. Xcel plans to build about 2 gigawatts of new wind and solar power in the area to meet oil and gas industry electrification needs, as well as for the transformation of a crypto mining site into a data center complex, Frenzel said.

Likewise, Xcel is almost finished converting its Pawnee coal plant in Colorado to gas-fired power. Xcel’s Hayden coal plant in Colorado is slated for closure in 2028, and geothermal power is under consideration for that site. Xcel is working with data center developer QTS in the state.

In a more unique twist on coal-to-gas switching, the Intermountain coal plant in Utah is switching to gas, but it’s also utilizing a green hydrogen blend with the gas to make it burn cleaner. And some coal-to-gas involves using battery storage as well. The AES Petersburg coal plant in Indiana is switching to a gas-fired and battery storage combo complex.

Elsewhere in the country, even coal-to-nuclear plans are underway. Bill Gates’ TerraPower is developing a next-generation nuclear plant slated to open by 2030 on an expedited schedule—in a partnership with Sabey Data Centers—utilizing the interconnections of the Naughton coal and gas plant, which will start closing next year.

Still, even as coal plant retirements were moved up in recent years, some are being pushed backwards again toward their original closure dates now that the grid is being strained and the Trump administration is championing coal power.

For instance, Maryland’s last coal plant, Brandon Shores, was slated to close this year, but will now stay up until 2029 as a power bridge for the AI boom. Likewise, the J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan was extended from its May closure date until at least November.

The Trump administration’s orders to keep “beautiful clean coal” alive are only temporary. The plants are still going to close; they just received stays on their execution dates.

The “clean coal” phrasing was part of a lobbying and marketing push for more modernized—and less dirty—coal plants about 15 years ago, but the language has largely disappeared outside of the White House as coal continues to be replaced by renewables and cleaner, cheaper gas.

The coal lobbying group, Americans for Balanced Energy Choices, rebranded in 2008 as the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity. They gave up on that in 2019, changing to the more succinct and generically named America’s Power. Since then, utilities and railroads have left the group, leaving its membership only to coal companies.

Big Appalachian gas opportunity

In July, about 85 miles west of Homer City in Pennsylvania, it was announced by the project’s developers that the old Bruce Mansfield coal plant, padlocked in 2019, would be converted to gas-fired power as the new Shippingport Power Station to help fuel the AI revolution.

That same day, the developers also publicized the largest natural gas producer in the Appalachia region, EQT, would supply both the Shippingport and Homer City projects with a combined 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of gas supplies.

“Just to put this in perspective, that’s enough natural gas to power two of New York City. Scale matters,” EQT CEO Toby Rice told Fortune. “Homer City and Shippingport are just the first steps of multiple steps in multiple projects, because I do believe that cluster effect is real. They already have connections to the grid, which is a huge fast pass.”

EQT is ready to help lead an AI tech boom in Pennsylvania and the broader Appalachia region with the advantage that it’s home to the largest natural gas field in the country, the Marcellus Shale. And EQT has its own pipeline business to connect directly to data centers as needed.

Rice is leading the charge to make natural gas as clean as possible, through improved technology and upcoming carbon capture and storage projects. It incudes a marketing push—after all, “natural gas” sounds much nicer than “methane.” “People need to understand the natural gas decarbonization train has not slowed down,” he said.

Rusty Hutson, the CEO of gas producer Diversified Energy agrees. Methane is the product, he said, and the producers don’t want to waste the gas in emissions. “We want to sell it. At the end of the day, going through a pipeline and going through a meter is much more beneficial to us than any emissions are,” Hutson told Fortune.

While EQT will focus on drilling new wells to feed the AI beast, Diversified operates more mature gas wells that are often unwanted by the biggest players.

“Data centers, especially in the Appalachian basin, are going to be a huge demand on natural gas,” Hutson said. “We can’t afford to lose any production because other companies are focused on the drill bit and not really on existing wells and existing operations. That’s where we come in to maintain and produce those wells in an efficient manner to keep them in production for longer.”

As Rice and Hutson argued, the trend is much bigger though than an Appalachia story. Enverus’ Kearl said the AI race may very well be won or lost based on how rapidly old coal plants can be repowered to other generation sources nationwide.

“Repowering isn’t just a cost play—it’s a political and logistical shortcut to growing 24/7, low-carbon power,” Kearl said.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/j3MZc_def9wzTTG7HO7mGw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fortune_175/82b3da3501aba17615f78c6d995d0d77,N,,2025-08-31 08:59:46.786703

Don’t forget the American Cement Association, National Asphalt Pavement Association and the Associated General Contractors of America.
You’ll be surprised to hear supporters argue the bill “cuts red tape, streamlines reviews, and provides greater regulatory certainty” under Clean Water Act permitting processes.
They’ll also try convincing Iowans how this power grab strengthens the Clean Water Act.","For a brief, shining moment, the Environmental Protection Agency stepped in to protect Iowa’s polluted waterways. It did so against the wishes of state officials who resented the federal effort to address nitrate pollution in drinking water.

State regulators had already deployed their strongest platitudes to address the problem. Hit the bricks, federales.

So, after Iowa regulators delisted seven river segments from our lengthy tally of impaired waters in 2024, the EPA stepped in to put them back on the list due to high nitrate concentrations. The segments included the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers which supply drinking water to Des Moines, the Cedar River north of Cedar Rapids and the Iowa River near Iowa City.

The nerve of these federal bureaucrats, telling Iowa its water is dirty and unsafe. Iowa Department of Natural Resources Director Kayla Lyon complained the EPA was holding Iowa to “a very high standard.” I mean, it’s only drinking water.

But in July, the EPA, now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Trump Enterprise, told Iowa they can remove the segments from the impaired waters list. This, even after high nitrate levels forced Des Moines to order water usage limits to help its nitrate removal system clean up contaminated water before it reached the taps of 600,000 people.

So, the EPA is no longer here to help. Thankfully, we’ve still got Congress.

But Republicans who control the U.S. House are trying to make changes that would weaken the Clean Water Act. The bill is called the PERMIT Act, Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today. Stop them before they acronym again.

The legislation cleared a House committee and could be debated on the House floor as early as next week.

That would be perfect timing. Just after Iowans are advised over the holiday weekend to avoid swimming at several state park beaches by the DNR.

“This is all weakening amendments to the federal Clean Water Act, and it really isn't what people want. People actually want clean safe water. The President said that that's what he wanted, clean safe water,” said Nancy Stoner a senior attorney with the Environmental Law & Policy Center.

“They don't want more toxins in their water. They don't want more pesticides, they don't want more sewage, they don't want more, you know, heavy metals. They don't want any of that, and they didn't vote for that. And yet, that's what Congress is considering, Stoner said.

The legislation would slash protections for ephemeral streams and wetlands, which can help filter and hold back runoff during periods of heavy precipitation. Climate change is spawning more of those. But there would be no penalty for burying them so the land can be developed or farmed.

The EPA and Army Corps of Engineers would have the unrestricted power to remove any body of water from federal protection. They don’t have to tell the public why they’ve been removed. What could go wrong?

Under the bill, according to a summary from the group Beyond Pesticides, the EPA would have to consider the cost of pollution cleanup, so “safe water” might just be too expensive to mitigate. It would also curtail the EPA’s ability to update pollution standards based on the newest technology.

States and Tribes would lose the authority to review the local effects of federal projects, including dams and pipelines.

General pollution permit rules would exempt pesticides, agricultural runoff and fire suppression chemicals from accountability. There also would be no penalty or liability for failing to report pollution discharges. That includes contamination by PFAS, or “forever chemicals.” The public, apparently, doesn’t need to know.

Also, the Endangered Species Act will no longer be considered in the permitting process.

So, it’s quite a bill. And it’s got a list of supporters longer than an impaired stream, according to a list prepared by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.

It includes the American Farm Bureau Federation, National Cattleman’s Beef Association, National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, National Milk Producers Federation, National Pork Producers Council, National Turkey Federation, United Egg Producers and the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association.

Don’t forget the American Cement Association, National Asphalt Pavement Association and the Associated General Contractors of America. The road builders are backing the bill, as is the American Mosquito Control Association.

The Fertilizer Institute supports the bill along with something called Responsible Industry for a Sound Environment.

You’ll be surprised to hear supporters argue the bill “cuts red tape, streamlines reviews, and provides greater regulatory certainty” under Clean Water Act permitting processes. Oh, and the ‘reforms” are common sense. They always are.

The Environmental Law and Policy Center sees the bill differently.

“The PERMIT Act poses genuine threats to human health by creating a system that makes it easier for polluters to discharge forever chemicals, pesticides, and toxic pollutants into the waters Americans use for drinking, fishing, and recreation,” the group contends.

Fourteen Iowa groups sent a letter to members of Iowa’s House delegation urging them to vote against the bill, including the Environmental Law & Policy Center, Food & Water Watch, Iowa Alliance for Responsible Agriculture, Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement, Iowa Environmental Council, Iowa Faith and Climate Network, the Iowa Groundwater Association and the Iowa Wildlife Federation.

It’s likely my congresswoman, Ashley Hinson, will back the bill, along with the entire Republican delegation. It was Hinson who warned the EPA would inspect farm puddles if the agency expanded the list of Waters of the U.S. under federal protection. The puddle police were a figment of her imagination.

They’ll also try convincing Iowans how this power grab strengthens the Clean Water Act. Who are you going to believe, a member of Congress or radical socialist water drinkers?

Don’t believe them. We should urge Hinson and others to oppose the bill. But more importantly, we need to make sure our delegation understands we know what they’re doing. And we will be holding them accountable.

So, we’ll get no help from the EPA, and our state government bowed to the polluters years ago. But Iowans are starting to get the picture, and they’re not pleased. They also suspect nitrate pollution has something to do with Iowa’s high and growing cancer rate.

We have some of the dirtiest surface water in the nation. There’s plenty of bipartisan blame to go around. Common sense is now far less sensible and hardly common under a president who cares as much about the environment as he cares about truth. Iowa Republicans have pledged undying allegiance to our dear leader.

We live on the banks of an endless river impaired by greed, pollution and lies. It truly is our golden age.

The production of coal, which Trump often points to as an ideal for American jobs, peaked in 2008.
Another cut last week sums up the repercussions of the administration’s attack on renewable energy.
As Matthew Daly of the Associated Press noted yesterday, Revolution Wind was the region’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm.
In July, Ella Nilsen of CNN reported that cuts to renewable power generation, as well as to the tax credits that encouraged the development of more renewable power projects, are exacerbating the electrical shortage and driving prices up.","August 30, 2025 (Saturday)

Just days before Labor Day, a holiday designed to celebrate the importance and power of American workers in the United States, the Transportation Department cancelled $679 million in funding for offshore wind projects, and the Department of Energy announced it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee to complete infrastructure for an offshore wind project in New Jersey.

These cancellations reflect President Donald J. Trump’s apparent determination to kill off wind and solar power initiatives and to force the United States to depend on fossil fuels. He refers to climate change as a “hoax,” says that windmills cause cancer, and falsely claims that renewable energy is more expensive than other ways to generate power. Former president Joe Biden made investing in clean energy a central pillar of his administration; Trump often seems to construct policies mostly to erase the legacies of his predecessors.

Reversing the shift toward renewable energy not only attacks attempts to address the crisis of climate change and boosts the fossil fuel industry on which some of Trump’s apparent allies depend, but also undermines a society based on the independence of American workers. In 2023, about 3.5 million Americans worked in jobs related to the renewable energy sector, and jobs in that sector grew at more than twice the rate of those in other sectors in what was a strong U.S. labor market. The production of coal, which Trump often points to as an ideal for American jobs, peaked in 2008. Between then and 2021, employment in coal mining fell by almost 60% in the East and almost 40% in the West, leaving a total of about 40,000 employees.

Another cut last week sums up the repercussions of the administration’s attack on renewable energy. On August 22 the Interior Department suddenly and without explanation stopped construction of a wind farm off the coast of Connecticut and Rhode Island that was 80% complete and was set to be finished early next year. As Matthew Daly of the Associated Press noted yesterday, Revolution Wind was the region’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm. It was designed to power more than 350,000 homes, provide jobs in Connecticut and Rhode Island, and enable Rhode Island to meet its goal of 100% renewable energy by 2033.

The Board of Directors of the Chamber of Commerce of Eastern Connecticut expressed their dismay at the decision, noting that Revolution Wind employed more than 1,000 local union workers and is part of a $20 billion investment in “American energy generation, port infrastructure, supply chain, and domestic shipbuilding and manufacturing across over 40 states” by Ørsted, a Danish multinational company.

“Stopping this fully permitted, important project without a clear stated reason not only seriously undermines the state’s efforts to work towards a carbon neutral energy supply but equally important it sends a message to investors from all over the world that they may want to rethink investing in America. The message resulting from the President’s action is a lack of trust, uncertainty, and lack of predictability,” they wrote.

Connecticut governor Ned Lamont and Rhode Island governor Dan McKee, both Democrats, are working together to save the project. In a statement, Lamont said: “We are working closely with Rhode Island to save this project because it represents exactly the kind of investment that reduces energy costs, strengthens regional production, and builds a more secure energy future—the very goals President Trump claims to support but undermines with this decision.”

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” McKee said. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

The Trump administration launched this attack on renewable energy at a time when electricity prices are bouncing upward. According to Ari Natter and Naureen S. Malik of Bloomberg, electricity prices jumped about 10% between January and May and are projected to rise another 5.8% next year. Trump has tried to blame those rising costs on renewable energy, but in the country’s largest grid, which stretches from Virginia to Illinois, nearly all the electricity comes from natural gas, coal, and nuclear reactors.

More to the point is that the region also has the world’s highest concentration of AI data centers, driving power demand—and costs—upward. At the same time, according to Natter and Malik, the infrastructure for transmission is too outdated to handle the amounts of electricity the data centers will need.

Trump’s cuts are adding stress to this already overburdened system. Over the next decade, they are projected to reduce additions to the electric grid by half compared to projections from before his cuts. In July, Ella Nilsen of CNN reported that cuts to renewable power generation, as well as to the tax credits that encouraged the development of more renewable power projects, are exacerbating the electrical shortage and driving prices up.

The Trump administration claims that relying on fossil fuels will jump-start the economy, but higher costs for electricity are already fueling inflation, and in the longer term, more expensive power will slow economic growth. In contrast, China has leaped ahead to dominate the global clean energy industry. Cheaper electricity there is expected to make it more attractive for future investment.

Renewable energy is crucial to addressing the existential crisis of climate change, but as former president Joe Biden emphasized, developing the sector was also key for building a strong middle class. Well-paying jobs, in turn, help to protect democracy.

Historically, a system in which local economies support small businesses and entrepreneurs promotes a wide distribution of political power. In contrast, extractive industries support a system that concentrates wealth and power in the hands of a few individuals. The extractive systems in the pre–Civil War American South, where cotton concentrated power and wealth, and later in the American West, where mining, cattle, and agribusiness did the same, nurtured political systems in which a few men controlled their regions.

As president of the Massachusetts AFL-CIO Chrissy Lynch said in July after the Republicans passed the budget reconciliation bill cutting clean energy tax credits: “Working families shouldn’t have to purchase energy from billionaire oil tycoons and foreign governments or let them set the price of our energy bills.”

Her observation hit home earlier this week, when Joe Wallace, Costas Paris, Alex Leary, and Collin Eaton of the Wall Street Journal reported that the comments of Russian president Vladimir Putin and Trump at their meeting in Alaska on August 15 in which they talked about doing more business together were not vague goodwill. ExxonMobil and Russia’s biggest energy company, Rosneft, have been in secret talks to resume a partnership to extract Russian oil, including in the Arctic, that had been severed by Russia’s attack on Ukraine in 2022.",,N,,2025-08-31 13:02:27.749522

According to EY, 70% of businesses will prioritise electrification, energy costs and emissions within the next three years.
“Successfully navigating accelerating business energy growth will drive energy prosperity and define the economic and energy transition winners of tomorrow,” says Greg Guthridge, EY Global Industrials & Energy Customer Experience Transformation Leader, in EY’s report.
“Progress is slow because of barriers including the high cost of financing, complex regulations and challenges working with energy providers,” says EY.
Tailored partnerships and smarter solutions could enable this underserved group to actively participate in the energy transition.","Global electricity demand is forecast to double by 2050, with businesses expected to account for around 75% of this growth.

This surge is driven by factors such as the expansion of data centres, increased electrification, onshoring of manufacturing and large-scale investments in emerging technologies.

EY’s latest research asks how this growing demand can fuel long-term prosperity and what shape the business energy transition will take.

EY’s Navigating the Energy Transition research programme spans five years and includes insights from nearly 100,000 residential consumers and more than 2,400 energy leaders and decision makers from medium to large businesses.

Electrification ambitions and rising expectations

The study covers eight countries across various stages of energy transition and renewables deployment.

The findings highlight growing ambition.

According to EY, 70% of businesses will prioritise electrification, energy costs and emissions within the next three years.

However, most say that traditional account management is no longer enough.

EY’s data reveals that 71% of businesses now have energy strategies but many are waiting to collaborate with energy specialists to execute them.

Businesses are increasingly willing to pay more for rapid access to renewable energy, particularly through on-site generation and battery storage.

Around 70% of those surveyed plan to invest in both areas within the next three years.

The shift in expectations is also evident in the way businesses view their relationship with energy providers.

Customised services, transition support and digital tools are in high demand, especially as energy consumption becomes more central to operations.

“Successfully navigating accelerating business energy growth will drive energy prosperity and define the economic and energy transition winners of tomorrow,” says Greg Guthridge, EY Global Industrials & Energy Customer Experience Transformation Leader, in EY’s report.

The report also outlines the complexity of today’s business energy needs. For mid-sized firms in particular, the energy landscape is difficult to navigate without targeted support.

Addressing the “neglected middle” of the business energy transition

Mid-sized businesses, which form a large portion of employment and GDP, express similar energy ambitions to their larger counterparts but often lack the confidence and capability to act.

EY’s data shows they are 20% less likely to have clear energy plans in place.

More than two-thirds of these businesses are exploring options including on-site renewables, battery storage, demand response, electrification of equipment and EVs.

However, progress is limited by challenges around financing, regulation and insufficient engagement from energy providers.

“Progress is slow because of barriers including the high cost of financing, complex regulations and challenges working with energy providers,” says EY.

This presents a growth opportunity for providers willing to offer sector-specific services and support.

Tailored partnerships and smarter solutions could enable this underserved group to actively participate in the energy transition.

Data centres and digital tech

Digital infrastructure is emerging as a core force behind demand.

The acceleration of generative AI development, alongside ongoing electrification, is pushing electricity consumption to levels not seen in decades.

EY finds that 71% of businesses want artificial intelligence to support energy decision-making, including advice and insights on deploying smarter systems.

This reflects a broader appetite for digital platforms that provide real-time control, automated reporting and optimisation.

“Data centres are multiplying, electrification is accelerating and manufacturing is ramping up, all driving electricity demand to levels not seen in decades,” says Greg.

“Rising energy demand and infrastructure investments are impacting affordability and raising important questions about who should pay for it.”

Examples of smarter systems in action include AES, a US utility operating in 15 countries.

AES works with Siemens to run Fluence, an industrial-scale battery storage company.

It also invests in Uplight, a cloud-based energy platform for residential and business customers.

The case is being watched closely, not only by climate alliances and sustainability nonprofits, but by the financial sector at large.
That study, which empirically examines 11 major climate alliances and 424 listed financial institutions over 10 years, turned up no evidence of traditional antitrust violations.","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy, and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

Since 2022, Republican lawmakers in Congress and state attorneys general have sent letters to major banks, pension funds, asset managers, accounting firms, companies, nonprofits, and business alliances, putting them on notice for potential antitrust violations and seeking information as part of the Republican pushback against “environmental, social and governance” efforts such as corporate climate commitments.

“This caused a lot of turmoil and stress obviously across the whole ecosystem,” said Denise Hearn, a senior fellow at the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment. “But everyone wondered, ‘OK, when are they actually going to drop a lawsuit?’”

That came in November, filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other Republican AGs, accusing three of the biggest asset managers on Wall Street—BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street—of running “an investment cartel” to depress the output of coal and boosting their revenues while pushing up energy costs for Americans. The Trump administration’s Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission filed a supporting brief in May.

The overall pressure campaign aimed at what’s known as “ESG” is having an impact.

“Over the past several months, through this [lawsuit] and other things, letters from elected officials, state and federal, there has been a chilling effect of what investors are saying,” said Steven Maze Rothstein, chief program officer of Ceres, a nonprofit that advocates for more sustainable business practices and was among the earliest letter recipients. Still, “investors understand that Mother Nature doesn’t know who’s elected governor, attorney general, president.”

Earlier this month, a US District Court judge in Tyler, Texas, declined to dismiss the lawsuit against the three asset managers, though he did dismiss three of the 21 counts. The judge was not making a final decision in the case, only that there was enough evidence to go to trial.

BlackRock said in a statement: “This case is not supported by the facts, and we will demonstrate that.” Vanguard said it will “vigorously defend against plaintiffs’ claims.” State Street called the lawsuit “baseless and without merit.”

The Texas attorney general’s office did not respond to requests for comment.

The three asset managers built substantial stakes in major US coal producers, the suit alleges, and “announced their common commitment” to cut US coal output by joining voluntary alliances to collaborate on climate issues, including the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative and, in the case of two of the firms, the Climate Action 100+. (All of them later pulled out of the alliances.)

The lawsuit alleges that the coal companies succumbed to the defendants’ collective influence, mining for less coal and disclosing more climate-related information. The suit claimed that resulted in “cartel-level revenues and profits” for the asset managers.

“You could say, ‘Well, if the coal companies were all colluding together to restrict output, then shouldn’t they also be violating antitrust?’” Hearn asked. But the attorneys general “are trying to say that it was at the behest of these concentrated index funds and the concentrated ownership.”

Index funds, which are designed to mirror the returns of specific market indices, are the most common mode of passive investment—when investors park their money somewhere for long-term returns.

The case is being watched closely, not only by climate alliances and sustainability nonprofits, but by the financial sector at large.

If the three asset managers ultimately win, it would turn down the heat on other climate alliances and vindicate those who pressured financial players to line up their business practices with the Paris agreement goals as well as national and local climate targets. The logic of those efforts: Companies in the financial sector have a big impact on climate change, for good or ill—and climate change has a big impact on those same companies.

If the red states instead win on all counts, that “could essentially totally reconstitute the industry as we understand it,” said Hearn, who has co-authored a paper on the lawsuit. At stake is how the US does passive investing.

The pro-free-market editorial board of The Wall Street Journal in June called the Texas-led lawsuit “misconceived,” its logic “strained” and its theories “bizarre.”

The case breaks ground on two fronts. It challenges collaboration between financial players on climate action. It also makes novel claims around “common ownership,” where a shareholder—in this case, an asset manager—holds stakes in competing firms within the same sector.

“Regardless of how the chips fall in the case, those two things will absolutely be precedent-setting,” Hearn said.

Even though this is the first legal test of the theory that business climate alliances are anti-competitive, the question was asked in a study by Harvard Business School economists that came out in May. That study, which empirically examines 11 major climate alliances and 424 listed financial institutions over 10 years, turned up no evidence of traditional antitrust violations. The study was broad and did not look at particular allegations against specific firms.

“To the extent that there are valid legal arguments that can be made, they have to be tested,” said study co-author Peter Tufano, a Harvard Business School professor, noting that his research casts doubt on many of the allegations made by critics of these alliances.

Financial firms that joined climate alliances were more likely to adopt emissions targets and climate-aligned management practices, cut their own emissions and engage in pro-climate lobbying, the study found.

”The range of [legal] arguments that are made, and the passion with which they’re being advanced, suggests that these alliances must be doing something meaningful,” said Tufano, who was previously the dean of the Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford.

Meanwhile, most of the world is moving the other way.

According to a tally by CarbonCloud, a carbon emissions accounting platform that serves the food industry, at least 35 countries that make up more than half of the world’s gross domestic product now mandate climate-related disclosures of some kind.

In the US, California, which on its own would be the world’s fourth-largest economy, will begin requiring big businesses to measure and report their direct and indirect emissions next year.

Ceres’ Rothstein notes that good data about companies is necessary for informed investment decisions. “Throughout the world,” he said, “there’s greater recognition and, to be honest, less debate about the importance of climate information.” Ceres is one of the founders of Climate Action 100+, which now counts more than 600 investor members around the world, including Europe, Asia, and Australia.

For companies that operate globally, the American political landscape is in sharp contrast with other major economies, Tufano said, creating “this whipsawed environment where if you get on a plane, a few hours later, you’re in a jurisdiction that’s saying exactly the opposite thing.”

But even as companies and financial institutions publicly retreat from their climate commitments amid US political pressure, in a phenomenon called “greenhushing,” their decisions remain driven by the bottom line. “Banks are going to do what they’re going to do, and they’re going to lend to the most profitable or to the most growth-oriented industries,” Hearn said, “and right now, that’s not the fossil fuel industry.”",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wall-street-1152x648.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 05:59:34.061489

This frozen spot, fondly referred to as “The Great Land,” hides a colossal mine that could be the global heart of none other than hydrogen. The Great Land’s official state flower is the “Forget-Me-Not,” and we can without a doubt confirm that it will never be forgotten after this major discovery, as it could potentially change the future of the renewable energy industry forever. Earth’s future is suddenly looking a whole lot brighter.

The importance of hydrogen in the renewable energy industry

We have been relying on carbon-heavy sectors for as long as time can tell. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, within the United States, the primary carbon-heavy sectors are:

Manufacturing, mining, and construction industries

Power and heat production

Transportation

Agriculture

Waste management

These sectors are culprits of extreme carbon emissions and are great contributors to climate change. If these sectors do not become decarbonized soon, achieving the global mission of net-zero will be near impossible, and we can start saying goodbye to sustainable development for the ever-increasing global population. This is where hydrogen’s importance in the renewable energy industry comes in.

According to CNBC, not only is hydrogen essential in decarbonizing carbon-heavy sectors, but it also plays a fundamental role in energy storage in these ways:

Power intermittency

Hydrogen can store high amounts of power from renewable sources

Long-term storage

Can store power for extended periods

Grid stabilization

Power plants can utilize stored hydrogen to produce power during peak demands or when renewable output is low

This frozen spot’s colossal mine could be the global hydrogen heart

The frozen spot in America, the Great Land, is none other than Alaska. And its colossal hydrogen mine could change our future. One thing that must always be considered is the type of hydrogen. It is the world’s most mysterious energy source, as it is polluting in one country, and non-polluting in another. According to the company, Granite Creek Copper Ltd., this potential hydrogen reserve is a clean source.

This clean source of hydrogen is called geological hydrogen, also referred to as white hydrogen. According to Metal Tech News, white hydrogen is produced naturally by a process that comprises iron-rich rock formations. Granite Creek and Cornell University have partnered to research the potential of white hydrogen.

“Our team looks forward to this collaboration with Granite Creek on strategies to stimulate geologic hydrogen production, with an emphasis on exploring the ultramafic resources in Alaska.” – Greeshma Gadikota, a Cornell associate professor

Geological hydrogen is the best color of hydrogen

In general, hydrogen is combined with other elements in hydrocarbons, water, and other forms. Splitting hydrogen from natural gas or water usually utilizes vast amounts of energy, is expensive, and results in carbon emissions, which defeats the purpose, as per Metal Tech News. Hydrogen is thus categorized with colors, which represent the respective carbon footprints. White hydrogen is the best type.

Grey hydrogen

Obtained by splitting natural gas for chemicals, fertilizers, and steel. It costs $2 per kg and has a high carbon footprint.

Green hydrogen

Obtained by splitting water molecules with renewables, thus has a low carbon footprint. It costs $7 per kg, making it too expensive for global supply.",https://www.ecoportal.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Depositphotos_2194194_L.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 10:00:55.895380

The company emphasized its local production capabilities in the region, which includes converting part of the production at its Indiana joint venture facility with Stellantis from electric vehicle battery cells to ESS. Samsung SDI has committed to completing the transition by October, with mass production planned for later this year.

Highlights at the expo include the new models of its power grid ESS solution, the Samsung Battery Box 1.7 and SBB 2.0. The SBB is an all-in-one ESS solution housed in a 20-foot container containing battery cells, modules and racks ready for direct connection to the grid. Both new models contain batteries produced in the US, making them eligible for tax incentives available to US clients under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Showcased for the first time at the exhibition, the SBB 1.7 delivers approximately 17 percent higher energy density compared to its predecessor, the nickel-cobalt-aluminum-based SBB 1.5. Meanwhile, the prototype of the SBB 2.0, showcased here for the first time ever, features more cost-effective lithium iron phosphate battery cells.

Both SBB models incorporate Samsung SDI’s enhanced safety technology through Enhanced Direct Injection impregnation fire prevention, which sprays fire-extinguishing agents directly onto battery modules to prevent thermal propagation between cells.

In addition, Samsung SDI plans to display other innovative ESS products and technologies, including a new uninterruptible power supply product that won an innovation award at The Smarter E Europe 2025, Europe’s largest energy exhibition held in Munich last May, along with its advanced thermal propagation suppression safety technology.

A Samsung SDI spokesperson stated, “We will unveil locally tailored ESS battery products and innovative technologies for the rapidly growing US market. With high-performance and highly efficient ESS batteries, we will accelerate our penetration of the US market.”

RE+ is the largest renewable energy event in North America, with around 1,300 global companies expected to participate this year.

The federal EV tax credit, worth up to $7,500, is set to expire on September 30, 2025. For buyers on the fence about going electric, this is the final boarding call. The tax credit has been a lifeline for making electric vehicles (EVs) more affordable. But once it’s gone? Prices will rise, and the total cost of ownership will shift dramatically.

Chevrolet Leads the Charge

Mercury Insurance, a leading auto insurer in California, just dropped its annual list of the most affordable EVs to insure. And guess who’s at the top? Chevrolet. The Blazer EV and Equinox EV take the first two spots, making them the most budget-friendly EVs to insure in 2025.

Why does this matter? Insurance is a major factor in the total cost of owning an EV. While EVs are often cheaper to operate (think lower fuel and maintenance costs), their insurance premiums can be a dealbreaker. EVs cost, on average, 49% more to insure than gas-powered cars. But Chevrolet’s models buck the trend. The Blazer EV, for instance, costs about $2,765 annually to insure, saving drivers $312 compared to the national average for SUVs.

Mercury’s Top 10 List

This year marks the 10th anniversary of Mercury’s list, and it’s more relevant than ever. With federal tax credits on the chopping block, budget-conscious buyers need every edge they can get. Here’s the full list of the most affordable EVs to insure for 2025 and 2026:

Chevrolet Blazer EV

Chevrolet Equinox EV

Nissan Leaf

Kia Niro EV

Ford F-150 Lightning

Hyundai Kona EV

MINI Cooper SE

Hyundai IONIQ EVs (all models)

Fiat 500e

Subaru Solterra/Toyota bZ4X

Chong Gao, Director of Product Management R&D at Mercury Insurance, emphasized the importance of this year’s list: “With federal EV tax credits set to expire in the near future, now is the time to get into an EV for consumers who are interested in one. These EVs are great choices for consumers who are looking to save on the total cost of car ownership equation.”

Why Are Some EVs Cheaper to Insure?

Not all EVs are created equal when it comes to insurance costs. Factors like repair expenses, safety records, and claims history play a big role. For example, vehicles with expensive, hard-to-replace parts (like Tesla’s falcon-wing doors) drive up premiums. On the flip side, models like the Blazer and Equinox are designed with affordability in mind, making them standout choices for cost-conscious drivers.

The Bigger Picture: What Happens After the Tax Credit Ends?

The EV market is at a critical juncture. Analysts predict a short-term sales surge as buyers rush to claim the tax credit. But after September 30, 2025? A slowdown. Without the tax credit, EVs will become less accessible for many buyers. Dealerships may struggle to move inventory, and some are already offering deep discounts to clear their lots.

But is this the end of the EV revolution? Not at all. Long-term growth is still expected, albeit at a slower pace. Automakers are investing heavily in innovation, rolling out cheaper, more efficient models. And with states like California pushing for zero-emission mandates, EVs are here to stay.

Why Act Now?

If you’re considering an EV, the time to act is now. Lock in the tax credit. Choose a model with low insurance costs—like the Chevy Blazer or Equinox. And don’t forget: even after the credit expires, EVs still offer lower operating costs and environmental benefits.

Final Thoughts

The federal tax credit’s expiration is a turning point for the EV market. It’s a challenge, but also an opportunity for savvy buyers. Chevrolet’s affordable insurance rates, combined with the last chance to claim the tax credit, make this a moment to seize. The future is electric.

Some 200 patients have participated in tango workshops offered over the past 15 years at Ramos Mejia Hospital to study the impact of the dance on the symptoms of this incurable neurodegenerative disease, organizers told AFP.

""One of the main problems of the disease is gait disorder, and the tango, as a walking dance, works on starting and stopping steps, and strategies for walking,"" said neurologist Nelida Garretto.

The results have been encouraging. Many patients find ways to alleviate symptoms such as the motor blocks that ""freeze"" their gait, said neurologist Tomoko Arakaki.

""A patient told us that when she freezes, she tries to do the 'figure eight' -– one of the classic tango steps -- with her feet, and this enables her to get out of the freeze,"" Arakaki added.

Dancing the tango helps build a ""sensory pathway"" that helps with walking, she explained.

""We know that Parkinson's requires pharmaceutical treatments. Tango is used to rehabilitate the motor part. With music, you can get out of complex situations,"" she said.

Beltran, 66 and diagnosed with Parkinson's two years ago, had never danced the tango. She joined the workshop on the advice of doctors.

""If it's to stop the advance, I have to do it, I have to dance for my life,"" she said.

In addition to tremors, stiffness, difficulty with balance and speech problems, Parkinson's leads to social isolation and depression. The tango workshop can help in these areas.

Beltran reported that dancing boosts her stability and her mood. ""Tomorrow I'm sure I'll feel better because today I danced tango,"" she said.

Patients dance with partners not suffering from Parkinson's, and under the guidance of dance therapists like Manuco Firmani, a professional tango dancer who has been involved with Parkinson's rehabilitation since 2011.

Emilia, 86, did not want to give her last name because she is dancing against the wishes of her son, who worries over the two-hour bus trip she takes to reach the studio in central Buenos Aires.

""For me this is the happiness of every Tuesday"" said the retired teacher with a frail, bent body and whispery voice, for whom tango evokes memories of her youth.

""Every year we conduct specific evaluations to analyze the benefits of tango,"" revealed neurologist Sergio Rodriguez. ""We have measured improvements in cognitive skills, motor skills, gait and balance.""

Walking is at the core of the Argentine tango, specialists say. But that's not the only reason it is an effective rehabilitation method for Parkinson's patients.

Tango also requires dancers to follow rhythms, to move in a set direction and to interpret the physical cues of their dance partner.

""There are many simultaneous messages that must be resolved, which is very positive for this disease,"" said Garretto.

At the end of class, there is applause and ""an air of satisfaction"" in the room, remarked dance therapist Laura Segade.

""After all, who can take away what they've danced?""

Britain's energy operator is betting on an age-old technology to future-proof its grid, as the power plants that traditionally helped stabilize it are closed and replaced by renewable energy systems.

Spinning metal devices known as flywheels have for centuries been used to provide inertia -- resistance to sudden changes in motion -- to various machines, from a potter's wheel to the steam engine.

Grid operators are now looking to the technology to add inertia to renewable-heavy electricity systems to prevent blackouts like the one that hit Spain and Portugal this year.

In an electricity grid, inertia is generally provided by large spinning generators found in coal-fired and gas power plants, helping maintain a steady frequency by smoothing fluctuations in supply and demand.

But renewable energy sources like solar and wind power don't add inertia to the grid, and usually cannot help with other issues, such as voltage control.

Flywheels can mimic the rotational inertia of power plant generators, spinning quicker or slower to respond to fluctuations.

Without rotating turbines, ""the system is more prone to fluctuations than it would be otherwise"", explained David Brayshaw, a professor of climate science at the University of Reading in England.

""As we get to ever higher levels of renewables, we're going to have to think about this more carefully,"" Brayshaw told AFP.

Flywheels and batteries

The Iberian Peninsula, which is powered by a high share of renewables, went dark on April 28 after its grid was unable to absorb a sudden surge in voltage and deviations in frequency.

Spain's government has since pointed fingers at conventional power plants for failing to control voltage levels.

It could serve as a wake-up call similar to a 2019 outage which plunged parts of Britain into darkness following a drop in grid frequency.

That blackout prompted UK energy operator NESO to launch what it called a ""world-first"" program to contract grid-stabilizing projects.

Flywheels and batteries can add synthetic inertia to the grid, but engineering professor Keith Pullen says steel flywheels can be more cost-effective and durable than lithium-ion batteries.

""I'm not saying that flywheels are the only technology, but they could be a very, very important one,"" said Pullen, a professor at City St George's, University of London and director of flywheel startup Levistor.

In the coming years, Pullen warned the grid will also become more unstable due to greater, but spikier demand.

With electric cars, heat pumps and energy-guzzling data centers being hooked onto the grid, ""we will have more shock loads... which the flywheel smooths out"".

Carbon-free inertia

Norwegian company Statkraft's ""Greener Grid Park"" in Liverpool was one of the projects contracted by NESO to keep the lights on.

Operational since 2023, it is a stone's throw from a former coal-fired power station site which loomed over the northern English city for most of the 20th century.

But now, instead of steam turbines, two giant flywheels weighing 40 tons (40,000 kilograms) each whirr at the Statkraft site, which supplies one percent of the inertia for the grid needed in England, Scotland and Wales.

Each flywheel is attached to a synchronous compensator, a spinning machine that further boosts inertia and provides voltage control services in the Liverpool region.

""We are providing that inertia without burning any fossil fuels, without creating any carbon emissions,"" said Guy Nicholson, Statkraft's zero-carbon grid solutions head.

According to NESO, 11 other similar synchronous compensator and flywheel projects were operational in Britain as of 2023, with several more contracted.

'Not fast enough'

The government is ""working closely with our industry partners who are developing world-leading technology, including flywheels, static and synchronous compensators, as we overhaul the energy system"", a Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson told AFP.

But, ""we aren't building them fast enough to decarbonize the grid"", warned Nicholson.

Britain aims to power the grid with clean energy 95 percent of the time by 2030, before completely switching to renewables in the next decade.

""At the moment... we can't even do it for one hour,"" said Nicholson.

Even when there is sufficient solar and wind energy being generated, ""we still have to run gas turbines to keep the grid stable"", he explained.

Still, Britain and neighboring Ireland seem to be ahead of the curve in procuring technology to stabilize renewable-heavy grids.

""In GB and Ireland, the system operators are leading by contracting these services,"" Nicholson said. ""On the continent, there hasn't been the same drive for that.""

“I think these things are driven by events. So, the Spanish blackout will drive change.""

For nearly two centuries, the white ferries gliding over the Bosphorus Strait have provided an iconic link for countless passengers travelling between Istanbul's European shores and its Asian side.

Despite the increasingly congested waters and competition from the Turkish megacity's bridges and undersea metro line, the ferries remain very popular.

The main operator Sehir Hatlari carries at least 40 million passengers a year.

""Any view of Istanbul must include Maiden's Tower, a ferry and a seagull,"" smiled Adil Bali, a specialist on the history of Istanbul's ferries, referring to a tiny rocky outcrop at the southern entrance to the Bosphorus.

""It is one of the few cities in the world that can be crossed by sea, so the ferries are indispensable here.""

Their arrival in 1843 transformed the simple fishing villages lining the shores of the Bosphorus into popular holiday destinations where wooden palaces were later built overlooking the water, boosting trade.

Until the first Bosphorus bridge was opened in 1973, the only way to cross between Istanbul's Asian and European sides was by boat -- and today, the experience remains an essential part of the city's charm.

At the helm of the Pasabahce, the flagship of Sehir Hatlari's 30 vessels, Captain Ekrem Ozcelik said the waters had become increasingly crowded.

""There's a lot more traffic on the water,"" he said of the tankers, containers and cargo ships that pass through the strait linking the Black Sea to the Aegean via the Sea of Marmara and the Dardanelles.

There are also cruise ships and private yachts navigating what is one of the world's busiest waterways, where 41,300 vessels passed in 2024, official figures show -- an average of 113 per day.

""Navigating the waters of Istanbul requires a certain amount of experience,"" Ozcelik said of the strait's powerful currents, whose waters can get particularly tricky when strong southwesterly winds can whip up three-meter (10-foot) high waves.

Born into a family of sailors and fishermen, Ozcelik said his boyhood dream was to one day don the white cap and uniform of a captain.

Now 52, he enjoys the freedom of sailing and the kudos of his profession.

""Being a captain in the heart of Istanbul is a source of great pride.""

And even more so on the Pasabahce, which recently escaped being decommissioned and instead underwent a two-year restoration, returning to the Bosphorus in 2022 on its 70th birthday.

""It's harder to maneuver than the others. It's heavier and turning corners is complicated,"" admitted first officer Semih Aksoy, 36.

But he added he wouldn't change the iconic ferry for the world, with its trademark wooden tables and old-world air of faded luxury.

""This ship has a unique beauty, a special feel to it.""

With its nine-man crew, the Pasabahce mainly sails the 20-minute route between the Asian district of Kadikoy and Besiktas on the European side.

But even that relatively short trip can be tricky, said Burak Temiz, a 24-year-old sailor.

""This summer, people were jumping into the water from Maiden's Tower for hours.

""And then there are the fishing nets,"" he told AFP, adding that the ferry's bows had even been grazed by jet skis in the crowded waters.

All the other ferries have a six-man crew, and dozens more staff work at the city's 53 ports, many of whom are known by regulars.

Ibrahim Bayus, a 62-year-old engineer born on Buyukada, the largest of the nearby Princes' Islands in the Sea of Marmara, recalls the familiarity of the ferries.

""As a boy, I often forgot to bring money but the captain knew me,"" he smiled.

With the service only suspended for snow, fog or a violent storm, Captain Ozcelik recalls when three students on Buyukada came to beg for his help.

""Traffic had been suspended but they told me if they couldn't take their exams, they would fail the entire year. So I took them to Kadikoy. And they all passed,"" he smiled.

And they still come to visit him.",https://static.srpcdigital.com/styles/1200x600/public/2025-08/1181436_0.jpeg.webp,N,,2025-08-31 09:00:13.526304

Washington (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday fired at least eight employees who signed a letter criticizing the agency’s leadership under Administrator Lee Zeldin and President Donald Trump.

“Following a thorough internal investigation, EPA supervisors made decisions on an individualized basis,” an EPA spokeswoman said Friday in a statement.

The so-called declaration of dissent, signed by more than 170 employees in late June, “contains inaccurate information designed to mislead the public about agency business,” spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said. “Thankfully, this represents a small fraction of the thousands of hard-working, dedicated EPA employees who are not trying to mislead and scare the American public.”

The EPA “has a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November,” she added.

Vaseliou declined to say how many employees were disciplined, but the head of the agency’s largest union said at least six probationary employees who signed the letter were fired, along with at least two career employees. The firings were first reported by The Washington Post.

The EPA union, part of the American Federation of Government Employees, condemned the firings, which come after 139 workers were put on administrative leave shortly after signing the dissent declaration. The EPA at the time accused employees of “unlawfully undermining” the Trump administration’s agenda.

“The Trump administration and EPA’s retaliatory actions against these workers was clearly an assault on labor and free-speech rights,” said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA employees.

More than 150 workers who were disciplined — up to and including being fired — included scientists, engineers, lawyers, contract officers, emergency response personnel “and a whole host of other jobs,” Chen told the Associated Press. “They live and work in communities around the country, and all believe in the mission of the agency to protect human health and the environment on behalf of the American public.”

In a letter made public June 30, the employees wrote that the EPA is no longer living up to its mission to protect human health and the environment. The letter represented rare public criticism from agency employees who knew they could face retaliation for speaking out against a weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science.

Employees at other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and Federal Emergency Management Agency, have issued similar statements. Some FEMA employees who signed a public letter of dissent earlier this week were put on administrative leave Tuesday, according to documents reviewed by The Associated Press.

More than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed the letter made public Monday. The statement criticizes recent cuts to agency staff and programs and warns that FEMA’s capacity to respond to a major disaster is dangerously diminished.

The EPA said last month it is eliminating its research and development arm and reducing agency staff by thousands of employees. Officials expect total staffing to go down to about 12,500, a reduction of more than 3,700 employees, or nearly 23%, from staffing levels when Trump took office in January.",https://kion546.b-cdn.net/2023/10/kionlogog-860x540.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 03:58:54.211289

And a new study published by the Cox Automotive firm adds a little water to the mill. A few days ago, it published its Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, an indicator based on prices observed at wholesale auctions in the United States. Values ​​that do not directly reflect prices for an individual but constitute a reference for used car professionals, scrutinized in particular for the evolution of residual value. In August, the overall index shows relative stability in used car prices. But the evolution by segment confirms a striking fact: electric cars depreciate faster than hybrids or thermal cars.

One-off rebound in the USA and underlying trend in Europe

While in the study data, electric vehicles recorded a +4.2% increase in value compared to August 2024, compared to only +0.9% for non-electric vehicles, which can be explained by the imminent end of tax credits in the USA, which artificially supported demand. In the long term, the depreciation of electric vehicles is much stronger. And European data confirms this. In July 2025, according to Cox Automotive Europe, electric vehicles less than two years old retained on average only 49% of their new price, compared to 68% for hybrids. For comparison, in 2022, the two technologies still displayed comparable residual values, close to 90%. The gap has therefore widened by around twenty points in just a few years, with the races having separated since January 2023.

The hybrid, a reassuring compromise

Cheaper to buy and more balanced in terms of running costs, hybrids are emerging as a haven in the used vehicle market. For Philip Nothard, Insight Director at Cox Automotive Europe, this resistance can be explained: “Hybrid vehicles offer an alternative and cost-effective solution for buyers concerned about sustainability but still hesitant about the range or infrastructure constraints of electric vehicles.” A trend that is reflected in sales: since the beginning of the year, registrations of plug-in hybrids have increased by 31.5%, and those of conventional hybrids by 6.5%. The Cox Automotive study, whether it covers the United States or Europe, highlights the same phenomenon. Residual value remains the Achilles heel of the electric vehicle and constitutes one of the obstacles to its adoption, while the hybrid is establishing itself as a more reassuring and more sustainable compromise for the used vehicle market.",https://autojosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/new_ev6_autojosh_6jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 03:58:49.715146

To promote hydrogen cars, Hyundai Motor provided 32 Nexo SUVs as protocol vehicles for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Energy Ministerial Meeting held in the southern port city of Busan last week.

""The rising sales of the Nexo, along with its use at international events, indicate hydrogen mobility is gradually becoming part of everyday life,"" a company official said.

Meanwhile, Hyundai Motor Group has decided to increase to $26 billion its investment commitment to the United States over the next four years, with a focus on steel, automobiles and robotics.

The investment, which was unveiled following President Lee Jae Myung's first summit with US President Donald Trump in Washington, marks a sharp rise from the $21 billion pledge made in March.

""Through the investment, Hyundai Motor Group will respond to US government policies and expand business opportunities in various areas to bolster its future competitiveness in areas including the mobility sector,"" the company said in a release.

Under the plan, Hyundai will build a steel plant in the US state of Louisiana with an annual production capacity of 2.7 million tons, providing quality low-carbon steel for key strategic industries.

Lawmakers gathered testimony, sought federal funding and considered creating a task force to combat coastal erosion.
Five years since the height of the crisis — with water levels now 6 inches below average — most Michigan communities still allow home construction perilously close to the shore.
The high water crisis forced local leaders to rethink those lax policies, said Herasanna Richards, a legislative associate at the Michigan Municipal League.
But, five years later, only a few of the state’s 387 coastal communities appear to have followed through.","Kathy and Tom Brickley knew erosion would be an immutable part of owning a property on Lake Michigan when they moved into their dream cottage 15 years ago.

For the first decade, the erosion caused by waves wearing away at beaches and dunes in annual cycles was manageable.

Then the water started rising.

Extreme rainfall and reduced evaporation during the 2010s caused the Great Lakes to rise to record-breaking levels by 2020, swallowing up beaches and digging away at the dunes behind them, threatening waterfront homes like the Brickleys’, which is in Berrien County.

“Plenty of sleepless nights,” Tom Brickley recalled while looking out at the water on a recent afternoon.

Back then, dramatic footage of homes tumbling into the water spurred calls to reform state and local policies that leave Michigan residents vulnerable when the waters rise.

Lawmakers gathered testimony, sought federal funding and considered creating a task force to combat coastal erosion. Local governments looked to replace outdated zoning rules that let people build too close to the shore. Experts suggested fixes, from giving property owners an incentive to move their homes farther inland to banning seawalls that ultimately worsen erosion.

But the political will for change seemed to recede with the water.

Five years since the height of the crisis — with water levels now 6 inches below average — most Michigan communities still allow home construction perilously close to the shore. Bills aiming to curb construction on coastal dunes or make it easier for homeowners to protect their homes with temporary barriers have failed to gain traction in the Legislature.

“The reality is that most townships have not implemented coastal erosion plans,” said Mark Breederland, who helps communities implement shoreline protection practices through Michigan Sea Grant.

The end result is that many communities that faced crisis during the last high-water event will be no better protected when the waters inevitably rise again.

“The state knows they’re probably not as prepared as they should be for the next cycle,” Breederland said. “But nobody knows when that will be, or how severe it will be.”

The high water also highlighted the divide between homeowners determined to protect their shores and experts who point out that the only long-term solution to erosion is retreating.

“The concept of giving the property to the grandchildren and having it go on is just not realistic in the Great Lakes or along the ocean,” said Guy Meadows, the director of the Great Lakes Research Center.

Short-term barriers criticized

The Brickleys made it through the erosion crisis with the help of large sand-filled tubes placed at the edge of their property to keep waves from scouring out their lawn.

Now they’re fighting with the state over whether those tubes can remain in place now that the waves pose no immediate danger.

Amid the crisis, thousands of waterfront property owners received state permits to fortify their shores with sand tubes, seawalls and riprap.

“Everybody’s breathing a sigh of relief,” Kathy Brickley said. “However, we all know that eventually the water is going to go back up.”

It provided short-term protection for those properties, but in the long run will only worsen erosion by deflecting wave energy onto neighboring shores. Those defenses can also block public access to the shoreline by burying beaches under an artificial barrier.

“Armoring is, at best, a temporary type of fix that ultimately will fail,” said Wendy Rampson, the director of programs and outreach for the Michigan Association of Planning.

Long-term fixes

Planning experts said the long-term solution is to strengthen shoreline development policies to keep people from building homes dangerously close to shore.

Along the vast majority of Michigan’s 3,288-mile coast, state law allows property owners to build right up to where water regularly reaches, called the “ordinary high water mark.”

About 250 miles of shoreline designated by the state to be at high risk of significant erosion or sensitive coastal dunes are more tightly regulated. There, property owners need prior approval from the state for activities like building a deck, installing a fence or expanding a driveway.

Outside those lands, any additional regulation is up to local governments, which have historically taken a hands-off approach.

The high water crisis forced local leaders to rethink those lax policies, said Herasanna Richards, a legislative associate at the Michigan Municipal League.

But, five years later, only a few of the state’s 387 coastal communities appear to have followed through. The planning association's Rampson put it at “maybe a dozen.”

Among them is Saugatuck Township, on the Lake Michigan shoreline, which restricts the size of new shoreline homes and requires them to be far enough inland so it would take 60 years of erosion for the waves to reach them.

Lax development policies worked in an earlier era, when Michigan’s coast was dotted with small cottages that could be easily moved inland if erosion worsened, said Saugatuck Township Manager Daniel DeFranco.

But the unmovable mansions that have proliferated along the shoreline in recent years often come with “invasive building practices” that destabilize bluffs, DeFranco said.

In Chikaming Township, near Bridgman, officials banned hard armoring and implemented a 150-foot setback for new shoreline developments.

“We didn’t want to become a community of solid, hardened shoreline,” said Chikaming Township Supervisor David Bunte.

One possible reason other communities have not followed suit: Short-staffed local governments may hesitate to take on the time-consuming and logistically and politically complex process.

In Lake Charter Township, where the Brickleys have their cottage, the local government doesn’t have a specialized setback for lakefront lots, instead using a standard 25-foot setback from the ordinary high water mark unless a lot is in an area tightly regulated by the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.

That hasn’t seemed to cause any issues, said Building Administrator Rich Kubsch, particularly because there are only one or two undeveloped lots on the lakefront where the setback would apply.

“It’s just not something that comes up a lot,” Kubsch added.

Over the past five years, EGLE has doled out $4 million to dozens of communities and organizations interested in better protecting their coastlines.

But not every community that engages with the program sees the process through to completion, said Adam Arend, the coastal community development coordinator for EGLE.

“Sometimes we’re able to capture a moment in time where the community is really interested,” Arend said. “And sometimes communities are just less interested and more focused on other issues.”

But after three days of travel, the driver came back to find that a rear door had been keyed.

""Someone had to go to a lot of effort to be purposefully damaging,"" the original poster wrote. ""I really don't get it.""

Electric vehicles have become more common on roads around the world. In 2020, fewer than 3.5 million EVs were sold globally, according to the International Energy Agency. This year, that number is expected to surpass 20 million.

But with that growth has come an increase in EV vandalism, which could deter people from switching from dirty fuel-burning, gas-powered cars. In one particularly brazen act, cameras caught a security guard urinating on a Tesla Model Y.

EV charging stations have also become popular targets for vandalism, as thieves sever the charging cables in an attempt to steal the copper within.

Some critics claim that EVs aren't any better for the environment than gas-powered vehicles (spoiler alert — they are). They often point to mining for EV battery materials and the pollution it causes, which, in reality, is a fraction of what's generated by digging for fossil fuels.

Some commenters were quick to blame fossil fuel supporters for much of the vitriol directed at EVs and their drivers.

""Oil and gas people hate electric cars,"" one wrote. ""They see them as the enemy, threatening their livelihood.""

One commenter, who said they have driven EVs for a decade, said many people have been upset with them because of their car choice. But most of the time, they added, it seems to come from a place of misunderstanding.

""It's always from people who are scared of EVs being mandated and eventually reducing their quality of life,"" the commenter wrote.

She expects there will be money left over after the laboratory improvement expenses to cover GEPA's operations for several years.
Redirecting the money will still require U.S. EPA approval.
GovGuam sought alternative ways to cover the agency's operational costs and was able to tap into U.S. EPA grant funding.
Lastimoza said GEPA provides vital services to the community that must be continued.","The Guam Environmental Protection Agency has enough federal grant funding in the bank to cover it's operations for the next three to four fiscal years, if it's allowed by the U.S. EPA to redirect the money, according to GEPA administrator Michelle Lastimoza.

She said the Trump administration cut off any further grant funding for GEPA beginning with fiscal year 2026, so the money in the bank may be the last GEPA receives for the foreseeable future.

""Four years ago, we were awarded a non competitive $45 million grant over five years, which is the Emerging Contaminant Small Disadvantaged Community grant from U.S. EPA,"" Lastimoza said, ""What we have in our accounts right now is three years of that five year grant with the expectation of year four coming next month.""

Lastimoza said GEPA will have about $35 million left, with the money intended to upgrade laboratory facilities to monitor for emerging contaminants such as heavy metals , or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, also known as ""forever chemicals.""

Lastimoza said the money is also meant to fund a new headquarters building but if the financial situation warrants it, they will ask to shift the funding elsewhere.

""Let's say that FY 26 rolls around and we don't have the funding to continue operations, we will redirect those funds, and still maybe upgrade our current laboratory so that we're not building a new building,"" she said.

""But we would request to redirect, to continue to fund salaries and operations for as long as we can, provided that emerging contaminant money goes towards laboratory capacity,"" Lastimoza added.

She expects there will be money left over after the laboratory improvement expenses to cover GEPA's operations for several years. It's annual budget is roughly $4 million for salaries, benefits, utilities, supplies, vehicle maintenance and equipment.

Redirecting the money will still require U.S. EPA approval. If it is denied GEPA will have to fall back on local funding, and Lastimoza said she has discussed that potential with Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero.

""I've spoken to the governor on whether or not we would request to go back to general funding if it came to that,"" Lastimoza said, ""Of course, we would have to prepare our budget, and we would have to go before the legislature.""

Lastimoza said the agency used to be funded by the general fund until it was stopped about fifteen years ago because of the government of Guam's severe financial constraints at the time.

GovGuam sought alternative ways to cover the agency's operational costs and was able to tap into U.S. EPA grant funding. That has covered operations ever since, until the Trump administration decided to eliminate the funding for fiscal year 2026.

In the meantime, Lastimoza said they are looking into other sources of funding such as increasing their fees.

""So we're looking at our fee schedule and adjusting it to make it more congruent to the work that's done,"" she said, ""For example, one permit in our solid waste program is $25 for five years no matter how many vehicles that company has to collect, whether it's like a fleet of one or a fleet of ten.""

Other potential revenue sources have been eyed, but have yet to push through.

""I know that in the past, legislation has been discussed about allocating funds from the use tax that would go into our environmental trust fund, and ... create a more sustainable local source of funding for Guam EPA, but that didn't pass,"" Lastimoza said.

""Maybe we need to work with our oversight (chairperson) to change language that wasn't acceptable. So that's still something that we'd like to pursue, is whether or not we could get a portion of the use tax,"" she said.

Lastimoza said GEPA provides vital services to the community that must be continued.

Her legislation would have required Edison and other investor-owned utilities to make a plan to remove decommissioned power lines across the state.
He said he was so “passionate” about SB 256 that he traveled to Sacramento earlier this year to speak in support of it, in particular the provision that would have required the removal of decommissioned power lines and infrastructure.
“Without this bill, I can’t think of another bill that really successfully addresses this specific issue of the decommissioned lines.
So it’s just extremely disappointing.” Pérez noted that utilities that had previously called for rejecting the bill formally withdrew their opposition in recent weeks.","A state bill that would have required Southern California Edison and other investor-owned utilities to take steps to avoid causing catastrophic wildfires died in Sacramento on Friday.

Sen. Sasha Renée Pérez’s (D-Pasadena) district includes Altadena, which was devastated by the Eaton fire in January.

She introduced SB 256 earlier this year to make power infrastructure more safe and less prone to starting wildfires, citing reporting in the Los Angeles Times about some investigators and experts’ concerns that a decommissioned power transmission line in Eaton Canyon may have been the fire’s ignition site.

That reporting also revealed that Edison knew that some of the electrical towers under investigation were long overdue for critical upkeep and were classified as an “ignition risk” in company records.

Her legislation would have required Edison and other investor-owned utilities to make a plan to remove decommissioned power lines across the state.

It would have also boosted “California’s electrical infrastructure and wildfire resilience by improving wildfire mitigation planning, enhancing emergency response efforts, undergrounding power lines, and requiring closer collaboration between utilities, emergency services and local communities to prevent wildfires,” according to an email from Jerome Parra, a spokesperson for the senator.

Pérez called the bill, which she wrote, her top legislative priority this year, and said its failure was “disappointing” given the stakes of the issue.

“I’m very frustrated because, when are we going to have accountability? When are we actually going to start reducing fire risk and ensuring utilities are reducing fire risk?” Pérez said in an interview.

Pérez also cited reporting in The Times in which Edison International Chief Executive Pedro Pizarro acknowledged that “the possibility that an idle, unconnected Southern California Edison transmission line somehow reengerized on Jan. 7 is ‘a leading hypothesis’ for what started the destructive Eaton fire.”

Brian Leventhal, a spokesperson for Edison, provided a brief statement on behalf of the company.

“We worked with the senator’s office, withdrew our opposition, and remain neutral,” he said.

Nic Arnzen’s home in Altadena was one of thousands destroyed during the Eaton fire. As vice chair of the Altadena Town Council and president of the Altadena Coalition of Neighborhood Assns, Arnzen represents many residents who lost loved ones, belongings and livelihoods to the fast-moving blaze.

He said he was so “passionate” about SB 256 that he traveled to Sacramento earlier this year to speak in support of it, in particular the provision that would have required the removal of decommissioned power lines and infrastructure. He too was dismayed to learn that it had died Friday before even a committee vote.

“I’m a person who lost our home, everything in our home, and I went up there because I believed that of all the bills … this got to the core of the issue,” Arnzen said in an interview. “Without this bill, I can’t think of another bill that really successfully addresses this specific issue of the decommissioned lines. So it’s just extremely disappointing.”

Pérez noted that utilities that had previously called for rejecting the bill formally withdrew their opposition in recent weeks. So she said she was “shocked” by its failure to move forward.

Pérez, who began her first term barely a month before the Eaton fire destroyed much of her district, said she had been told by veteran lawmakers that her legislation would be a “tough fight” given how powerful and influential utilities are. Given that there was no formal opposition to the bill, she said she is concerned that utilities engaged in “shadow lobbying” behind the scenes to ensure that legislators did not support it.

“The cost is negligible, there’s no registered opposition, I made it my No. 1 priority. Tell me what went on here,” she said. “I’m at a loss for words.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0788a0a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+266/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F82%2F41%2F3b0818ea49f697702ba9411a4d00%2Fla-photos-1staff-808095-la-me-sylmar-converter-station-power-grid-19-als.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 00:58:39.380934

Energy security isn’t some abstract concept — it’s the backbone of the nation’s strength, and we are risking it all chasing net-zero pipe dreams.

Common sense and numbers don’t lie. We can’t sacrifice reliable, homegrown power for unreliable wind, solar and batteries that cost a fortune and leave us vulnerable. It’s time to wake up before the lights go out and our energy costs skyrocket.

Let’s talk about China. While activists trip over themselves to “save the planet,” Beijing is playing a different game. In 2023, it added 500 terawatt-hours of new electricity generation, mostly from coal.

China is not slowing down. It knows cheap, reliable energy fuels its economy and global ambitions. Meanwhile, under the Joe Biden administration, we were stuck with energy policies that drove up our bills and made our grid shakier than a house of cards in a windstorm. Thankfully, the One Big Beautiful Bill ends $500 billion in wind and solar subsidies, just not fast enough.

Wind and solar? They sound great until you look at the real world. They aren’t just expensive; they’re destabilizing. Ask Californians about their sky-high electricity rates and shortages, or Texans about their blackout nightmares. When the wind stops or the sun sets, so does electricity.

We’re funding China’s coal empire by buying its solar panels, turbines and batteries. China uses more than half of the world’s 9 billion tons of coal, and it is building hundreds of coal plants that will last 50 years. India and Indonesia are doing the same.

The good news? The corporate green facade is starting to crack. Big Oil, Shell, BP and others used to play along, trumpeting climate pledges to keep the activists happy. Now, they’re backing off.

Shell is cutting wind and solar targets to focus on oil and gas profits. BP is slashing wind projects because the math doesn’t add up. Even Exxon is backing away from the net-zero hype. These aren’t eco-villains; they’re businesses realizing that gutting hydrocarbons, oil, natural gas and coal is economic suicide. Why don’t many of our politicians get it?

America has more coal than China. We’re sitting on enough to power industries for generations, yet we’re paying through the nose for electricity. Why? Because we’ve vilified coal and bet on “green” tech that comes from China.

Subsidizing solar panels and wind turbines made with low-cost coal, low labor costs, sometimes using slave labor, and few environmental protections isn’t just bad business; it’s bankrolling an authoritarian regime that’s building its military at an amazing clip and polluting the world.

Our tax dollars are propping up a regime that crushes dissent and eyes global control, all while many worry about “sustainability.”

We should protect our environment. But we have taken our eye off real conservation in favor of attempting to regulate the gas of life, carbon dioxide, out of existence. Carbon dioxide makes plants grow much better, greens our Earth, and is a gas that we each exhale about two pounds a day.

Energy security is national security. We need to lean into what works: coal, oil, natural gas and nuclear, sources that keep the lights on and the factories humming and transportation moving all the time, not just when the wind blows (32 percent of the time) and sun shines (20 percent of the time).

We must stop funneling money to China for tech that doesn’t deliver. Ditch the subsidies that make us weaker, and embrace the home-harvested energy that strengthens the economy and national security.

Net-zero might make for nice headlines, but in a world where power means survival, it’s a luxury we can’t afford. We’ve got the resources and the know-how to lead; let’s stop pretending and start acting like it.

Americans want electric grids that don’t flicker, where energy bills don’t take ever more from our wallets, and where we’re not at the mercy of rivals who don’t play fair. That starts with an energy policy grounded in reality, not fantasies. We are choosing strength over slogans and building a future that’s powered by us, for us.

Putting Americans and the country’s security ahead of the fantasies of controlling the weather by limiting the gas of life is the right direction for our country.

“The Administration is blatantly lying about the sourced facts of our dissent letter, and are now blatantly retaliating and infringing on our constitutional rights.,” says Michael Pasqua, an EPA employee who helps manage the safety of drinking water in Wisconsin and a signatory of the declaration.

During the first Trump administration—noted for the scandal-ridden tenure of Scott Pruitt as the EPA’s administrator between late February 2017 and early July 2018—the agency rolled back more than 100 environmental rules. Now that Trump has returned to office, the administration has moved to cut back federal solar and wind power initiatives, as well as more environmental rules. Across science agencies, the administration has fired employees and advisory panel members, stopped grants and issued policies at odds with scientific findings. In July Zeldin moved to revoke the “endangerment” finding that serves as the linchpin for U.S. climate regulation under a 2007 Supreme Court decision.

In response to such moves across science agencies, hundreds of EPA, NASA, National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation staffers have signed on to public letters of dissent, rare rebukes from traditionally reticent federal employees. The letters follow the administration moving to remove tens of thousands of federal employees from agencies. In February Trump mistakenly said during a cabinet meeting that the EPA would likely cut 65 percent of its staff because “a lot of people weren’t doing their job.” (White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers later corrected Trump to clarify that the agency was planning to cut 65 percent of its spending.)

More recently, in August, Federal Emergency Management Agency staffers released a “Katrina Declaration,” raising the alarm to Congress about spending restrictions, cuts to disaster prevention programs and “censorship” of climate and environmental science at the agency. Those moves all raised the chances of a disaster like 2005’s Hurricane Katrina catastrophe, which took an estimated 1,833 lives, they wrote.

Following a thorough internal investigation, EPA supervisors made decisions on an individualized basis,' an EPA spokeswoman said Friday in a statement.

The so-called declaration of dissent, signed by more than 170 employees in late June, contains inaccurate information designed to mislead the public about agency business,' spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said. Thankfully, this represents a small fraction of the thousands of hard-working, dedicated EPA employees who are not trying to mislead and scare the American public.

The EPA ""has a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November,' she added.

Vaseliou declined to say how many employees were disciplined, but the head of one of the agency's largest unions said at least six probationary employees who signed the letter were fired, along with at least two career employees.

The union, part of the American Federation of Government Employees, condemned the firings, which come after 139 workers were put on administrative leave shortly after signing the dissent declaration. The EPA at the time accused employees of unlawfully undermining the Trump administration's agenda.

The Trump administration and EPA's retaliatory actions against these workers was clearly an assault on labor and free-speech rights,' said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA employees.

More than 150 workers who were disciplined up to and including being fired included scientists, engineers, lawyers, contract officers, emergency response personnel and a whole host of other jobs, Chen told the Associated Press. They live and work in communities around the country, and all believe in the mission of the agency to protect human health and the environment on behalf of the American public."" In a letter made public June 30, the employees wrote that the EPA is no longer living up to its mission to protect human health and the environment. The letter represented rare public criticism from agency employees who knew they could face retaliation for speaking out against a weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science.

Employees at other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and Federal Emergency Management Agency, have issued similar statements. Some FEMA employees who signed a public letter of dissent earlier this week were put on administrative leave Tuesday, according to documents reviewed by The Associated Press.

More than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed the letter made public Monday. The statement criticizes recent cuts to agency staff and programs and warns that FEMA's capacity to respond to a major disaster is dangerously diminished.

The EPA said last month it is eliminating its research and development arm and reducing agency staff by thousands of employees.

This isn’t just about British households or American politics—it’s about how we respond to one of the defining challenges of our time, and the dangerous consequences of getting it wrong.

[https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/news/nation/2025/08/27/offshore-wind-derailed-trump-administration/85846293007/]

The Inconvenient Truth About Energy Economics

The data tells a clear story that political rhetoric cannot obscure. UK energy bills have indeed risen sharply, but the primary culprit isn’t the whir of wind turbines—it’s the volatility of fossil fuel markets. When Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent natural gas prices soaring globally, countries heavily dependent on gas-fired power plants felt the shock immediately. The UK, despite its impressive wind capacity, still relies on gas for roughly 40% of its electricity generation and nearly 85% of home heating.

The economic reality is stark: onshore wind now costs approximately $26-50 per megawatt hour globally, while natural gas power generation ranges from $45-74 per MWh—and that’s before factoring in the price volatility that can double or triple costs overnight. The International Renewable Energy Agency reports that renewable electricity generation capacity added in 2023 will save the world at least $11 billion annually in fuel costs.

Meanwhile, wind power has provided something invaluable during this crisis: stability. Long-term contracts for wind energy, typically locked in at fixed prices for 15-25 years, have shielded consumers from some of the worst price spikes. Had the UK built even more renewable capacity over the past decade—matching Denmark’s achievement of generating over 50% of electricity from wind—households would be facing significantly lower bills today, not higher ones.

The Hidden Costs of Energy Dependence

What Trump’s analysis conveniently omits is the staggering cost of energy insecurity. The UK spends approximately £40 billion annually on energy imports, money that flows directly to fossil fuel exporters rather than supporting domestic jobs and economic growth. Compare this to Denmark, which not only meets its own electricity needs with wind but exports surplus power to neighboring countries, generating revenue rather than hemorrhaging it.

The employment picture tells an equally compelling story. The global wind industry now employs over 1.4 million people, with jobs that cannot be outsourced—wind turbines must be maintained where they’re installed. In contrast, oil and gas employment has been declining for decades due to automation and cyclical downturns, shedding over 200,000 jobs in the U.S. alone since 2014.

Energy as Geopolitical Weapon

The recent energy crisis exposed a truth that military strategists have long understood: energy dependence is a national security vulnerability. Russia’s weaponization of natural gas supplies demonstrated how autocratic regimes can hold democratic nations hostage through energy blackmail. Putin’s ability to manipulate European energy markets was possible only because those markets remained tethered to fossil fuel imports.

NATO’s former Supreme Allied Commander, Admiral James Stavridis, has called renewable energy “a national security imperative,” noting that every solar panel and wind turbine reduces dependence on unstable regimes. The Pentagon’s own assessments identify climate change as a “threat multiplier” that exacerbates conflicts and instability worldwide—conflicts that inevitably disrupt fossil fuel supplies and spike energy prices.

Countries that have achieved high renewable energy penetration—like Costa Rica, which runs on nearly 100% renewable electricity, or Norway, which generates 95% of its power from hydroelectric sources—demonstrate remarkable resilience to global energy shocks. They’ve effectively insulated their citizens from the price manipulation and supply disruptions that plague fossil fuel markets.

A Global Pattern of Misdirection

This blame-shifting isn’t unique to the UK or Trump’s rhetoric. Across the world, as energy costs have risen due to geopolitical instability and fossil fuel market manipulation, politicians have found it easier to point fingers at solar panels and wind turbines than to acknowledge their own failures to diversify energy supplies fast enough.

In Germany, critics blamed the country’s renewable transition for industrial challenges, conveniently ignoring how Russian gas dependency—not solar installations—created the real vulnerability. When winter energy prices spiked 300% in 2022, it was due to reduced Russian imports, not increased renewables capacity. German renewable energy actually prevented costs from rising even higher.

In Texas, wind turbines were scapegoated for the February 2021 grid failures that left millions without power. The reality? Natural gas wells and pipelines froze, accounting for nearly twice as much lost capacity as frozen wind turbines. Coal plants also failed en masse due to inadequate winterization—a finding confirmed by multiple independent investigations.

The pattern extends globally. In Australia, renewable energy has been blamed for grid instability despite the Australian Energy Market Operator confirming that coal plant failures caused the majority of supply interruptions. In South Africa, politicians blamed solar installations for grid problems while ignoring decades of underinvestment in coal infrastructure maintenance.

The Technology Reality Check

Critics often attack renewables with outdated assumptions about grid stability and intermittency. Modern grid management systems, powered by artificial intelligence and advanced weather forecasting, can now predict wind and solar generation with 95% accuracy up to 72 hours in advance. Battery storage costs have plummeted 85% since 2010, making large-scale energy storage economically viable.

The grid stability argument falls apart under scrutiny. Studies by grid operators worldwide consistently show that renewable energy integration improves rather than degrades system reliability. Wind and solar installations respond to grid disturbances in milliseconds—far faster than traditional fossil fuel plants that require minutes or hours to adjust output.

Real-world examples abound: South Australia, which generates over 70% of its electricity from renewables, has actually improved grid reliability since transitioning away from coal. The state that was once mocked for blackouts now exports its expertise in renewable grid integration globally.

The Accelerating Climate Bill

While politicians argue over quarterly bill fluctuations, the physical world continues delivering increasingly expensive climate bills. The summer of 2024 brought record-breaking temperatures, devastating floods, and unprecedented wildfires across multiple continents. Hurricane damage alone in 2024 exceeded $100 billion in the United States. European floods caused over €40 billion in damages.

These aren’t future costs—they’re present-day economic realities. The insurance industry, guided by actuarial science rather than political convenience, has been raising premiums and withdrawing coverage from climate-vulnerable areas for years. Lloyd’s of London estimates that climate change adds $23 billion annually to global catastrophic losses.

The stranded asset risks are mounting rapidly. Carbon Tracker estimates that $1.3 trillion in oil and gas assets could become worthless as the world transitions to clean energy. Coal plants are already being retired early across the globe as they become uneconomical compared to renewables. The International Energy Agency projects that demand for fossil fuels will peak before 2030—leaving countries that fail to diversify their energy systems holding increasingly worthless infrastructure.

International Competition and Economic Leadership

Perhaps most dangerously, the wind power blame game distracts from a crucial geopolitical reality: the clean energy transition is happening with or without Western leadership, and China is winning the race. China now manufactures over 60% of the world’s solar panels, 50% of wind turbines, and 70% of lithium batteries. Chinese companies are rapidly expanding across Africa, Latin America, and Asia, building the energy infrastructure that will define the next century’s economic relationships.

While American and European politicians debate whether renewables cause high energy bills, Chinese renewable energy companies are creating facts on the ground. China installed more solar capacity in 2023 than the entire world had built by 2017. This isn’t just about environmental leadership—it’s about economic and technological dominance in the industries that will define the 21st century economy.

The European Union recognizes this challenge, announcing the Green Deal Industrial Plan with hundreds of billions in clean energy investments. The United States responded with the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest climate investment in American history. Countries that continue relitigating whether renewables are economically viable risk being left behind in a technological revolution that’s accelerating regardless of their participation.

The Working Family Case for Wind Power

Beyond the macro-economics and geopolitics lies a simple truth that resonates with working families worldwide: renewable energy democratizes power generation. Unlike oil wells or gas deposits that concentrate wealth in the hands of a few resource owners, wind and solar can be deployed almost anywhere, keeping energy dollars in local communities.

Rural communities hosting wind farms receive hundreds of millions in annual lease payments, property taxes, and local jobs. In Iowa, where wind generates over 60% of electricity, rural landowners earn more than $25 million annually in wind lease payments while continuing to farm around the turbines. These aren’t temporary construction jobs—they’re permanent positions maintaining infrastructure that will operate for 25-30 years.

The distributed nature of renewable energy also provides resilience that centralized fossil fuel systems cannot match. When Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico’s centralized grid in 2017, communities with distributed solar and battery systems maintained power throughout the crisis. Microgrids powered by renewables are increasingly recognized as essential infrastructure for climate resilience.

Conservative Arguments for Energy Independence

The case for renewable energy shouldn’t be viewed through a partisan lens. Conservative principles of national strength, economic independence, and technological leadership all point toward accelerating the clean energy transition.

Energy independence has been a bipartisan American goal for decades, yet the country continues importing millions of barrels of oil daily from regions of questionable stability and values. Wind and solar offer true energy independence—powered by resources that cannot be manipulated by foreign adversaries or cartel pricing.

The military case is equally compelling. Forward operating bases powered by solar microgrids reduce vulnerable fuel supply convoys—a leading cause of military casualties in recent conflicts. The Department of Defense has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, not from environmental activism but from operational necessity.

Fiscal conservatives should embrace technologies that eliminate ongoing fuel costs forever. Once built, wind and solar installations generate electricity at near-zero marginal cost for decades, providing long-term price certainty that fossil fuels cannot match.

The Path Forward: Investment, Not Obstruction

Rather than relitigating the false choice between economic prosperity and environmental protection, we need leaders who understand that energy security and climate action are the same fight. The solution to volatile energy bills isn’t fewer wind turbines—it’s more of them, paired with expanded grid storage, improved transmission infrastructure, and policies that accelerate rather than obstruct the clean energy transition.

The UK’s recent experience offers a crucial lesson for the world: countries that bet their energy future on fossil fuels will continue experiencing the price volatility and supply insecurity that come with that choice. Those that invest boldly in renewables will enjoy the twin benefits of lower costs, enhanced security, and a more stable climate.

The numbers are overwhelming. The International Energy Agency’s latest scenarios show that achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 requires global clean energy investment to triple to $4 trillion annually by 2030. This isn’t a cost—it’s the largest economic opportunity in human history, creating tens of millions of jobs while avoiding trillions in climate damages.

Countries and regions that position themselves at the forefront of this transition will reap enormous economic benefits. Those that resist it will find themselves increasingly isolated, economically disadvantaged, and vulnerable to the growing costs of climate change and energy insecurity.

A Choice That Defines Our Future

President Trump’s wind power claims will fade from headlines, but the choice they represent will define the coming decades. We can continue allowing political convenience to override scientific evidence and economic reality, or we can acknowledge what the data has long shown: renewable energy isn’t the cause of our energy challenges—it’s the solution.

The wind isn’t responsible for high energy bills. Our failure to harness enough of it is. Every day we delay is another day we remain vulnerable to the price shocks, supply disruptions, and climate damages that are the true legacy of fossil fuel dependence.

The transition to clean energy is not a future possibility—it’s a present reality happening at unprecedented speed. The only question is whether we’ll lead it or be left behind by it. The answer will determine not just our energy bills, but our economic prosperity, national security, and the planet we leave for future generations.

The choice is ours, but time is not unlimited. The wind is blowing—literally and figuratively. The question is whether we’ll catch it or let it pass us by.",https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/blogs/uploads/users/image-11733199174-400x400.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 23:58:06.262496

### Tax Credits and Eligibility The recent changes in tax policy have led to the tax credit for new and used EVs expiring by the month’s end.
It’s essential to be aware that not all vehicles qualify for the tax credit.
Notably, leasing new EVs offers a significant advantage; all leases qualify for the $7,500 tax credit, regardless of the buyer’s tax circumstances.
Models like the Chevrolet Bolt, Nissan Leaf, and Tesla Model 3 are popular among used car buyers.","As the end-of-summer holiday car shopping season approaches, many buyers are racing to take advantage of the federal electric-vehicle tax credit, which is set to expire at the end of September. This urgency could lead to increased activity over the Labor Day weekend and throughout the month. However, prospective buyers are urged to prepare thoroughly before visiting any dealership.

To maximize your chances of securing the best deal on an electric vehicle (EV), understanding several intertwined factors is crucial. This includes assessing eligibility for tax credits, defining budget limits for monthly payments, and determining the total purchase cost.

### Tax Credits and Eligibility

The recent changes in tax policy have led to the tax credit for new and used EVs expiring by the month’s end. Originally introduced under the Biden administration, this credit enabled buyers to save up to $7,500 on new EVs and $4,000 on specific used models. These credits are designed to provide a substantial discount at the point of sale, making it imperative for interested buyers to act quickly.

It’s essential to be aware that not all vehicles qualify for the tax credit. Factors influencing eligibility include battery sourcing, production location, and vehicle pricing. Buyers should refer to a list of qualifying EVs and be mindful of IRS income thresholds, which limit eligibility for certain purchasers. The tax credits are capped at $80,000 for vans, SUVs, and trucks, and $55,000 for other types of vehicles. For budget-conscious buyers, the credit is available for used EVs priced below $25,000, but eligibility is restricted by income.

Some dealerships will handle the application process for tax credits directly at the sale, while others may require buyers to manage the paperwork on their own. It’s advisable for shoppers to verify the experience and willingness of dealers to facilitate this process.

Notably, leasing new EVs offers a significant advantage; all leases qualify for the $7,500 tax credit, regardless of the buyer’s tax circumstances. However, this benefit will also disappear after the end of September.

### The Benefits of Leasing

Currently, leasing is seen as more advantageous than purchasing for new EVs. Many manufacturers offer enticing “lease specials,” but buyers should scrutinize these deals for hidden costs. While low advertised monthly payments can be attractive, they often require substantial upfront payments, which can negate the benefit. It is often recommended to either make minimal upfront payments or none at all to avoid risking that amount if the leased vehicle is in an accident.

Before heading to the dealership, potential lessees should compare advertisements and calculate the “effective monthly payment” to better evaluate costs against the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP). For example, comparing the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and the Kia EV6 illustrates significant differences in total lease costs, highlighting the importance of thorough analysis.

### Considerations for Hybrid and Plug-in Models

For those who may not have access to home charging or prefer a transitional vehicle, hybrids and plug-in hybrids could be more suitable. While fully electrified vehicles are generally more favorable for leasing, hybrid models might present better purchasing options. The Honda Civic Hybrid, for instance, offers competitive pricing but leasing may not be as financially prudent given its strong residual value.

### Exploring the Used Car Market

With numerous compelling choices in the used EV market, shoppers can find excellent deals, particularly in the $30,000 to $35,000 range. The tax credit applies to EVs priced under $25,000, provided they are at least two years old. Models like the Chevrolet Bolt, Nissan Leaf, and Tesla Model 3 are popular among used car buyers.

When seeking used EVs, potential buyers should pivot their strategy compared to new car shopping, as dealers may be less flexible on pricing. Focusing on value rather than seeking the highest discount can lead to better outcomes.

### Final Thoughts

As deadlines loom and potential price hikes due to tariffs are anticipated, there has never been a better time to consider buying or leasing an EV or hybrid vehicle. Detailed price comparisons and a willingness to explore options beyond local markets can yield significant savings. With an informed approach, buyers can navigate these changes and emerge successfully with their next vehicle purchase.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tips-for-Car-Buyers-Ahead-of-Electric-Vehicle-Tax-Credit.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 11:00:03.310386

The New York Post first reported the pocket rescission.","MAKASSAR, Indonesia: At least three people were killed by a fire started by protesters at a council building in eastern Indonesia’s Makassar city, a local official told AFP Saturday, after demonstrations across the country following the death of a motorcycle taxi driver hit by a police vehicle.

The country was rocked by protests across major cities including the capital Jakarta on Friday, after footage spread of a gig motorcycle driver being run over by a police tactical vehicle in earlier rallies over low wages and perceived lavish perks for lawmakers.

Protests in Makassar descended into chaos outside the provincial and local city council buildings, both set on fire and vehicles set ablaze as protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails.

Three people were killed as a result of the fire at the Makassar city council building, its secretary Rahmat Mappatoba said.

“They were trapped in the burning building,” he said, accusing protesters of storming the office to set the building on fire.

“This is beyond our prediction, usually during a demonstration, protesters only threw rocks or burn a tire in front of the office. They never stormed into the building or burned it.”

Two of the victims were staff at the local council and another was a civil servant. Two died at the scene while one died in hospital.

At least four people were injured in the fire and are being treated at hospital, the official said.

The fire has since been extinguished. Images showed the provincial council building ablaze overnight.

Protesters at the South Sulawesi provincial council building tried to knock down the gate and storm in.

In the capital Jakarta, hundreds massed outside the headquarters of the elite Mobile Brigade Corp. (Brimob) paramilitary police unit they blamed for motorcycle gig driver Affan Kuniawan’s death, throwing firecrackers as police responded with tear gas.

A group of protesters tried to tear down the gates of the unit, notorious for its heavy-handed tactics, and pulled a sign from the building’s facade in chaotic scenes.

Police said they had detained seven officers for questioning in connection with the driver’s death.

The protests were the biggest and most violent of Prabowo Subianto’s presidency, a key test less than a year into his rule that forced him to quickly urge calm, order an investigation and visit the family of the slain driver.

He has pledged fast, state-driven growth but he had already faced protests for widespread government budget cuts to fund his populist policies including a billion-dollar free meal program.

Protests also spread to other major cities on Friday in Indonesia, including Yogyakarta, Bandung, Semarang and Surabaya in Java and Medan in North Sumatra province.

SEOUL: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met with the families of soldiers killed fighting for Russia against Ukraine and offered condolences for their “unbearable pain,” state media said Saturday.

Pyongyang has not confirmed the number of its soldiers that died fighting for Russia, though Seoul estimates around 600, with thousands more wounded.

South Korean and Western intelligence agencies have said the North sent more than 10,000 soldiers to Russia in 2024 — primarily to the Kursk region — along with artillery shells, missiles and long-range rocket systems.

Kim delivered a speech to the families on Friday, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported, after meeting with only some of them last week at another public ceremony awarding honors to the soldiers.

“I thought a lot about other martyrs’ families who were not present there. So, I had this meeting arranged as I wanted to meet and console the bereaved families of all the heroes and relieve them of their sorrow and anguish even a little,” Kim said in his speech, according to KCNA.

He pledged to erect a monument in the capital as well as a new street for the bereaved families, while the state would give full support to the troop’s children.

“My heart breaks and aches more at the sight of those little children,” he said.

“I, our state and our army will take full responsibility for them and train them admirably as staunch and courageous fighters like their fathers,” he added.

North Korea only confirmed it had deployed troops to support Russia’s war in Ukraine in April and admitted that its soldiers had been killed in combat.

At the ceremony last week, images released by KCNA showed an emotional Kim embracing a returned solider who appeared overwhelmed, burying his face in the leader’s chest.

The leader was also seen kneeling before a portrait of a fallen soldier to pay his respects and placing medals and flowers beside images of the dead.

In early July, state media again showed a visibly emotional Kim honoring flag-draped coffins, apparently of the deceased soldiers returning home.

WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump has told House Speaker Mike Johnson that he won’t be spending $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid, effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.

Trump, who sent a letter to Johnson on Thursday, is using what’s known as a pocket rescission — when a president submits a request to Congress to not spend approved funds toward the end of the fiscal year, so Congress cannot act on the request in a 45-day timeframe and the money goes unspent as a result. It’s the first time in nearly 50 years a president has used one. The fiscal year draws to a close at the end of September.

The letter was posted Friday morning on the X account of the White House Office of Management and Budget. It said the funding would be cut from the State Department and the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, an early target of Trump’s efforts to cut foreign aid.

If the White House standardizes this move, the president could effectively bypass Congress on key spending choices and potentially throw into disarray efforts in the House and the Senate to keep the government funded when the next fiscal year starts in October.

The use of a pocket rescission fits part a broader pattern by the Trump administration to exact greater control over the US government, eroding the power of Congress and agencies such as the Federal Reserve and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, among others. The administration has already fired federal workers and imposed a historic increase in tariffs without going through Congress, putting the burden on the judicial branch to determine the limits of presidential power.

A White House official, who insisted on anonymity on a call with reporters to discuss the move, declined to say how the administration might use pocket rescissions in the coming years or what the upper limits of it might be as a tool. The official expressed confidence the administration would prevail in any legal challenges and said a goal of the proposed spending cuts was to make the cleanest case possible for these types of clawbacks.

Winding down USAID

Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted on X that USAID is essentially being shuttered and congratulated White House budget director Russ Vought for managing the process.

“USAID is officially in close out mode,” Rubio said. “Russ is now at the helm to oversee the closeout of an agency that long ago went off the rails.”

The 1974 Impoundment Control Act gives the president the authority to propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Congress can within 45 days vote on pulling back the funds or sustaining them, but by proposing the rescission so close to Sept. 30 the White House argues that the money won’t be spent and the funding lapses.

What was essentially the last pocket rescission occurred in 1977 by Democratic then-President Jimmy Carter, and the Trump administration argues it’s a legally permissible tool despite some murkiness as Carter had initially proposed the clawback well ahead of the 45-day deadline.

Pushback against pocket rescissions

The move by the Trump administration drew immediate backlash in parts of the Senate over its legality.

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said in a statement that the Constitution “makes clear that Congress has the responsibility for the power of the purse” and any effort to claw back funds “without congressional approval is a clear violation of the law.”

“Instead of this attempt to undermine the law, the appropriate way is to identify ways to reduce excessive spending through the bipartisan, annual appropriations process,” Collins said. Congress approves rescissions regularly as part of this process.”

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York warned that Trump’s use of the pocket veto could undermine the normal funding process and risk “a painful and entirely unnecessary shutdown.” After all, any budget agreements reached in the Senate could lack authority if the Trump White House has the power to withhold spending as it sees fit.

Schumer said in a statement that Republican leaders have yet to meet with Democrats on a path to fund the government after the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30 just as Trump tries an “unlawful gambit to circumvent the Congress all together.”

“But if Republicans are insistent on going it alone, Democrats won’t be party to their destruction,” Schumer said.

‘No exceptions’

Eloise Pasachoff, a Georgetown University law professor and expert on federal spending issues, has written that the Impoundment Control Act allows rescissions only if Congress acts within 45 days, meaning the the White House alone cannot decide to not spend the funds.

“This mandatory language admits no exceptions, indicating that Congress expects the funds to be used as intended before the end of the fiscal year if it does not approve the proposed rescission,” Pasachoff wrote in an academic paper last year.

What’s in the funding?

The funds in the pocket rescission package include $3.2 billion in development assistance grants, $520 million for the United Nations, $838 million for international peacekeeping operations and $322 million to encourage democratic values in other countries.

Trump had previously sought to get congressional backing for rescissions and succeeded in doing so in July when the House and the Senate approved $9 billion worth of cuts. Those rescissions clawed back funding for public broadcasting and foreign aid.

The Trump administration has made deep reductions to foreign aid one of its hallmark policies, despite the relatively meager savings relative to the deficit and possible damage to America’s reputation abroad as foreign populations lose access to food supplies and development programs.

In February, the administration said it would eliminate almost all of USAID’s foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall assistance abroad. USAID has since been dismantled, and its few remaining programs have been placed under State Department control.

The Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court on Wednesday to stop lower court decisions that had preserved foreign aid, including for global health and HIV and AIDS programs, that Trump has tried to freeze. But on Friday, the administration withdrew its appeal to the Supreme Court, after a favorable appeals court ruling late Thursday.

With Evanston’s power aggregation agreement with Chicago-based MC Squared Energy Services expiring next year, the city is developing a Request for Proposals from potential providers, and staff asked the board to weigh in on what it would like to see in the next agreement.

That included a discussion on how the the city should approach Renewable Energy Credits (RECs), which give cities the opportunity to buy renewable energy production elsewhere to offset some of their own carbon footprint. The board largely supported continuing to purchase credits, but some members disagreed on where the city should buy them.

The board also discussed future agenda items and what kind of policies it wants to develop and recommend to City Council. All members in attendance offered ideas, and, after some back and forth, they agreed to pare down the list to a series of top priorities at the Sept. 25 meeting.

At that meeting, Evanston Transportation and Mobility Coordinator Sarah FioRito will update the board on public transit, and at the October meeting, Senior Project Manager Bridget Nash will give an update on the city’s Stormwater Master Plan.

The future of RECs

RECs are certificates showing that a utility plant generated one megawatt of electricity from renewable energy, such as solar or wind power. By buying RECs, municipalities like Evanston pay utilities for generating electricity from renewable sources, even if they don’t necessarily get that energy themselves.

Cara Pratt, the city’s sustainability and resilience manager, said Evanston has been buying RECs since 2012, applying them to the electricity that Evanstonians get through MC Squared. The purchases have largely funded wind power generated by Midwestern utilities, according to Pratt.

Board member David Karnes said he would favor branching out beyond that, so “we get more bang for our buck in cheaper markets.”

Gennifer Geer, another board member, said she was worried that “by buying RECs from a state with less sustainability-friendly policies,” Evanston would be “encouraging that type of policy,” mentioning Texas as an example. Board member Gul Agha, though, responded that “the money isn’t going to Texas.”

“What it’s doing is subsidizing the cost for renewable energy,” he said.

Future agenda items

Toward the end of the meeting, board co-chair Paula Scholl summarized some of the policy recommendations that came up at previous meetings and some ideas of her own.

Most notably, she mentioned a presentation on the environmental justice work that the Gichigamiin Indigenous Nations Museum has been doing, a discussion of how the city can better “infuse” climate goals into city operations, having the city’s new forestry supervisor Tom Ianetti talk about his plans and weighing in on the Envision Evanston zoning code rewrite.

At their last meeting before departing for college, Jexa Edinberg said they’d like to see the board build relationships with natural area stewards and also in District 65 schools.

Board member Anusha Kumar said she wants the board to look into subsidies to help middle- and low-income homeowners make their houses more energy efficient.

Agha added that he’d like to see the City Council adopt two new environmental policies — a food composting mandate and a requirement that developments that need zoning approval show their projected carbon footprint.

Geer said she would like a composting ordinance, too, plus a lakefront protection ordinance, an idea that’s been discussed for the past 15 years but never adopted. She also suggested an update to the 2009 Evanston Multi-Modal Transportation Plan.

Pratt replied that this was something FioRito and the city’s Bureau of Capital Planning and Engineering has been quietly working on, and that FioRito could discuss it at next month’s meeting.

Olin Wilson-Thomas, an Evanston Township High School student and board member, said he’d like to look into getting rid of parking minimums, an item discussed before he was appointed to the board.

Grant said she didn’t know much about the air quality issues on the east side.
For other attendees, such as Duane Daniels, the EGLE meeting didn’t offer much new information.","When Jameella Grant moved into her home on Detroit’s east side a few years ago, she said she was happy to find a quiet and affordable place to rent.

What she didn’t expect was the lingering cough she developed.

On Wednesday, Grant and other east side residents listened as staff members from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy’s Air Quality Division broke down the state agency’s air quality enforcement, monitoring, and permitting processes in a community learning session.

The event comes nearly a year after an informal resolution with the Environmental Protection Agency of a 2021 civil rights complaint against the state regulator that found EGLE violated the EPA’s Title VI protections when it approved a permit for the Stellantis Detroit Assembly Complex – Mack.

As part of the resolution, EGLE said it would hold several discussions, including an informational meeting with the community surrounding the Stellantis facility.

The agreement does not include an admission of wrongdoing or future actions beyond holding conversations and providing summaries of the conversations to the EPA.

EGLE staff told Planet Detroit ahead of Wednesday’s meeting at the Wayne County Community College District’s Eastern Campus that it is one of many steps the agency has planned to improve communication and transparency with residents and advocacy groups.

“Although it’s tied with some of these Title VI events that happened in the past, we are looking at this through the lens of how we can actually make this productive for us here at EGLE, but mostly for community members,” said Jenifer Dixon, planning and policy coordinator at EGLE’s Air Quality Division.

Air quality info ‘something I can take back to my community’

Grant, who lives on Beniteau Street, directly across from the Stellantis Mack plant, said she gained some useful information from the session.

“It was very detailed,” she told Planet Detroit. “I didn’t know what to expect, but once I got here, I was like, ‘OK, I needed this, and this is something I can take back to my community and my block club.’”

The community event included resource tables run by community organizations such as JustAir and Detroit Area Disaster Recovery Group, as well as representatives from Detroit’s Office of Sustainability and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

Grant said she didn’t know much about the air quality issues on the east side. Before moving to Beniteau, she lived for nearly two decades in Warren.

“When you’re living across Eight Mile, you don’t think about that kind of stuff,” she said. “They do talk about it, but I really didn’t pay attention.”

When she developed a persistent cough, Grant said she started seeing an ear, nose, and throat doctor.

“At first I was like, it’s allergies, and that’s what they kept saying,” said Grant. “But I’m like, it’s three years later, I am still coughing, what is wrong?”

Most of the Stellantis Mack plant’s violations are for odors, which can cause headaches, nausea, and irritation, and can suggest there may be harmful airborne chemicals. The facility has received eight violations from EGLE since it began operation as an assembly plant in 2021.

For other attendees, such as Duane Daniels, the EGLE meeting didn’t offer much new information. The disabled combat veteran has lived on Bewick Street, less than 1 mile from the Stellantis plant, for more than a decade.

Daniels came to the meeting with concerns around the city’s community benefits agreement with Stellantis. The automaker is providing roughly $5 million in home repair grants for residents living near the Mack Avenue facility, but some residents like Daniels were excluded due to an income requirement, he said.

Every resident, Daniels said, is paying the price for the automaker’s emissions.

“If a person comes down with an injury from the polluter, from Stellantis, they have to pay with their own health insurance. They’re not getting reimbursed. So how come they don’t have a fund for the people in the impact zone?”

Robert Shobe, a longtime Beniteau Street resident, attended Wednesday’s meeting. He’s been a vocal advocate against Stellantis and the noxious fumes coming from its factory, but in the months since the Title VI resolution between the EPA and EGLE, he said he’s mostly kept himself indoors.

“There’s more things going on with me than there had been, but I stay out of that air most of the time,” Shobe said. He has an air purifier in his house, and avoids doing too much yardwork in the summer, but said he still finds himself experiencing “issues with my eyes and my throat on a daily basis” on top of living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.

“They haven’t resolved the situation,” he said. “The only thing they’ve done is create more pollution, and they’re allowing them to put something in the stack like Febreze, to keep you from smelling the actual scent.”

Stellantis spokesperson Jodi Tinson told Planet Detroit that numerous local, state, and federal agencies tested the air in the neighborhood and found it “meets all health-based screening standards and is well below the levels that are considered harmful” in federal standards and Michigan Air Toxics Screening Levels.

Ambient air data collected at an onsite monitoring station shows the neighborhood’s air is “consistent with other areas of the city,” Tinson said.

A second regenerative thermal oxidizer was installed at the auto plant in 2023, Tinson said, adding that EGLE has conducted inspections based on odor complaints and has not confirmed a nuisance odor.

“The company is monitoring for odors to confirm the system is addressing this concern and also has not detected any nuisance odors.”

The neighborhood is being disregarded, Shobe told Planet Detroit.

“This neighborhood has been starved of city support and things of that nature for years.”

Zero Waste Detroit director: East side air quality needs attention

During a Q&A session, attendees asked about EGLE’s staffing numbers as well as the status of supplemental environmental projects on Detroit’s east side.The projects are voluntary agreements made between the state and a facility after an air quality violation is issued.

Jenine Camilleri, air quality enforcement supervisor at EGLE, said a project is in the works in Southeast Michigan at Southeastern High School, and agreements are being negotiated with Edward C. Levy Co.’s plant in Southwest Detroit and a cremation facility in the suburbs.

“I think it really does come down to when we start those negotiations, if a company is interested in doing a supplemental environment project,” said Camilleri. “We’re seeing that that is happening probably just as much now as ever.”

As a teenager, Deb Stewart Anderson attended Southeastern. Now she’s partnering with Henry Ford Health and Wayne State University’s Center for Urban Responses to Environmental Stressors to install air monitoring sensors in the vicinity of her alma mater.

“I don’t think that the east side gets the attention that Southwest and other parts of the city get, but it’s a Detroit problem,” said Stewart Anderson, executive director of Zero Waste Detroit, a coalition of community organizations advocating for waste reduction and universal curbside recycling.

“We’re trying to come together to get some solutions and to advocate for better air.”

EGLE’s Air Quality Division is approved by the Michigan Legislature to have as many as 225 full-time employees, up from 190 a few years ago, said Dixon, planning coordinator for the division. The extra staff is especially important, she said, for engaging local communities like Detroit, where the local team as of this year is fully staffed.

“There’s a lot going on here, and we need more staff to do this work,” said Dixon.

“When that (Detroit) office was not fully staffed, we were not able to do the work that we needed to do to be responsive to the community. When they had complaints, when they had concerns, doing inspections was harder.”",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP22284778913296-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 23:01:11.540853

Washington (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday fired at least eight employees who signed a letter criticizing the agency’s leadership under Administrator Lee Zeldin and President Donald Trump.

“Following a thorough internal investigation, EPA supervisors made decisions on an individualized basis,” an EPA spokeswoman said Friday in a statement.

The so-called declaration of dissent, signed by more than 170 employees in late June, “contains inaccurate information designed to mislead the public about agency business,” spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said. “Thankfully, this represents a small fraction of the thousands of hard-working, dedicated EPA employees who are not trying to mislead and scare the American public.”

The EPA “has a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November,” she added.

Vaseliou declined to say how many employees were disciplined, but the head of the agency’s largest union said at least six probationary employees who signed the letter were fired, along with at least two career employees. The firings were first reported by The Washington Post.

The EPA union, part of the American Federation of Government Employees, condemned the firings, which come after 139 workers were put on administrative leave shortly after signing the dissent declaration. The EPA at the time accused employees of “unlawfully undermining” the Trump administration’s agenda.

“The Trump administration and EPA’s retaliatory actions against these workers was clearly an assault on labor and free-speech rights,” said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA employees.

More than 150 workers who were disciplined — up to and including being fired — included scientists, engineers, lawyers, contract officers, emergency response personnel “and a whole host of other jobs,” Chen told the Associated Press. “They live and work in communities around the country, and all believe in the mission of the agency to protect human health and the environment on behalf of the American public.”

In a letter made public June 30, the employees wrote that the EPA is no longer living up to its mission to protect human health and the environment. The letter represented rare public criticism from agency employees who knew they could face retaliation for speaking out against a weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science.

Employees at other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and Federal Emergency Management Agency, have issued similar statements. Some FEMA employees who signed a public letter of dissent earlier this week were put on administrative leave Tuesday, according to documents reviewed by The Associated Press.

More than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed the letter made public Monday. The statement criticizes recent cuts to agency staff and programs and warns that FEMA’s capacity to respond to a major disaster is dangerously diminished.

The EPA said last month it is eliminating its research and development arm and reducing agency staff by thousands of employees. Officials expect total staffing to go down to about 12,500, a reduction of more than 3,700 employees, or nearly 23%, from staffing levels when Trump took office in January.

What's being done about the energy crunch?","Renewable-energy executives have warned that unprecedented moves by the federal government could grind new cleaner-energy projects to a halt just as the U.S. struggles to meet growing electricity demand, CNBC reported.

""I don't think everybody realizes how big the crunch is going to be,"" Kevin Smith, CEO of solar and battery developer Arevon, told CNBC. ""We're making that crunch more and more difficult with these policy changes.""

What's happening?

After years of electricity demand in the U.S. remaining relatively flat due to gains in energy efficiency, demand for power has begun to increase sharply, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency.

Electricity-hungry data centers, particularly those behind energy-intensive AI models, have been the major drivers of increased demand.

A 2024 report released by the Department of Energy found that data centers accounted for 4.4% of all U.S. electricity consumption in 2023. That figure was expected to grow to between 6.7% and 12% by 2028.

At the time of the report's publication, experts expressed confidence that these growing energy needs could be met using cleaner, renewable sources of electricity.

""The United States has seen an incredible investment in artificial intelligence and other breakthrough technologies over the last decade and a half, and this industrial renaissance has created greater demand on our domestic energy supply,"" Jennifer Granholm, who was Secretary of Energy at the time, said in 2024, per the DOE.

""We can meet this growth with clean energy,"" Granholm continued.

However, with the federal government announcing a new, more stringent review process for renewable-energy projects, industry experts have begun to question whether the U.S. will be able to increase electricity production fast enough to meet rising demand, according to CNBC.

Why does the energy crunch matter?

If electricity demand outpaces the growth in supply, it means higher prices for everyone, from factory owners to consumers. The result could be significantly slower economic growth overall.

Renewable-energy projects are important because they typically can be brought online much more quickly than power plants using coal or natural gas.

For example, a massive new solar and battery-storage array that helps to power the City of Los Angeles took just two years from the time shovels hit the ground until the project was brought into service.

By comparison, the world currently is experiencing a severe backlog of the turbines used in natural-gas-powered facilities, leading to wait times as long as seven years, according to S&P Global.

Additionally, cleaner, renewable-energy power plants are responsible for far less heat-trapping, health-harming pollution overall than their nonrenewable counterparts, which are powered by dirtier, extracted fuels like coal and natural gas.

What's being done about the energy crunch?

Unless the federal government begins embracing renewable sources of energy, the U.S. might not be able to meet rising demand for electricity.

To encourage political change, you can use your voice, contact your elected representatives, and vote for pro-environment candidates.

Further, regardless of the policies coming out of Washington, D.C., you can make a difference by driving an EV and installing solar panels on your home. Home solar can reduce your electricity bill to practically zero while also lowering planet-heating pollution.

With federal tax incentives for home solar ending Dec. 31 and credits for EVs ending on Sept. 30, it's important to act soon if you want to take advantage. Solar can take up to three months to complete on time, but if you're interested in getting quotes before it's too late, EnergySage has a comparison shopping tool for local solar installers that's a great way to find one that still has installation slots available.

So, it might stand to reason that Tesla stock has had a torrid time of it, too, right?

Not necessarily!

The carmaker’s stock price is down 14% so far in 2025. But over the past year, it is up – and not just by a little bit.

A 68% gain means that Tesla stock is worth slightly over two-thirds more than it was one short year ago.

That represents more than half of the total 134% gain seen over the past five years.

With sales falling and profits set to suffer from the end of US tax credits, increased electric vehicle market competition, and falling sales volume, can Tesla really justify its stock market capitalisation of $1.1trn?

Given the stock price, the answer to that question seemingly depends on who you ask!

The current bull case for Tesla

Looking on the positive side, there is still a lot to like about the company.

Sure, first-half sales showed a bad decline. But that could be down to temporary production line closures for retooling and the Tesla boss’s high-profile political involvement. As both factors recede into the rear-view mirror, maybe sales can grow.

Energy generation and storage revenue showed a 7% year-on-year decline in the most recent quarter. But the long-term trend in this business remains positive, with the footprint of the equipment deployed to date growing over time. Tesla has a compelling technological capability in this area.

The company says volume production of its truck and self-driving taxi is ‘slated’ for 2026 and self-driving taxi trials are ongoing in the US (albeit with a Tesla employee in each car).

In other words, the core car business could rebound from a bad start to the year, power generation and storage continues to demonstrate its long-term potential, and new business areas are moving closer to commercialisation.

The bear case, at a $1.1trn market cap

Still, what does all that add up to in terms of an investment case?

Much of it is speculative – and, in my view, ought to be valued accordingly.

The car business is huge and I do think that with the right management effort it can be returned to sales growth. But sales are not the only issue it faces.

Profitability is under threat on multiple fronts, from the end of US tax credits to pricing pressure growing as rivals offer cheap models to try and build market share.

The power generation and storage business has demonstrated strong long-term potential, in my view. At 12% of Tesla’s most recent quarterly revenue, I do not see it as a rounding error, but I also do not think it is core to the investment case.",https://www.fool.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tesla-Building-1200x675.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 21:59:16.413203

The EPA at the time accused employees of “unlawfully undermining” the Trump administration’s agenda.
“The Trump administration and EPA’s retaliatory actions against these workers was clearly an assault on labor and free-speech rights,” said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA employees.
More than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed the letter made public Monday.
The EPA said last month it is eliminating its research and development arm and reducing agency staff by thousands of employees.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday fired at least eight employees who signed a letter criticizing the agency’s leadership under Administrator Lee Zeldin and President Donald Trump.

“Following a thorough internal investigation, EPA supervisors made decisions on an individualized basis,” an EPA spokeswoman said Friday in a statement.

The so-called declaration of dissent, signed by more than 170 employees in late June, “contains inaccurate information designed to mislead the public about agency business,” spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said. “Thankfully, this represents a small fraction of the thousands of hard-working, dedicated EPA employees who are not trying to mislead and scare the American public.”

The EPA “has a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November,” she added.

Vaseliou declined to say how many employees were disciplined, but the head of the agency’s largest union said at least six probationary employees who signed the letter were fired, along with at least two career employees. The firings were first reported by The Washington Post.

The EPA union, part of the American Federation of Government Employees, condemned the firings, which come after 139 workers were put on administrative leave shortly after signing the dissent declaration. The EPA at the time accused employees of “unlawfully undermining” the Trump administration’s agenda.

“The Trump administration and EPA’s retaliatory actions against these workers was clearly an assault on labor and free-speech rights,” said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA employees.

More than 150 workers who were disciplined — up to and including being fired — included scientists, engineers, lawyers, contract officers, emergency response personnel “and a whole host of other jobs,” Chen told the Associated Press. “They live and work in communities around the country, and all believe in the mission of the agency to protect human health and the environment on behalf of the American public.”

In a letter made public June 30, the employees wrote that the EPA is no longer living up to its mission to protect human health and the environment. The letter represented rare public criticism from agency employees who knew they could face retaliation for speaking out against a weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science.

Employees at other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and Federal Emergency Management Agency, have issued similar statements. Some FEMA employees who signed a public letter of dissent earlier this week were put on administrative leave Tuesday, according to documents reviewed by The Associated Press.

More than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed the letter made public Monday. The statement criticizes recent cuts to agency staff and programs and warns that FEMA’s capacity to respond to a major disaster is dangerously diminished.

The EPA said last month it is eliminating its research and development arm and reducing agency staff by thousands of employees. Officials expect total staffing to go down to about 12,500, a reduction of more than 3,700 employees, or nearly 23%, from staffing levels when Trump took office in January.

The Iowa Renewable Fuels Association called the action a “major step” toward renewable fuel adoption, especially for producers in Iowa who have several B30 incentive programs.

The adoption means that farmers can use the higher-blend fuel in their agricultural equipment like tractors and combines, which typically use the heavy-duty engines. Previously, John Deere rated the tier-4 engines for B20, or 20% biodiesel, fuel blends.

IRFA executive director Monte Shaw said in a news release that John Deere “has always been a leader in promoting renewable fuels.”

The tier rating is a system designed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate and reduce emissions.

Pierre Guyot, senior vice president of John Deere Power Systems, said the company is committed to growing its use of renewable fuels.

Lower-tier John Deere engines are rated for higher fuel blends, up to 100% biodiesel.

“We believe strongly in the role that renewable fuels play in supporting the agriculture economy and are excited to offer our customers — including those who grow the very crops used to make renewable fuels — the opportunity to leverage higher blends of fuels like biodiesel in their own equipment,” Guyot said in a press release.

In 2024 Iowa, the nation's top maker of biodiesel, produced an estimated 350 million gallons, and the industry had an estimated economic contribution of $2.2 billion, according to IRFA. In May, Iowa gained a first-of-its-kind biodiesel pump at a station in Urbandale to fuel PepsiCo trucks with B99 fuel.

Iowa offers a 10-center-per-gallon tax credit to fuel retailers who sell B30 or higher blends. In addition to the state program, the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association offers a biodiesel fuel credit to farmers who fill up with biodiesel blends. Blends above 20% can get 50 cents per gallon in credits, up to $500.

“These programs make biodiesel more accessible and affordable for Iowa farmers, while supporting the state’s leadership in renewable energy,” Lisa Coffelt, IRFA’s marketing director said.","https://www.desmoinesregister.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/15/PDEM/83101722007-planting-4.jpg?crop=7537,4239,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-31 00:58:52.849630

Ford’s joint venture battery plants in Kentucky and Tennessee were the next targets in this organizing push.
It was the first auto assembly plant election the union had won in the South since the 1940s.
Ford, however, has balked at agreeing to neutrality at its joint ventures or folding its battery plants into its master contract with the UAW.
He left after five years to work at BOSK because it was closer to home and he thought battery plants are the future.","Kentucky battery plant workers at the BlueOval SK Battery Park (BOSK) in Glendale have voted to join the United Auto Workers (UAW). The workers make batteries to power Ford’s all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck and E-Transit cargo van.

On August 27 at 10 p.m., an unofficial tally showed 526 yes and 515 no votes, with forty-one challenged ballots. There were 1,200 eligible voters; turnout was over 90 percent. The UAW called the vote “a major step forward for workers who stood up against intense company opposition and chose to join the UAW.”

“We’re feeling pretty confident, I think we’re gonna win,” said battery worker Halee Hadfield via text message on August 23. “Things are really ramping up across the whole plant and people are pissing off the plant managers by simply wearing shirts, hats, and buttons with the UAW logo on them.”

Disputed Votes

The outcome of the election will ultimately hinge on the forty-one challenged ballots. The union called those ballots “illegitimate” and called on Ford to “drop their anti-democratic effort to undermine the outcome of the election.”

Maintenance and production workers were eligible to vote. But the status of Safety Emergency Response Team (SERT) employees was left in limbo: election rules agreed to by the company and the UAW permitted them to vote but said their eligibility would be decided after the election. Their ballots are being challenged by the union.

“The challenged ballots are not part of the group of workers who built their union from the bottom up,” the UAW said in a statement. “They deserve to have their own union, in an appropriate bargaining unit with a representative of their own choosing.”

Southern Organizing Push

“I’m just under thirty years old, and I’ve been trying to organize my entire adult life,” said Derek Doherty, a production operator, who has tried to organize with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and the Teamsters at previous jobs. “It’s just been beautiful,” he said about the union drive. “Everybody knows what we’re here for and why we’re doing it.”

Hadfield had predicted a win by 57 percent. “Unfortunately, a lot of people bought the company’s bullshit,” she said the night of the vote count.

Shortly after the successful 2023 stand-up strike against the Big Three automakers, the UAW committed $40 million to new organizing with the intent of doubling the union’s membership by aggressively organizing 150,000 nonunion workers, especially in Southern auto manufacturing and newly built battery plants.

Ford’s joint venture battery plants in Kentucky and Tennessee were the next targets in this organizing push. And the UAW’s latest effort to breach one more citadel in the South comes with big potential obstacles, as Ford will appeal the contested ballots, and this may give the Trump administration an opportunity to influence the outcome through the National Labor Relations Board.

Union Experience

Hadfield and many of her coworkers were union members at previous jobs. For four years, Hadfield was a member of the Communications Workers of America’s industrial division, IUE-CWA, at the General Electric–Haier Appliance Park in Louisville, an hour’s drive from the BlueOval plant.

Others had the protection of UAW contracts at auto parts suppliers or Ford’s Kentucky Truck and Louisville Assembly Plants, or they have family who were Teamsters at UPS or grocery workers at Kroger.

The battery park is a joint venture between Ford and South Korea’s SK On, an affiliate of South Korea’s second-largest conglomerate.

In July, the UAW joined forces with the militant Korean Metal Workers’ Union in hopes of changing BOSK’s status as “the only union-free company among the joint ventures between Korean battery manufacturers and U.S. automakers,” according to the Korea Times.

SK On and Ford’s partnership involves creating twin electric battery manufacturing facilities in Kentucky and in Stanton, Tennessee. The Stanton plant is slated to start production in 2025 after a pause last year. The Kentucky battery park became fully operational on August 19. The facility is expected to eventually employ over five thousand workers.

“Whatever the powertrain is, we’re going to be there,” UAW president Shawn Fain said earlier in the month at a rally. “We’re not going to run from [technological] advances. We have to embrace it and figure out how we make it work for working-class people, not just for business or just for the rich.”

The union notched a big win in its new organizing push in auto in April 2024, when 4,300 workers at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, voted to join the UAW. It was the first auto assembly plant election the union had won in the South since the 1940s.

Wins and Losses

A month later, however, the union fell short of winning an election at a Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama. It has not filed for any elections at other Southern assembly plants since, and the Volkswagen workers are still fighting for a first contract.

Earlier this month, in another blow, workers at a Navistar engine plant in Huntsville, Alabama, voted 142 to 73 against joining the UAW following an aggressive anti-union campaign by management, including a personal visit to the plant by the parent company’s CEO and the reinstatement — days before the vote — of a health insurance plan the company had taken away last year. According to the union, those moves violated the neutrality agreement in its contract at other UAW plants and reversed course on its card-check certification agreement to recognize and negotiate with the union once a majority of employees sign up.

Battery plants have been a bright spot in the UAW’s organizing efforts. Workers at Ultium Cells, a joint venture in Ohio between GM and LG Energy Solution, joined the UAW through an election in December 2022 and won a first contract in June 2024. Ultium Cells workers at another plant in Tennessee joined the UAW through a card-check agreement last September, a victory clinched during the stand-up strike; GM agreed to recognize the union through a majority sign-up process as part of the agreement that ended the strike. At the Kokomo, Indiana, battery plant StarPlus Energy, a joint venture between Stellantis and the South Korean company Samsung SDI, the company agreed to recognize the UAW this May after a majority of the 420 workers signed cards to join the union.

Ford, however, has balked at agreeing to neutrality at its joint ventures or folding its battery plants into its master contract with the UAW. During the stand-up Strike, Ford CEO Jim Farley accused Fain of “holding the deal hostage over battery plants.”

Bitter Company Campaign

Since then, Ford has taken the gloves off. It launched a bitter anti-union campaign at BOSK, holding the vote back for nearly five months after finally agreeing to an election date in June and dispatching supervisors to harass union supporters wearing UAW shirts to chill the organizing drive. The UAW has filed four unfair labor practice charges, alleging that BOSK destroyed union materials, fired pro-union workers, and threatened to close the facility if workers voted to unionize.

One notable talking point, said Hadfield, is the company’s use of Donald Trump’s rollback of electric vehicle credits to claim its financial viability is in jeopardy. The company falsely claimed to have lost a $9 billion loan from the Department of Energy that it had already obtained under the Biden administration, Hadfield said.

BOSK workers’ starting pay is $21 an hour, compared to $26.32 for UAW Ford workers, whose earnings increase to over $42 an hour after three years. But it’s not just about dollars and cents.

Doherty, a production operator, started in late June and signed a union card on his first day at the plant. During mandatory training at a nearby facility, management painted a rosy picture, he said, claiming that there was no division between salary and hourly workers — “It’s just one big family.” But as soon as he arrived at the plant, he noticed the power managers wielded through favoritism and decided to join the organizing effort.

He described the company’s anti-union push as a typical assault on workers’ minds: lies and intimidation. “They’ll do the exact textbook definition of an unfair labor practice but then toss in one sentence that adds just enough of a caveat to make it slip by.” He described captive-audience meetings where workers were forced to sit through anti-union harangues from management.

Managers would shut down the line, he said, and then announce that there was a meeting going on, saying “It’s completely voluntary, but we really think you should go.” That’s not a real choice, said Doherty. “The line is shut down; everybody else is going. There’s not really much else to do in there.”

Hadfield said she and her coworkers are vocal about their union support, but they are less visible with their union gear. “Because of the retaliatory firings and people getting threatened with all kinds of bullshit, there are a lot of people who used to wear a red shirt that don’t anymore because they’re scared.”

In the course of the nine-month organizing push, BOSK management has fired three union organizing committee members. But workers remained committed to the organizing drive, saying the company has been the best organizer.

Company management also used recent internal divisions in the UAW to attempt to undermine support for the union. Flyers passed out by supervisors quoted opponents of the union’s aggressive organizing and bargaining strategies under Fain and attempted to sow fear among workers about the potential ramifications of a strike. One flyer concluded by asking: “In this unstable environment — with a history of hostility, layoffs, and financial corruption — is this the type of organization you want to trust with your livelihoods?”

Dangerous Slurry

Health and safety concerns loom large at the plant. A May Louisville Courier Journal investigation found that unsafe working conditions ranged from chemical exposures to blocked emergency exit doors to mold contamination to injury and respiratory illness. As Labor Notes reported last November, a big motivation to organize a union at BOSK, as it was at Ultium Cells, stemmed from safety concerns, especially exposure to hazardous powders from chemical leaks, electric shocks, explosions, and fires.

Rob Collette was previously a member of IUE-CWA at General Electric–Haier Appliance Park. He left after five years to work at BOSK because it was closer to home and he thought battery plants are the future. “The technology, the facility, the machinery,” he told Jacobin in March. “It’s blown my mind.”

Collette hired in while the plant was still under construction but tripped on construction debris and fractured his hip. The experience fortified his support for the union drive to fix the company’s negligence. “Nobody feels safe,” he said.

“Roughly three weeks in, I just mentioned to a coworker one day, ‘Golly, if we don’t get the UAW in here, I don’t know if I can stay,’” said battery worker Bill Wilmoth back in November.

“We started running into a myriad of safety issues,” said Wilmoth. “We are taken into a plant that is in construction, and we’re being asked to navigate that and never really given clear instructions on things like: What happens if there’s an emergency? How do we evacuate? How do we deal with the raw material chemicals?”

“Just today, there was an accident where a bunch of people got sprayed with electrode slurry,” said a worker on August 26 who we’ve granted anonymity to protect from company retaliation. When handling the electrode slurry, workers can come into contact with a hazardous solvent known as n-Methylpyrrolidone (NMP) used in the production of battery cells. “The NMP is the worst part of the slurry. It’s a nasty chemical that is definitely not good to breathe or get on your skin,” Greg Less, technical director at the University of Michigan Battery Lab, told me in 2023.

For Doherty, it feels as if managers are making things up as they go. “They’ll say we’re certified on something, and then the next day, say, ‘Actually, no, that certification isn’t good.’ All sorts of problems can and have arisen from that.”",https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/29155247/GettyImages-2167257031.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 23:58:17.293933

During the 2025 edition of Intersolar South America, Sungrow unveiled its PV rapid shutdown solution, tailored for the Brazilian market.

The solution, consisting of an SR20D-M rapid shutdown (RSD) device, SR200T-BX RSD controller box and Sungrow inverters, ensures system safety by reducing module voltage to a safe level within 30 seconds, providing reliable protection for both individuals and property.

According to Brazil’s newly released standard, rooftop PV systems must lower DC voltage below 35 V within 30 seconds in case of utility power outages, fires or other emergencies. Previously, the country’s fire authority also emphasized the importance of rapid shutdown devices, urging the industry to enhance emergency response capability.

Sungrow’s new rapid shutdown solution ensures that rooftop arrays quickly enter a safe zone, creating a safe environment for emergency crews and maintenance teams.

In rooftop systems, if a panel is heavily shaded or develops a fault, shutdown devices activate a bypass mode, allowing the faulty panel to be isolated while the rest of the system keeps generating power.

The problem with conventional designs is that, during bypass, device temperatures can reach 180–190°C. This extreme heat goes well beyond the safe limit of electronic components, which leads to faster aging, seal failures or even cracks in the casing. Over time, that shortens a system’s lifespan and raises the risk of malfunctions.

Sungrow solves this issue with its patented Fault Heat Control (FHC) low-temperature bypass technology, which keeps the temperature under 120°C, about 33% lower than conventional solutions.

To handle Brazil’s diverse climates the devices feature C5 anti-corrosion protection and the industry’s leading IP68 rating (IP68 for SR20D-M, IP65 for SR200T-BX).

He called the effort the “moral equivalent of war.” His message was simple. Use less imported oil. Build new homegrown energy. Plan for the long term. That warning still reads true today.

What Carter Meant—And Why It Still Matters

Carter’s speech came after oil shocks and rising prices. He asked people to save energy and support new solutions. He pushed for a national plan. He said the task would be hard but necessary. The line about a “moral equivalent of war” became the headline. And it still echoes in this decade.

Where the World Stands Now

Today, renewables are the fastest-growing source of new electricity. Policy, markets, and tech all align. The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects annual renewable additions to keep rising through 2030, led by solar and wind. In its outlook, yearly additions scale from about 666 GW in 2024 toward ~935 GW by 2030. Solar and wind make up most of it because they are cheap and quick to build.

Another global source, IRENA, counted the projects that actually came online in 2024. It found the world added ~582 GW of renewables that year. That total was about 20% more than in 2023. Different methods can explain the gap with IEA forecasts. But both show a sharp rise in clean power.

Costs Now Beat Fossil for New Build

Cost is the biggest story. Lazard’s 2025 LCOE+ report says renewables remain the most cost-competitive form of new power on an unsubsidized basis. That’s true even with supply chain bumps. And it matters as grids chase fast demand growth from data centers, EVs, and factories.

IRENA reaches the same point from a different angle. It reports that in 2024, about 91% of newly commissioned utility-scale renewable projects produced power at lower cost than the cheapest new fossil option. Falling battery prices also help balance solar and wind across the day.

From Targets to Steel in the Ground

Ambition means little without projects. Across North America and beyond, developers are moving from plans to sites. One example is O3 Energy. Since 2011, the firm has offered solar project development, financing, construction, asset management, and O&M. It focuses on heavy energy users and helps them cut bills and risk.

Good developers reduce headaches. They pick sites, manage interconnection, design systems, and line up capital. O3 Energy describes a time-tested process that aims to lower risk and keep schedules on track. For customers, that can mean faster payback and more control over future costs.

Why Execution Matters

Speed: Solar and wind can be built in months, not years.

Scale: Projects range from rooftops to utility-scale plants.

Price stability: Sun and wind are free, so there’s no fuel price shock.

Local value: Construction brings jobs and tax revenue.

Reliability: Grids Are Adapting

As clean energy grows, grids must adapt. They need more transmission, faster interconnection, and smarter software. Storage helps too. Batteries can shift solar from noon to evening. They can also respond within milliseconds to support frequency. With planning, regions are keeping reliability steady while adding lots of clean power.

What the Next Five Years Could Look Like

The IEA expects renewables to supply a much bigger share of power by 2030. The share grew to about 30% in 2023 and is forecast to reach about 46% by 2030. Most of that growth comes from solar and wind. Electrification then cuts emissions in transport, industry, and buildings.

Quick Snapshot: Then vs. Now

Topic 1977 2024–2030 Energy message Conserve. Cut oil imports. Plan ahead. “Moral equivalent of war.” Build renewables fast. Expand grids and storage. Electrify uses. Costs Fossil fuels set prices amid shocks. Renewables are the lowest-cost new build in many markets. New capacity Slow growth in clean power. IEA forecasts rising annual additions through 2030; IRENA counted ~582 GW added in 2024. Share of electricity Small and emerging. ~30% in 2023; ~46% expected by 2030. Developers Limited clean energy pipeline. Experienced firms like O3 Energy scale projects end-to-end.

Why This Shift Helps Households and Businesses

Lower long-run bills: No fuel costs. Less exposure to price spikes.

Faster builds: Meet new demand from AI, EVs, and industry sooner.

Cleaner air: Fewer pollutants near homes and schools.

Resilience: Storage and demand response can back up the grid.

Headwinds to Watch

Yes, challenges remain. Permitting can be slow. Supply chains can tighten. Geopolitics can push prices up. These risks are real. But the direction is clear. Global leaders and analysts say clean energy is pulling ahead, even as they urge faster action.

Welcome to Horizon, DLA Piper’s monthly bulletin reporting on late-breaking legislative and policy developments in ESG. Our aim is to scan the litigation, enforcement, and regulatory horizon to help inform business decisions.

Deadline alert

California: Under SB 261, the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act, covered entities are required to post their first biennial climate-related financial risk report to CARB’s public docket by January 1, 2026. For SB 253, the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act, CARB has proposed June 30, 2026 as the initial deadline for Scope 1 and 2 reporting.

California: for SB 54, the Extended Producer Responsibility Law, register with the Circular Action Alliance (CAA) by September 5, 2025, and report data for covered material sold or distributed in California in 2023 to CAA by November 15, 2025.

Canada: Phase 1 of reporting to the Federal Plastics Registry is due by September 29, 2025.

Please also see our ESG calendar for information about key reporting deadlines around the world.

Disclosures and voluntary reporting

Key points from CARB’s August 21 virtual public workshop on the California Corporate Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. In 2023, California passed SB 253, requiring large companies doing business in California to annually disclose their GHG emissions, and SB 261, requiring disclosure of material climate-related financial risks. Reporting requirements under those laws begin in 2026. The August 21 California Air Resources Board (CARB) workshop on the proposed fee regulation and implementation guidance for both bills featured a regulatory update from CARB staff outlining key aspects of the proposed regulations governing upcoming climate disclosure requirements, followed by an extensive public comment session with participation from various stakeholders. CARB staff opened the workshop with an overview of the regulatory process and key requirements under both measures, emphasizing that for the initial reporting cycle, good faith efforts and use of best available data will be accepted. Regarding potential fee structures, CARB is proposing a flat annual fee for each covered entity of $3,106 under SB 253 and $1,403 for SB 261. Entities subject to both laws pay both fees.

The public comment period was highly active, with over 90 stakeholders raising a range of questions and concerns in a tight timeframe. Commenters particularly sought clarification on parent vs. subsidiary liability; the feasibility of reporting deadlines; the definitions of “doing business in California” and “revenue” (earlier in the meeting, staff stated that CARB is already working to clarify the regulatory definition of the former); the frequency of fee assessment and how fees would apply to entities near the revenue threshold or with changing business status; whether existing sustainability or SEC filings could satisfy SB 261 requirements if they align with TCFD or IFRS standards; and whether only CARB-accredited verifiers could provide assurance. Going forward, CARB stated, it will continue refining regulatory definitions, fee structures, and reporting templates based on stakeholder feedback. Written comments are strongly encouraged and will be accepted through the newly opened public docket. Additional guidance and draft materials are expected in the coming months, with formal rulemaking and board consideration scheduled for late 2025.

Initiative launched to preserve, advance carbon accounting models that are widely used in disclosure reporting. On August 11, Stanford University’s Stanford Sustainable Solutions Lab and sustainability data provider Watershed announced Cornerstone, an initiative that will provide open access to the US Environmentally-Extended Input-Output model (USEEIO), EPA’s popular environmental-economic carbon accounting model of US goods and services, and Watershed’s own Comprehensive Environmental Data Archive (CEDA). Those two models are used by businesses around the world to calculate their Scope 3 emissions in order to comply with EU and California reporting requirements and to understand the impact of their operations – the USEEIO database is reportedly the third most viewed of more than 281,000 federal data sets on data.gov. EPA announced on August 8 that, starting in September, it would no longer update the USEEIO models. Watershed stated of Cornerstone that in the coming months the USEEIO and CEDA models will be merged into “a single global open multi-regional input output model” to “drive significant improvements in scope 3 measurements and expand beyond greenhouse gas pollution to assess regional air and water quality, water use, and waste generation” and “offer a durable common standard for companies, governments, and researchers.” Serving as Cornerstone’s technical director is Dr. Wesley Ingwersen, the architect of the USEEIO model, who joined Stanford after being suspended from EPA in June. Two other leading experts in emissions measurement, Dr. Steven Wright and Dr. Sangwon Suh, will serve as Cornerstone’s technical advisors.

Omnibus I in the news. The EU continues to advance Omnibus I, the set of proposed simplification measures that will streamline key reporting and compliance requirements of the bloc’s Green Deal – the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), EU Green Taxonomy, and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. Here are the latest developments:

The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) on July 31 released revised and simplified exposure drafts of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). The standards set out in the ESRS are foundational to the CSRD. Among the revisions, mandatory datapoints as well as mandatory and voluntary disclosures have been greatly reduced, and the double materiality assessment has been refined, removing all voluntary disclosures and clarifying language. Overall, the revised ESRS are less than half the length of the originals. The public consultation on the simplified ESRA is open through September 29.

As it awaits the outcome of the Omnibus I reforms, on August 11 the European Banking Authority (EBA) released a no action letter recommending that regulators not prioritize the enforcement of new ESG Pillar 3 disclosure requirements for banks for now. The steady advance of the Omnibus I reforms has created, for the moment, an uncertain regulatory environment which, EBA stated, could place a “disproportionate compliance burden” on smaller financial institutions could face; banks in general could be subject to conflicting disclosure requirements. In July, the EBA proposed amendments that would simplify its guidelines on product oversight and governance arrangements for retail banking products. Its virtual public hearing on the proposed amendments takes place on September 21. Register for it here by September 8.

The European Commission has officially adopted the VSME Standard – a streamlined, updated version of reporting standards that will allow small and medium-sized enterprises that fall outside the scope of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) to voluntarily report their disclosures. The VSME Standard is regarded as particularly useful for small businesses that are part of the value chain of larger entities, providing them with a compatible reporting format. The VSME Standard was developed by EFRAG.

Eight EU countries have adopted legislation to implement the “stop the clock” directive, which delays the implementation of key sustainability reporting and due diligence requirements set out in the EU’s Green New Deal as Omnibus I proceeds. The eight are Cyprus, Estonia, France, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, Norway, and Poland. Ten others – Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Slovenia, and Sweden – have drafted but not yet adopted implementing legislation.

UK: FCA sustainability reporting framework to be “streamlined and enhanced.” In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is set to streamline and enhance its sustainability reporting framework after reviewing how firms have implemented climate-related disclosure rules. The review found that while the rules have improved firms’ consideration of climate risks and increased transparency, challenges remain, including the complexity and volume of disclosures, data limitations, and the need to make reports more useful for different types of investors. The FCA plans to simplify disclosure requirements, align reporting timelines across regimes like TCFD and SDR, and promote international consistency, all while maintaining high standards to prevent greenwashing and support investor trust. Additionally, the FCA is focusing on improving the sustainability-linked loans market by encouraging better-structured deals, stronger governance, and clearer standards, aiming to position the UK as a leader in sustainable and transition finance. Our alert tells you more.

ISS will update ESQS methodology in Q4. ISS Sustainability Solutions has announced that in Q4 2025 it will release updates to its Environmental & Social Disclosure QualityScore (ESQS) methodology. Companies and investors use the ESQS methodology to evaluate corporate governance practices in four areas: board structure, shareholder rights, compensation, and audit and risk oversight. An ISS press release states that among the changes being introduced, 35 new factors will be added to the ESQS, “including more detailed data points regarding Scope 3 GHG emissions, business ethics, as well as health and safety.” Nine other factors will be removed entirely, and two will be removed for certain industries “due to their decreasing relevance.” ISS will release more granular details about the updates in September.

Greenwashing

Italian regulator fines Shein website provider €1 million over greenwashing. The Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato (AGCM), Italy’s competition and market regulator, has imposed a fine of €1 million (USD$1.16 million) on Infinite Styles Services Co. Ltd, a Dublin-based company that operates the website and app for the fast-fashion e-commerce giant Shein, over environmental claims on Shein's platforms. The fine, AGCM stated on August 4, “is for the use of misleading and deceptive environmental messages and claims – known as greenwashing.” As we reported in October, the AGCM’s investigation looked at statements on Shein's website that ""convey an image of production and commercial sustainability of its garments through generic, vague, confusing and/or misleading environmental claims"" as well as statements emphasizing Shein’s commitment to decarbonization, sustainability, and recyclability. AGCM concluded this month that such statements were ""false or at least confusing.” Statements Shein made about its goal of reducing its GHG emissions, AGCM also found, were vague and misleading “and were even contradicted by an actual increase in Shein’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 and 2024.” Also on August 4, Shein announced it “is implementing targeted improvements across its supply chain” as part of its “ongoing work to address the environmental impact of its operations and reduce greenhouse gas emissions where feasible.” That plan, the company stated, will include replacing some diesel trucks in its operations in China with 130 custom-designed electric vehicles as well as implementing measures to enhance its logistics.

Putative class action alleges a premium water brand’s claims of purity are false and deceptive. A putative class action case filed on August 11 charges that Mountain Valley Spring Water’s premium products are being falsely advertised as “purely sourced,” “Free of pollutants,” and “exceptionally healthful.” The complaint, brought by Florida consumer Jeffrey Nadel against Mountain Valley, Primo Water Corporation, and Primo North America, states that independent laboratory testing of Mountain Valley Waters in July 2025 “detected arsenic, uranium, and bromoform – all substances with EPA Maximum Contaminant Level Goals of zero, meaning there is no safe level for human consumption,” as well as “multiple contaminants for which the EPA has established Maximum Contaminant Level Goals.” Nadel stated that he has purchased Mountain Valley Spring water for years, paying its premium price because he believed the company’s statement that he was purchasing “the very best bottled water you can drink.” Instead, his complaint states, consumers of the premium waters were purchasing “water containing detectable carcinogens and disinfection byproducts.” Nadel is seeking class certification as well as a judgment against the defendants “for violations of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act and all applicable state consumer protection statutes.” This case is in its earliest stages.

India: Parliamentary committee urges creation of ESG oversight body to combat greenwashing. In India, the parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance has called on the Ministry of Corporate Affairs to create an ESG oversight body “for actively combating greenwashing through specialised forensic expertise.” Among the committee’s other recommendations, it also called for India’s Companies Act, 2013 to be amended to add ESG objectives to the fiduciary responsibilities of company directors. The committee’s report was tabled on August 4.

Sustainability: Regulatory

US rejects IMO’s net zero framework and global pricing mechanism for carbon emissions from ships. As we've previously reported, in April International Maritime Organization (IMO) member nations agreed to implement a global pricing mechanism for carbon emissions from ships and to legally binding targets for such emissions: a 20 to 30 percent reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, a 70 percent reduction by 2040, and net-zero “by or around” 2050. The US did not take part in that agreement, leaving the negotiations before the vote occurred. This month, the US formally rejected the agreement. The August 11 joint statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that “the proposed framework is effectively a global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable UN organization,” then went on to warn any IMO members that persist in supporting the net-zero framework that the US will ”not hesitate to retaliate” against them. The draft regulations amending the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships’ Annex VI are set to be adopted in October during an extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee. Detailed implementation guidelines are expected to be approved in spring 2026, and the regulations are expected to enter into force in early 2027. Reuters report that many large shipping companies have already committed to achieving net-zero operations by 2050.

Plans to terminate Orbiting Carbon Observatories. The Trump Administration has reportedly asked NASA to formulate plans to terminate the Orbiting Carbon Observatories (OCO), the only federal satellite missions created specifically to monitor greenhouse gases. NASA reports that the termination of the OCOs is ""to align with the President's agenda and budget priorities"" in the proposed budget for FY2026. The equipment on the two OCO satellites is regarded as state of the art; the data the OCOs gather is extensively used by energy companies, businesses, the USDA, farmers, and private agricultural consulting companies both to understand the global distribution of CO2 and to measure plant growth and track crop yields. The OCOs have been funded by Congress through the 2025 fiscal year, which ends September 30. On August 8, NASA announced Research Opportunities for International Space Station Utilization “seeking submissions for partnerships for the continued operations and data collection of three Earth science missions” attached to the International Space Station – among them one of the OCO missions. The other OCO is free-flying; if that mission is terminated, the satellite would be abandoned to burn up in the atmosphere.

New White House AI Action Plan and EO aim to streamline environmental review and data center permitting. An Executive Order and accompanying Action Plan issued in late July aim to support AI development and the digital transformation by streamlining federal permitting and environmental review of new data centers that constitute “Qualifying Projects.” The Action Plan and EO specifically call for reducing or eliminating regulatory barriers to increasing US semiconductor manufacturing and electricity generation capacity, as well as modernizing electricity transmission. See our alert.

California legislator proposes reauthorization, some reforms to cap-and-trade program. As we reported in April, California Governor Gavin Newsom has urged the state legislature to extend the long-running cap-and-trade emissions program, a measure proposed and then signed into law by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006. Without further action, the program will expire in 2030. On August 19, Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin (D-Thousand Oaks) announced a proposal that would reauthorize the program and reform certain aspects of it. For instance, under the current program, free allowances are allocated to some participants in industries that are both energy intensive and trade exposed and thus at risk of leaving the state. Under Irwin’s proposal, the regulatory formula used to award free allowances would be redesigned to reflect more up-to-date trade data. Her proposal would also expand the use of purchased offsets. At this writing, whether Irwin’s proposal will be addressed in this year’s legislative session, which ends September 12, is unclear. In the decade leading up to 2024, California funded $28 billion in “climate investments” through the cap-and-trade program, broadly ranging from wildfire prevention and environmental restoration to low-carbon transit and electric vehicle rebates. The program also funds the California Climate Credit, which is applied to state residents’ electric and gas bills. Irwin’s proposal would alter the timing of that refund, too, moving it to the time of year when utility bills are highest.

SB 54 Advisory Board provides updates on implementing California’s EPR law for packaging. On August 15, the SB 54 Advisory Board met to update stakeholders on the progress of implementing California’s SB 54, the Plastic Pollution Prevention and Packaging Producer Responsibility Act. The meeting included a detailed presentation on SB 54’s ongoing Source Reduction & Material Design Needs Assessment. The timeline for the assessment is aggressive: draft and final reports are due throughout the fall of 2025. The Advisory Board went on to provide an update on the status of rulemaking, recent regulatory changes, and the upcoming formal public comment period. Notably, proposed regulatory changes would clarify that only components of FDA/USDA-regulated materials with irreconcilable conflicts are excluded, not entire packages. Compostable plastics standards would also require full biological decomposition with no toxic residues. Local jurisdictions may now apply for exemptions or extensions at any time, even after a notice of violation, and penalties are paused during that review. Furthermore, the Covered Material Categories list and producer reporting guidance are being updated, with new versions expected soon.

Finally, the Circular Action Alliance (CAA), the producer responsibility organization tasked with overseeing industry compliance with SB 54, presented its plans for stakeholder engagement and program development, focusing on transparency and inclusivity. CAA is encouraging early producer engagement for data reporting and is finalizing interim agreements to facilitate compliance ahead of final regulations. Elements of the draft program plan, CAA said, will be brought to the Advisory Board for review and discussion before the full plan is submitted in June 2026, rather than presenting the entire plan at once.

Plastics treaty talks fail. Negotiations this month in Geneva to agree on an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution have collapsed. As we reported last month, the UN’s Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution (INC) had convened this session in hopes of finalizing an agreement after the prior session, in Busan in December 2024, failed. As the World Economic Forum reported, “No agreement to reach stricter, enforceable rules to reduce plastic pollution was achieved after 10 days of negotiations by nations” because “consensus could not be reached on key issues, such as whether the treaty should impose caps on new plastic production or put its focus instead on waste management, reuse and improved design.” This is not the end for the treaty, however; negotiations are expected to resume in the future, although a date has not been set. DLA Piper was present at the Geneva meeting to represent the Environmental Law Institute, which has observer status in the negotiations.

European Commission opens public consultation for Circular Economy Act. On August 1, the European Commission (EC) opened a public consultation and call for evidence in support of the forthcoming Circular Economy Act. The EC states that the act, due for adoption in 2026, “aims to establish a Single Market for secondary raw materials, increase the supply of high-quality recycled materials and stimulate demand for these materials in the EU.” The consultation is part of the larger impact assessment process for the act, through which the EC is seeking a better understanding of “the bottlenecks and opportunities for the wider deployment of a circular economy.” The public consultation period is open until November 6, 2025, via the Have Your Say portal.

Sustainability: Litigation

Federal Court denies preliminary injunction against California’s SB 253 and SB 261. On August 13, the US District Court for the Central District of California issued an order in Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America et al. v. California Air Resources Board denying the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to halt enforcement of California Senate Bills 253 (the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act) and 261 (the Climate-Related Financial Risk Disclosure Program). The challenge, on First Amendment grounds, argued that the two laws’ disclosure requirements amount to compelled speech and are unconstitutional. The court’s analysis focused on several key issues. Applying different standards of review, the court found that SB 253 was reasonably related to substantial government interests, and that SB 261 was sufficiently tailored to the state’s objectives. The court also determined that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on their First Amendment claims against either law. Additionally, the court found that the balance of equities and the public interest weighed against granting an injunction, as enjoining the laws would delay California’s efforts to advance its climate and investor protection goals. The court’s order allows the state to move forward with implementation while this litigation proceeds. The plaintiffs have already filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit, and the court has set a briefing schedule for plaintiffs’ motion for an injunction pending resolution of the appeal. That motion will be heard on September 15, 2025. See some of our earlier coverage of this litigation here.

Vermont moves to dismiss Climate Superfund Law challenges. On August 15, the state of Vermont asked the US District Court for the District of Vermont to dismiss three lawsuits that seek to overturn Vermont’s Act 122, the Climate Superfund Act. One of the suits, brought in January by the US Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute, charges that the Vermont law is preempted by the federal Clean Air Act (CAA), violates the Constitution’s Dormant and Foreign Commerce Clauses as well as Eighth Amendment protections against excessive fines, and that the law would harm other states through higher energy costs. That suit was joined by a coalition of 24 states led by West Virginia on May 1. The third suit, brought in May by the Department of Justice, points to President Donald Trump’s April Executive Order, Protecting American Energy From State Overreach, and alleges that the Vermont law is preempted by the CAA and the foreign affairs doctrine. Vermont’s motion to dismiss addresses these charges, arguing that Act 122 “does not conflict with federal law or policy, regulate fossil fuel emissions, or punish fossil fuel producers” and that it is a “valid exercise of Vermont’s traditional authority to raise revenue, protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens, and mitigate environmental harms inside its borders.”

Administration’s lawsuit against New York Climate Superfund law will stay in the SDNY. The US District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) has denied the state of New York’s request to move USA and EPA v. New York – the Administration’s constitutional challenge to New York’s Climate Superfund law – to a different venue. New York had sought to move the case to the Northern District of New York, which is already hearing a separate challenge to the law brought by 22 Republican-led states and two trade groups. On August 4, the court ruled that the case would remain in the SDNY for a number of reasons, most notably the government's right to proceed in its preferred jurisdiction. “The United States has selected this forum,” the court stated, “and on these facts, its choice is entitled to great deference.”

Lawsuit targets Oregon’s Plastic Pollution and Recycling Modernization Act. The National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors has sued Oregon’s Department of Environmental Quality, Environmental Quality Commission, and Attorney General, seeking to halt implementation of and invalidate Oregon’s Plastic Pollution and Recycling Modernization Act. The outcome of this litigation could have broad implications for the RMA and similar EPR laws in other states. Our alert explores the background of the case and its potential impacts for producers in the state and beyond.

City of Chicago v BP remanded to lower court. Also on August 4, the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit denied attempts by the defendants in City of Chicago v BP P.L.C. et al to block the court’s May 2025 order remanding the case to Cook County Circuit Court. In this lawsuit, originally filed in March 2024, Chicago is alleging that, for decades, the fossil fuel industry knowingly concealed the link between fossil fuel use and climate change to drive fossil fuel consumption, violating numerous Chicago laws and leading to “an enormous, foreseeable, and avoidable increase in anthropogenic GHG emissions and accelerated global warming, bringing devastating consequences to the City and its people.” The complaint goes on to ask the court to hold the plaintiffs financially accountable.

Administration asks court to dismiss youth-led lawsuit over energy EOs. Also on August 4, the Trump Administration asked the US District Court for the District of Montana to dismiss Lighthiser v. Trump, a youth-led lawsuit charging that three of the President’s energy-related Executive Orders (EOs) will accelerate climate change, causing “irreversible harm” to the plaintiffs and violating their constitutional rights to life and liberty. As we reported in May, the plaintiffs, among them litigants who prevailed in the landmark Held v. Montana case, charge that the EOs “falsely claim an energy emergency, while the true emergency is that fossil fuel pollution is destroying the foundation of Plaintiffs’ lives.” They are asking the US District Court for the District of Montana to invalidate the EOs and order the President, as well as 11 federal agencies also named as defendants, not to enforce or implement them. The Administration’s August 4 brief argues that the court should dismiss the case because, among other things, the plaintiffs’ claims are nonjusticiable, the plaintiffs lack Article III standing (meaning they must be able to show a concrete, personal stake in the outcome of a case), and the plaintiffs fail to plausibly allege that their climate injuries are traceable to the three challenged executive orders. On August 13, the states of Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming, as well as the Territory of Guam, asked the court to allow them to join the case as defendant-intervenors.

Charleston’s climate accountability suit is dismissed. On August 5, the Court of Common Pleas for South Carolina’s Ninth Judicial Circuit dismissed the City of Charleston’s climate accountability suit, originally filed in 2020, against two dozen energy companies. The court concluded that state tort law cannot be used to hold these multinationals accountable for damages caused by GHG emissions and that it lacked jurisdiction over the defendants. At this writing, the city is considering whether to appeal. The case is City of Charleston v. Brabham Oil Co.

DC Circuit rejects constitutional challenge to AIM Act. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has rejected a constitutional challenge to the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act. That act requires a substantial phasedown by 2036 in US production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) – fluorinated gases widely used in refrigeration, air conditioning, and other applications. The Act, the EPA states on its website, facilitates this goal in three ways: by “(1) phasing down HFC production and consumption through an allowance allocation program, (2) facilitating sector-based transitions to next-generation technologies, and (3) issuing certain regulations for purposes of maximizing reclamation and minimizing releases of HFCs from equipment.” The plaintiff argued, among other things, that the AIM Act unconstitutionally delegates legislative power to the EPA. The court noted in its August 1 ruling that to avoid a non-delegation claim, legislation “must contain an ‘intelligible principle’ to guide an agency’s action.” The Aim Act, the court concluded, “easily passes muster.” The case is iGas Holdings, Inc., et al., v. EPA.

Supply chain integrity

DHS adds 5 Chinese industries, including steel and lithium, as high priority sectors for UFLPA border enforcement. On August 19, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it is designating five additional Chinese sectors as high priorities for enforcement under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). Enacted in 2021, the UFLPA aims to “ensure that goods made with forced labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region [XUAR] of the People’s Republic of China do not enter the United States market.” It creates a rebuttable presumption that goods with any input from the Xinjiang Region in the People’s Republic of China or made by certain entities were manufactured in part or wholly by forced labor and, therefore, are prohibited from entry into the United States. To overcome the rebuttable presumption and receive an exception from US Customs and Border Protection, importers must meet a high evidentiary standard in demonstrating that the goods were not made with forced labor, among other requirements. The five new categories are steel, copper, lithium, caustic soda – which has numerous industrial applications – and red dates.

Australia: Consultation on strengthening the Modern Slavery Act. Australia’s Attorney-General has opened a public consultation process seeking input from the public on ways to strengthen the Modern Slavery Act 2018. The government’s press release on the consultation states that the Act is “a key pillar of Australia’s response to modern slavery. It requires certain large businesses based or operating in Australia to report on how they assess and address modern slavery risks in their operations and supply chains.” The consultation particularly seeks suggestions on enhancing the reporting framework for covered businesses,” to simplify and improve reporting, and address non compliance.” The consultation period closes on September 1. You may also be interested in our reports on modern slavery legislation in Canada and New Zealand.

Wright: EPA is “reviewing” and planning “updated” National Climate Assessments, plus latest developments around the Endangerment Finding. During an August 5 appearance on the CNN program The Source, Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated that the EPA is “reviewing” past versions of the National Climate Assessment (NCA) “and we will come out with updated reports.” The National Climate Assessment is a Congressionally mandated scientific report issued every four to five years summarizing the impacts of climate change on the US. Regarded as a pre-eminent source of scientific information, the NCA supports decision-making by governments, researchers, and businesses. In April, the Administration eliminated funding for the US Global Change Research Program, terminating the hundreds of scientists already working on the 2028 NCA. In July, the purpose-built website housing the 2023 NCA went dark. Relatedly, on July 23, the EPA proposed revoking the Endangerment Finding – the foundation for GHG regulation under the Clean Air Act and the backbone of US climate policy; that same day, the Department of Energy (DOE) released A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate, a report written by five contributors over two months that questions the severity of climate change.

Hundreds of veteran climate scientists have responded to these developments. Among their actions, during the week of August 4, the National Academy of Sciences announced it is fast-tracking a comprehensive, self-funded review of climate science findings since 2009, the year the Endangerment Finding was originally issued. In September, the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society will issue a formal call for manuscripts on climate change in the US. Of note, the scientists involved in these and other similar efforts are not claiming their work will be sufficient to replace the National Climate Assessment.

On August 12, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists filed suit in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Secretary Wright, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA, and the DOE, alleging that they utilized an unlawful advisory committee that worked in secret for months to produce a report for DOE and EPA that would provide justification for their predetermined goal of rescinding the Endangerment Finding, arguing that federal law does not permit agencies to create or rely on such secret, unaccountable groups when engaged in policymaking. That case, in its earliest stages, is Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Wright.

On August 15, Dr. H. Christopher Frey, formerly the EPA’s Deputy Assistant Administrator for Science Policy, filed a “request for correction”– a formal mechanism calling on the DOE to remedy inaccuracies in the July 23 report that violate federal quality guidelines. In an article looking at legal concerns about the report, Dr. Frey noted that in their attempts to rescind the Endangerment Finding, “the Energy Department and the EPA seem to have run afoul of four laws in particular that may be tricky for the administration to get around.”

IEA: Electricity generation from renewables will overtake coal as soon as this year. As the global demand for electricity continues to expand, the International Energy Agency (IEA) states, electricity generation from renewable energy sources is forecast to overtake coal-fired generation as the world’s leading source of electricity as early as 2025 or by 2026. Natural gas and nuclear power will also play increasingly significant roles in electricity generation. The IEA’s forecast is set out in its Electricity Mid-Year Update 2025. The world’s growing demand for electricity, IEA concludes, will primarily be met by wind and solar photovoltaic energy, which it predicts will cover over 90 percent of the increase in global electricity demand in 2025; hydro power will modestly enhance renewables’ reach. Coal’s importance, the IEA states, will continue to slowly decline, while the US, India, and other Asian countries have increased their dependence on coal-fired generation, its use is shrinking in the EU and China. Alongside that shift, nuclear power generation is set to hit a new record in 2025, and will continue to rise in 2026, and multiple regions are switching from coal to gas to generate electricity. See the Electricity Mid-Year Update 2025 here.

Philippines to introduce Carbon Credit Policy. The Department of Energy (DOE) of the Philippines will launch a Carbon Credit Policy for its energy sector. In his announcement on August 18, Energy Undersecretary Felix William B. Fuentebella stated that the policy “will equip our energy sector with the tools to generate and manage carbon credits with integrity, ensuring every ton of reduced carbon dioxide is real and verifiable.” The policy advances the Philippines’ recent moves to advance its commitment to the clean energy transition, among them its 2024 Memorandum of Understanding with Singapore to collaborate on carbon credits under Paris Agreement Article 6, which supports international cooperation to tackle climate change and unlock financial support for developing countries.

Germany: Cabinet approves two draft bills supporting climate goals. On August 6, Germany’s federal cabinet approved two draft bills to support the energy transition. The first, addressing Germany’s goal of eliminating fossil fuel-based heating by 2045, would accelerate the development of geothermal energy projects. The draft bill would streamline the current regulatory process and would classify geothermal plants, heat pumps, thermal storage, and district heating pipelines as of ""overriding public interest"" – the same classification already applied to wind and solar projects. The second draft bill approved by the cabinet would amend the Carbon Dioxide Storage Act to accelerate planning and approval for CO2 capture, transport, and storage projects. This measure particularly addresses the concerns of companies in hard-to-abate industries – such as cement and lime production – allowing them, with state approval, to store CO2 offshore, under the seabed, or inland. CO2 capture projects would also be reclassified as of “overriding public interest.” Both draft bills now go to the Bundestag.

Sustainability in financial services

Significant decline in banks’ fossil fuel project financing. Financing from Wall Street’s top six banks for fossil fuel projects has significantly declined so far this year compared to the same period in 2024, according to data compiled by BloombergNEF, a research division of Bloomberg LP. Reviewing data on investments made from January 1 to August 1, researchers found that this year the most prominent banks invested $73 billion in oil, gas, and coal projects, a decline of 25 percent over the same time frame last year. Bloomberg reporter Alastair Marsh observed, “The statistics suggest that, despite political headwinds, US banks may now be reducing emissions in response to the forces of capitalism.”

“Fair banking” Executive Order targets politicized debanking and reputational risk. President Donald Trump’s August 7 Executive Order “Guaranteeing Fair Banking for all Americans” broadly prohibits banks and other financial institutions from engaging in politicized or unlawful debanking – essentially, from restricting or denying credit, deposit, or other financial services to customers and potential customers based on political or religious beliefs or lawful business activities. Our alert sets out proactive steps supervised institutions may wish to consider in this evolving landscape.

China updates Green Taxonomy via new Catalog of Green Finance Endorsed Products. Aiming to boost liquidity in green finance, China has announced that it is updating its Green Taxonomy, consolidating formerly separate bond and loan market standards for economic activities into a single Catalog of Green Finance Endorsed Products. That catalog defines the economic activities that qualify as green or environmentally sustainable across a wide swathe of industries. Issued by the People’s Bank of China, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and the National Financial Regulatory Administration, the catalog goes into effect on October 1.

CHEYENNE, Wyo. — Wyoming regulators will assume oversight for toxic coal ash storage and remediation at coal-fired power plants in the state — a role historically handled by federal regulators.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced his agency’s proposal to grant primacy of the Coal Combustion Residuals program to the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality at a press conference Thursday at the Capitol.

“Wyoming has been trying very hard for years to be able to take primacy, to take control over its own destiny in overseeing coal combustion residuals,” Zeldin told a roomful of reporters, EPA staffers and a handful of Wyoming lawmakers. “One of the principles at the EPA is advancing cooperative federalism. It is our desire to improve our relationship with states [and] local governments.”

Zeldin was joined by a trio of Republicans — EPA Region 8 Administrator Cyrus Western (a former Wyoming lawmaker), Gov. Mark Gordon and Wyoming U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis — along with Wyoming DEQ Director Todd Parfitt. Each praised Zeldin and the rest of the Trump administration for putting states in charge of federal environmental programs and for rolling back federal regulations on fossil fuel industries — most of which were an overreach by Democratic administrations that stifle innovation and the U.S. economy, they said.

“I couldn’t believe that Lee Zeldin was willing to take the EPA on,” Lummis said. “What a heavy lift, because it had been used in this country to thwart economic activity and to second guess the experts in this deal, and it changed in a heartbeat. It changed the minute that Lee Zeldin became the administrator.”

Gordon concurred.

“You are a marvelous breath of fresh air,” he said. “We dealt with an administration that used regulation to frustrate progress, and I think, today, it is a remarkable moment to talk about how regulation, in Wyoming, is about doing things the right way.”

Coal ash

When power plants burn coal, heavy residues, known as clinker and slag, accumulate within the exhaust systems. It also produces a finer ash, most of which is captured via various filtration methods. All of those residuals are toxic. The substances are typically stored in coal ash ponds, and federal regulations — specifically, the Coal Combustion Residuals program — require that the sites be lined with materials to prevent seepage into surface waters or aquifers.

The program also requires monitoring to ensure containment.

There are only four active and two legacy coal ash sites in Wyoming that fall under the federal program, according to Wyoming DEQ. The only change in granting the DEQ primacy over the management of those sites, Parfitt told WyoFile, is that the state agency will add environmental stipulations to ensure protections.

Zeldin’s declaration on Thursday kicked off a 60-day public comment period on the proposal. The EPA will also hold a public hearing on Oct. 30 in Cheyenne. For more information about how to comment, and about the public hearing, go to the EPA’s Wyoming CCR permit program webpage.

The short answer is something, rather than nothing. Yes, the Earth is well past the 1.5 degree Celsius average temperature rise that was widely seen, and is, the tipping point for global warming and the consequent weather and ocean-rise factors from which there is no real return, at least for hundreds of years.

“California wildfires burn as much carbon into the atmosphere as cars and trucks and natural-gas turbines!” we are told. Well, let’s then work on dampening down wildfires while we’re at it. One thing that contributes to more of them is hot and dry wildlands.

“But India and China are big emissions cheaters,” we are told, “always with the new coal plants!” The idea that this should prevent us from leading the way in cutting back on the dirtiest form of energy production makes zero political or scientific sense.

“And California is just one state. Why get cracking on green energy here when they won’t in Wyoming” cry the do-nothings. Just because your neighbor lives a life of crime is no reason to become a jewel thief. There are other glamour professions.

“But the planet is old, and big. Puny humans can’t affect it.”: This is universally acknowledged by people who have studied the matter, i.e. scientists, and not just guys who make stuff up and then write a letter to the editor, that this is demonstrably not the case, and has not been since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, when the world began to be choked by smoke and smog.

Bill McKibben, the Altadena kid turned Harvard Crimson editor turned New Yorker staff writer turned Vermont college professor, who in 1989 wrote the doomsday book “The End of Nature,” now acknowledges that though nature did “end” — humans, though part of nature, have affected the climate in ways that are not natural — we still have it within our power to mitigate the problem.

His new book, “Here Comes the Sun: A Last Chance for the Climate and a Fresh Chance for Civilization,” published this month, is undoomsday optimistic.

He notes that in our own state we have almost halved the use of natural gas in just the last two years, progress for California that can be modeled elsewhere.

Writing the book’s introduction during a Vermont rain last winter that should have been snow, he notes that “2024 was the hottest year on record — indeed, the paleoclimatologists said it had been the hottest year in the last 125,000.” The local hook: “Oh, and Los Angeles caught fire; among the least important results of that conflagration was that the home of my earliest memories, up against the Altadena hills, burned to the ground.”

What gives McKibben hope, he writes, is that within the last several years we crossed the point at which “producing energy from the sun dropped below the cost of fossil fuel.” It is no longer “the Whole Foods of power — nice, but pricey.” Photovoltaic cells and wind turbines as well are now “the Costco of energy, inexpensive and available in bulk.”

Problem is, of course, in this nation at least, that we live in the short term under the rule of a president who claims to believe, because he made it up, that “climate change is a hoax.” Not only that; as a headline that ran on the second day of his return to the Oval Office has it, “Trump Wants to Unleash Energy, as Long as It’s Not Wind or Solar.”

He doesn’t like the look of turbines off Nantucket, and he notes that the sun disappears at night. What, you think the Santa Barbara surfers like the looks of the oil derricks off Rincon?

Solar and wind aren’t the only answers. Responsible energy use by us all during the transition; battery research in our universities; sustainable building practices — all will help, until we rid ourselves of the president who said of solar on the campaign trail: “It’s all steel and glass and wires.

The administration of President Trump is creating unhealthy fish stocks in two ways — by deregulating fishing and by denying climate impacts on fish and habitat and increasing our nation’s focus on producing fossil fuels that continue to harm habitat, fish and fisheries.
Historically, we have opened and closed fisheries to make sure we maintain fish stocks at sustainable levels.
""Anglers are now targeting tautog, the water is clear, and they are starting to catch fish,"" Holland said.
Keeper fish are averaging 3 to 5 pounds.” Olson said: “No reports yet of keeper fish being caught in the Bay but some good reports from anglers fishing structure off Narragansett.""","The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management halted construction of the Revolution Wind offshore wind farm in Rhode Island, citing national security interests.

The project, which is 80% complete, has faced criticism from some fishermen while being supported by others for its potential to create jobs and contribute to clean energy.

Senator Jack Reed disputes the national security rationale, stating the Defense Department and Coast Guard were involved in the project's review.

Matthew Giacona, the acting director of the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, halted construction at Revolution Wind off Rhode Island on Aug. 22, because of “national security interests of the United States and prevention of interference with reasonable uses of the exclusive economic zone.”

Revolution Wind is 80% built with 45 of 65 turbines installed. The project is estimated to cost more than $1 billion and, according to union officials, has generated about 1,000 jobs.

I see negative climate impacts on the water every day and they have been created by humans burning fossil fuels and are growing exponentially. I cancel charter trips 20% more often now due to high seas and storms.

The administration of President Trump is creating unhealthy fish stocks in two ways — by deregulating fishing and by denying climate impacts on fish and habitat and increasing our nation’s focus on producing fossil fuels that continue to harm habitat, fish and fisheries.

Deregulation is simple to understand. Historically, we have opened and closed fisheries to make sure we maintain fish stocks at sustainable levels. When we get close to a science-based quota, we close a fishery. And when we have enough fish in the water, we open it.

We need to leave enough fish in the water so they reproduce at sustainable levels or they will be fished into extinction. Hundreds of fish stocks have been protected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the federal fishing law of this nation that allows authorities to open and close fishing. The ability to do this effectively is being taken away by administration executive orders 14192 on deregulation and 14276 on seafood competitiveness.

These executive orders aim to deregulate seafood to enhance our nation’s trade balance by simply taking more fish. The answer to growing fish stocks is to support NOAA with full funding so it can conduct the proper science to meet changing ocean conditions, do appropriate stock assessments to identify the health and location of fish stocks and modernize its data systems to provide more robust fishing data. Eliminating these programs will worsen fishing conditions.

The warming Earth and oceans (the warmest ever) from sunlight and greenhouse gases have created massive and frequent wildfires, horrific storms, flooding, sea level rise, ocean acidification and warming waters that have had negative impacts on fish reproduction along with stock shifts.

We have an influx of warm-water fish here, too, with the danger of overfishing them. Large animals such as the 800-pound bluefin tuna caught this month at the mouth of Narragansett Bay, sharks of all types, whales and porpoises are feeding just a mile or two off our coast due to warm water attracting robust bait profiles, the food they like to eat.

“It’s not about national security,” said Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Reed disputed the administration's rationale for stopping the work as the Defense Department and the U.S. Coast Guard were involved in reviewing the project with the Ocean Energy Management Bureau, as with all offshore wind development, to avoid conflicts with military operations and training.

Where’s the bite?

Freshwater fishing is still good. “Young anglers in our area are fishing local ponds at Melville and the Reservoir in Middletown with success,” said Chis Holland of Sam’s Bait & Tackle in Middletown.

Striped bass, bluefish. “We now have bait including Atlantic menhaden and peanut bunker in Greenwich Bay with anglers catching bluefish off Chepiwanoxet Point in Warwick,” said Tom Olson of Ponaug Bait & Tackle in Warwick. Declan O’Donnell of Breachway Bait & Tackle in Charlestown reported: “Striped bass action has been consistent at Block Island. Fish are still ranging from 20 to 40 pounds, with some larger ones up to 50 pounds. The best bites have been early in the morning and late in the evening, with soft plastics and eel imitations.” Chris Holland of Sam’s Bait & Tackle in Middletown said: “Now that the water has cleaned up from the storm, anglers are catching striped bass and bluefish out in front of Newport and Middletown. A mixture of bait and eels is working best for shore and boat anglers.” On Sunday, angler Matt Haczynski reported a great striped bass bite in the West Passage right at the mouth. “Birds diving and fish busting from sun-up till we left around 11 a.m.,” he said.

Bonito. “The bonito bite was excellent this past week around Block Island,"" O'Donnell said. ""These large schools seem to come and go. They should be around for a while and will start pushing closer to shore once bait leaves the ponds.""

Tautog. ""Anglers are now targeting tautog, the water is clear, and they are starting to catch fish,"" Holland said. ”We caught one 21-inch tautog fishing off Newport this Wednesday; all other fish were below the 16-inch minimum size."" O’Donnell reported: “Tautog fishing has been consistent around shallow rocky structures and wrecks in waters less than 30 feet. Keeper fish are averaging 3 to 5 pounds.” Olson said: “No reports yet of keeper fish being caught in the Bay but some good reports from anglers fishing structure off Narragansett.""","https://www.providencejournal.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/28/NPRJ/85876171007-tom-richardson-bluefin-in-wind-farm-photo-d.jpeg?crop=4031,2267,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-30 20:02:40.340777

The mix of soaring travel prices, inflation, and a drop in international tourists is vastly impacting these economically vibrant US cities, and, in particular, their tourism sectors. This situation creates a further strain on the already economically distressed cities, with the exact nature of their inflation exhibiting a constant and volatile decline in the value of visitor arrivals.

The sustained drop in tourists that Las Vegas, Seattle, Portland, Detroit, and Houston are experiencing underscores a broader challenge that these cities grapple with bolstered by reduced travel demand and increased costs. Collectively, these metropolitan areas possess unique tourism assets that set them apart, but are straining from elevating travel expenses, inflation, and a drop in international travel. This collective challenge is forcing these cities to adapt.

Changing travel patterns, reduced international arrivals, increased travel expenses, and shifting visitor preferences all contribute to this downturn. Attendant with these chronic visitor declines, cities need to rethink their tourism strategies to regain and sustain international and domestic tourism. Alleviating these recoverable pressures is a common challenge that could re-position these cities as prominent travel hubs in the US.

Las Vegas

Las Vegas received 3.09 million visitors in July, a 12% decline from the previous year. For a city built almost entirely on leisure, that is a considerable setback.

Hotel occupancy rates fell to 76.1%, a steep decline from more than 83% in July 2024. The average daily room rate fell to $154.76 and revenue per available room (RevPAR) dropped from $134.05 to $117.77, a steep decline of 12.1%.

Local analysts attribute the decline to a combination of spending correction and restrained spending. After years of record visitor numbers, travel demand is now normalizing. Inflation has reduced the disposable income available to travelers. Some are also avoiding Las Vegas because of Strip hotel rates that are widely deemed to be exorbitant.

This problem extends beyond hotels. The consistent inflow of visitors is vital for casinos, entertainment venues, and shopping malls. The reduced influx of visitors has a far-reaching impact on the economy of Las Vegas.

Places to Visit

The Las Vegas Strip: The heart of the city, lined with famous casinos, hotels, and entertainment venues. Don’t miss the iconic Bellagio Fountains, the Luxor Pyramid, and the Eiffel Tower replica at Paris Las Vegas.

Seattle

Seattle documented the most significant decline among large US cities, with the number of international visitors down 27% year over year. This diminishment is particularly concerning because Seattle heavily depends on the Alaskan cruise season, which tends to bring in thousands of visitors during the summer. Additionally, Seattle boasts its own music festivals and cultural points of interest which, alongside the cruises, are likely to suffer due to the decreased number of visitors.

The increase in travel costs is one of the factors contributing to this decline. Seattle has one of the most expensive airfare and accommodation options in the US. This is bad for tourism, particularly for international tourists because, in addition to expensive travel, they have to deal with slower visa processing times.

Supplementing the aforementioned issues, the recovery of international travel, especially from countries like Japan and South Korea, is taking longer. These regions have historically contributed a lot to the tourism in Seattle, but that is no longer the case. Furthermore, Portland, Vancouver, and other Pacific Northwest cities are competing with Seattle for visitors. These other cities are more cost effective and less congested than Seattle.

Places to Visit

Tour the Seattle Great Wheel: Located on Pier 57, the Great Wheel offers views of the waterfront and the Olympic Mountains.

Portland

Portland, Oregon experienced an 18.3% drop in international tourism for the year ending July 2025. Portland has long been a beloved tourism city for its food scene, craft beer culture, and its proximity to hiking and outdoors attractions such as the Columbia River Gorge and Mount Hood. However, hiking and outdoor attractions coupled with a rise in the cost of visiting the city has resulted in a decline of tourists.

Increased inflation has substantially driven the prices of dining and accommodations in Portland. As a result, tourists looking to visit Portland for its affordable prices and uniquely crafted adventures are now visiting other similar places. Furthermore, the sharp decline in tourism brought by Canadian visitors is an important factor in the forecasted decline Portland is witnessing.

Additionally, image-related challenges stemming from safety issues and homelessness affect some regions of Portland’s downtown. These issues, which the city is working to mitigate, have resulted in negative media coverage of Portland, leading to a decrease in visitors to the city. Consequently, this is especially worrying for the local economy which is reliant on tourism to sustain businesses and employment, as the projected 18.3% decline is steep.

Places to Visit

Washington Park: A beautiful park home to Portland Japanese Garden, International Rose Test Garden, and the Oregon Zoo.

Powell’s City of Books: The world’s largest independent bookstore, spanning an entire city block.

Go brewery hopping: Portland has a thriving craft beer scene, with more than 70 breweries in the city.

Take a hike: The city is surrounded by stunning natural scenery, perfect for hiking and exploring, especially in places like Forest Park.

Detroit

Increasingly in recent years, Detroit has been in a recovery state with efforts to market itself as a cultural center enticing tourists with its rich music history, sports franchises, and ongoing urban revitalization projects. Regardless of everything in place, tourism declined by 17% in 2025, which may inhibit the city’s recovery and pose additional challenges to its economic revitalization.

This decline, in turn, is attributed to the weakening regional travel market. High regional driving and inflationary pressures in the United States is causing many visitors. to the Detroit area, to opt for cheaper and more convenient alternatives. Given how much Detroit depends on regional tourism, the city is exposed to the brunt of changes in travel patterns.

In comparison with other major U.S. cities, the international tourism numbers for Detroit are low. Efforts to diversify the tourism provided are there, and yet, the city fails to pull in visitors from other countries. With the projected 17.3% decline, sustaining tourism has become more difficult, and businesses in the city are likely to go into trouble, as tourists and visitors have become a rare sight in the coming year.

Places to Visit

Take a Detroit River cruise: See the city from the water and enjoy the views of both the Detroit skyline and Windsor, Canada.

Houston

Visitor numbers are projected to decline by 20% in Houston. The city has always depended on business tourism and conventions, particularly from the energy and aerospace sectors, but these industries are still recovering from the pandemic. Houston also faces a drop in tourism because of a decrease in international travel, particularly from Mexico and other Latin American countries.

Corporate events and trade shows have always been a vital component of Houston’s tourism; however, the rise in hybrid and remote work models has decreased the demand for in-person meetings. An international visitor segment from Latin America, once a strong source of tourism, is also declining due to unresponsive visa systems and unencouraging travel conditions.

Weaker business travel, combined with a drop in international visitors, are the key drivers behind the anticipated decline in tourism to Houston. The city has a challenge to diversify and innovate in tourism marketing strategies; however, the primary focus will have to be on regional tourism to offset the international and business tourism losses.

Places to Visit

Space Center Houston: A must-see for anyone interested in space exploration, featuring exhibits on NASA’s space missions and a chance to tour the Johnson Space Center.

Take a day trip to Galveston: Just an hour away, this coastal city offers beautiful beaches, historic sites, and fresh seafood.

Los Angeles

Los Angeles, famous for Hollywood, its beaches, and its entertainment options, is projected to experience a 10.5% decrease in tourism in 2025. While LA is still one of the most recognizable places to visit in the world, the cost of living and the rising cost of hotels and dining is inflating the budget a tourist requires to visit the city.

Like the cost for dining and attractions, hotel prices in Los Angeles have skyrocketed as well. Visitors now find no reason to spend a night in places like Hollywood and Santa Monica, because the prices are supersan mansion level. With the strong US dollar, Los Angeles is now a pricier option for international visitors, more so for those coming from European and Asian countries. In the United States, Los Angeles is now a dream city for most International tourists which is wishfully impossible to reach in terms of budget.

Los Angeles tourism sector’s 10.5% decline is particularly alarming because it has for a long time been one of the key economic engines of the area. These declines, if left unchecked, are a major economic risk for Los Angeles, especially in the tourism-reliant economic sectors.

Top Attractions:

The Hollywood Sign: One of the world’s most recognized landmarks, offering scenic views of Los Angeles.

Universal Studios Hollywood: A massive film studio and theme park offering thrilling rides and attractions.

Explore Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), the largest art museum in the west.

Spend the day shopping along Rodeo Drive or The Grove for luxury shopping experiences.

Why Are Visitors Staying Away?

The declines share common underlying reasons across all cities. The first is inflation. Families have increasingly less disposable income. Additionally, airfare, hotel, and dining costs have all surged.

The second is ageing demographics. Older travelers are visiting destinations less frequently, and a growing proportion of younger travelers opt for short, budget-friendly getaways or international destinations where their money has greater purchasing power.

The third is weaker international arrivals. Economic uncertainty coupled with a strong US dollar is dissuading foreign visitors. Cities such as Houston, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas rely heavily on international visitors, and the void created by their absence is stark.

The Ripple Effect on Local Economies

The decrease in tourism impacts more than just the hotels; local businesses suffer due to the decrease in customers. Stores have reduced sales. Restaurants have empty seats. Ride-share drivers have fewer rides. Revenue from taxes also declines, causing strain on public services.

For Las Vegas, tourism is the lifeblood that finances infrastructure, public services, and various entertainment outlets. For Seattle, cruise tourism sustains an entire cluster of businesses. In Detroit, tourism assists in alleviating an economy that still heavily relies on the auto industry. The absence of visitors is felt in a myriad of ways.

A Warning for the US Travel Industry

The July figures serve as a red flag for the entire US travel industry. It illustrates that fostering a stagnant assumption for growth in larger cities is misguided. Market shifts, demographic changes, and global demand fluctuations greatly impact them.

As travelers look for lower-priced options, smaller cities, national parks, secondary cities, beaches, and rural areas become easier to explore for budget-strapped families.

The struggle continues for larger cities as they try to devise a solution. Failing to employ the right pricing, marketing, or international engagement will cement a continued decline for the region.

In the first seven months of 2025, Las Vegas unites with Seattle, Portland, Detroit, Houston, and Los Angeles in facing a significant US tourism slump, as visitor numbers continue to plunge due to rising travel costs, inflation, and fewer international arrivals. These factors have collectively contributed to a sharp decline in tourism across these major U.S. cities.

Looking Forward

Houston, Los Angeles, and Portland, together with Seattle, Detroit, and Las Vegas, share a single concern. Each of these cities experienced a drop in visitors by double-digit percentages in July of 2025. The international visitor numbers are still lower, and the travel market is adjusting, indicating the reasons are quite straightforward.

In the near term, these urban tourism centers will depend on inflationary economies. Strong urban tourism recovery is possible in the near term if inflation eases and flight prices become more dependable. On the other hand, if the currently low demand continues, American cities will struggle with a long-term weak recovery.

Numbers concerning tourism are the primary concern, but research indicates it goes way beyond that. The fragile economies of the US depend on that the travel market reaches its optimal recovery in the shortest possible time, which is quite the concern in recent years. The numbers have shown that these declines have a direct effect on business, community, and the traveling industry.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/USA-35.jpeg,N,,2025-08-30 20:03:23.282493

However, EV growth strains road funding models.
Conclusion Post-pandemic VMT trends reveal a complex interplay of economic resilience, behavioral shifts, and policy interventions.
As infrastructure and energy sectors adapt to this new normal, investors must balance short-term recovery needs with long-term sustainability goals.","Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) has long served as a barometer of economic health and consumer behavior. Post-pandemic, the U.S. VMT rebound to 3.19 trillion miles in 2023—nearly matching 2019 levels—signals a nuanced recovery in mobility patterns, with far-reaching implications for infrastructure and energy sectors [1]. This article examines how VMT trends, shaped by macroeconomic dynamics and policy interventions, are reshaping investment landscapes.

VMT as a Leading Indicator of Macroeconomic Strength

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) projects total VMT to grow at 0.5% annually through 2050, lagging behind the 1.7% average U.S. GDP growth forecast [2]. This divergence reflects structural shifts: light-duty VMT, the largest component of travel demand, is expected to rise at 0.4% per year, while truck VMT (combination and single-unit) will grow faster (1.1% and 1.9%, respectively) due to e-commerce and supply chain demands [3]. These trends underscore a decoupling of VMT from traditional GDP correlations, driven by factors like remote work adoption and modal shifts (e.g., biking, public transit) [4].

The post-pandemic rebound also reveals behavioral shifts. Work-related trips declined, while nonwork trips (shopping, school drop-offs) surged during peak hours, straining infrastructure [5]. Traffic congestion, costing the average driver 43 hours in 2024, exacerbates operating costs, with deteriorated roads adding $1,400 annually per vehicle [6]. These pressures highlight the need for infrastructure modernization, even as VMT growth moderates.

Infrastructure Investment: Bridging the Funding Gap

The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) has allocated $591 billion since 2021, yet a $684 billion shortfall remains for roadways over the next decade [7]. State and local governments now fund 79% of infrastructure spending, with operations and maintenance accounting for 56.7% of expenditures [8]. This shift reflects the aging infrastructure backlog and the prioritization of upkeep over new projects.

Meanwhile, state-level policies are targeting VMT to meet climate goals. California’s 20% VMT reduction target by 2030 contrasts with more moderate goals in Washington and Colorado [9]. Critics argue such policies risk overlooking the economic benefits of VMT, particularly in a post-pandemic era where travel patterns remain fluid [10].

Energy Sector Dynamics: Fuel vs. Electric Vehicles

The energy sector faces a dual trajectory. While EV adoption is rising—EVs accounted for 6.7% of new vehicle sales in 2022—traditional fuel-based transportation still dominates [11]. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has spurred clean energy manufacturing, with quarterly investments tripling to $14 billion in Q1 2025, focusing on EV supply chains [12]. Public EV charging infrastructure expanded by 6.5% in Q2 2024, with DC fast chargers growing at 7.4% [13].

However, EV growth strains road funding models. Motor fuel tax (MFT) revenues are declining as fuel efficiency improves and EVs proliferate. Between 2019 and 2022, plug-in vehicle market share tripled to 6.7%, exacerbating the funding shortfall [14]. While EVs lack a ""rebound effect"" (unlike fuel-efficient vehicles, which induce more driving), their long-term impact on emissions remains limited due to the slow turnover of vehicle fleets [15].

Strategic Implications for Investors

For infrastructure investors, the key lies in aligning with state and local funding priorities, particularly in operations and maintenance. The IIJA’s $273.2 billion highway formula funding over five years offers opportunities in road resurfacing, bridge repairs, and smart mobility projects [16]. Energy investors should focus on EV supply chains and charging infrastructure, where IRA tax credits and private-sector partnerships are driving growth [17].

The energy transition also demands innovation in road funding. A shift from gas taxes to VMT-based fees could address declining revenues while incentivizing efficient travel. However, such reforms must account for equity concerns and the unique challenges posed by EVs [18].

Conclusion

Post-pandemic VMT trends reveal a complex interplay of economic resilience, behavioral shifts, and policy interventions. As infrastructure and energy sectors adapt to this new normal, investors must balance short-term recovery needs with long-term sustainability goals. The data underscores a critical truth: VMT is not just a metric—it is a lens through which to view the evolving American economy.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-30 20:02:32.563416

It does not include a road usage charge.
In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections.
Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge.","Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers began a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.

However, the special session got off to a rocky start: The state Senate met as scheduled at 9 a.m., but the state House failed to reach the two-thirds quorum required to conduct business, leaving the session in limbo as of late Friday afternoon.

Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers’ jobs are at risk, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.

Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.

The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.

“This is a pretty major change,” said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state fiscal policy team, noting “the challenge in enacting something that’s dramatically different for most drivers.”

Oregon’s transportation woes

Oregon’s transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.

Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.

Kotek’s proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state’s gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.

The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn’t have to pay supplemental registration fees.

Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle’s telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state’s decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.

Republican lawmakers, who have opposed the tax and fee increases, unveiled a different proposal Friday that largely focuses on lifting funding restrictions to allow the transportation department to spend more money on maintenance operations, including by redirecting dollars earmarked for public transit and efforts to combat climate change toward such operations. It does not include a road usage charge.

As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state’s total vehicles, he said.

Hawaii launches program

Under Hawaii’s program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.

In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.

Questions about privacy and fairness

In past surveys commissioned by Oregon’s transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.

Oregon’s voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they’re more expensive and can be removed, he added.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.

Many people don’t realize that “both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,” said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.

Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.

“We are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,” Morgan said.",https://www.ktalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/08/68b2595c73b824.90454694.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-30 20:04:01.171471

The delay was supported by Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA), which had called for the penalties to be delayed for 20 years, saying prices were determined by global oil markets and not the state’s policies.

The state’s Consumer Watchdog group faulted the change in direction by California officials. “By taking the penalty off the table, you are opening the market to the price spikes we suffered in 2022,” said Consumer Watchdog President Jamie Court in a letter prior to the vote.

In addition to putting penalties on hold, the commission also voted to adopt policies to stabilize California’s refinery capacity, increase motor fuel imports and promote development of the state’s oil reserves. California is isolated by the Rocky Mountains from the U.S. refining centers along the U.S. Gulf Coast and in the Midwest. The state relies on what plants in that state and Washington can make as well as imports from Asian refineries.

The rule establishes areas of the National Forest System managed according to regulations that generally limit timber harvesting and road building.
Wood characterized the decision to rescind the Roadless Rule as “a solution in search of a problem.” “These are typically higher elevation areas, so they have steep slopes.
“Roadless areas are often these kinds of tendrils that snake off of wilderness areas,” Tom Wheeler, executive director of the Environmental Protection Information Center, told the Times-Standard on Thursday.
Wheeler said that while designated wilderness areas are often higher in elevation with limited ecological value, roadless areas represent a lot of critical habitat that has historically been inaccessible to the logging industry.","Last week, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins announced that the USDA had entered the next phase of its plan to rescind its 2001 Roadless Rule, beginning a public comment period that will last until Sept. 19. The rule establishes areas of the National Forest System managed according to regulations that generally limit timber harvesting and road building. Its rescission would open some 45 million acres spread across 36 states to timber harvest and road-building projects.

In a press release on the rescission process, Rollins described the rule as “burdensome, outdated, one-size-fits-all regulations that not only put people and livelihoods at risk but also stifle economic growth in rural America.”

Environmental groups contend that roadless areas have an outsized impact on protecting water quality and habitat for species such as salmon and trout. They also say that the roadless rule makes little economic sense — allowing for timber harvesting in mostly exceedingly remote, high-elevation areas ill-suited for logging and potentially putting the onus on the U.S. Forest Service to maintain roads in areas where the agency lacks the resources to do so.

Protecting species and water quality

Trout Unlimited President and CEO Chris Wood told the Times-Standard that, though they make up just 2% of the U.S. landscape, roadless areas “harbor about 25% of … imperiled species … (and) they also provide drinking water sources to nearly 60 million Americans.”

“It’s difficult to overstate their importance in terms of fishing and wildlife and water resources,” Wood said.

Wood characterized the decision to rescind the Roadless Rule as “a solution in search of a problem.”

“These are typically higher elevation areas, so they have steep slopes. They’re highly erosive. They’re hard to get to, so they’re very expensive to get to. The timber that remains there is very low value …” Wood said. “And so you’re talking about losing taxpayer money to get into really hard-to-access areas while compromising things like water quality and hunting and fishing. It just doesn’t make a lot of ecological or economical sense.”

While unsuitable for logging, roadless areas — including roughly 4.4 million acres in California — do have enormous benefits in terms of preserving species like salmonids and critically endangered and threatened species.

“Roadless areas are often these kinds of tendrils that snake off of wilderness areas,” Tom Wheeler, executive director of the Environmental Protection Information Center, told the Times-Standard on Thursday.

Wheeler said that while designated wilderness areas are often higher in elevation with limited ecological value, roadless areas represent a lot of critical habitat that has historically been inaccessible to the logging industry. ““These roadless areas are really important ecologically; roads have a pretty profound effect on biodiversity, and so these roadless areas are … habitat refugia for wildlife … These areas also have remnant old growth in a way that other areas of the forest don’t.”

Habitat preservation

In a press release, Wheeler added: “Roadless areas support old-growth forests, rare plant communities, and essential wildlife corridors for species such as the northern spotted owl, Pacific fisher, and Humboldt marten … Roadless areas serve as critical refugia and connectivity corridors for wildlife. Opening them to new roads and logging undermines what makes Humboldt great.”

Friends of the Eel River Conservation Director Scott Greacen told the Times-Standard that roadless areas along the Eel River watershed — which is suffering from a protracted salmonid population collapse — have been vital in preserving the remaining population of those fish.

“What we have, for example, in the Eel River watershed are some roadless lands up on the South Fork of the Van Duzen — the Little Van Duzen — that are a big part of the reason I think that we’ve still got summer steelhead in that drainage, because those forests are keeping cold, clean water coming regularly downstream to the steelhead and summer steelhead that are still in the Little Van Duzen,” Greacen said.

“And there’s a whole story there about how we have these two remnant populations of this fish, the summer steelhead on the Van Duzen and the middle Eel. We’re trying to bring them back on the upper main stem Eel with dam removal, but we really are hanging on to these remnant populations of this incredibly well-adapted fish that has unfortunately suffered a lot from human impacts. And you know, one of the places where there are populations that are hanging on is in the Van Duzen.”

Reasons behind roadless rules

Wood, who worked on the development of the 2001 Roadless Rule nearly 25 years ago, said that the Forest Service had developed its approach to roadless areas, in large part, because it had been saddled with an overly extensive pre-modern network of 270,000 miles of roads. That amount has subsequently increased to 380,000 miles, all subsidized by U.S. taxpayers.

“The Forest Service had an $8.6 billion maintenance backlog on its existing road system, that’s just roads across the National Forest System,” Wood said, “probably 98% of which were built to facilitate the harvest of timber … So the reason that we did the roadless rule, it was like, ‘Why are we spending so much money to build this road network we can’t afford to take care of? This doesn’t make sense.’ The height of conservativism is to make sure you take care of your investments before you make new ones, and that was basically the premise of the Roadless Rule, and that’s why I think it served us well for so long.

Greacen said that the 2001 adoption of the USDA’s Roadless Rule represented a realignment of the U.S. Forest Service’s values in the face of mounting maintenance costs as the service’s priorities began to shift from facilitating timber harvest and other areas of forest management to, increasingly, combating wildfires.

“Basically the decision was less that these areas need to not have roads in them as ‘we’re going to put an end to the assumption that we’re going to put a road in every part of every national forest’ because that’s too expensive and it doesn’t actually line up with the agency’s larger mission,’ which from the very beginning, was protecting water sources, among other things,” Greacen said.

Greacen said that the Roadless Rule, since its introduction, has become a sort of “political football,” with political opposition to the rule based less in the realities of economics and policy than it is in signaling an antagonism toward regulation in general.

Fire prevention

The Trump administration and the USDA contend that roadless rules have been a hindrance to wildfire prevention.

“For nearly 25 years, the Roadless Rule has frustrated land managers and served as a barrier to action — prohibiting road construction, which has limited wildfire suppression and active forest management,” said Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz, in a press release on the rescission efforts.

That assertion is refuted by many experts, who note that roads are one of the primary vectors that cause wildfires and that mature forest in remote and difficult-to-access roadless areas is among the most resilient to fire.

“Roadless areas are some of the most wildfire-resilient landscapes in North America because they are the least degraded by industrial logging and road-building that would have converted fire-adapted native forests into fire-prone tree farms, and provided road access for human-caused ignitions from careless recreationists and sociopathic arsonists,” said Timothy Ingalsbee, executive director of Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics, and Ecology, in a news release. “We need to be more strategic and selective with the places we put young bodies to fight fires, and these should be near at-risk communities, not in rugged, remote wildlands. Tearing open roadless areas to industrial logging and road-building will do wildland firefighters no favors — just the opposite.”

Greacen noted that fire suppression, in part because it’s a complicated topic, has become “easy to demagogue” for Republican administrations seeking to advance extractive industry goals that have little to do with wildfire prevention. He said that while Roadless Rule rescission might not have an immediate and dramatic impact on national forest-goers, he sees it as part of a greater effort on the part of the current administration to erode protections on public lands.

“They’ve at least made representations that their intent is to dramatically increase the timber production on American public lands,” Greacen said. “We’ve heard the same rhetoric before, but you know, there are a lot of ways in which this administration is doing things that the far right and the right have been proclaiming their intention to do for a long time. And a lot of people kind of didn’t take them seriously after a while because they seemed so out of touch with reality, but here they are doing it.”

By doing this, the government would be able to treat projects involving fusion energy the same as other clean energy projects, such as solar or wind energy.
It's exciting news, as fusion energy is seen as a way to alleviate or solve many of the world's energy problems.
Fusion energy is created when two light atoms combine, forming a heavier atom, and could theoretically provide a virtually unlimited source of clean energy.
Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said in a statement: ""The future of fusion energy starts now.","Fusion energy is a step closer, at least in the U.K.

The country's government announced it would create a National Policy Statement to help clear the way for fusion energy projects. This makes the U.K. the first country to develop planning rules specifically for fusion energy.

According to World Nuclear News, prior to the new policy, any fusion projects in the U.K. were required to submit an application to begin work.

However, there was no formal guidance on which sites were appropriate, nor were there specific timelines for approval. That meant applications could take quite a while to be approved, which further delayed the development of fusion technology.

With the National Policy Statement, the government would introduce fusion energy into the Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project system. By doing this, the government would be able to treat projects involving fusion energy the same as other clean energy projects, such as solar or wind energy.

As the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero explained, ""The introduction of a National Policy Statement will provide clarity to developers and streamline the planning process for fusion, giving applicants clearer guidance on where and how quickly projects can be developed.""

It's exciting news, as fusion energy is seen as a way to alleviate or solve many of the world's energy problems.

Fusion energy is created when two light atoms combine, forming a heavier atom, and could theoretically provide a virtually unlimited source of clean energy.

With such an abundant clean energy source, individuals, businesses, and cities could see a significant reduction in energy bills, saving money while also using resources more efficiently.

This type of clean energy might even help ensure people have enough clean water to drink and food to eat, as it can make it less expensive for governments and farmers to utilize technologies like water desalination or vertical farming.

With more diversified clean energy sources, the world could stop relying on dirty energy sources that are responsible for heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, which raise global temperatures. The result could be a cooler planet, as well as cleaner water and air, and reduced health issues in our communities.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said in a statement: ""The future of fusion energy starts now.

Almost $10,000 worth of tax credits for drivers looking to get hold of an electric vehicle will soon be unavailable.

What is the clean vehicle tax credit?

Drivers are set to lose out on $7,500 in tax credits and $4,000 in used EV credit on September 30.

Congress first approved the tax breaks for EV drivers in 2008, it was expanded in 2022 to cover leased vehicles.

A manufacturer cap of 200,000 vehicles was also implemented in the 2022 legislation change.

Now legislation approved by Congress on Thursday will see drivers lose their EV tax credits when buying or leasing a new car.

Still time to cash in

With Labour Day just around the corner the opportunity for car makers to roll out exciting promotions on new models is fast approaching.

Drivers will find the best deals on electric motors this year with motorists scrambling to lease an EV before the tax credits expire on September 30.

EV tax credit savings

The tax credit can save EV leaseholders an average of $208 a month spread across a 36-month lease.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, drivers of fully electric vehicles can save up to $2,200 per year on fuel.

The IRS is reportedly allowing consumers more wiggle room to claim the EV tax credit before it ends.

Eligibility for the credit was originally tied to a vehicle's delivery date.

However, this month the IRS issued a notice clarifying that consumers are eligible for credit if they sign a contract for a vehicle before September 30 and make a payment.

This can include putting money down or trading in a car and applies even if the vehicle isn't delivered until after the deadline.

How to qualify for the credits

It comes as President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill was recently signed into law and includes a clause that ends current federal clean-vehicle tax credits.

Anyone looking to capitalise on the tax credits before they are cut will need to confirm their income qualifies.

The purchase credit disappears once modified adjusted gross income tops $300,000 for joint filers, $225,000 for heads of household or $150,000 for single filers.

Only plug in vehicles count so mild hybrids will not be able to qualify for the tax credit.

Anyone hoping to get a tax cut will need to pick a vehicle from the approved list.

Final assembly of the motor must occur in North America for the vehicle to be eligible.

On top of this the sticker price must not exceed $80,000 for trucks, vans, and SUVs, or $55,000 for cars.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/08/2025-us-president-donald-trump-1018552869.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-08-30 18:01:36.037213

Colgate-Palmolive has outlined a clear approach to sustainability, social impact and environmental targets across its 2024 Sustainability and Social Impact Report.

With a footprint in over 70 countries and a portfolio of mass-market goods, the company places its manufacturing responsibilities at the centre of its climate and ESG strategies.

Its programme is structured around three core pillars: supporting communities, reaching homes globally and reducing environmental harm.

Strategy embedded across manufacturing and supply chain operations

Colgate-Palmolive manages ESG risks through its Enterprise Risk Management framework.

This process identifies climate transition and plastic transition as critical issues within its global operations. However, it notes that these risks also provide opportunities to create new industrial solutions, enhance reputation and reinforce compliance with responsible business expectations.

The company has established a cross-functional ESG Reporting Task Force. This internal group ensures Colgate’s data and policies align with current and incoming ESG disclosure requirements.

The structure supports real-time alignment between investor, customer and regulatory expectations and the company’s operational priorities.

Materiality assessments shape Colgate’s approach, ensuring its business goals reflect stakeholder input.

Across operations, sustainability is embedded in risk management protocols, procurement procedures and product innovation cycles.

Metrics are tracked using widely accepted sustainability frameworks, including progress against 14 of the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Ann Tracy, Colgate-Palmolive’s Chief Sustainability Officer, says: “Our sustainability efforts also help to strengthen our business. We believe that some consumers favour brands from companies that act responsibly and will recognise our leadership in this space and choose our brands.

“We are proud of our progress so far, but there is more work to be done. We strive to be better for the people who use our products and drive value throughout our business. Getting this principle right will result in reducing our impact on the planet.”

Materials, emissions and process targets

The report highlights targeted achievements across Colgate’s packaging, energy and resource programmes.

One of the centrepieces of its industrial sustainability approach is packaging. The company manufactures a recyclable toothpaste tube, now used across more than 70 global markets.

In North America, 95% of tubes are converted to recyclable formats and, by the end of 2024, 93% of Colgate’s packaging was recyclable, reusable or compostable.

Material sourcing has also evolved, with virgin plastic reduced by 25% from a 2019 baseline. At the same time, 21% of packaging content in 2024 was made from post-consumer recycled materials.

These actions align with 2025 targets set through the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Global Plastics Commitment, which includes:

A one-third reduction in virgin plastic usage

25% post-consumer recycled plastic content in packaging

Elimination of problematic or unnecessary packaging

The company continues to secure renewable energy agreements, aligning with a net zero carbon emissions goal set for 2040.

It is also addressing the physical and transitional climate risks across its factories, warehouses and distribution systems. Strategic alliances with the U.S. Plastics Pact, The Recycling Partnership and startups have also supported operational improvements across waste and emissions performance.

This work supports Colgate’s broader framework which includes efficient design, responsible sourcing and promoting circular manufacturing systems. The business continues to encourage internal and external behavioural change to reduce its environmental footprint across product lifecycles.

2030 and 2040 environmental goals

Colgate has confirmed two major climate targets across the next 15 years.

By 2030:

Move from annually sourcing 35% renewable electricity in 2020 to 100%

Cut Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from Purchased Goods and Services by 42% against 2020 levels

Reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in operations by 42% from 2020

By 2040:

Reach net zero carbon emissions across its entire value chain, excluding optional Scope 3 categories per the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Net Zero Standard

Cut Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 90% from a 2020 baseline, excluding Scope 3 categories 9, 11 and 12 and optional emissions per SBTi Net Zero Standard

Ann wrote on LinkedIn: “At Colgate-Palmolive, we're committed to reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets and our planet. We are driving social impact, helping millions of homes and preserving our environment.”

Supply chain systems and external partnerships

Colgate targets sustainable sourcing through its raw material suppliers, with a particular focus on palm oil and soy.

The company uses certified material streams, satellite-based geospatial monitoring and supplier engagement programmes to ensure ethical, transparent sourcing. The aim is to build a conversion- and deforestation-free supply chain while improving resilience across its sourcing network.

Water stewardship is another area of focus, supported through Colgate’s involvement in the CDP Water Supply Chain Program and localised outreach such as webinars in water-stressed areas.

To this end, the company promotes best practice in water risk management among its suppliers, ensuring downstream accountability.

Human rights initiatives run alongside environmental goals. Colgate partners with the Fair Labor Association to enhance labour standards and enforce responsible recruitment practices in its Malaysian palm oil supply.

It is also a member of industry alliances like the Forest Positive Coalition and prioritises recycled content in pulp and paper purchasing to lessen environmental impact.

These actions embed ESG into the company's procurement processes and manufacturing footprint, providing both risk mitigation and improved economic resilience for supplier communities.

But momentum for EV charging in the Pittsburgh area will continue with or without the program, as businesses look to serve customers with convenient refueling locations.

The Trump administration halted the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program in February, saying it needed to be updated to align with current policy and priorities.

The roll out of the NEVI program had been slow, attracting critiques of being inefficient. Of the six projects awarded in Allegheny County, only one is complete.

The Biden administration set requirements to try to ensure that chargers would benefit disadvantaged communities and minority-owned businesses and be spaced evenly along major highways.

Now the Trump administration has thrown out those conditions.

Trump administration reluctantly resumes funding for EV chargers

Electric vehicle owners in Pa. will need to pay an extra fee starting in 2025

Ryan McKinnon with the Charge Ahead Partnership, a business group, said he’s cautiously optimistic about the new guidance.

“Eliminating a million requirements that made it impossible for states to implement the program is overall good for clean energy,” McKinnon said.

He added that, while public funding is helpful, most charging is being driven by the private sector.

That’s true for Southwestern Pennsylvania, according to Sarah Olexsak, general manager of electrification solutions for Duquesne Light Company.

“When we think about what’s driving the growth of public charging stations in the Pittsburgh region it’s really being driven by our commercial customers,” Olexsak said.

Olexsak said small businesses are looking to build chargers as a way to attract customers. She also credited municipalities with building charging stations to serve their residents and visitors.

DLC offers a program through which it covers the cost of engineering and construction to ready a site for a charging station. The commercial customer then installs the charger, agrees to maintain it, and pays for the electricity to power it.

Olexsak said the utility has helped install more than 350 charging ports at 50 locations to date and has another 100 ports planned at ten sites.

However, Olexsak said incentives will remain important for encouraging future charging infrastructure to meet projected needs.

“Today we have about 700 public level two charging station ports in our territory. To support the number of EVs on the road in 2030, we still need to increase that by over six fold,” she said.

The number of EVs in the Pittsburgh region is expected to grow from 18,000 today to 50,000 by 2030, Olexsak said.

Pennsylvania has been at the front of the pack in contracting charging sites through NEVI. The state has obligated 90 projects, with 18 of them operational.

PennDOT spokesperson Zachary Appleby said the new federal guidance will have no effect on the previously contracted projects.

“Pennsylvania achieved full buildout of its Alternative Fuel Corridor in January 2025 and has been ready to move forward into the next stages of the NEVI program, but without federal guidelines, we were unable to move forward as quickly as we could have,” Appleby said.

Initial NEVI-funded chargers were placed in 50-mile intervals along major highways. The next phase of NEVI funding is slated to build community-focused charging stations.

Matt Stephens-Rich with the Electrification Coalition said NEVI-backed sites create a “core backbone of charging” that can support a larger network spread on secondary roads and in towns.

He said Pennsylvania’s plan for NEVI funds has acted as a market indicator, encouraging businesses to install their own chargers.

“ We still have a lot more to go as we continue to grow the EV market across America and also growing the charging to meet it,” Stephens-Rich said “We do expect to see additional private dollars also coming in as the market continues to grow and expand.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.alleghenyfront.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EV-charging.jpg?fit=1760%2C1320&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-30 19:01:42.148446

Under the new federal budget, tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act available to Wisconsin businesses, utilities and school districts are now ending much earlier than intended.
Hicks emphasized the dire implications on the climate change crisis as Wisconsin is already facing impacts such as historic floods, unsafe air quality and record-breaking temperatures.
“We need to meet the moment to address climate change and the position that we’re in right now,” Hicks underscored.
“Because of Derek Van Orden’s votes and his colleagues in the Republican delegation in Wisconsin who voted for this bill, they’re putting us at a severe disadvantage to address climate change.”","Clean energy advocates in Wisconsin are warning that federal tax incentives and funding rollbacks will raise energy costs, cut jobs and deter necessary efforts to address climate change.

Under the new federal budget, tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act available to Wisconsin businesses, utilities and school districts are now ending much earlier than intended.

Casey Hicks, federal government affairs manager for the group Wisconsin Conservation Voters, said incentives for homeowners are being canceled even sooner than other entities, creating uncertainty which leads to project delays and cancellations.

“Without the tax credits, the grants, the incentives to help those projects along, we’re going to be in a bind where we have way more demand for energy because of things like AI data centers,” Hicks pointed out. “And not being able to meet that demand.”

A grant which would have helped low-income residents in Milwaukee make their homes more energy efficient is being revoked. Hicks noted now, utility rates for residents across the state are projected to increase by more than $450 a year by 2035. Supporters of the repeal argued the tax credits were costly and fueled by misguided policy.

Hicks explained Wisconsin has no natural resources of coal, oil or natural gas, which requires it to import energy, costing the state more than $14 billion a year. Hicks argued incentives which were supposed to continue under the Inflation Reduction Act would have accelerated the transition to clean energy, saved the state money and increased Wisconsin’s energy independence, while creating thousands of jobs.

“Because of this bill that was passed recently, Wisconsin could end up seeing about 11,000 jobs go away by 2030,” Hicks reported.

Hicks urged residents to voice their concerns to their members of Congress, all of whom supported the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Hicks emphasized the dire implications on the climate change crisis as Wisconsin is already facing impacts such as historic floods, unsafe air quality and record-breaking temperatures.

Meanwhile, renewable energy stocks like NextEra Energy and Brookfield Renewable Partners are benefiting from policy tailwinds such as the Inflation Reduction Act [2].
The U.S. energy storage market added 2 GW of capacity in Q1 2025, with installations expected to double by year-end [1].
Conclusion The energy sector’s resilience in 2025 hinges on its ability to adapt to divergent regulatory and market signals.
Contrarian investors must balance exposure to oil and gas’s near-term volatility with the long-term tailwinds of the energy transition.","The energy sector in 2025 is navigating a paradox: regulatory shifts and market forces are pulling in divergent directions, creating both risks and opportunities for investors. Federal policies in the U.S. are prioritizing fossil fuels through streamlined production and infrastructure development, while state-level initiatives and corporate sustainability programs continue to drive renewable energy adoption [2]. Meanwhile, global demand for clean energy is surging, with solar and wind investments projected to outpace oil and gas for the first time [1]. This duality demands a nuanced, contrarian approach to investment, balancing short-term volatility with long-term structural trends.

Regulatory Divergence and Market Realities

Federal-level regulatory changes, such as the ""Unleashing American Energy"" Executive Order, have accelerated fossil fuel production and infrastructure projects, including LNG exports [2]. However, this contrasts sharply with state-level policies in California and New York, which are tightening emissions standards and incentivizing renewables [2]. The result is a fragmented regulatory landscape, where companies must navigate conflicting mandates. For example, the EPA’s proposed repeal of the 2009 Endangerment Finding threatens to undermine vehicle emissions standards and broader GHG regulations [3], while the One Big Beautiful Bill extends tax credits for carbon capture but shortens eligibility for clean hydrogen and biofuels [5]. These shifts create uncertainty for long-term project planning, particularly in renewables.

Market dynamics further complicate the picture. OPEC+’s 2.2M b/d output surge has led to a global oil supply surplus, pushing Brent crude to $67/bbl and squeezing energy stock valuations [1]. Meanwhile, renewable energy stocks like NextEra Energy and Brookfield Renewable Partners are benefiting from policy tailwinds such as the Inflation Reduction Act [2]. The energy transition is also reshaping demand: electricity consumption is surging, with 90% of global growth attributed to renewables, nuclear, and gas [3]. This trend is driven by data centers and AI infrastructure, which require stable, low-carbon power [4].

Contrarian Opportunities in a Dual-Track Sector

For investors, the key lies in identifying dual-track opportunities that hedge against volatility while capitalizing on structural shifts. In oil and gas, midstream operators like Enterprise Products Partners and Kinder Morgan offer fee-based revenue models insulated from commodity price swings [2]. Similarly, LNG exporters such as Cheniere Energy are well-positioned to benefit from rising global demand, particularly in Asia [1]. These companies provide resilience in a sector otherwise plagued by oversupply and regulatory uncertainty.

On the renewable side, energy storage and grid infrastructure are critical enablers of the transition. The U.S. energy storage market added 2 GW of capacity in Q1 2025, with installations expected to double by year-end [1]. Companies like Vestas Wind Systems and Brookfield Renewable Partners are leveraging AI-driven optimization to enhance efficiency and reduce costs [1]. Small-cap energy firms, such as Crescent Energy and Flowco, also present contrarian opportunities. Crescent has hedged 60% of its production using swaps and collars, while Flowco’s focus on production optimization reduces exposure to oil price fluctuations [3].

Innovation and Geopolitical Risks

Technological innovation is another frontier. Carbon capture and small modular reactors (SMRs) are gaining traction, particularly in China, which is projected to surpass the U.S. and Europe in nuclear capacity by 2030 [5]. Direct air capture (DAC) and long-duration energy storage are emerging as critical tools for decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors [3]. However, geopolitical tensions—such as U.S. tariffs on Russian oil and potential sanctions on Iran—are fragmenting markets and amplifying volatility [1]. These risks underscore the importance of ESG-aligned portfolios and diversified energy procurement strategies [4].

Conclusion

The energy sector’s resilience in 2025 hinges on its ability to adapt to divergent regulatory and market signals. Contrarian investors must balance exposure to oil and gas’s near-term volatility with the long-term tailwinds of the energy transition. By prioritizing infrastructure, storage, and innovation-driven companies, investors can navigate uncertainty while positioning for a future where clean energy and traditional fuels coexist in a redefined global energy system.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-30 23:58:25.225523

The U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the reallocation of funds, part of a broader move to divert $679 million from 12 offshore wind initiatives across the country.
This initiative aligns with several legislative measures signed by Governor Moore, aimed at quadrupling Maryland's offshore wind energy targets to 8.5 gigawatts by 2030, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and promoting electric vehicle adoption through rebate programs.
The retraction affects the Sparrows Point Steel Marshalling Port Project, initially granted as part of the U.S. Maritime Administration's Port Infrastructure Development Program.
This project was intended to facilitate the handling of substantial offshore wind components like monopile foundations and towers.","Maryland's ambitions to become a leading hub for offshore wind development have encountered a significant setback as federal authorities withdraw $47.3 million allocated for an offshore wind project in Baltimore County. The U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the reallocation of funds, part of a broader move to divert $679 million from 12 offshore wind initiatives across the country. This decision reflects a strategic pivot towards enhancing traditional energy sectors and strengthening maritime infrastructure, rather than pursuing what the administration terms ""fantasy wind projects.""

Maryland Governor Wes Moore voiced a strong commitment to advancing the state's clean energy initiatives. He recently participated in a groundbreaking ceremony for a new manufacturing facility at Tradepoint Atlantic, a move heralded as a vital step towards establishing Maryland as a frontrunner in the nation's offshore wind industry. The facility, developed by Ørsted, aims to produce components for wind turbines, significantly contributing to the broader supply chain along the U.S. East Coast.

The Tradepoint Atlantic complex at Sparrows Point, historically the site of a major steel mill, offers strategic advantages such as deep-water access, robust infrastructure, and extensive real estate, positioning it as an ideal location for offshore wind operations. The development is expected to create 125 union jobs during construction, offering benefits such as healthcare and secure employment conditions. This initiative aligns with several legislative measures signed by Governor Moore, aimed at quadrupling Maryland's offshore wind energy targets to 8.5 gigawatts by 2030, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and promoting electric vehicle adoption through rebate programs.

Despite these local advancements, federal funding withdrawals pose a challenge. The retraction affects the Sparrows Point Steel Marshalling Port Project, initially granted as part of the U.S. Maritime Administration's Port Infrastructure Development Program. This project was intended to facilitate the handling of substantial offshore wind components like monopile foundations and towers.

The decision to cut funding aligns with a national trend under the Trump administration to shift focus from renewable to traditional energy sources, a move receiving critique for potentially stifling economic growth and renewable energy job creation. Nonetheless, Maryland officials remain determined to forge ahead with their vision for a sustainable energy future, underscoring the state's enduring commitment to clean energy projects despite federal pullbacks.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-30 19:01:51.561541

While the company's supporters cheered another end of quarter burst, overall production and sales again disappointed. Today, I wanted to circle back and provide more detail on why Q1's headlines were troublesome for Tesla, along with some updates on key headwinds that are getting stronger.

The curious Model S and X picture:

Tesla's two flagship vehicles saw their first year over year decline in quarterly deliveries, falling by more than 3,000 units. While management said that demand is strong, it only said that orders set a Q1 record, not an overall quarterly record. Additionally, while it was stated that vehicles in transit were up 68% sequentially, that's not a surprise given the production shutdown in Q4. In fact, take a look at the chart below.

(Source: Tesla quarterly production/delivery announcements on IR news page)

Did management note that S/X vehicles in transit were down nearly 600 vehicles over the end of the prior year period, a drop of almost 12.7%? Nope. What's really interesting is that vehicles in transit rose sequentially by 1,540 vehicles. If we add that to the 21,800 vehicles delivered, we get 23,340 total. However, Tesla produced 1,400 more than that in the period, meaning inventory levels are rising again. Add that to an extra 1,200 Model 3's in transit, and you can see why rising inventory could pressure cash flow, a key reason why many are skeptical of the company saying it doesn't need a capital raise outside of credit lines.

He says the proposed changes to the regulation are unnecessary.

EPA determined existing federal wastewater regulations under the Clean Water Act are effective and the burdens proposed changes would inflict on meat and poultry processors are unwarranted.

“The National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) applauds the Trump administration and EPA Administrator Zeldin for taking a common sense approach on the Meat & Poultry Processing Rule,” says Duane Stateler, NPPC president and pork producer from McComb, Ohio. “As proposed by the previous administration, this rule—which provides no environmental benefits—would have been devastating to small- and medium-sized meat processors across the country and the livestock farmers who rely on them as markets for their animals.”

EPA’s action will save not only the nearly 100 local meat processors that EPA itself identified would have to close down but also the thousands of family farmers who rely on them to stay in livestock production, Stateler points out.

“It will help ensure affordable, nutritious American-grown pork can continue to be served on dinner tables across the country,” Stateler says.

Moving Forward

The decision closes the book on a nearly two-year comment and consideration process in which NPPC and other stakeholders have worked with EPA to better inform the agency’s decision and preempt unnecessary harm.

“Under the prior proposal, if it were finalized, major pork processors would have faced significant costs to install new waste water management systems,” explains Michael Formica, NPPC chief legal strategist. “During that period of construction, some plants would likely have needed to temporarily shut down. Others might have had to cut back on how many shifts they run.”

When activists are again successful at persuading a state to adopt anything different than Prop 12’s housing requirements, the wholesale revision of farm practices and contracts will start all over again.

Ohio EPA reports the red color in Carey Creek stemmed from a discharge of liquid manure that was pulled from an anaerobic manure lagoon on a nearby hog farm.

They survived the farm crisis of the 1980s, overcame industry challenges and quit their day jobs in the late 1980s to focus on building their dream — Brenneman Pork — into a legacy.

EPA’s internal analysis showed that dozens of facilities, likely small and medium-sized, would be forced to shut down because they would be unable to afford the cost of the technology required to comply, Formica says. Overall, the industry would have realized additional costs estimated at greater than $1 billion a year.

“Producers who rely on those processors would have then been without a market for their livestock,” Formica adds.

Unnecessary Expansions

The Meat and Poultry Products Effluent Guidelines and Standards was enacted in 1974 by the EPA and amended in 2004 to cover wastewater directly discharged by processing facilities. NPPC says the proposed amendment would have established more stringent technological requirements for controlling discharges from processors and significantly increased the scope of plants that were covered by the rules.

While the agricultural industry and the meat and poultry processing sectors support clean water efforts, EPA found these expansions were unnecessary.

NPPC says it appreciates EPA taking no action on the proposal, which would have disrupted packing capacity and livestock markets, in turn inflicting additional financial harm on producers and leading to further industry concentration and the loss of independent farmers.

The Meat Institute says the proposed rule would have also harmed the relationship between meat and poultry processing (MPP) facilities and publicly-owned treatment works (POTWs).

“Indirect discharging MPP facilities often make significant financial investments in maintaining and upgrading the POTW or shouldering major surcharges for the POTW’s continued operation and maintenance, which reduce public treatment costs for residential ratepayers and improve the quality of local and downstream waters,” the Meat Institute wrote in a statement.",https://assets.farmjournal.com/dims4/default/237f470/2147483647/strip/true/crop/320x180+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffj-corp-pub.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2F2017-11%2F320x180_71018B00-DJSPH.png,N,,2025-08-30 23:01:32.472787

“I personally truly believe that this pause will be beneficial to ensure that this mid-transition is smooth,” he said.
The governor signed a law the following year authorizing the energy commission to penalize oil companies for excessive profits.
Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California energy regulators Friday put the brakes on plans requiring oil companies to pay a penalty if their profits climb too high, a temporary win for the fossil fuel industry two years after the governor declared the state had “finally beat big oil.”

The postponement by the California Energy Commission until 2030 comes after two oil refineries accounting for roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity announced their plans to close in the coming months. The commission has the power to implement a penalty but has not done so since it was given that authority in 2023.

The penalty was considered a landmark piece of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s government and the state’s ambitious goals to curb climate change. The state faces challenges in its efforts to take on the oil industry while ensuring a stable and affordable fuel supply. His administration is also proposing to temporarily streamline approvals of new oil wells in existing oil fields in an effort to maintain a stable fuel supply.

Siva Gunda, the commission’s vice chair, said the state is not “walking back” its efforts to wean itself off fossil fuels but must prioritize protecting consumers at the gas pump.

“I personally truly believe that this pause will be beneficial to ensure that this mid-transition is smooth,” he said.

The commission still plans to set rules that would require oil refineries to keep a minimum level of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when refineries go offline for maintenance.

Jamie Court, the president of Consumer Watchdog who supported the law, said the energy commission’s vote is “basically a giveaway to the industry.”

“I’m really disheartened and disgusted by Newsom,” he said. “I feel like this is just a total about-face. And in the end it’s going to result in greater price spikes.”

But the Western States Petroleum Association recommended that the state postpone a penalty for 20 years.

“While today’s action by the CEC stopped short of a full statutory repeal or a 20-year pause, it represents a needed step to provide some certainty for California’s fuels market,” CEO Catherine Reheis-Boyd said in a statement. “The vote demonstrates the CEC’s understanding that imposing this failed policy would have likely exacerbated investment concerns contributing to California’s recent refinery closures.”

In 2022, Newsom called the Legislature into a special session to pass a law aimed at holding oil companies accountable for making too much money after a summer of record-high gas prices in California. The governor signed a law the following year authorizing the energy commission to penalize oil companies for excessive profits.

Julia Stein, deputy director of a climate institute at UCLA School of Law, said state officials are still intent on advancing their efforts to transition away from fossil fuels.

“But I think there is also a sense at the state level that we’re entering a different phase of the transition where some of these problems are going to be presented more acutely,” she said. “And folks are kind of now trying to understand how they’re going to approach that in real time.”

California has the highest gas prices in the nation, largely due to taxes and environmental regulations. Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.

The commission has not determined what would count as an excessive profit under the policy.

Setting a penalty could be risky for the state because it could unintentionally discourage production and drive prices up, said Severin Borenstein, an economist and public policy professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

“It’s pretty clear they are shifting towards more focus on affordability and recognition that the high prices in California may not be associated with the actual refinery operations,” he said of state officials.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/08/29/California_Gas_Prices_51698_c0-146-3515-2196_s1200x700.jpg?cea3c8d9ee6bca3f2cb1be60d37b6378821043d4,N,,2025-08-30 18:03:02.295502

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has closed its investigation into whether major truck manufacturers violated antitrust laws through the “Clean Truck Partnership” with the California Air Resources Board (CARB). The commission concluded the case after Daimler Truck, International Motors, PACCAR, Volvo Group, and the Truck & Engine Manufacturers Association provided binding commitments to avoid similar agreements in the future and maintain independent business practices.

The Clean Truck Partnership, formed in 2023, committed manufacturers to comply with California’s zero-emission truck rules. The FTC raised concerns that this arrangement imposed output restrictions, limited competition, and locked in terms without adequate political accountability.

“CARB’s regulatory overreach posed a major threat to American trucking and, in our view, presented serious antitrust concerns,” said Bureau of Competition Deputy Director Taylor Hoogendoorn. “The Bureau is pleased that the leading heavy-duty truck manufacturers agreed to a course correction. The Commission’s swift action will put the Clean Truck Partnership squarely in the rearview mirror and prevent repeats of CARB’s troubling regulatory gambit.”

Following federal legislation revoking CARB’s regulatory waivers, the manufacturers disavowed the agreement and pledged not to enforce or recreate it. The Commission’s decision to close the case was unanimous.

The wind farm will be made up of 81 turbines and set to create more than 100 jobs during construction, as well as 10 fulltime local jobs once the wind farm becomes operational.

Wind is the biggest contributor to renewable electricity generation in Victoria, with 21 percent of our state’s monthly electricity generation coming from wind farms in the first half of 2025.

Because of this investment in renewables, Victorians continue to benefit from some of the lowest energy prices in the country. Over the financial year Victoria’s wholesale price was $106 per megawatt – compared to $149 in New South Wales, $144 in Tasmania, $136 in South Australia and $125 in Queensland.

This project referred to a Planning Panel for consideration and included wide-ranging consultation with residents, community groups and government agencies. The panel recommended the project could proceed, with measures taken to protect local biodiversity, including bats and brolgas.

The project is located in the South-West Renewable Energy Zone, one of six areas identified as most suitable to host new renewable energy generation across Victoria through the Victorian Transmission Plan.

Victoria has met every renewable energy target it has set to date and is well on the way to meeting the next ones of 65 per cent renewable energy generation by 2030 and 95 per cent by 2035.

Delivering more renewable energy will provide a secure source of cheap renewable energy for homes, businesses and industry across the whole state and boost employment – 67,000 jobs will be required to deliver our energy transition by 2040 – a 60 percent increase from today.

With federal policy rollbacks hampering investment in homegrown clean energy, we need to look for areas where Maine can make progress now to bring down electricity prices and curb climate pollution.

One of the most promising and proven solutions is time-of-use (TOU) electricity rates, which encourage electricity use when the grid is less busy, empowering customers to save and keeping expensive fossil-fuel power plants offline.

Here’s how it works.

The cost of electricity fluctuates over the day and seasons of the year. The most expensive times are when consumer demand is high; it’s basic economics. This summer, for example, wholesale prices have exceeded $1,000/MWh, more than 2,000% higher than average prices. These true costs are hidden from consumers by an antiquated practice of averaging prices across all hours, an approach that unfairly shifts costs to those causing the least impact on our shared electricity grid.

Well-thought-out TOU rates can fix this and save working families in Maine money in three ways.

Advertisement

First, they would reduce the stress on our regional electricity system, bringing down costs for everyone. Our grid — all the poles, wires and substations that we pay for through our electricity bills — is sized to match maximum demand for electricity, even if that peak period is only a few hours a year.

Incentivizing use during off-peak times keeps expensive infrastructure upgrades at bay and makes more efficient use of the capacity we already have. New England’s grid operator found that reducing peak loads would save roughly $10 billion across the region, with nearly a billion of that coming to Maine.

Second, creating a more flexible grid with solutions like TOU rates will deliver additional savings from our local transmission and distribution systems. Maine’s recent Pathways to 2040 study found that these Maine-based approaches could reduce grid growth by 35-55% by 2050, with huge implications for costs savings to Maine homes and businesses over the next 25 years.

Third, it’s not just poles and wires but the electricity itself that gets more expensive — and more polluting — as demand increases. In New England’s electricity market, the least expensive power plants come online first. The last resource to be fired up is the most expensive and sets a uniform price paid to all generators. By shifting use away from peak times, we use those expensive resources more rarely, lowering market prices across the board.

As a bonus, the most expensive generators are also the most polluting. By relying less on these outdated coal- and oil-fired clunkers, we reduce climate pollution and improve air quality.

Because TOU rates have been around for decades, there’s a wealth of information about the scale of benefits at stake. One recent program in Maryland saved customers an average of 5-10% off their electricity bills by reducing summer peaks. This included lower-income people who responded similarly to higher-income households to shift their electricity usage and save money.

Maine’s Public Utilities Commission (PUC) is considering a TOU proposal now, and it should make this a priority so we can deliver savings to families and businesses across the state. Maine’s TOU rates should be simple and clear, with a higher price during an evening window and a lower price the rest of the time, with good outreach and education to let people know how to save money on their bills by doing laundry and running the dishwashers outside those hours.

Any time changes in electricity rate structures are proposed, people have questions. And to be clear, there are important details to work out. But because TOU has been implemented effectively elsewhere, we have confidence the PUC can address these questions while moving forward and bringing these cost savings to bear quickly.

Effective TOU rates can offer Maine families short-term savings, while suppressing rates system-wide over the long term. If we’re serious about addressing affordability while achieving Maine’s Climate Action Plan, well-designed time-of-use rates are a foundational policy and too important an opportunity to pass up.",https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/08/Biden_Electrical_Grid_Money_81447_da0721-1724367833.jpg?w=1000,N,,2025-08-30 19:01:59.476003

“The Salem Wind Port Project is operating under a project labor agreement, with 800 union workers set to build Massachusetts’ energy future brick by brick. Now, these workers are left fighting for their livelihoods as job offers evaporate and offshore wind worksites grind to a halt.

“Between energy cost hikes for working families and job cuts for union workers, our communities are being sacrificed at the altar of Trump’s bizarre personal hatred of American-made wind energy. Trump claims to care about workers, but his actions are a direct attack on construction and trades workers nationwide.”

The Trump administration announced today that the Department of Transportation and Maritime Administration will illegally terminate or withdraw funding from twelve projects under the Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects (INFRA) program and the Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIPD), totaling $679 million.

But Canada needs to get on board first,"Nick Logan, CBC News",,,,,https://www.cbc.ca/news/climate/plug-in-balcony-solar-panels-1.7618883,"A plug-in balcony solar unit that can generate up to 800 watts can cost between $2,000 to $2,300 US, but a 200-watt kit sells for as low as $400.
Around 1.5 million German homes, many of them apartments, are registered as using balcony solar panels — although many more might be unregistered.
Demand is now growing in Spain and some other European countries, while the U.K. government announced last month it's studying the potential for allowing balcony solar panels for apartments.
But balcony plug-in solar isn't necessarily the solution he'd like to see.
O'Brien says integrating solar panels into construction not only centralizes the power generation but addresses any safety concerns around people affixing panels to their balconies themselves.","Want to lower your electricity bill and help power your home with an abundant renewable energy source — the sun?

OK, maybe you don't have a rooftop where you can install $20,000 to 30,000 worth of solar panels, get the permits and hire a crew to put them in.

But there's a simple, affordable solution for people who own houses or condos, or are renting an apartment.

Plug-in balcony solar panels are a do-it-yourself clean energy solution that not only help power appliances and devices in homes but lower electricity costs at a time when the cost of power — along with everything else — is rising.

They've become popular in Germany and elsewhere in Europe, as well as in the U.S. While these plug-and-play units aren't readily available in Canada, and could face bureaucratic hurdles in getting approved, solar energy proponents say there's likely to be consumer interest and calls for Canada to get on board.

""We're about to find out what that pent-up demand is,"" said Phil McKay from the Canadian Renewable Energy Association (CanREA).

How do they work?

You may have seen portable 100-watt solar panels at your local hardware store that you can take with you camping or to a cabin in order to charge your cellphone or other small devices.

Plug-in balcony solar kits are somewhat similar, says Kevin Chou, co-founder of San Francisco Bright Saver, which aims to bring this technology to a wider North American market.

The difference is that with balcony solar, you're able to power small appliances, lights and other household electrical items from a lightweight panel you can install yourself on a balcony or the side of your home.

A plug-in balcony solar unit that can generate up to 800 watts can cost between $2,000 to $2,300 US, but a 200-watt kit sells for as low as $400.

As Chou explains, the panels connect to an inverter, much like your typical rooftop photovoltaic solar panels, except that it's much smaller and plugs directly into a standard wall outlet.

""It just pushes electricity into that plug at a slightly higher pressure than the rest of the electricity coming in from the grid, so that you're using the electricity from your solar panels first,"" Chou said. Any unused power is absorbed into the power grid.

Some newer and costlier kits also have batteries that can store electricity for later use.

Chou says the power from these systems isn't significant enough to address all your home energy needs.

In Canada, the average detached home uses approximately 13,000 kilowatt hours of electricity per year, while an apartment or condo in a highrise building might use around 5,900 kWh per year, according to Statistics Canada.

But depending on where you live and and your overall power costs, he says balcony solar can shave some money off your monthly bill.

In northern California, where Chou lives, it can work out to $30 to $50 US off per month.

Big in Germany

Chou says he was inspired to try to develop a market for plug-in balcony solar units in North America following their success in Germany in recent years.

Balkonkraftwerk, as it's known in German (translation: balcony power plant), grew in popularity after the country began to move away from its reliance on cheap Russian oil following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which increased the cost of power for residents.

Around 1.5 million German homes, many of them apartments, are registered as using balcony solar panels — although many more might be unregistered.

McKay says they're not contributing a huge amount of solar power to Germany's grid, ""but what it's doing is impacting millions and millions of people's homes"" by saving as much as 30 per cent on power bills, according to some estimates.

Demand is now growing in Spain and some other European countries, while the U.K. government announced last month it's studying the potential for allowing balcony solar panels for apartments.

A red state greenlit balcony solar. Why not Canada?

Germany's Balkonkraftwerk success story also caught the eye of Utah lawmaker Raymond Ward, a Republican state representative who successfully passed legislation earlier this year to allow the use of plug-in solar panels, a first anywhere in the U.S.

Given the political environment in the U.S. and divisiveness over climate change, it might come as a surprise that a red state like Utah is leading the charge. Ward says it was a matter of offering residents an opportunity to save money, and his legislation gets ""the government out of their way.""

He says it wasn't that plug-and-play solar units were prohibited, but rather that the regulations only covered rooftop solar panel systems, which weren't allowed to be plugged directly into an existing electrical system and had a contract with the local utility.

""That makes sense if you're going to cover your whole roof with them and expect the utility to pay you some money for that power,"" Ward said. ""But it doesn't make sense if you're just buying something little and plugging it in and not asking [the utility] for anything.""

Utilities got on board, he says, once they realized they wouldn't have to compensate customers for the power they were generating.

Part of the challenge, he said, was certification. The units, as a whole, are not UL-certified, the standard certification for electronics in the U.S. But the individual components are, which has given some companies the green light to sell their plug-in solar kits in Utah and some other parts of the country.

UL is also recognized certification in Canada, but the Canadian Standards Association (CSA Group) certifies most electronics for use in this country.

CSA Group confirmed to CBC News that balcony solar units ""are not evaluated or certified as standalone products"" and that ""the complete plug-in configuration falls outside the scope of our current certification frameworks.""

There's also the challenge of getting provinces, municipalities and utilities on board.

CBC News reached out to various provincial and municipal governments, as well as utility providers, and found many had not yet considered the potential use of DIY plug-in solar panels or regard it as being similar to rooftop solar installations that require permits and licensed contractors to install.

Alberta, however, could provide an opportunity. A spokesperson for the province's Ministry of Affordability and Utilities says balcony plug-in solar technology would fall under existing micro-generation regulation, which allows generators capable of producing less than 150 kilowatts of electricity to be connected to the grid.

Better integration

Liam O'Brien, a civil and environmental engineering professor at Carleton University in Ottawa, sees value in giving people a ""tangible connection"" to energy resources.

But balcony plug-in solar isn't necessarily the solution he'd like to see.

He's more in favour of solar being integrated into buildings when they're constructed or renovated — something that's happened in some places in Canada, including an apartment building in Toronto and at a student residence at Halifax's Saint Mary's University.

O'Brien says integrating solar panels into construction not only centralizes the power generation but addresses any safety concerns around people affixing panels to their balconies themselves.

It's also a better use of space, he says, and could save developers money on other material costs while offering a cheaper power source to residents.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7618976.1756307884!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/plug-in-solar-panel-baltimore-home.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-08-30 19:02:05.831573

The National Adaptation and Resilience Planning Strategy, launched in 2025, emphasizes collaboration between federal, state, and local actors to address climate and economic risks [6].
Climate-related fiscal risks further complicate the picture: property values in high-risk areas are declining, straining tax bases and increasing borrowing costs for infrastructure projects [10].
In conclusion, the 2025 federal-state conflicts have created a landscape of heightened geopolitical and economic risk.
While municipal resilience strategies offer pathways to stability, their success hinges on navigating federal policy shifts and global trade dynamics.","The 2025 U.S. economic landscape is defined by a volatile interplay between federal and state policies, particularly in the realm of tariffs and fiscal strategies. As the Trump-Vance administration’s “Liberation Day” tariffs—imposing baseline 10% duties on imports and higher rates on key trading partners—have taken effect, the economy faces a dual challenge: short-term inflationary pressures and long-term structural risks. The average effective tariff rate (AETR) has surged to 18.6%, the highest since 1933, contributing to a 1.8% rise in consumer prices and a 0.5 percentage point drag on real GDP growth in 2025 and 2026 [1]. These policies, while generating $2.8 trillion in projected government revenue over a decade, have also disrupted global supply chains, with retaliatory tariffs from China and Mexico reshaping trade flows [2].

Geopolitical volatility has intensified as a result. The Federal Reserve, now adopting a “neutral” monetary stance, has struggled to balance inflation control with labor market stability, as job creation weakened by 1.4% in the first half of 2025 [3]. Financial markets have mirrored this uncertainty, with the S&P 500 and VIX volatility index experiencing swings akin to the 2008 crisis and early 2020 pandemic [4]. Deloitte’s Q2 2025 forecast outlines three scenarios: a baseline of sustained high tariffs leading to slower GDP growth, an upside of reduced trade tensions boosting economic activity, and a downside of escalating conflicts triggering a 1.7% GDP contraction in 2026 [5].

Amid this turbulence, municipal resilience strategies have emerged as critical buffers. The National Adaptation and Resilience Planning Strategy, launched in 2025, emphasizes collaboration between federal, state, and local actors to address climate and economic risks [6]. However, federal devolution—shifting disaster preparedness and infrastructure responsibilities to states and municipalities—has created fiscal strain. At least 25 states introduced climate adaptation legislation in 2025, focusing on wildfire resiliency and flood preparedness, yet critics warn that under-resourced local governments may struggle to meet these demands [7].

Case studies highlight the stakes. Sanctuary cities like Los Angeles and Chicago, initially targeted for funding cuts under Trump’s immigration policies, secured legal victories preserving billions in federal grants [8]. Meanwhile, cities such as Detroit and Dallas have pivoted to reshoring strategies, incentivizing domestic manufacturing to offset tariff-driven supply chain disruptions [9]. Climate-related fiscal risks further complicate the picture: property values in high-risk areas are declining, straining tax bases and increasing borrowing costs for infrastructure projects [10].

For investors, the implications are clear. Municipal bonds with strong credit fundamentals—particularly in water, sewer, and electric utilities—remain attractive, but caution is warranted in sectors exposed to tariff volatility, such as manufacturing and agriculture [11]. The expiration of federal programs like the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) in 2026 threatens to exacerbate fiscal gaps, particularly in urban centers [12]. Defensive strategies, including low-volatility equities and quality-focused portfolios, are gaining traction as hedging mechanisms against policy uncertainty [13].

In conclusion, the 2025 federal-state conflicts have created a landscape of heightened geopolitical and economic risk. While municipal resilience strategies offer pathways to stability, their success hinges on navigating federal policy shifts and global trade dynamics. Investors must remain agile, prioritizing sectors and regions demonstrating adaptability in this fragmented environment.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-30 17:03:12.593560

Enabling Project Financing The renewable energy insurance market has developed rapidly, from a simple property damage policy to technologically enhanced solutions.
These factors together drive more capital flow into the renewable energy sector, accelerating project deployment and contributing to a more sustainable energy future.","As India gears up for decarbonizing energy to 50% and achieving 500 GW of fossil fuel-free generating capacity by 2030, renewable energy is becoming centre stage in the country. Insurance is becoming a quiet force enabler, insuring green assets and releasing funds that can help drive the world’s clean energy transition. With global warming and changing climatic conditions, there has never been a greater need to accelerate the transition to clean energy. And in today’s time, renewable energy technologies such as solar, wind, hydro, and biomass hold out a hopeful solution. More importantly, there is a need to protect the renewable energy sources, which can only be done through insurance.

Below are ways in which insurance is protecting the renewable energy sector today:

Protecting India’s vision of achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030

Renewables usually face unique risks like weather challenges, land acquisition delays, grid unavailability, and technology performance issues. Unlike conventional fossil-fuel-based power plants, renewable energy power plants are decentralized and sit in remote or ecologically critical positions. Solar farms are exposed to hail, heat fatigue, and dust storms; wind turbines are subject to lightning strikes, blade wear, or gusty surges of wind; hydroelectric stations are exposed to fluctuations with the seasons, droughts, or floods.

Insurance thus offers protection against such disturbances as natural catastrophes, fire and explosion risks, construction delays, and cost overruns. In the absence of proper cover, a single bout of weather-related incident or cyber-attack can lead to huge losses.

Along with that, renewable insurance also provides operational risk coverage, which includes machinery breakdown cover, liability cover (third-party, environmental), and loss of revenue due to underperformance or downtime.

Enabling Project Financing

The renewable energy insurance market has developed rapidly, from a simple property damage policy to technologically enhanced solutions. The insurance products available today are designed to meet the unique requirements of green power programs, taking into account the complexities of technologies, geographies, and regulatory environments.

Lenders and equity investors, thus, often require insurance as a condition for disbursement to fund renewable energy projects. Her,e insurance today plays an instrumental role by improving creditworthiness for Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). For banks and NBFCs involved in green financing, it can help in redirecting their loan portfolios. These factors together drive more capital flow into the renewable energy sector, accelerating project deployment and contributing to a more sustainable energy future.

Supporting during Construction & Commissioning

Insurance policies like Contractors All Risk (CAR), Erection All Risk (EAR), and aDayin Start-Up (DSU) are meant to support construction projects, as well as renewable energy projects. These policies cover unforeseen circumstances during installation and commissioning, and help in timely project completion, which is critical for meeting the national targets of the country.

Protecting the Indian renewable energy market

The industry here is witnessing a 15–20% increase in demand, fuelled by favourable government policies, increased ESG expectations, and increased sensitization of the project exposures. Foreign reinsurers and insurers are also plugging gaps, crafting policies for new technology such as floating solar, offshore wind, battery energy storage systems, and hybrid renewable configurations. Well-insured projects will be more likely to attract capital, meet demands, and sail through regulatory bottlenecks. They are also better able to deliver steady returns and address long-term sustainability demands.

Insurance companies help align coverage with MNRE policies and state-level solar/wind park frameworks. Insurance is also allowing the realization of wider environmental ambitions by making new technology deployment, such as green hydrogen, carbon capture, and energy storage at scale, feasible. High-risk, high-payback projects like these have difficulty finding capital because there is perceived risk. With suitable insurance products, the road to commercialization is easier and less risky.

While we promote sustainable development and renewable energy, we should appreciate the support systems fuelling this revolution. Insurance, largely unnoticed, is a silent pillar of the renewable industry, converting risk into resilience, fear into foresight, and ambition into sustainable advancement.",https://etedge-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/default-article-banner.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 17:02:24.661866

Renewable energy executive calls for public awareness, equity, and action in reshaping how America thinks about energy access

Louisiana, USA, 30th August 2025, ZEX PR WIRE, Tyler Pommier, Executive Vice President of Innovation at GulfStream Renewables, is calling on individuals, communities, and leaders across the U.S. to rethink the way energy is produced, shared, and understood. After years of spearheading clean energy projects across the Gulf Coast, Pommier is using his platform to raise awareness about energy equity and local empowerment through decentralized, renewable systems.

""Everyone deserves access to clean power,"" Pommier says. ""Not just for the environment, but for dignity, safety, and freedom.""

This message is central to Pommier's recent TEDx talk titled ""Decentralizing Power: Energy Belongs to Everyone."" It also echoes throughout his work developing solar, wind, and battery systems that support schools, neighborhoods, and underserved rural areas.

The Power Gap

Pommier's advocacy comes at a time when energy insecurity remains a serious issue. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration:

Nearly one in three U.S. households faces some form of energy insecurity each year.

In rural and low-income communities, power outages and energy costs impact health, education, and economic stability.

Schools in underserved areas face frequent disruptions due to unreliable power, affecting student learning and safety.

""This isn't just a technical problem-it's a people problem,"" says Pommier. ""When a school loses power, classrooms close. When a family can't afford heating, people get sick. Energy touches every part of our lives.""

Local Action, Local Control

One of Pommier's proudest achievements is a series of solar-plus-battery installations in rural schools across Louisiana.

""These schools had constant outages,"" he explains. ""We gave them a way to stay open, save money, and be resilient. That kind of project shows how clean energy can serve real human needs.""

He believes decentralized systems-like rooftop solar, community microgrids, and battery storage-can give control back to families, schools, and local governments.

""I want to see communities that don't just use power,"" he says. ""I want to see communities that own their power.""

Making Clean Energy Understandable

Pommier is also focused on simplifying the conversation. ""You can't just throw data at people,"" he says. ""You have to explain how it affects their daily lives. Like: Will your fridge stay on in a storm? Will your kid's school stay open during a blackout?""

His plainspoken approach has made him a trusted voice at town halls, schools, and policy meetings.

What You Can Do

Pommier isn't asking people to wait for government action or big investment. Instead, he's offering simple steps that everyday people can take:

Learn how your home or building uses energy.

Ask questions at local meetings about power sourcing and grid reliability.

Support community solar projects or energy co-ops.

Encourage schools and public buildings to explore renewable options.

Talk about it. Share energy stories with neighbors, family, and friends.

""Start small,"" Pommier says. ""Talk to your city council. Learn how your utility works. Ask where your electricity comes from. That's how change begins.""

A great debate is underway as political leaders, technology experts and leaders from multiple industries engage in a serious discussion about the impending AI revolution and its implications for our country, society and future.

The conclusions drawn from these discussions range from wildly optimistic to a frightening, dystopian future. However, two things that are almost universally accepted are, one, the United States must win the AI race against our Chinese counterparts, and two, winning this race requires new power, equipment and an aggressive data-center buildout that depends on a combination of innovative policies and coordination between governments and industry.

The National Association of Electrical Distributors is a national organization representing wholesalers of electrical products with nearly 5,600 warehouse locations nationwide. The industry is positioned to help the nation rise to the occasion. Research indicates that $4.5 billion in economic activity will flow through the warehouse and distribution network to support data center buildout this year.

The question is, “How do policymakers create an environment where private industry can achieve this monumental task?”

Leaders in Washington must focus on expanding opportunities to attract and retain a skilled workforce, while also strengthening domestic sourcing and manufacturing across the electrical equipment supply chain.

On the workforce, Congress and the administration made progress in the “One Big Beautiful Bill” by including a provision to allow individuals to use money from 529 savings accounts to pay for post-secondary training programs. This will help more Americans obtain and retain well-paying jobs that don’t require a traditional four-year degree.

Congress should pass the Veterans Energy Transition Act, which would help veterans and their spouses secure well-paying jobs in the growing energy industry.

Nearly 200,000 service members transition out of active duty annually. NAED is helping our members tap into this talent pool. Incentivizing this burgeoning pipeline would benefit more of those who have served and will equip our members with the talent they need to electrify America. Veterans bring valuable skills, hands-on training, and a strong sense of mission that aligns closely with the needs of the energy industry.

Congress should also extend and expand tax incentives designed to promote domestic manufacturing of key technologies, most notably distribution transformers. As the country starts reshoring production of certain materials and components, an incentive structure that has proven successful in the past should be reworked to provide additional relief to companies trying to do the right thing by bringing jobs back to America.

Permitting reform, which has been discussed but has proven elusive, is needed to cut red tape and to allow project developers the required legal and regulatory certainty to build reliable mining and power generation capacity. We appreciate efforts to move the ball forward, but we need legislation to ensure these efforts are not reversed in the future.

Finally, we support a trade policy framework set forth by NEMA, our electrical manufacturing partner, that encourages American investments and onshoring.

Their three-pronged “Tariff Offset” framework aligns trade policy with national goals by offering targeted tariff relief for capital investments in domestic manufacturing, for goods essential to AI and grid infrastructure, and for products meeting “Made in America” content standards.

Together, these sensible policies will give risk-takers the coverage they need to shift workers to critical industries, unleash the availability of materials and products sourced by American-based firms, and provide needed relief for those working to ensure the United States can meet the demands to dominate the AI race.",https://www.oaoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Bud-DeFlaviis-e1756310893412.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 20:03:28.170236

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It’s the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states’ climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans’ livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

The governor signed a law the following year authorizing the energy commission to penalize oil companies for excessive profits.
The law also required oil companies to report more data on their operations to the state.
Newsom’s office thanked the energy commission for voting to postpone implementing a penalty, saying it was a “prudent step” toward stabilizing the oil market.
Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California energy regulators Friday put the brakes on plans requiring oil companies to pay a penalty if their profits climb too high, a temporary win for the fossil fuel industry two years after the governor declared the state had “finally beat big oil.”

The postponement by the California Energy Commission until 2030 comes after two oil refineries accounting for roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity announced their plans to close in the coming months. The commission has the power to implement a penalty but has not done so since it was given that authority in 2023.

The penalty was considered a landmark piece of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s government and the state’s ambitious goals to curb climate change. The state faces challenges in its efforts to take on the oil industry while ensuring a stable and affordable fuel supply. His administration is also proposing to temporarily streamline approvals of new oil wells in existing oil fields in an effort to maintain a stable fuel supply.

Siva Gunda, the commission’s vice chair, said the state is not “walking back” its efforts to wean itself off fossil fuels but must prioritize protecting consumers at the gas pump.

“I personally truly believe that this pause will be beneficial to ensure that this mid-transition is smooth,” he said.

The commission still plans to set rules that would require oil refineries to keep a minimum level of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when refineries go offline for maintenance.

Jamie Court, the president of Consumer Watchdog who supported the law, said the energy commission’s vote is “basically a giveaway to the industry.”

“I’m really disheartened and disgusted by Newsom,” he said. “I feel like this is just a total about-face. And in the end it’s going to result in greater price spikes.”

But the Western States Petroleum Association recommended that the state postpone a penalty for 20 years.

“While today’s action by the CEC stopped short of a full statutory repeal or a 20-year pause, it represents a needed step to provide some certainty for California’s fuels market,” CEO Catherine Reheis-Boyd said in a statement. “The vote demonstrates the CEC’s understanding that imposing this failed policy would have likely exacerbated investment concerns contributing to California’s recent refinery closures.”

In 2022, Newsom called the Legislature into a special session to pass a law aimed at holding oil companies accountable for making too much money after a summer of record-high gas prices in California. The governor signed a law the following year authorizing the energy commission to penalize oil companies for excessive profits.

The law also required oil companies to report more data on their operations to the state. It created an independent division at the commission to oversee the oil and gas industry and provide guidance to the state on its energy transition.

Newsom’s office thanked the energy commission for voting to postpone implementing a penalty, saying it was a “prudent step” toward stabilizing the oil market.

“When Governor Newsom signed this legislation two years ago, he promised that we would utilize the new transparency tools to look under the hood of our oil and gas market that had been a black box for decades,” spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said in a statement. “We did exactly that.”

Julia Stein, deputy director of a climate institute at UCLA School of Law, said state officials are still intent on advancing their efforts to transition away from fossil fuels.

“But I think there is also a sense at the state level that we’re entering a different phase of the transition where some of these problems are going to be presented more acutely,” she said. “And folks are kind of now trying to understand how they’re going to approach that in real time.”

California has the highest gas prices in the nation, largely due to taxes and environmental regulations. Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.

The commission has not determined what would count as an excessive profit under the policy.

Setting a penalty could be risky for the state because it could unintentionally discourage production and drive prices up, said Severin Borenstein, an economist and public policy professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

“It’s pretty clear they are shifting towards more focus on affordability and recognition that the high prices in California may not be associated with the actual refinery operations,” he said of state officials.",https://www.wspa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/53/2025/08/68b2129967efd3.90903522.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-30 19:03:04.009529

In an interview with Bloomberg, Andre Correa do Lago, who will oversee the COP30 climate talks in November, sought to allay growing concerns that US President Donald Trump’s use of tariffs and hostility toward green energy sources could undermine the clean power transition. He said that recent attacks on clean energy sources like wind and solar show that the interests of fossil fuel producers are increasingly threatened by the transition to a greener economy.

“The success of this agenda is a challenge to some businesses and some interests,” said Correa do Lago, while calling on the private sector to attend the COP30 summit en masse in order to implement the commitments made by countries. “This is the utmost demonstration that these policies worked or these policies are working and that they are somehow threatening some significant interest.”

Trump’s distaste for climate-progressive policies has reverberated across the business community as he puts a halt to wind projects, slaps countries across the world with tariffs and causes banks to rethink their own climate commitments for fear of running against the ESG backlash. Against such a backdrop, it’s not clear how many executives will make the trip to a climate conference in Brazil.

The dilemma faced by business was recently exemplified when the world’s biggest climate alliance for banks suspended its activities and proposed a vote on scrapping its current structure in the face of a Wall Street exodus that spread globally.

In a letter published Friday, Correa do Lago called on the private sector to take a “step forward, and not back” in order to make the transition an “exponential reality.”

So far, the run-up to COP30 has been overshadowed by logistical issues in the Amazonian city of Belem, with many of the 50,000 participants expected battling a shortage of available accommodation and extremely high prices. It’s an issue that business executives will also have to contend with, and many may choose to focus on side events taking place in the larger cities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

Correa do Lago said that private sector representatives would face less of an issue in Belem as they’d likely attend the summit for shorter periods than negotiators.

“Obviously the element that unfortunately everybody’s talking about Belem is the difficulty of having rooms,” he said. “But we just want to say very clearly that we need the private sector.”

By suspending new project approvals, rescinding designated wind energy zones, and revoking subsidies, the administration has introduced immediate and long-term risks for investors, workers, and energy security. This analysis examines the implications of these policies, drawing on recent actions and their economic and strategic consequences.

Immediate Risks: Project Halts and Job Losses

The administration’s January 2025 executive order effectively froze offshore wind development by halting permits, loans, and rights-of-way approvals [1]. This move canceled $679 million in funding for 12 projects and revoked key approvals, such as the Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island [2]. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management also rescinded 3.5 million acres of designated Wind Energy Areas, removing pre-approved zones for development [1]. These actions have already jeopardized over 17,000 jobs in the offshore wind sector, particularly in blue-collar communities reliant on port infrastructure and manufacturing [2].

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which accelerated the phase-out of subsidies for renewables, further exacerbated the crisis. By shortening the eligibility period for tax credits to 12 months and imposing stricter permitting timelines, the law has made financing and project timelines increasingly precarious [1]. The result? A 36% drop in U.S. renewable energy investment in the first half of 2025 [2].

Long-Term Risks: Investor Confidence and Market Shifts

The regulatory uncertainty has triggered a ""regulatory lottery"" for developers, eroding investor confidence [2]. Investors are now pivoting to alternative technologies like green hydrogen and energy storage, as well as emerging markets less susceptible to U.S. policy volatility [1]. This shift risks leaving the U.S. behind in the global clean energy race, where countries like Germany and the UK are scaling offshore wind capacity.

The administration’s ""project density"" policy, requiring renewables to match fossil fuels’ energy output per acre, has also disqualified many wind and solar projects from permits [1]. This arbitrary standard undermines the scalability of renewables and prioritizes short-term fossil fuel production, including resuming LNG exports and lifting drilling restrictions in Alaska [1]. Such policies expose the U.S. to price volatility and geopolitical risks, contrasting with the energy security promised by renewables [3].

Energy Security and Strategic Implications

While the administration frames these rollbacks as a path to ""American energy dominance,"" the reality is more complex. Despite federal setbacks, renewables still accounted for 90% of new electrical capacity additions in the first nine months of 2024, driven by market forces and state-level policies [1]. However, the federal retreat has created a fragmented energy strategy, where state-level progress is undermined by national policy.

The termination of offshore wind port infrastructure funding and the rescission of the Lava Ridge wind project in Idaho signal a broader retreat from long-term planning [2]. This undermines the U.S.’s ability to meet climate goals and compete globally, as the Department of the Interior simultaneously rolls back protections for national forests and geothermal incentives [1].

Conclusion: Navigating the Storm

Trump’s offshore wind rollbacks present a dual challenge: immediate job losses and investment declines, coupled with long-term risks to energy security and global competitiveness. For investors, the key lies in hedging against policy uncertainty by diversifying into resilient technologies and markets. Yet, the administration’s focus on fossil fuels and nuclear energy may not address the volatility and environmental costs inherent in those sectors [2].

As the offshore wind sector braces for further regulatory turbulence, the question remains: Can market forces and state-level initiatives offset the federal retreat, or will the U.S. cede its clean energy future to more policy-stable nations? The answer will shape not only the energy transition but the economic and strategic trajectory of the country.

In a report last week, Compass Point analysts led by Whitney Stanco said the Department of Energy's recent establishment of a new consortium for nuclear fuel paves the way for the Trump administration to take stakes in companies as part of the government's quest to build a domestic supply of enriched uranium, the critical fuel used to make nuclear energy.

“Given the U.S. nuclear fuel industry’s interest in roughly $3.4 billion of federal funding from Biden-era appropriations, we believe it may be a target for future similar Trump administration deals,” Stanco wrote.

The DOE’s Office of Nuclear Energy is expected to work with industry participants in the coming weeks to identify participants and long-term goals.

The Trump administration has already announced deals with Intel (INTC) and rare earths producer MP Materials (MP), both of which involved the government backing major domestic manufacturing projects. Following the Intel deal struck earlier this month, Trump and other members of the administration suggested this would be the beginning of a broader investment strategy.

Stanco sees Bethesda, Md-based Centrus Energy (LEU) as a likely recipient of government backing, as it is the only domestic company currently producing enriched uranium under a DOE contract. Centrus shares have rallied over 180% year to date. BWX Technologies (BWXT), a Lynchburg, Va-based company with a $15 billion market cap, is also on the analyst’s list. Its stock is up 45% year to date.

The Russia-Ukraine war renewed national security concerns around nuclear power, as uranium enrichment has increasingly shifted overseas. Meanwhile, the AI boom’s surging energy demands have increased interest in nuclear energy as deals between Big Tech and nuclear energy providers have put a spotlight on the sector.

Nuclear energy providers Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VSTR) are each up more than 35% year to date on optimism of growing power demand for data centers.

On Tuesday, BofA initiated coverage of Oklo (OKLO), a builder of next-generation small nuclear reactors (SMRs), with a Buy rating. Its stock is up more than 1,000% over the last year as investors bet on nuclear energy as part of the AI trade. ""Nuclear is regaining momentum, backed by both the DOE and data center operators, with Oklo well positioned to meet the rising energy needs of AI,"" the firm wrote.

And while the administration's high-profile Intel deal is seen as a novel arrangement, Compass Point's Stanco notes that government ownership of nuclear fuel production is not unusual around the world.

In the US, much of the enriched uranium supply comes from Urenco, whose ownership is split among the UK and Dutch governments, along with German utilities. France, meanwhile, owns 90% of Orano, a primary enrichment company seeking to expand in the US.

""Therefore, we can see where the Trump administration may want to exert leverage through the potential funding, and, in the case of Urenco or Orano, even through trade or other sovereign negotiations, to seek more US ownership of new domestic nuclear fuel production,"" Stanco added.

A 'fundamental tension'

Still, questions remain on how these deals will ultimately shake out and whether the government should be doling out money in exchange for stakes.

“There is a fundamental tension here,” Philip Rossetti, a resident senior fellow at the right-leaning R Street Institute, told Yahoo Finance. ""You're incentivizing these companies to try to get under this umbrella of governmental protection.”

“The problem is, if that company starts to become inefficient with its production, like if it has rising production costs, or neglecting investment that would improve productivity or reduce operating costs, the bearer of those costs and inefficiencies are going to be the public,"" he added.

But the White House has signaled Intel's deal could be just the beginning of a new wave of government dealmaking under the second Trump administration.

MP Materials stock surged 50% in one session in July after announcing the Pentagon would become its largest shareholder to curb reliance on Chinese rare earths. Intel shares rose 5% after the US announced a 9.9% stake in the struggling chipmaker.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recently hinted the administration is considering taking a stake in defense contractor Lockheed Martin (LMT), telling CNBC there has been a ""monstrous discussion about defense.""

“The Biden administration literally was giving Intel money for free and giving TSMC money for free, and all these companies just giving the money for free,” said Lutnick.

“Donald Trump turned it into saying, ‘Hey, we want equity for the money. If we’re going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action for the American taxpayer.’”

It mandates state agencies, including the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), California Energy Commission (CEC), and California Independent System Operator (CAISO), to prioritize permitting and approvals to expedite these projects.

The order also requires a report within 90 days detailing actions taken and recommendations for further support.

“California is doubling down on building more clean energy, faster,” Newsom said, emphasizing the state’s commitment to carbon neutrality by 2045 and 100% clean electricity by the same year. The state added nearly 7,000 megawatts of clean energy capacity in 2024, a record, with 67% of retail electricity sales in 2023 from renewable and zero-carbon sources.

The Trump administration’s policies, including HR 1, threaten hundreds of California projects that could create thousands of jobs and bolster grid reliability. The order instructs the CPUC to prioritize interconnection for projects expected online within three years, streamline transmission permitting, and coordinate with utilities and CAISO.",https://yovenice-enki.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3162.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 17:02:56.377964

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement.

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It's the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states' climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans' livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

Chang, opinion contributor",,,,,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/5477608-china-car-industry-global-dominance/,"China, already the world’s largest automobile market, “has overtaken Detroit as the center of the global auto industry,” writes the New York Times.
The scholar asks whether China will take over the global auto industry.
There are, after all, about 150 passenger car manufacturers in China — 97 domestic manufacturers and 43 joint ventures with foreigners.
That’s not good news for a Chinese car sector that has now become extraordinarily dependent on exports.
In a world where China is shut off from the most developed markets, China’s car industry and BYD, its leader, may be the ones without a future.","China’s carmakers were responsible for 21 percent of global sales in 2024, according to consulting group AlixPartners. They are projected to account for 30 percent in 2030.

China, already the world’s largest automobile market, “has overtaken Detroit as the center of the global auto industry,” writes the New York Times. The country’s manufacturers are not stopping there, however.

“China now has an incredible — and I would argue unprecedented — capacity to supply over half the global market for cars, which is typically around 90 million cars a year,” according to Brad Sester of the Council on Foreign Relations.

The scholar asks whether China will take over the global auto industry. The answer: Probably not.

China’s automobile sector is certainly big. There are, after all, about 150 passenger car manufacturers in China — 97 domestic manufacturers and 43 joint ventures with foreigners. New companies are still entering the crowded market.

Some of those car companies are doing well. In an industry where 70 percent factory utilization is the general dividing line between profitability and failure, Tesla in China had the highest rate at 96 percent.

The company in its Shanghai “gigafactory” makes the Model 3 and Model Y sport-utility vehicles for both domestic and foreign sales. Shenzhen-based BYD, the world’s largest new-energy vehicle maker, enjoyed utilization rates of 80 to 85 percent in the 2022 to 2024 timeframe.

Many of the companies in China will not survive, however. Only about 15 percent of 70 Chinese carmakers tracked by Gasgoo Automotive Research Institute had a factory utilization rate last year of at least 70 percent.

The next trend in China, therefore, is easy to predict.

“The consolidation has not yet truly begun,” Stephen Dyer of AlixPartners in Shanghai told Bloomberg. “In the end, it will slowly consolidate because car making is a truly cash-burning business. We expect to see maybe a dozen survivors.”

Price wars started in early 2023 and have taken their toll. The discounting is the inevitable result of too much supply. Too much supply is the inevitable result of China’s economic model, which depresses consumption and prioritizes industrial production.

As a result of this model, China’s internal market — around 25 million car sales per year — is not growing robustly.

In the last several weeks, the Chinese central government, alarmed by deep discounting, has stepped in to stabilize prices. Government action is only a temporary fix, however. China’s planners see exports as the longer-term solution.

“China currently has the capacity to produce over two times its own domestic demand and is adding to that capacity quickly thanks to the rapid expansion of its electric vehicle sector,” Sester wrote. “It thus has almost unlimited potential capacity to export.”

And China is exporting, grabbing market share and decimating foreign car companies around the world.

In a rules-based trading system — China acceded to the World Trade Organization in December 2001 — Chinese manufacturers have been able to penetrate open markets. At the same time, Beijing has gamed rules and taken advantage of lax enforcement by others of their rights. As a result, China has largely been allowed to continue policies blocking access to its market.

“A U.S. system built around the ideal of openness and interdependence is facing off against a Chinese counterpart constructed as a fortress of control,” write Tom Orlik, Eric Zhu and Jennifer Welch of Bloomberg.

“In a first-best world of free trade and market competition, the dynamism of the U.S. approach should win every time,” they point out.

But we do not live in that world. The writers dubbed our situation as “the second-best world of protectionism and economic statecraft.” They said this “theory of the second best” posits that “if one of the conditions for perfect markets is missing, sticking with the others — rather than finding a second-best accommodation — only makes things worse.”

“China’s state planners have spent decades developing tools for a second-best world,” they continue. These planners have, with numerous stratagems, successfully exploited that system. In practical terms, China is now forcing the rest of the world to accept a second-best system.

As countries choose the second best — most notably the U.S. with President Trump’s ongoing tariff campaign — China’s industries will suffer, especially as others follow his protectionist lead.

That’s not good news for a Chinese car sector that has now become extraordinarily dependent on exports.

In 2024, BYD, which stands for “Build Your Dreams,” passed Tesla to become the world’s biggest-selling electric vehicle brand. Many believe the race between the two companies is just about over.

It’s not. In a world where China is shut off from the most developed markets, China’s car industry and BYD, its leader, may be the ones without a future.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/china_auto_cas_byd_08232025_GettyImages-2230783280-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-30 17:03:18.616636

“Following a thorough internal investigation, EPA supervisors made decisions on an individualized basis,’' an EPA spokeswoman said Friday in a statement.
“The Trump administration and EPA’s retaliatory actions against these workers was clearly an assault on labor and free-speech rights,’' said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA employees.
More than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed the letter made public Monday.

“Following a thorough internal investigation, EPA supervisors made decisions on an individualized basis,’' an EPA spokeswoman said Friday in a statement.

The so-called declaration of dissent, signed by more than 170 employees in late June, “contains inaccurate information designed to mislead the public about agency business,’' spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said. “Thankfully, this represents a small fraction of the thousands of hard-working, dedicated EPA employees who are not trying to mislead and scare the American public.”

The EPA “has a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November,’' she added.

Vaseliou declined to say how many employees were disciplined, but the head of the agency’s largest union said at least six probationary employees who signed the letter were fired, along with at least two career employees. The firings were first reported by The Washington Post.

The EPA union, part of the American Federation of Government Employees, condemned the firings, which come after 139 workers were put on administrative leave shortly after signing the dissent declaration. The EPA at the time accused employees of “unlawfully undermining” the Trump administration’s agenda.

“The Trump administration and EPA’s retaliatory actions against these workers was clearly an assault on labor and free-speech rights,’' said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA employees.

More than 150 workers who were disciplined — up to and including being fired — included scientists, engineers, lawyers, contract officers, emergency response personnel “and a whole host of other jobs,” Chen told the Associated Press. “They live and work in communities around the country, and all believe in the mission of the agency to protect human health and the environment on behalf of the American public.”

In a letter made public June 30, the employees wrote that the EPA is no longer living up to its mission to protect human health and the environment. The letter represented rare public criticism from agency employees who knew they could face retaliation for speaking out against a weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science.

Employees at other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and Federal Emergency Management Agency, have issued similar statements. Some FEMA employees who signed a public letter of dissent earlier this week were put on administrative leave Tuesday, according to documents reviewed by The Associated Press.

More than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed the letter made public Monday. The statement criticizes recent cuts to agency staff and programs and warns that FEMA’s capacity to respond to a major disaster is dangerously diminished.

The EPA said last month it is eliminating its research and development arm and reducing agency staff by thousands of employees.

The Humboldt Bay project was planned to build a maritime terminal for assembling and deploying wind turbines, supporting California's goal of achieving 25 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2045.","The U.S. Department of Transportation has canceled funding for 12 infrastructure projects supporting offshore wind development, totaling 679 million dollars. This decision directly impacts thousands of jobs, including many blue-collar workers who supported the current administration in the elections, creating a stark contrast with the government's ""America First"" labor policies.

The administration is accelerating its policy offensive against wind energy development. The Department of Transportation's decision to withdraw funding for these projects is part of a broader strategy to prioritize traditional energy sources over renewable energy. The department's secretary stated that wasteful wind energy projects were diverting resources that could be used to revitalize the U.S. maritime industry. The reallocated funds are expected to support port upgrades and other infrastructure projects.

One of the most significant projects affected is the Revolution Wind project by Danish energy company Orsted A/S, which was ordered to halt its operations off the coast of New England. The project, which was 80% complete, is now under threat, raising concerns about potential electricity price increases. Industry executives warn that the administration's actions against clean energy could lead to higher electricity prices.

The project's suspension has left approximately 1,000 workers in Rhode Island idle, sparking strong discontent among local union leaders. The union chairman highlighted that these jobs were specifically trained ""blue-collar, working-class positions"" that the administration had promised to protect. A non-profit industry advocacy group also noted the irony of these actions coming from an administration that frequently discusses the importance of American workers and enjoys union support.

Industry advocates warn that the project's stagnation will not only affect coastal regions but also ripple through the manufacturing supply chain in Republican strongholds like Louisiana. The administration has reiterated its energy policy priorities, emphasizing the release of domestic oil, natural gas, and nuclear energy as the most effective and reliable tools. Under this policy, multiple offshore wind projects have become targets, with the Humboldt Bay project in California being the most severely affected, losing approximately 427 million dollars in federal funding.

The Humboldt Bay project was planned to build a maritime terminal for assembling and deploying wind turbines, supporting California's goal of achieving 25 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2045. The 12 affected projects include:

Projects with funding withdrawn:

Bridgeport Port Authority Wind Energy Maintenance Port Project in Connecticut (10.53 million dollars)

He is a recipient of the Clean Grid Innovator Award and Green Leader of the Year, and serves on the boards of the Louisiana Clean Energy Council and National Renewable Futures Forum.","(MENAFN- Zex PR Wire) Renewable energy executive calls for public awareness, equity, and action in reshaping how America thinks about energy access

Louisiana, USA, 30th August 2025, ZEX PR WIRE , Tyler Pommier , Executive Vice President of Innovation at GulfStream Renewables, is calling on individuals, communities, and leaders across the U.S. to rethink the way energy is produced, shared, and understood. After years of spearheading clean energy projects across the Gulf Coast, Pommier is using his platform to raise awareness about energy equity and local empowerment through decentralized, renewable systems.

“Everyone deserves access to clean power,” Pommier says.“Not just for the environment, but for dignity, safety, and freedom.”

This message is central to Pommier's recent TEDx talk titled“Decentralizing Power: Energy Belongs to Everyone.” It also echoes throughout his work developing solar, wind, and battery systems that support schools, neighborhoods, and underserved rural areas.

The Power Gap

Pommier's advocacy comes at a time when energy insecurity remains a serious issue. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration:

Nearly one in three U.S. households faces some form of energy insecurity each year.

In rural and low-income communities, power outages and energy costs impact health, education, and economic stability.

Schools in underserved areas face frequent disruptions due to unreliable power, affecting student learning and safety.

“This isn't just a technical problem-it's a people problem,” says Pommier.“When a school loses power, classrooms close. When a family can't afford heating, people get sick. Energy touches every part of our lives.”

Local Action, Local Control

One of Pommier's proudest achievements is a series of solar-plus-battery installations in rural schools across Louisiana.

“These schools had constant outages,” he explains.“We gave them a way to stay open, save money, and be resilient. That kind of project shows how clean energy can serve real human needs.”

He believes decentralized systems-like rooftop solar, community microgrids, and battery storage-can give control back to families, schools, and local governments.

“I want to see communities that don't just use power,” he says.“I want to see communities that own their power.”

Making Clean Energy Understandable

Pommier is also focused on simplifying the conversation.“You can't just throw data at people,” he says.“You have to explain how it affects their daily lives. Like: Will your fridge stay on in a storm? Will your kid's school stay open during a blackout?”

His plainspoken approach has made him a trusted voice at town halls, schools, and policy meetings.

What You Can Do

Pommier isn't asking people to wait for government action or big investment. Instead, he's offering simple steps that everyday people can take:

Learn how your home or building uses energy.

Ask questions at local meetings about power sourcing and grid reliability.

Support community solar projects or energy co-ops.

Encourage schools and public buildings to explore renewable options.

Talk about it. Share energy stories with neighbors, family, and friends.

“Start small,” Pommier says.“Talk to your city council. Learn how your utility works. Ask where your electricity comes from. That's how change begins.”

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It's the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states' climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans' livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

In addition to reforming the climate credit, state lawmakers should also advance structural changes by regionalizing California’s electric grid and protecting electric vehicle programs, which lower costs for everyone.
Lower electricity prices also could accelerate California’s clean energy transition by making electric cars more affordable, helping the state meet its climate goals.
This shift would be more equitable since nearly all households pay electric bills, but many don’t use gas.
Finally, state policymakers should prioritize state funding for California’s electric vehicle programs, which deliver direct savings to all electricity customers.","This legislative session offers a crucial opportunity to update the climate credit program and use these funds to lower electric rates, delivering meaningful relief where families need it most: on their electricity bills. That change, combined with other rate reforms taking effect next year, could reduce costs for most households by 20%, UC Santa Barbara researchers found.

That’s real savings that can improve lives across California. And it starts with thoughtfully reauthorizing the cap and trade program so funding can reach utility customers.

Addressing the affordability crisis requires action on multiple fronts. In addition to reforming the climate credit, state lawmakers should also advance structural changes by regionalizing California’s electric grid and protecting electric vehicle programs, which lower costs for everyone.

The urgency is clear. PG&E rates have climbed 40% above inflation since 2018. Rates for other investor-owned utilities are increasing at a similarly dire pace. For families struggling to make ends meet, these increases are crushing.

California’s leaders can take decisive action in the coming weeks.

It begins with restructuring the climate credit program to deliver monthly relief, instead of twice a year, by using polluter fees to directly reduce electricity prices. This creates predictable savings and importantly can help inland families afford air conditioning during the brutal summer heat.

Lower electricity prices also could accelerate California’s clean energy transition by making electric cars more affordable, helping the state meet its climate goals.

Legislators also could shift funds currently applied to gas bills toward electricity relief, where families need help the most. Electricity represents the largest utility expense for most California households. This shift would be more equitable since nearly all households pay electric bills, but many don’t use gas.

State leaders should pair these climate credit reforms with structural electric system changes, including participating in a regionalized grid that enables clean energy sharing across the West. It will help California develop more renewable energy to use or sell to other states, while reducing fossil fuel dependence and improving air quality.

Finally, state policymakers should prioritize state funding for California’s electric vehicle programs, which deliver direct savings to all electricity customers.

Every electric car and truck on the road helps lower everyone’s bills because EV owners pay more in electricity costs than they actually cost the grid to serve, essentially subsidizing cheaper prices for all Californians. As more families make the switch to electric vehicles, these savings compound, creating a virtuous cycle of falling electricity prices that benefits every household, regardless of what they drive.",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/davisenterprise.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/0d/d0d09c6a-17f2-41a1-babd-9b7ed41960e5/68b1e0b8de09b.image.jpg?crop=1000%2C525%2C0%2C237,N,,2025-08-30 13:05:34.203597

State regulators are again seeking developers who could pull off a wind and transmission project with the new regional support.
However, it’s an open question whether the northern Maine transmission project will be able to overcome some of the early roadblocks — including local resistance along the proposed corridor — that have already stalled the project for several years.
But Francis Pullaro, president of the green energy-supporting group RENEW Northeast, said the northern Maine project can survive without federal assistance.
Northern Maine has some of the strongest wind energy potential in the Northeast, according to experts.","A new push to boost electricity capacity across New England could help to get a stalled transmission line project to northern Maine — and related wind energy development in the region — back on track.

The effort by ISO New England, which operates the region’s power grid, will likely support the upgrade of a key substation in Pittsfield and other changes to move power farther south into New England. That could, in turn, make it easier to tap the mostly undeveloped wind energy potential of northern Maine, according to Jack Shapiro, director for clean energy programs at the Natural Resources Council of Maine.

Clean energy advocates hope the efforts by ISO New England could give a much-needed boost to Maine’s own plans to create more wind energy in Aroostook County and send it southward. State regulators are again seeking developers who could pull off a wind and transmission project with the new regional support.

However, it’s an open question whether the northern Maine transmission project will be able to overcome some of the early roadblocks — including local resistance along the proposed corridor — that have already stalled the project for several years.

Because all six New England states will share in the costs for transmission investments, ISO New England’s new effort could knock hundreds of millions of dollars off the overall cost to Maine ratepayers for a project in the northern part of the state, Shapiro said.

“It’s a really big deal and really exciting to see this kind of regional planning and thinking,” Shapiro said.

Across the U.S., the renewable energy outlook has gotten considerably darker under the new Trump administration, which has pushed executive actions and a Republican megabill that have removed key federal support for those efforts.

But Francis Pullaro, president of the green energy-supporting group RENEW Northeast, said the northern Maine project can survive without federal assistance.

“Federal support is not mandatory; however, certainly any project that can benefit from federal tax policy will have increased benefits for Maine and the region’s consumers,” he said.

Northern Maine has some of the strongest wind energy potential in the Northeast, according to experts. But harnessing that wind and getting the electricity it produces to the power grid has had its share of obstacles and stalled attempts, including the Number Nine Wind Farm canceled in late 2016 and the Aroostook Renewable Gateway canceled in December 2023.

Nonetheless, the region’s electric usage continues to increase due to heat pumps, EVs, and other electrification priorities, and the need for new power sources has grown with it, said Pullaro. That’s on top of Maine’s push to produce 100 percent clean electricity by 2040.

As part of ISO New England’s new initiative to encourage more transmission capacity, it has issued a request for proposals for various efforts, including developing new infrastructure in Pittsfield — or at an alternate location north of a substation there — that can accommodate the interconnection of at least 1,200 megawatts of onshore wind.

The RFP also seeks to increase what’s called the “interface capability” in two different parts of southern Maine near the New Hampshire border.

According to Shapiro, the ISO could select more than one project to address all of those needs but the substation and transmission line would be located in Maine. The six New England states would share in the costs, with bids closing on Sept. 30.

The Pittsfield substation, with its more northern location, could make plugging into the grid easier than a previous substation proposal near Augusta, although the transmission route has not yet been determined, Shapiro said.

Another boost to Maine’s renewed attempt to get electricity flowing from Aroostook County has come from Massachusetts legislators. The state had previously agreed to purchase 40 percent of the power generated from the Aroostook Renewable Gateway project, but that offer had a December 2025 deadline. Recently, the state approved extending that deadline to 2027.

In 2021, the Maine Legislature tasked the Maine Public Utility Commission with soliciting bids for both power generation and transmission for the Aroostook Renewable Gateway project.

New York-headquartered LS Power was awarded the transmission portion of the gateway project, and Boston-based Longroad Energy’s King Pine Wind was selected to generate the power with County located wind turbines.

The Aroostook Renewable Gateway was touted as the largest land-based wind project east of the Mississippi River. With its proposed 170 wind turbines slated to snake along a large swath of Aroostook County mountain tops, it was set to harness the northern Maine wind. And the complementary transmission line, starting in Haynesville, would have carried that power to the New England electric grid.

But cost and transmission route issues plagued LS Power’s bid, despite efforts by the company to meet with the public in a series of information gathering sessions along the proposed route. Many property owners were opposed to the route because in certain places it cut through the middle of farmlands or rural towns. In late December 2023, the PUC canceled the project because of cost uncertainties.

But in May 2024, the PUC put out a request for information from clean-energy experts and developers interested in bidding on the wind or transmission projects before proceeding with a new call for bids, to better determine how to move forward. In April, the commission made a second request for information that mentioned details on the ISO New England initiative and the proposed substation in Pittsfield.

The deadline for additional comments on the request is Sept. 30, according to PUC spokesperson Susan Faloon. The project is now called the Northern Maine Renewable Energy Development Program.

“Overall, the state and region must bring online low-cost clean energy that provides meaningful benefits to host communities, the states and consumers,” Pullaro said. “If we get this right, it is possible to envision a second regional project moving forward. If we don’t get this right, it means higher costs and energy shortages.”

The PUC expects to issue a draft RFP for the Aroostook wind project and transmission line to allow for public feedback in the coming weeks and then to issue the final request by the end of the year, said Faloon.

Pullaro said that whichever project is ultimately selected, its developers will have a critical role to play in meeting with communities and citizens to listen to their ideas and concerns, and answer questions.

Electric two-wheeler maker Ather Energy on Saturday unveiled a new two-wheeler platform for a new generation of electric scooters across multiple segments.

The company also announced a series of other significant product and technology developments, including showcasing a concept moto-scooter Redux, and AtherStack 7.0, which would alert riders to share live location, report on potholes and crashes, update them on tyre pressure, among others.

Built for versatility, scalability, and cost optimisation, the new e-scooter platform is the first vehicle architecture since the launch of Ather 450, the company announced at an event here.

""With the EL platform, we are laying the foundation for Ather's next phase of growth. Just as the 450 defined our first chapter, EL will define the next, enabling us to develop multiple types of scooters at scale far more efficiently,"" said Tarun Mehta, Co-founder & CEO, Ather Energy, at the event.

This platform-first approach enables faster innovation and improved efficiency, serviceability, and rider experience, he said adding the latest platform reflects years of learning, deep R&D, and engineering.

Live Events

He said the Ather's new factory at Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar will scale with EL platform products to meet growing demand effectively.

A vehicle platform is the underlying structure and integrated systems shared by multiple vehicle models. The structure, which includes the chassis, powertrain, underbody, and electronic architectures, serves as the common foundation for the design and engineering.

The company has two manufacturing plants in Hosur (Tamil Nadu), one each for vehicle manufacturing and battery manufacturing. Additionally, another is coming up in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Maharashtra, which is expected to increase Ather's total manufacturing capacity to 1.42 million EVs per year.

Ather said its next-generation platform is designed to meet the evolving and diverse needs of the domestic electric scooter buyers.

Designed on the back of 26 lakh km of field data, the new platform features a new chassis, powertrain, and a fully redesigned electronics stack. This offers the flexibility to build a wide variety of form factors by utilising a common set of key components, the company said.

The versatility it offers enables Ather to cater to different consumer segments, use cases, and markets, while being more cost-effective. It also noted that simpler architecture and a reduced component count enable 15 per cent faster assembly.

This also allows up to 2X faster periodic services, increasing the service interval up to 10,000 km, it said.

The new platform also introduces features such as Advanced Electronic Braking System (AEBS), which enhances braking performance by reducing stopping distance and minimising rear-wheel lockups, it said.

""With AtherStackTM 7.0, we're bringing AI into everyday riding through an LLM (Large Language Model) trained for our use cases and tuned to Indian dialects. Voice is the first step in that journey, an interface beyond buttons that makes rides smarter, safer, and more intuitive,"" said Swapnil Jain, Co-founder and CTO at Ather Energy.

Ather also announced expanding its theft-safety suite with the introduction of ParkSafe and LockSafe features and said that AtherStack 7.0 will roll out as an over-the-air (OTA) update in the coming months, and will be backwards compatible with the Rizta Z and the Ather 450X up to Gen 3 scooters.

The company also announced it has updated the 2025 Ather 450 Apex with its own advanced cruise control system designed specifically for Indian riding conditions.

Ather also unveiled its next-generation fast-charging experience. The new 6 kW charger is half the size of the current Ather fast charger and delivers double the speed in select Ather variants, adding up to 30 km of range in just 10 minutes, the company said.

With Trump’s 2025 policies phasing out solar tax credits and imposing tariffs, the U.S. solar market faces headwinds. However, SolarEdge’s strategic pivot to international markets, resilient financials, and analyst optimism suggest the pullback may present a compelling entry point for long-term investors.

Political Headwinds and U.S. Market Challenges

President Trump’s ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" has disrupted the U.S. solar sector by phasing out tax credits for solar and wind energy, favoring hydropower and nuclear alternatives [1]. This policy shift has led to a 42% drop in SolarEdge’s stock price at one point in 2025 [1]. Additionally, tightened federal permits and tariffs on solar imports from Southeast Asia have increased costs and supply chain risks [3]. BloombergNEF projects a 23% decline in U.S. solar installations through 2030 compared to earlier forecasts, directly threatening SolarEdge’s domestic growth [5].

Despite these challenges, the company is adapting. CEO Shuky Nir emphasized in Q2 2025 earnings calls that SolarEdge is expanding U.S. manufacturing to leverage the 45X Advanced Manufacturing Credit, aiming to neutralize tariff impacts by 2026 [1]. This onshoring strategy aligns with the Inflation Reduction Act’s incentives, which have sustained some U.S. solar growth [4].

Analyst Sentiment: Mixed but Optimistic

Analyst ratings for SEDG remain mixed, with a ""Reduce"" consensus from 28 firms, including 10 ""Sell"" and 18 ""Hold"" ratings [1]. However, recent upgrades from Barclays, UBS, and KeyCorp signal cautious optimism. Barclays raised its price target from $12 to $29, while UBS increased its target to $30, maintaining a ""neutral"" rating [1]. These upgrades follow SolarEdge’s Q2 revenue of $289.43 million, a 9% year-over-year increase and a 32% sequential jump [1].

The stock’s 31.8% month-to-date gain as of August 29, 2025, reflects investor confidence despite the bearish consensus [6]. Analysts project an average 1-year target price of $18.20, implying a potential 44.5% downside from the current $32.81 [1]. Yet, the recent Q3 revenue guidance of $315M–$355M (vs. $296.7M estimate) has prompted price target revisions, suggesting earnings resilience [5].

Financial Resilience and Strategic Diversification

SolarEdge’s Q2 2025 results highlight operational improvements. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded to 13.1%, up from 7.8% in Q1, driven by higher revenue and cost efficiencies [2]. The company also increased cash reserves to $131.8 million, providing liquidity for R&D and strategic acquisitions [3]. Management anticipates further margin improvements in Q3, with non-GAAP gross margin projected at 15–19% despite a 2% tariff impact [3].

Critically, SolarEdge is diversifying its revenue streams. A partnership with Schaeffler to deploy 2,300 EV charging points in Europe and growth in commercial storage solutions position the company to offset U.S. market risks [3]. This pivot aligns with global trends, as the residential solar market faces headwinds in 2026 [1].

Global Clean Energy Incentives: A Long-Term Tailwind

While the U.S. market falters, global clean energy incentives are accelerating SolarEdge’s international expansion. The EU added 67 GW of solar capacity in 2024, supported by the Green Deal and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism [1]. India, now the third-largest solar market, installed 30.7 GW in 2024, driven by its 500 GW non-fossil fuel target by 2030 [1]. Latin America’s Brazil added 14 GW of solar in 2024, fueled by distributed generation and rural electrification [1].

SolarEdge is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends. Malaysia’s Corporate Renewable Energy Supply Scheme and Indonesia’s power wheeling policies are creating favorable conditions for solar-storage projects [3]. Additionally, Singapore’s carbon credit purchases and Vietnam’s Direct Power Purchase Agreement (DPPA) scheme are expanding renewable energy adoption [4].

Conclusion: A Calculated Buy for Long-Term Investors

SolarEdge’s stock has faced significant volatility due to U.S. policy risks, but its financial resilience, strategic diversification, and global market opportunities suggest the pullback is temporary. While the Trump administration’s policies create near-term uncertainty, the company’s onshoring efforts, margin improvements, and international expansion plans mitigate these risks.

For investors with a long-term horizon, SEDG’s current valuation—trading at a discount to its 2028 revenue projections of $1.7 billion [3]—offers a compelling entry point. The global solar market’s projected 10.6% CAGR from 2025 to 2030 [2] further underscores SolarEdge’s potential to thrive beyond U.S. borders. However, investors must remain cautious about regulatory shifts and supply chain bottlenecks.

In a sector defined by rapid innovation and policy-driven cycles, SolarEdge’s adaptability and global reach position it as a resilient long-term play.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-30 16:04:35.577193

An innovative solution from MIT might hold the key to revolutionizing electric vehicle (EV) battery recycling. A research team at the esteemed institution has unveiled a self-assembling battery material that disintegrates upon contact with a simple organic liquid. This breakthrough, detailed in a recent Nature Chemistry paper, could mark a significant move towards batteries designed with recyclability in mind.

The material primarily acts as an electrolyte in solid-state batteries and is quickly reduced to its molecular components, which could potentially streamline the recycling process. Current recycling methods often shred batteries into mixed, tough-to-process materials. This new approach allows the battery to disassemble, effectively simplifying the separation of components. As Yukio Cho, the lead author of the study, told MIT News, ""Our approach is to start with easily recyclable materials and figure out how to make them battery-compatible. Designing batteries for recyclability from the beginning is a new approach.""

The innovation draws on aramid amphiphiles (AAs), which self-assemble in water to form nanoribbons capable of conducting lithium ions. This combination of resilience, reminiscent of Kevlar, and ion conductivity could prove integral to creating sustainable, efficient batteries. Upon exposure to water, these AAs quickly transform into a gel, indicating a high volume of nanoribbons ready to be hot-pressed into a solid-state material. The team successfully tested a battery cell using this material, although they acknowledged that performance was hampered by polarization, limiting rapid charging and discharging.

Significantly, when dipped into an organic solvent, the battery dissolves, enabling each part to separate for easier recycling. ""So, when you want to recycle the battery, the entire electrolyte layer can fall off naturally and you can recycle the electrodes separately,"" Cho explained in a statement obtained by MIT News. The team currently aims to fully optimize the material's performance and explore integration with existing battery designs and new battery chemistries.

With the escalating demand for EVs, this research could also help address the critical issue of lithium supply. Reusing materials from recycled batteries may act as an effective domestic source of lithium, mitigating the need for new mines and stabilizing lithium pricing. ""If we can start to recycle lithium-ion batteries from battery waste at scale, it'll have the same effect as opening lithium mines in the U.S.,"" said Cho. This type of innovation not only represents a step forward environmentally but also signifies a potential paradigm shift in how the industry approaches battery life cycle and resource utilization.",https://img.hoodline.com/2025/8/mit-mavens-unveil-game-changing-self-dismantling-ev-battery-revolutionizing-recycling-and-curbing-e-waste.webp,N,,2025-08-30 14:06:14.837936

“We’ll start to be able to go to electric fleets and reduce the cost straight up — no incentives, no tax breaks, no grants — versus a [gas-powered] fleet,” said CEO Rick Wilmer.
Charging networks have long angled to serve vehicle fleets, such as delivery companies, rideshare outfits and construction contractors, that typically have a large and predictable power demand.
When the vehicles are idle and have extra electrons, they can uncork a tiny trickle of revenue, or at least help power nearby buildings.
Often, these fleets are idle at the end of a work day, precisely when power demand is peaking on the typical grid.","For the past few years, charging networks, delivery fleets and retail hubs have been hustling to add infrastructure to provide juice to electric cars. The next step: helping drivers sell excess electrons back to the grid.

ChargePoint Holdings Inc., a Silicon Valley-based company that operates roughly 35,000 fast-charging ports in the US, announced this week a new kind of station that will pump power to and from vehicles, as opposed to the vast majority of chargers, which simply take electrons from the grid.

ChargePoint hopes the system will win business from companies that operate large fleets of vehicles by providing the opportunity to sell the electrons sitting in idle cars and trucks.

“We’ll start to be able to go to electric fleets and reduce the cost straight up — no incentives, no tax breaks, no grants — versus a [gas-powered] fleet,” said CEO Rick Wilmer.

Charging networks have long angled to serve vehicle fleets, such as delivery companies, rideshare outfits and construction contractors, that typically have a large and predictable power demand. ChargePoint reckons the next phase of charging competition will be helping those companies monetize their vehicles. When the vehicles are idle and have extra electrons, they can uncork a tiny trickle of revenue, or at least help power nearby buildings. Often, these fleets are idle at the end of a work day, precisely when power demand is peaking on the typical grid.

“You’re ending up with a significantly better mousetrap,” Wilmer said.

At the same time, there’s a push among many companies to generate and store electricity onsite to safeguard against outages, arbitrage time-of-use power prices or get off the grid entirely. Those sites will now be able to tap into vehicles as part of their energy mix, according to Eaton Corp., a power management company that is partnering with ChargePoint on the new charging system. The stations, which ChargePoint has dubbed Express Grid, will also use electricity generated onsite, say from solar panels or wind turbines.

Companies are “adding distributed energy resources such as solar, storage and wind,” said Paul Ryan, vice president and general manager of energy transition at Eaton. “Now you have EVs that are battery assets.”

To be sure, not all utilities can or will accept electricity from anything that isn’t a power plant. Likewise, many of today’s EVs can only accept electrons, not feed them the other way, a process known as bi-directional charging. For example, Ford Motor Co.’s electric pick-up truck, the F-150 Lightning, can discharge its battery, but the company’s electric crossover, the Mustang Mach-E, doesn’t have that capability.

But many analysts expect so-called bidirectional charging will soon be ubiquitous in the EV market. And with more volatile weather and the rise of power-hungry data centers, US utilities are scrambling to get electricity wherever they can find it.

While ChargePoint and Eaton unveiled their new charging system on Thursday, they have yet to take orders. The companies expect to install the first such unit in the second half of next year.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/384a5bd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff9%2Fe0%2Fce675a8e1c39f8079090b5a85704%2F1x-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 13:04:20.822360

Trump called wind and solar power “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve wind or “farmer destroying Solar” projects. “The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!” he wrote on his Truth Social site.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand, aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for energy-hungry data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems. Increased use of electric vehicles also has boosted demand, even as the Trump administration and congressional Republicans move to restrict tax credits and other incentives for EV purchases approved under the Biden administration.

Natural gas prices, meanwhile, are rising sharply amid increased exports to Europe and other international customers.

Trump promised during the 2024 campaign to lower Americans’ electric bills by 50%. Democrats have been quick to blame him for the price hikes, citing actions to hamstring clean energy in the sprawling tax-and-spending cut bill approved last month, as well as regulations since then to further restrict wind and solar power.

Advocates say renewables provide the extra energy needed

“Now more than ever, we need more energy, not less, to meet our increased energy demand and power our grid. Instead of increasing our energy supply Donald Trump is taking a sledgehammer to the clean energy sector, killing jobs and projects,” said New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

A report from Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found the GOP tax law will increase the average family’s energy bill by $130 annually by 2030. “By quickly phasing out technology-neutral clean energy tax credits and adding complex material sourcing requirements,” the tax law will “significantly hamper the development of domestic electricity generation capacity,” the report said.

Renewable advocates were blunter.

“The real scam is blaming solar for fossil fuel price spikes,” the Solar Energy Industries Association said in response to Trump’s post.

“Farmers, families, and businesses choose solar to save money, preserve land, and escape high costs of the old, dirty fuels being forced on them by this administration,” the group added.

As technology improves, wind and solar offer some of the cheapest and fastest ways to provide electric power. More than 90% of new energy capacity that came online in the U.S. in 2024 was clean energy, said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, another industry group.

States with the highest share of clean energy production have seen prices decline in the past year, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, while prices have gone up in states with the least renewable energy use.

“By slowing clean energy deployment, the Trump administration is directly fueling cost increases,” Grumet said

“Blocking cheap, clean energy while doubling down on outdated fossil fuels makes no economic or environmental sense,” added Ted Kelly, director of U.S. clean energy for the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group.

Partisanship anchors debate over rising energy prices

Energy Secretary Chris Wright blamed rising prices on “momentum” from Biden-era policies that backed renewable power over fossil fuel sources such as oil, coal and natural gas.

“That momentum is pushing prices up right now. And who’s going to get blamed for it? We’re going to get blamed because we’re in office,” Wright told POLITICO during a visit to Iowa last week. About 60% of the state’s electricity comes from wind.

Not all the pushback comes from Democrats.

Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican who backs wind power, has placed a hold on three Treasury nominees to ensure wind and solar have “an appropriate glidepath for the orderly phase-out of the tax credits” approved in the 2022 climate law under former President Joe Biden.

Grassley said he was encouraged by new Treasury guidance that limits tax credits for wind and solar projects but does not eliminate them. The guidance “seems to offer a viable path forward for the wind and solar industries to continue to meet increased energy demand,” Grassley said in a statement.",https://nsjonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/A10C.JohnWright.png,N,,2025-08-30 13:04:49.155372

Nuclear can supply energy on demand — unlike wind and solar, which rely on the weather or time of day, though rapidly improving battery tech solves this — making the move away from dirty fuel sources arguably more seamless, or at least easier for renewable skeptics to grasp.

Pushback on nuclear energy can be broad and stem from historical examples of disasters that are generally less applicable to any modern facility that isn't on a fault line, though security is always a factor. Major concerns pointed to by critics generally come down to safety issues, the production of radioactive waste, as well as the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Though these concerns are fair, they are paired with the benefits, making this energy source complex with clear pros and cons that most scientists agree add up to a better equation than seen with any fossil fuels — especially coal.

High upfront costs are another drawback associated with nuclear energy, though with the closed Duane Arnold Energy Center, the infrastructure is already in place, and the facility has been maintained as part of the process of keeping people safe.

""This process has kept the plant's core infrastructure largely intact,"" Interesting Engineering reported. ""An initial engineering assessment found the reactor to be in good condition, suggesting the entire plant could potentially be restored to operation by late 2028,"" the article continued, likely with upgraded computer hardware for safety, monitoring, and security.

Now, with NextEra Energy's request filed with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, it's just a matter of waiting to see how the plant pans out.

While NextEra is an energy company that operates fossil fuel power plants, it has a reputation for advancing renewable energy and nuclear power initiatives and advancements to lower its overall reliance on dirty fuel sources that would also make the company and country more reliant on drilling and mining that often require foreign sources. CEO John Ketchum recently spoke out about the federal government's ""Unleashing American Energy"" plan's featuring of coal as misguided, saying that ""the train has already left the station on coal.""

As with all grid-scale power plants, the energy goes to all kinds of needs in the area including homes, and if you want to become less reliant on the grid yourself, you can install solar panels. Federal tax credits worth up to around $10,000 expire after Dec. 31 and solar projects must be fully installed by then, which can take around 12 weeks, so it's important to act fast if you want to take advantage before it's too late.

This initiative is pivotal in pushing the boundaries of nuclear technology to support the surging energy requirements of data centres through AI-enhanced modular nuclear energy.

The Aalo-X is an innovative extra modular reactor (XMR) located adjacent to INL’s Materials and Fuels Complex.

Aalo executives aim for the reactor to reach criticality by 4 July 2026, marking a point where the nuclear reaction will become self-sustaining.

The company’s involvement in the programme emerged through selection by the US Department of Energy (DOE) following a rigorous competitive application process.

This highlights the collaboration between the public sector and private companies in advancing the nuclear energy market.

The impact of federal support and AI innovations

Initiated by the DOE in June 2025, following Executive Order 14301, the Nuclear Reactor Pilot Programme transforms reactor testing protocols.

Matt Loszak, Co-founder and CEO of Aalo Atomics, regards the selection as an indicator of harmony between public and private interests: “Our selection for the Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program is a significant catalyst for achieving our goal of going from ’founding to fission’ in less than three years – a feat many deemed impossible just a year ago,” he says.

This means that AI plays a key role in achieving these objectives by optimising reactor operations and enhancing safety measures.

INL’s pilot site serves as a testing ground for technologies aiming to improve energy scalability, reliability and deployment speed.

The highest number of air pollution-linked deaths and illnesses was seen in California, Texas, New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.
However, between 2017 and 2023, U.S. oil and gas output increased by 40 percent, meaning the figures in the study likely understate the current situation.
The researchers also looked at the spillover effects on neighbouring countries and found that air pollution linked to the U.S. oil and gas sector causes 1,170 premature deaths in southern Canada and 440 early deaths a year in northern Mexico.
Meanwhile, the President Trump administration is working to reduce the restrictions on air pollution to support government plans for higher fossil fuel production and accelerate new exploration and drilling projects.","Air pollution from oil and gas causes as many as 91,000 premature U.S. deaths a year, according to a study published in Science Advances in August. Meanwhile, during a time when many governments are shifting to green, the U.S. government is doubling down on its fossil fuel production and has recently carried out actions that aim to water down the rigorous air pollution standards enforced by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

The link between fossil fuels and premature deaths has been stressed by scientists and doctors for decades, although the connection is often greatly understated by the oil industry. Meanwhile, other safer energy sources, such as nuclear power, get far more attention for their perceived negative threat to health. However, the new study from University College London and the Stockholm Environment Institute, George Washington University, and the University of Colorado Boulder shows just how many tens of thousands of deaths are caused each year by air pollution from the burning of oil and gas, backed with real data.

Air pollution from oil and gas kills around 91,000 Americans prematurely, as well as causes health problems across hundreds of thousands more in the U.S., each year, with a greater impact on poor communities, particularly those of color. There are also over 10,000 pre-term births linked to fine particulate matter from oil and gas, 216,000 annual childhood-onset asthma cases, and 1,610 annual lifetime cancer cases, according to the study. The highest number of air pollution-linked deaths and illnesses was seen in California, Texas, New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.

The paper’s lead author, Karn Vohra, said, “We’ve long known that these communities are exposed to such levels of inequitable exposure as well as health burden… We were able to just put numbers to what that looks like.”

The study is the first to comprehensively assess the impact of oil and gas-related air pollution on human health and premature deaths, analysing all stages of the oil and gas supply chain, from exploration to end use. It assesses data from 2017, which is the most recent year that has complete data available. However, between 2017 and 2023, U.S. oil and gas output increased by 40 percent, meaning the figures in the study likely understate the current situation.

To assess the data, researchers developed a comprehensive inventory of oil and gas air pollution sources, then ran it through a computer model that calculates the complex air chemistry that forms harmful pollutants across the U.S. They analysed the air pollutant concentrations and epidemiological evidence of the relationship between exposure and health risk, using census and health data, to determine various adverse health outcomes and racial-ethnic disparities. The analysis shows that the final end-use stage overwhelmingly contributes the biggest health burden, contributing to 96 percent of the total incidents linked to the oil and gas industry.

The research found that Indigenous and Hispanic populations were most affected by the exploration, extraction, transportation, and storage stages of oil and gas production, while Black and Asian populations were overwhelmingly more affected by emissions from the processing, refining, manufacturing, distribution, and usage stages. This is linked to the geographical concentrations of specific demographics in certain areas of the United States.

The researchers also looked at the spillover effects on neighbouring countries and found that air pollution linked to the U.S. oil and gas sector causes 1,170 premature deaths in southern Canada and 440 early deaths a year in northern Mexico.

Meanwhile, the President Trump administration is working to reduce the restrictions on air pollution to support government plans for higher fossil fuel production and accelerate new exploration and drilling projects. In March, U.S. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans to undertake 31 historic actions in the greatest and most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history. Some of these actions included the reconsideration of: regulations on power plants, regulations throttling the oil and gas industry, mercury and air toxics standards and the mandatory greenhouse gas reporting programme.

He said at the time, “Today is the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen. We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more.”

A change in EPA standards could lead thousands of cities across the U.S. to become even more polluted at a time when most developed countries around the world are striving to reduce emissions, improve environmental protections, and undergo a green transition. Timothy Donaghy, the research director for the environmental group Greenpeace USA, stressed, “Given the reckless deregulation being pushed by Trump’s EPA and the president’s call to ‘drill, baby, drill’, this new study should be a flashing red warning light for the nation.”

A settlement from a major lawsuit is providing the funds for an ambitious infrastructure project to add dozens of charging stations for electric vehicles in Indiana.

As Electrek reported, Indiana is set to spend $3.3 million to add 36 charging stations across the Hoosier State. The money for the project comes from the Volkswagen Environmental Mitigation Trust, which was created to manage the proceeds of the $2.9 billion settlement following the automaker's Clean Air Act violations.

The plans include 18 DC chargers, among the fastest available, and another 18 Level 2 chargers. The former will be placed along the state's Alternative Fuel Corridors, which means that drivers will have unlimited access at travel stations, restaurants, and shopping areas along Indiana's highways. The projects are slated to be completed by 2026.

The new chargers will help plug gaps in the state's charging infrastructure and address one of the key stumbling blocks to wider electric vehicle adoption.

""Range anxiety,"" the concern that a car will run out of charge before reaching its destination, is a commonly cited reason for some Americans' hesitation to go electric. The increased presence of charging infrastructure will go a long way to allaying those fears.

Electric vehicles are cheaper to run and much better for the environment than standard gas-powered cars. While there are environmental issues regarding mineral extraction to manufacture batteries, EVs pay off their carbon debt after around 11,000 miles, per Carbon Brief.

Even with public chargers, it's much cheaper to fill a battery than a gas tank. But charging at home through solar panels is by far the cheapest and cleanest way to power an EV. With EnergySage's tools, homeowners can compare prices and save up to $10,000 on domestic solar panel installation.

The article's comments expressed excitement at the possibilities the scheme will unlock.

One user said, ""I drive my EV through Indiana several times a year. The more charging options, the better! It's great to hear some good news now and then!""

Another added, ""Great for Indiana. Let's keep building them and putting fast chargers at nearly every corner and every freeway exit.""

The proposal aims to allow 20–25% FDI through the automatic route in non-sensitive areas such as manufacturing, renewable energy, and auto components.

Currently, under Press Note 3 (2020), investments from countries sharing land borders with India, particularly China, require prior government approval.

This rule was introduced after the COVID-19 outbreak and escalating border tensions, to prevent opportunistic acquisitions of Indian firms.

Officials now suggest a more balanced approach. While strategic sectors like defence, telecom, energy exploration, and sensitive installations will remain restricted, others could be opened up to streamline investments, create jobs, and strengthen domestic supply chains.

Any concerns raised about specific investments will still be examined individually to safeguard national interests.

This development comes at a time when diplomatic engagement between India and China is slowly resuming. Recent ministerial visits, talks on border disputes, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s upcoming participation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in China signal efforts to stabilise ties.

The government’s policy think tank, NITI Aayog, has also recommended easing restrictions by allowing up to 24% Chinese FDI without prior clearance, a move aimed at reviving stalled projects such as BYD’s $1 billion electric vehicle plan.

Industry observers note that such reforms could encourage investment flow, reduce project delays, and support India’s manufacturing ambitions.

If approved, this would mark India’s first step towards easing FDI restrictions on Chinese companies since 2020, reflecting a cautious balance between security concerns and economic growth.",https://knnindia.co.in/uploads/newsfiles/FDI-IND-CHINA-30-8-2025.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 13:04:01.948078

Greg Markannen (R-Hancock), the Republican budget allocates $50 million to Wakefield Township in Gogebic County to invest into road upgrades, fortification of the electrical grid and improvements to telecommunication services across the region.
Leading the charge is Protect the Porkies, a grassroots group led by Tom Grotewohl, a resident of Wakefield Township.
In a statement released Thursday, Grotewohl denounced the inclusion of funding for the mine within the House Republican’s budget proposal.
Chief among environmental advocates’ concerns is the location of the mine’s tailings basin, which would store mining waste on sloping topography leading into Lake Superior.
Should the dam collapse, several toxins including arsenic, cadmium, selenium, lead and mercury would be released into the waterway.","Following the passage of the Michigan House of Representatives’ budget proposal for the 2025-2026 fiscal year, opponents of a controversial mining project are slamming the plan for a $50 million allocation aimed at preparing local communities for the project.

Put forth in a request from Rep. Greg Markannen (R-Hancock), the Republican budget allocates $50 million to Wakefield Township in Gogebic County to invest into road upgrades, fortification of the electrical grid and improvements to telecommunication services across the region.

“Site readiness, or lack thereof, is commonly cited as a factor in investment decisions by businesses and venture funds considering Michigan-based opportunities,” Markannen said in his request for legislative spending in May.

He noted that “an opportunity before the Township offers a generational opportunity to create hundreds of good-paying jobs to support local families and bolster the national supply chain and defense capabilities,” a reference to Highland Copper’s Copperwood Mine, but noted site investment is needed to encourage investment in the area.

While the state’s Strategic Fund Board approved $50 million for the mining project last year, the funding was held up in the Michigan Senate, when the Appropriations Committee adjourned for the year without voting on the funding.

While some state and community officials have welcomed the project, the mine has received push back from multiple environmental groups who are raising concerns about the underground mine and its proximity to the Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park, the North Country Trail, and Lake Superior.

Leading the charge is Protect the Porkies, a grassroots group led by Tom Grotewohl, a resident of Wakefield Township.

In a statement released Thursday, Grotewohl denounced the inclusion of funding for the mine within the House Republican’s budget proposal.

“Make no mistake, this funding request is identical in purpose to the $50 million Michigan Strategic Fund-approved SOAR grant twice halted last year due to pushback from around the state and nation,” Grotehwol said. “Considering Speaker Matt Hall’s [(R-Richland Township)] commitment to transparency, it’s surprising that he and his colleagues would include a corporate welfare handout thinly veiled as a community infrastructure grant to Wakefield Township.”

Earlier this summer, Highland Copper, the Canadian company developing the mine, pointed to Wakefield Township’s request for legislative funding as an alternative route in receiving infrastructure funding for the project.

“If one path is successful, the other will no longer be required,” the company said in a July 2 news release.

However, Jane Fitkin, director of Citizens for a Safe & Clean Lake Superior, argued that if the project is to move forward, Highland Copper should be the one footing the bill – not Michigan taxpayers.

Chief among environmental advocates’ concerns is the location of the mine’s tailings basin, which would store mining waste on sloping topography leading into Lake Superior. Should the dam collapse, several toxins including arsenic, cadmium, selenium, lead and mercury would be released into the waterway.

This contamination would infringe on the treaty rights of several Native American tribes to hunt, fish and gather within the territory ceded in the 1842 Treaty of La Pointe.

In a statement, Highland Copper called the project a “once-in-a-generation project” saying the grant would be used to fund infrastructure that’s needed to bring to life projects like the Copperwood Mine and more.

Wakefield Township Supervisor Mandy Lake applauded the Legislature for “prioritizing the Western Upper Peninsula and demonstrating its commitment to giving our community a future.”

“The infrastructure funded through this grant will have a tremendous positive impact on our whole region, and while it will support a great opportunity like Copperwood, it will also support our logging industry, and better our position to attract more business opportunities as well,” Lake told the Advance in an email.

Marty Fittante, CEO of Invest UP, a regional economic organization based in the Upper Peninsula, similarly cheered the inclusion of funding within the House’s budget proposal, comparing the effort to the Eagle Mine in Marquette County – which has drawn similar concerns from the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community alongside environmental advocates.

According to its website, the mine employs roughly 400 people with a 75% local hire commitment.

“We know firsthand from the success of Eagle Mine and its regulation under Michigan’s stringent mining standards, environmental stewardship and economic opportunity can be complementary to one another,” Fittante said. “This infrastructure funding will pave the way not just for the Copperwood Mine, a project that will create good paying jobs in a community that desperately needs them, but will also support the forest products industry which is also a critical opportunity for the region.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-86/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/michigan-air-use-permit-permit-to-install-application-for-copperwood-resources-inc1756562634.png?h=ccd5c36a&itok=baesAUsw,N,,2025-08-30 12:06:16.198872

The oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, fell by two to 536 in the week to August 29, the lowest since August 2021.

Baker Hughes said this week’s decline puts the total rig count down 47 rigs, or 8.1%, below the total this time last year.

Baker Hughes said oil rigs rose by one to 412 this week, while gas rigs fell by three to 119.

The oil and gas rig count declined by about 5% in 2024 and 20% in 2023 as lower U.S. oil and gas prices over the past couple of years prompted energy firms to focus more on boosting shareholder returns and paying down debt rather than increasing output.

Even though analysts forecast U.S. spot crude prices would decline for a third year in a row in 2025, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected crude output would rise from a record 13.2 million barrels per day in 2024 to around 13.4 million bpd in 2025.

On the gas side, the EIA projected a 65% increase in spot gas prices in 2025 would prompt producers to boost drilling activity this year after a 14% price drop in 2024 caused several energy firms to cut output for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for the fuel in 2020.

The EIA projected gas output would rise to 106.4 billion cubic feet per day in 2025, up from 103.2 bcfd in 2024 and a record 103.6 bcfd in 2023.

It does not include a road usage charge.
In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections.
Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge.","Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers began a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.

However, the special session got off to a rocky start: The state Senate met as scheduled at 9 a.m., but the state House failed to reach the two-thirds quorum required to conduct business, leaving the session in limbo as of late Friday afternoon.

Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers' jobs are at risk, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.

Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.

The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.

“This is a pretty major change,” said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state fiscal policy team, noting “the challenge in enacting something that’s dramatically different for most drivers.”

Oregon's transportation woes

Oregon's transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.

Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.

Kotek's proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state's gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.

The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn't have to pay supplemental registration fees.

Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle's telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state's decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.

Republican lawmakers, who have opposed the tax and fee increases, unveiled a different proposal Friday that largely focuses on lifting restrictions on how the transportation department can spend money on maintenance operations. It does not include a road usage charge.

As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state's total vehicles, he said.

Hawaii launches program

Under Hawaii's program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.

In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.

Questions about privacy and fairness

In past surveys commissioned by Oregon's transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.

Oregon's voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they're more expensive and can be removed, he added.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.

Many people don't realize that ""both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,” said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.

Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.

“We are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,” Morgan said.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/29/PDTN/85894417007-ap-25238683773408.jpg?crop=4028,2267,x0,y353&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-30 12:05:23.803312

The company is dealing with external factors hurting business, including tariffs on imported vehicles and parts, a decline in global sales, increasing competition in China amid a brutal price war, mounting lawsuits, a talent exodus, and consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political adventures. Despite all those negative developments, Tesla's stock has surged 54% higher over the past 12 months. And one recent move could help move more vehicles, which is exactly what the company needs in the near term.

Worrisome pricing?

Political backlash has put pressure on Tesla's used-car pricing. So much pressure, in fact, that even though Tesla is often considered a premium brand, its used vehicles are now selling almost as cheaply as the average used car -- and the latter's price is moving higher, while Tesla's prices continue to move lower. The problem started last year when the broader used car market in the U.S. started seeing values drop, but the broader market began recovering in the spring, and Tesla values continued to drop.

What's Tesla to do?

While consumer backlash is likely to eventually fade, Tesla's primary problem in the near term is to reverse its sales decline. Tesla recently started offering leases of certified preowned cars, which is fairly rare in the automotive industry. It's also offering $0 down as it tries to load as many deliveries into the third quarter as possible before the federal $7,500 tax credit on new electric vehicles (EVs) and the $4,000 credit for used EVs expire at the end of September.

The industry is banking on demand being pulled into the third quarter, and Tesla is aiming to capture as many sales as possible with the new leasing strategy. Telsa is doing this for the first time, and these certified preowned vehicles, mostly Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, are being offered for as little as $215 per month with $0 down for a 24-month lease and 10,000 miles per year. Tesla is also offering a 12-month lease and up to 15,000 miles annually, with $0 down but an acquisition fee of nearly $700.

Whether you're a fan of Musk or not, or Tesla or EVs in general, this is a compelling deal and the cheapest way to get into a Tesla at the moment. The problem is that used Teslas have been piling up, as the brand took a hit this year, and this does appear a little desperate.

Tesla is also trying a new strategy with its Cybertruck that has left investors and analysts unimpressed with its deliveries. Tesla raised the price of the high-end version of the Cybertruck to $114,990, up from $99,990, in the U.S., per listings on its website. The Cybertruck now comes with what Tesla calls a ""Luxe Package"" including Full-Self Driving (FSD), four-year wheel and tire protection, and free supercharging access. Unfortunately, pricing changes on a single trim, even a high-end and more profitable trim package, aren't likely to move the needle for either deliveries or financials.

The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) published a notice Friday seeking comment on its intention to develop an environmental impact statement for the proposed rescission of the 2001 rule. The comment period will run until Sept. 19.

The public had a full month to comment when the rule was created. The USFS received more than 1.6 million comments on the rule, the most it has ever received.

Experts caution that the truncated comment period limits the opportunity for public comment, a key part of rulemaking and a hallmark of the original rule.

Sam Evans, an attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the three-week comment period—only 14 business days from official publication—is an “unusual choice,” given the norm of 30-day comment periods. This also differs, he said, from when the Bush administration proposed repealing the rule in 2005. At that time, the administration offered a two-month comment period, which it extended an additional two months following a public request to do so.

Evans said that a “lengthy and intensive public process,” including over 600 hearings across the country and a flood of supportive comments, was crucial in the development of a strong rule more than two decades ago.

“Nothing like that can happen with the staff capacity and the timeline that the [USFS] is talking about here,” he said. “I think that just goes to show that the Forest Service here is not interested in developing public buy-in or reflecting the interests of the communities that it is supposedly serving.”

“Regulations do not specify the length of public comments. For the notice of intent to development an environmental impact statement, the 21 days was determined to be efficient to notify the public and seek comment. The comment period for the draft environmental impact statement and the proposed rule will be longer,” the USDA press office wrote in response to Inside Climate News’ questions about the shorter comment period.

“The rationale for repealing the Roadless Rule, I find very puzzling and a bit of a ruse for perhaps some other agenda,” said Mike Dombeck, who served as the chief of the agency from 1997 to 2001 and helped develop the rule. “The Forest Service has been a conservation leader over the decades. We need to make sure we continue to strengthen that image and that capability, because we need it more now than ever.”

Implemented at the end of the Clinton administration, the rule prohibits road construction, road reconstruction and timber harvesting on a wide swath of USFS land, effectively protecting a variety of places in states from Alaska to Vermont as remote wilderness areas.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced at a Western Governors’ Association conference in June that USFS, which falls under her agency, planned to rescind it. Like many other conservation professionals, Dombeck said that Rollins’ argument—that repealing the rule would open up forests for timber production—doesn’t have a logical basis.

“As I recall from my involvement in developing the Roadless Rule, only about 8 percent of [forest in] the roadless areas is productive timber base to begin with,” he said. “The assumption that there’s a lot of wood [with economic value in] roadless areas is just simply not true.”

Rulemaking is meant to be a slow, deliberate process, and so too is deregulation. But the Trump administration seems to have a faster outcome in mind, Evans said.

“We’ve heard rumors that the Forest Service … expects to finalize the rule next year,” said Evans, leader of the Southern Environmental Law Center’s National Forests and Parks Program. “Obviously, we don’t think that there is a solid case for repeal of the Roadless Rule. We think that the rule has had tremendous benefits.”

Grassroots organizations across the country got the word out to the public about the initial rule during its development, helping strengthen it. Some groups are now echoing earlier efforts of grassroots organizations in their attempts to fight a repeal.

“Our real interest now is making sure that folks understand what the policy measures are that ensure that public lands actually remain the way that people think of them,” said Alex Craven, a senior campaign representative at the Sierra Club focusing on forest conservation.

The announcement comes as Rollins is proposing a plan to reorganize the Forest Service, including closing nine regional offices over the next year. In the proposal, dated July 24, the agriculture secretary argued that the reorganization would improve “effectiveness and accountability.”

However, experts are cautioning that this could greatly weaken the Forest Service as a whole. The National Association of Forest Service Retirees, for example, submitted comments arguing that the proposal lacks detail and could compromise regional functions. The group urged the USFS to reassess the plan.

“It certainly seems like a disorganized approach to reducing the workforce. If it accomplished anything, it created a lot of chaos, both within the agency and among the partners that depend upon the Forest Service,” Dombeck said.

Craven said that most of the USFS regional offices have been located west of the Rocky Mountains. With the reorganization, “it’s looking like maybe it will be flipped,” he said, despite the fact that wildfire risk is higher in Western states.

Closing regional offices could mean losing staff with knowledge of wildfire mitigation and what to do when invasive bug species arrive in their respective regions, weakening the agency’s ability to respond to disasters.

“Losing the capacity and the research stations is kind of horrifying to me,” Evans said.

The reorganization could also lose the agency irreplaceable institutional knowledge and make it difficult to meet statutory requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), such as producing environmental impact statements.

“Those are really important steps, and with the reorganization, with the drain in capacity that the agency has right now, it’s very hard for you to imagine them doing a good job of that,” Evans said. “Let’s say that they push this through with a truncated NEPA analysis or a really skeletal consultation process. They’re going to be stuck with the loose ends of that forever. … Every project that they do in the future is going to be vulnerable.”

Even with the proposed NEPA changes that the Trump administration announced in July, Evans said that the USFS will still have to follow statutory requirements, which have remained the same. The “ultimate responsibility” of the USFS to consider environmental impacts, he said, still stands.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-1615373976-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 12:05:51.243262

In response to Sen. John Hoeven’s commentary in the Aug. 23 edition of the Herald, I believe North Dakota should be “cracking the code” on geothermal energy as part of a serious energy strategy.

Our state has long relied on coal and natural gas, but the economics are shifting in ways that cannot be ignored. The Inflation Reduction Act’s Investment and Production Tax Credits support renewable energy and carbon capture development, helping maintain a more competitive energy market. While these incentives don’t directly control fossil fuel prices, they enable lower-cost clean energy alternatives that can ease upward pressure on electricity costs. Costs could rise further as carbon capture systems and CO2 pipelines are added to the grid, with 45Q tax credits transferring part of the expense to taxpayers. This is not a formula for affordable or sustainable energy and underscores the need for diverse, domestic resources.

Natural gas prices are increasingly influenced by global factors. As U.S. companies expand liquefied natural gas (LNG) export capacity, domestic prices become more connected to international demand. The Energy Information Administration projects Henry Hub prices rising gradually from about $3.60 per MMBtu in 2025 to roughly $4.30 per MMBtu in 2026. Such increases can directly affect electricity costs for families and businesses and can challenge the competitiveness of energy-intensive industries, like data centers, where Europe and China are already aligning energy policy with strategic industrial goals.

Geothermal energy offers an alternative path. It is domestic, dispatchable, and immune to international commodity swings. Once developed, geothermal plants can provide decades of reliable, affordable electricity without hidden taxpayer liabilities embedded in fossil fuels. North Dakota’s recent legislation supporting geothermal resource studies was a valuable first step, but other states are moving faster. By investing in geothermal now, North Dakota can grow high-skilled energy jobs, strengthen industrial competitiveness, and ensure long-term energy independence.

If North Dakota intends to remain competitive in energy innovation, workforce development, and consumer affordability, we cannot afford to fall behind. The time to act is now. Geothermal should not be a side project; it should be a cornerstone of our energy future.

David Bookbinder, director of Law and Policy for Environmental Integrity Project, said the complaint is centered around the belief that CP2 will emit more pollution than DEQ assumed and will have air quality violations, as well as the fact that some of the permit limits are more lenient than justified for different pollutants.

""We're dealing with a facility that's going to be emitting many, many, many tons of pollutants and … the local impact on people who are directly breathing the air is going to be bad,"" Bookbinder said. ""The other problem is that it, not just for the people who are going to be directly breathing it, will contribute to the entire area having air quality violations. It mucks up people's air.""

The facility, which will be one of the largest LNG plants in the nation, would export 20 million metric tons of LNG per year, according to the release. The estimated life cycle greenhouse gas from the methane gas would be more than the annual emissions of 47 million gas-powered cars, the release states.

Construction started on CP2 this summer, and the facility is expected to begin LNG production in 2027.

Allaire, a former oil industry worker, said he and the organizations are upset that the state would grant CP2 a Clean Air Act permit based on the compliance history of Venture Global at Calcasieu Pass, which began operating in 2022.

During its first calendar year of operation, the Calcasieu Pass LNG facility had at least 139 incidents where it exceeded the hourly emission limits of its air permits, The Advocate previously reported. In addition, DEQ granted the facility an increase in its allowed emissions in 2023.

Bookbinder said the next steps for the lawsuit will be the court reaching out within a couple of weeks to provide a schedule to submit all the preliminary paperwork, and about two months later it will release a schedule for briefing.

From there, there will be arguments and then a decision, ""hopefully by the end of 2026,"" Bookbinder said.

Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, said that overall the permit is flawed and that is what they would like to see fixed.

""The Department of Environmental Quality does not have a realistic assessment of this facility that they're letting them get away with putting whatever they want on paper and not really tending to the Clean Air Act,"" Rolfes said. ""Our goal would be to get a real serious permit on this facility. I do believe that if you took an honest look at the emissions and at the area and the burden it's already bearing, that they could never get a permit because the pollution there is already too intense.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/67/7675be2a-a890-4999-b5e2-b67f8c8d9cf3/68b1effe4e682.image.png?crop=960%2C504%2C0%2C108,N,,2025-08-30 11:01:46.798981

ISA ENERGIA BRASIL is a leading company in Brazil's power transmission sector. It has been in the country for over 25 years and is a pioneer in developing initiatives that positively impact society and the environment. As part of ISA, a multinational company with over 57 years of experience, ISA ENERGIA BRASIL operates in Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Bolivia, and Central America. With over 49,000 kilometers of circuits and 113,365 MVA of transformation capacity, and a reliability and availability index of over 99%, ISA's goal is to ensure a resilient, secure, clean, and fair energy transition.

Demonstrating its commitment to modernizing the power grid, ISA ENERGIA BRASIL delivered a significant project in 2023: the country's first digital 4.0 substation. Designed to demonstrate and test cutting-edge IEC 61850 technologies, the project notably highlights Hitachi Energy's contribution to seamlessly integrating advanced Information and Communication Technology (ICT) with rigorous cybersecurity protocols, reinforcing the reliability and availability of the power grids. This initiative is the result of an R&D project by the Brazilian National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL) and aims to discover new approaches for updating the current grid infrastructure while generating essential insights for future developments in new (greenfield) substations.

Conventional substations require complex infrastructure, such as kilometers of copper cables, and present increasing challenges in security, maintenance, and reliability—especially in a country with the vast size and diverse climates of Brazil. To address this challenge, ISA ENERGIA BRASIL, in partnership with Hitachi Energy, is leading a transformation movement with the implementation of Brazil's first Digital 4.0 Substation in Jaguariúna (SP).

The Jaguariúna Substation project integrates sensing, smart monitoring, IoT (Internet of Things), data exchange via wireless industrial networks, and a layered cybersecurity architecture. These technologies not only improve operational efficiency but also serve as a prototype for future deployments across ISA's extensive network in Latin America.

One of the key differentiators is the Centralized Control and Protection (CPC), which allows for protecting and controlling various transmission functions from a single digital platform. This solution raises the standards for resilience, security, and operational redundancy by consolidating distributed intelligence into a central decision-making core.

This grid modernization project is a testament to ISA ENERGIA BRASIL's efforts to lay the foundation for a more resilient, sustainable, and technologically advanced electrical system. In addition to the improvements in operational efficiency, environmental impact, and grid security achieved through innovative solutions in Jaguariúna, this project aligns with Brazil's broader leadership in energy transition initiatives, such as battery energy storage and hydrogen projects. The country is therefore well-positioned to play a significant role in Latin America's energy future.

Cry me a river. Wait, make that two rivers. On Friday, August 29, the Trump administration yanked another rug out from under the US offshore wind industry, sending thousands of construction jobs spinning into the black hole of malevolent incompetence that passes for the US government these days. How many of those jobs were held by Trump voters remains to be counted, but … yeah, cry me a river.

Trump Kills More Offshore Wind Jobs … Shocker!

USA Today took stock of the situation on August 27, shortly after Trump’s Interior Secretary, Doug Burgum, single-handedly shut down the Revolution Wind offshore project in New England. The work was 80% complete but hundreds of workers were still busy tying up the loose ends when they were all sent home by Secretary Burgum.

“A lot of building trades workers, a lot of union workers, voted for Donald Trump and his team. But they didn’t vote to have union jobs shut down,” Rhode Island AFL-CIO President Patrick Crowley told USA Today. “It shouldn’t work like this.”

Actually, it does work like this, and they did vote to have their jobs shut down. Trump’s antipathy to wind turbines is a well-known fact that he has proclaimed often, and loudly, ever since first campaigning for President in 2016. That was nine years ago. That makes nine years of promising to kill the US wind industry, onshore and off, right on up to and including the campaign year of 2024.

Last year, Trump also promised that the US would have “only two sexes” if he won the office again. Apparently some voters decided that having two sexes, and only two sexes, was more important than, you know, making a living.

“For our folks, this is work, this is make or break for them,” Crowley also told USA Today. “When you get a chance to work on a project that’s going to be around for months at a time, that provides you and your family such a sense of stability. And to have this happen? I’ve never seen anything like this before.”

Hey Guys, Brace Yourself For Another Round Of Offshore Wind Layoffs

In the weeks following Election Day 2024, Associated Press was among those noting that support for Democratic candidates continues to run high among unionized workers and others holding construction jobs, so it’s not clear that Crowley’s observation is a by-the-numbers reflection of the Trump votes cast by people who have a personal interest in working for a living.

Still, AP was also among those emphasizing that the trend has been shifting towards Republican candidates in general, and Trump in particular. “But with Trump’s populist appeal, his working-class base saw a decent share of union rank-and-file voting for Republicans this year,” AP reported on November 23 last year.

“Working-class voters helped Republicans make steady election gains this year and expanded a coalition that increasingly includes rank-and-file union members,” AP added.

If that is indeed the case, then the Rhode Island wind workers who voted for Trump will have plenty of company as they cool their heels around the kitchen table. Revolution Wind is just one among several parts of the US offshore wind industry that were already in motion when Trump took office with intent to kill.

That brings us to Friday, August 29, the day when Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy helped to ensure that the bleeding of union jobs continues. Duffy issued an order clawing back $679 million in federal funds that had been allocated for 12 portside improvement projects that were to have supported the offshore wind industry, funded through his agency’s Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects program and the Port Infrastructure Development Program.

So, there go more jobs. They are probably not coming back. The offshore wind industry, on the other hand, will be just fine. The technology is not going anywhere, and there are plenty of opportunities to create new jobs building offshore wind farms in other countries.

Offshore Wind Or Not, These Jobs Are Toast

The reaction to Friday’s announcement was swift, not that it matters. The Republican majority in Congress has gleefully permitted the President to overr-reach his Constitutional authority on a daily basis ever since January 20. Why should August 29 be any different.

Here’s a representative sample from Democratic Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts:

“In unlawfully and senselessly cutting hundreds of millions in federal funding to offshore wind projects, Trump just signed a death warrant for thousands of union jobs nationwide and guaranteed that families’ energy bills will continue to skyrocket.”

Liz Burdock, president of the offshore wind trade organization Oceantic Network, also pointed out that the impact of the August 29 order will spread far beyond the offshore wind industry. “Offshore wind port development upgrades facilities and capabilities that serve multiple industries,” she said, noting that the offshore wind industry has brought new jobs to seaports by reviving underused and idled facilities, some of which had lain fallow for decades.

That’s news to Transportation Secretary Duffy and his gang of taxpayer-paid office workers. “Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Duffy said in a press statement.

“Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little,” he said, adding insult to injury.

Lie Down With Dogs, Wake Up With Fleas

Not to worry! Duffy will use the money to make more jobs at US seaports. No harm, no foul amirite? “Where possible, funding will be used to invest in real infrastructure, restoring American maritime dominance,” Duffy’s office declared.

That remains to be seen. Meanwhile, as may be expected the axe fell almost entirely on states headed up by Democratic governors. Here’s the list posted by Senator Markey, with the states added in:

Withdrawn:

[Maryland} Sparrows Point Steel Marshalling Port Project (PIDP; $47,392,500)

[North Carolina] Radio Island Rail Improvements in Support of Offshore Wind (PIDP; $1,679,604)

[Virginia] PMT Offshore Wind Development (PIDP; $20,000,000)

What do you bet New York Governor Kathy Hochul is on the phone with Trump right now, working to get that $11 million+ project back in motion? Earlier this year, Hochul negotiated a restart of the Empire Wind offshore project, with gas pipeline projects in her state as bargaining chips. Perhaps she has another card to play.

Let’s see what Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin has to say about this, too. Youngkin is the only Republican governor on Duffy’s hit list, and he must be wondering what he did wrong. After all, Youngkin has affirmed his support for the Trump agenda all throughout this year.

On the other hand, Youngkin is also the rare, if not the only, Republican governor in the US to champion an offshore wind project. With Youngkin’s support, the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is well underway, safe from the knives of the Trump administration — for now, at least.

As of this writing, Youngkin has yet to issue a public response to the loss of more than $60 million in federal funding. Maybe he never will. Why should he? After all, Youngkin is term-limited, and the smart money says a Democratic governor will inherit the whole mess after Election Day in November.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sean-duffy-us-dot.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 14:06:57.095591

Welcome back to another episode of TEN — Transport Evolved News! Thanks for joining me!

For more than forty years, protectionist barriers have made it difficult for European cars to be sold in the U.S.—and vice versa.

These obstacles mainly come down to differing crash test and emissions standards, which make it costly for automakers to sell a car designed for one market in the other—unless it was engineered for both from the start. This week, however, we learned that a potential trade deal being discussed between the U.S. government and the European Union could allow vehicles designed for one market to be imported and registered in the other without additional testing. The agreement is still vague, and it’s unclear how EU member nations would approve it given the significant differences in U.S. crash and emissions regulations. Stay tuned—I’m working on a video next week that will break it all down.

New sales data for EVs is in for Europe, showing a growing market share and changing brand-loyalty among EV buyers.

According to the ACEA—that’s the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association—just over one million new electric vehicles were registered across Europe in the first seven months of the year, representing a fifteen point six percent market share. That’s up from a twelve point one percent market share in the same period last year. The other key point from the July figures is the dramatic shift in attitudes toward Tesla across Europe. While EV sales overall outpaced ICE sales, and many brands saw double-digit EV growth, Tesla sales are down thirty-seven percent year to date, with BYD overtaking it with two hundred and twenty-five percent growth year over year.

Which brings us to the next story: the ACEA is now lobbying European lawmakers to loosen emissions targets across the region.

Its current president, Olla Källenius (Shell-en-ius), joined Schaeffler Powertrain & Chassis CEO Matthias Zink in a letter urging the EU to ease—or even drop—emissions targets and ICE bans. Calling the 2030 and 2035 CO₂ goals “no longer feasible,” they warned the European auto industry could face economic ruin if forced to comply. While the ACEA represents Europe’s auto sector as a whole, not all manufacturers back this push. Kia’s top European executive recently said the company does not support rolling back zero-emissions requirements, warning such a U-turn would be costly. Kia has heavily invested in European production of its EV4 and is urging the EU to keep the 2035 ICE ban in place.

From the U.S. President to tin-foil hat wearing trolls, we often find ourselves fighting off the assertion that EVs are responsible for more emissions than fossil fueled vehicles. Luckily that claim is super-easy and barely an inconvenience to debunk, with plenty of scientific research to back up that debunking.

Now we’ve got a new study from the University of Michigan to help. Even when accounting for manufacturing and electricity generation, it showed a battery electric vehicle with a three-hundred-mile range produces seventy-one to seventy-three percent fewer lifetime emissions than a comparable internal combustion engine vehicle. Compact electric vehicles have the smallest lifetime emissions overall, but the largest absolute reductions occur when large vehicles, such as pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, are converted to electric power. The study also includes a calculator that allows users to estimate the lifetime emissions of a vehicle on a county-by-county basis within the United States. Unfortunately, the calculator does not include data for other countries or regions.

For a long time, Chinese automakers faced allegations that the government unfairly subsidized domestic production to let them undercut overseas competitors.

Now, the Chinese government has published data showing where its subsidies went and which companies benefited. Between twenty sixteen and twenty twenty two, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology disbursed one point six five billion yuan to the EV industry. Beijing Electric Vehicle Co received the largest share, five hundred and fifty-six million yuan, while BYD got just fifteen point seven four million yuan and Tesla about three point five nine million yuan. The subsidy program initially focused on state-owned companies but shifted around five years ago. BYD subsidiaries received a combined seventy-three point four seven million yuan, while Tesla subsidiaries received thirty point one five million yuan. Leapmotor, the only startup to receive aid so far, got two point seven six million yuan. So yes, the Chinese government did subsidize its EV revolution—just not necessarily in the way many assumed.

Italian energy company EnelX—which many of you might remember as the company that acquired charging station manufacturer eMotorWerks—has been fined two point three million euros in Italy for abusing its market position.

If you haven’t watched our videos on the JuiceBoxes, here’s the context: the original, excellent, network-connected smart charging stations designed by eMotorWerks were ultimately neutered and then completely dropped by EnelX last year, following several years of poor support after the merger. This left hundreds of thousands of customers with non- or partially-functioning units. Italy’s anti-trust authority launched an investigation into EnelX and its subsidiaries and found it engaged in “margin-squeezing practices” in the fast-charging business aimed at blocking competitors from the market. EnelX acknowledged the findings but rejected the conclusions, stating it intends to appeal the decision and the fine. I don’t really buy the whole “karmic justice” thing, but I—and I’m sure many other JuiceBox owners—have little sympathy for this brand.

While Mercedes-Benz’s CEO has been vocal against a rapid all-electric future, the brand’s engineering team just celebrated a major milestone with its concept AMG GT XX EV.

Earlier this week, the concept set twenty-five new distance records in a single run at the Nardo test track. Unlike many recent range records, it averaged three hundred kilometers per hour (about one hundred and eighty-six miles per hour), covering forty thousand seventy-five kilometers (about twenty-four thousand eight hundred and forty-five miles) in seven days, thirteen hours, twenty-four minutes, and seven seconds. That’s the longest distance at these speeds for an EV—roughly equivalent to traveling around the world in less than eight days. The AMG GT XX is Mercedes-Benz’s first all-electric AMG concept and features axial flux motors, direct-cooled batteries, and super-fast charging, technologies planned for production vehicles on the AMG EA platform.

We’re off to Oregon next, where Democratic Governor Tina Kotek is proposing a controversial bill that could affect EV appeal and uptake at a time where EVs are already under attack by the Federal government.

Critics have long argued that EVs don’t pay enough toward road maintenance since they don’t use gasoline and avoid gas taxes. Oregon—and many other states—has traditionally charged EV owners higher bi-annual registration fees to compensate. Now, Kotek wants the state to require EV owners to join OReGo, a pay-as-you-drive program that tracks vehicle use and bills participants accordingly. OReGo has that been around for ten years but currently has just eight hundred fifty participants, showing it isn’t very popular. For low-mileage drivers, the program could be cheaper, but with over one hundred and seventeen thousand plug-in vehicles in Oregon, costs may rise significantly. As an example, someone driving twenty thousand miles a year could face an annual bill of around four hundred dollars. While everyone should contribute to road upkeep, this feels disproportionately high for EV owners.

We know that the current U.S. Government is no fan of renewable energy – or rather, the current White House – and those placed into government roles by the occupant of said white house.

But new data from the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shows that through May, the amount of new solar and wind generation projects added to the U.S. grid made up ninety-one percent of all new generating capacity. More than one thousand, five hundred and fifteen megawatts of solar panels were added to the grid in May (and that only includes large-scale grid-tied solar, not residential solar), with the agency forecasting that solar will become the number one two source of U.S. generating capacity in the next three years. However, it’s also worth noting that this particular report from FERC is more than a month behind schedule – and since the President’s actions to dismiss the expansion of renewable energy generation, the agency seems to be undergoing some not-great changes internally…

Finally, for this segment, following last week’s news that the White House wanted to halt new wind and solar projects, the Department of the Interior has forced the U.S.’s first multi-state offshore wind farm to stop construction—a wind farm that’s been fully permitted for a long time and is eighty percent complete.

Revolution Wind, a seven hundred and four megawatt farm off the northeastern coast, was supposed to power three hundred and fifty thousand homes across Rhode Island and Connecticut. Instead, it’s frozen over a stop-work order supposedly needed for national security. Developed by Ørsted and BlackRock Global Infrastructure, the regional grid operator, ISO New England—which manages electricity across six states—warns that this halt threatens grid reliability. Seriously, a fully approved, mostly built project is now stuck because of questionable claims about national security that nobody has actually substantiated.

And yes, some cabinet members, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have been making absurd claims about turbines harming whales, so don’t expect this to be resolved anytime soon. The oil industry—and President “I can’t apply concealer”—want nothing more than to see the world burn while they sit on piles of money that would make Scrooge McDuck blush and Smaug rage with envy.

Before we get to our final stories, I want to take just a moment to talk directly to you.

For fifteen years, Transport Evolved has been bringing you independent news about cleaner, greener, safer, and smarter transportation. Ten of those years have been here in the U.S., and through it all we’ve stayed true to our mission: covering stories that matter, even when bigger outlets pass them by.

But the truth is, we can’t do it without you. We’re not backed by corporations or big production budgets. We’re a tiny team—just three full-time and one part-time member—working hard to bring you content every week. And like so many other creators, we’re feeling the squeeze: costs keep rising, while YouTube ad revenue keeps falling. Every single Patreon pledge makes an enormous difference to keeping this show alive.

That’s why, during September and October, we’re holding a special pledge drive. By joining us on Patreon for as little as one dollar fifty a month, you’ll not only keep Transport Evolved going, but you’ll become part of the community that sustains independent journalism.

Over the next few weeks, we’ll share stories from supporters who already make this possible, and we’ll be offering a small thank-you in the form of exclusive digital art from Erin. And this Tuesday, we’ll kick things off live at eleven am Pacific with Liv and Patrick from the Electric Duo.

If you’ve been watching and thought about supporting us, now is the perfect time. Please consider joining us—and thank you, truly, for helping us continue this journey.

Now, it’s time for those last two stories.

As I’ve noted for what feels like the entire summer, there’s been something of a push in the Ev world toward setting new records this year, with range and track records a plenty.

We’ve covered several in this show, but there’s still one left to talk about – the new all-electric speed record set by BYD’s performance arm Yangwang, which managed to send a Yangwang U9 out on the APT automotive Testing Track in Papenburg, Germany to set a new world speed record. Previously set by the Aspark SP600 last year, the Yangwang U9 Track Edition, which can put two thousand, two hundred and fifty kilowatts to its quad motor drivetrain managed to hit a top speed of four hundred and seventy two point four one kilometers per hour. That’s two hundred and ninety-three point five four-two miles per hour, or if you prefer, faster than the Eurocopter X3, the Rimac Never, a Formula 1 car, and yes even most bullet trains. I could make plenty of Yangwang Jokes according to the Brits in the audience, but… I won’t.

And finally,

I’ve been driving and covering electric vehicles for nineteen years now, and in that time, I’ve heard just about every excuse for not getting an EV.

But this week, a new one popped up online that honestly stopped me in my tracks: the state of the average American garage. According to a Michigan-based research firm called Telemetry, one-third of American homes with garages are so full of stuff you couldn’t possibly park a car inside. And by extension, the argument goes, many people overlook EV ownership because they worry about not having a secure place to plug in at night.Now, I’ll admit—I’m not entirely convinced by that logic, though I do respect one of the study’s authors. Maybe I’m biased: my own garage is a woodworking shop, and I don’t know a single EV owner with off-street parking who actually charges inside their garage.But perhaps the best reaction came from two of our own team members, who rent and also own plug-in cars. Their take? “Most of us don’t even have a home, let alone a garage with power. And somehow, those who rent—and drive a plug-in—still manage just fine.”

And on that note, we’re done for today!

Before I go, a huge thank you to the Electric Vehicle Association for sponsoring today’s show. The EVA has been advocating for electric vehicles since nineteen sixty-seven and remains firmly committed to a cleaner, greener future for all. Join the EVA today to find out how to become an EV educator, meet like-minded fans, and get help to make your own transition to electric, help that includes a low-interest loan program to help finance your next step!

And thanks to EnergySage! Follow the link below to plan your own energy-independent future before those tax credits vanish.

And thanks to you – if you can, please consider supporting us from just one dollar and fifty cents a month on Patreon. Youtube, in its ultimate wisdom, is now inserting so many ads into long-form content that it’s pushing people off the platform – and it’s also diluting the money paid to creators for every ad. And because right now there’s not really a good alternative to YouTube, (and no, Nebula is invite only, which is why we’re not on there), Patreon is really our only reliable form of income.

If just four hundred of our one hundred and fifty-two thousand subscribers who have yet signed up to patreon did so and committed to giving the equivalent of a fancy coffee a month, would put us in a much better financial position. And if you’d like to join in by watching the launch of our pledge drive on Tuesday at eleven am Pacific, please do!

We publish every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday here — and every Sunday we drop two videos on Transport Evolved Take Two, our informal behind-the-scenes channel.

And in closing, some important message.

You are valid. You are loved, and you belong.

This week has been another hard one in many countries around the world for different reasons – from yet another mass shooting of innocent victims to blaming an entire community for the actions of that one individual… to mass genocide at the hands of a country which believes it has a divine right to let others die. And of course, all the… horrid things being said and done in the pursuit of enriching a few at the expense of the many.

Right now, division and hate aren’t just tolerated — they are encouraged by those in power driven by a lust for cruelty. In these times, kindness and empathy become acts of resistance. Empathy is not weakness — it’s a skill we must nurture and regularly practice to hold onto our shared humanity.

I also want to remind you that it’s okay to take time off if you need to. To unplug, to get outside, or bury yourself in a good book, listen to your favorite album, or just spend time with loved ones. It’s important to listen to your body and engage in self care – so that when you’re ready, you can come back and fight for decency, community and justice for all. Don’t let the … you know what… win. Embrace your awesomeness, and let your light shine.

Finally, Wherever you are, whoever you are, whoever you love — you are not alone. Be an ally. Be kind. Be the change you want to see. And please — for the sake of everyone’s future — don’t let hate or ignorance win.

One in 10 American families owns an RV,"" Kraus said.
The RV runs on a battery and is equipped with solar panels, an electric heat pump and water tanks.
It saves you fuel economy, saves you range if you have an electric vehicle.
Kraus says Lightship is focused on building in America for America and hopes to be a guiding light to a sustainable future for an American pastime.","This Labor Day weekend, many Colorado families may be hooking up their RVs and heading out on an adventure, but now there's an electric camper option in Broomfield.

A Colorado startup has created America's first all-electric recreational vehicle. Founded by alumni from Tesla, Rivian and Nike, Lightship is manufacturing the country's first self-propelled towable RV in Broomfield.

The first customers will be receiving those vehicles in the coming weeks.

Lightship CEO and co-founder Toby Kraus thinks RVs are as American as apple pie.

""It's part of Americana. One in 10 American families owns an RV,"" Kraus said.

After growing up in Boulder and then working at Tesla, Kraus partnered with another Tesla alumnus to create Lightship, the first all-electric RV in the U.S.

""We really are developing what I would consider a new class of vehicle,"" Kraus said. ""We do something that's a little bit wild, which is we actually put a motor in the vehicle. So even though it's towed, it's also self-propelling. It's supporting its own drag and its own mass.""

The RV can be towed by electric or gas-powered cars.

""We are trying to bring sustainable technology to a new group of people and really get it into the mainstream,"" Kraus said.

The RV runs on a battery and is equipped with solar panels, an electric heat pump and water tanks.

Kraus says it can last a week or more between charges. It has a taller ""camp mode"" and compresses into a more aerodynamic ""road mode"" when driving.

""It's very efficient. It saves you fuel economy, saves you range if you have an electric vehicle. And then when you're inside, it's nice and open,"" Kraus said.

It's all controlled by a tablet.

""This is where you can kind of control everything, lights, climate, door and window status. This is how you level a vehicle. Check your water levels, check your energy status,"" Kraus explained.

Inside the Atmos edition of the RV, you'll find up to three beds, a seating area, kitchen and dry bathroom.

""Over here, we have the kitchen sink, induction cooktop, refrigerator, freezer, microwave. Something that people love is we have a dishwasher,"" Kraus said.

Every RV is made in Lightship's Broomfield factory, which employs 70 people.

""What they're installing right now is one of our high-voltage battery packs,"" Kraus said, while gesturing to some of his employees at work.

The company has a small office and a second showroom in California. Kraus says Lightship is focused on building in America for America and hopes to be a guiding light to a sustainable future for an American pastime.

""We build in the United States, here in Colorado. We also have a supply chain that we set up that is around 80% U.S. domestic content,"" Kraus said.

Lightship's Founders model is already sold out, but their Atmos and Panos models are available at their Colorado showroom and online. The Atmos model starts at $184,000, while the Panos model starts at $151,000.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/30/fc6ba5d3-2eae-4894-b45a-3279abd05064/thumbnail/1200x630/6bba51d647d4ac1b4df05a276a30edd6/broomfield-ev-rvs-6pkg-frame-3167.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 12:05:27.323792

The company also announced a series of other significant product and technology developments, including showcasing a concept moto-scooter Redux, and AtherStack 7.0, which would alert riders to share live location, report on potholes and crashes, update them on tyre pressure, among others.

Built for versatility, scalability, and cost optimisation, the new e-scooter platform is the first vehicle architecture since the launch of Ather 450, the company announced at an event here.

""With the EL platform, we are laying the foundation for Ather's next phase of growth. Just as the 450 defined our first chapter, EL will define the next, enabling us to develop multiple types of scooters at scale far more efficiently,"" said Tarun Mehta, Co-founder & CEO, Ather Energy, at the event.

This platform-first approach enables faster innovation and improved efficiency, serviceability, and rider experience, he said adding the latest platform reflects years of learning, deep R&D, and engineering.

He said the Ather's new factory at Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar will scale with EL platform products to meet growing demand effectively.

A vehicle platform is the underlying structure and integrated systems shared by multiple vehicle models. The structure, which includes the chassis, powertrain, underbody, and electronic architectures, serves as the common foundation for the design and engineering.

The company has two manufacturing plants in Hosur (Tamil Nadu), one each for vehicle manufacturing and battery manufacturing. Additionally, another is coming up in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Maharashtra, which is expected to increase Ather's total manufacturing capacity to 1.42 million EVs per year.

Ather said its next-generation platform is designed to meet the evolving and diverse needs of the domestic electric scooter buyers.

Designed on the back of 26 lakh km of field data, the new platform features a new chassis, powertrain, and a fully redesigned electronics stack. This offers the flexibility to build a wide variety of form factors by utilising a common set of key components, the company said.

The versatility it offers enables Ather to cater to different consumer segments, use cases, and markets, while being more cost-effective. It also noted that simpler architecture and a reduced component count enable 15 per cent faster assembly.

This also allows up to 2X faster periodic services, increasing the service interval up to 10,000 km, it said.

The new platform also introduces features such as Advanced Electronic Braking System (AEBS), which enhances braking performance by reducing stopping distance and minimising rear-wheel lockups, it said.

""With AtherStackTM 7.0, we're bringing AI into everyday riding through an LLM (Large Language Model) trained for our use cases and tuned to Indian dialects. Voice is the first step in that journey, an interface beyond buttons that makes rides smarter, safer, and more intuitive,"" said Swapnil Jain, Co-founder and CTO at Ather Energy.

Ather also announced expanding its theft-safety suite with the introduction of ParkSafe and LockSafe features and said that AtherStack 7.0 will roll out as an over-the-air (OTA) update in the coming months, and will be backwards compatible with the Rizta Z and the Ather 450X up to Gen 3 scooters.

The company also announced it has updated the 2025 Ather 450 Apex with its own advanced cruise control system designed specifically for Indian riding conditions.

Here are some tips and strategies to arm yourself with the best game plan before you set foot into a dealership.

Stay informed with our newsletter every weekday

For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.

There are several approaches to finding the best deal for your situation, and the path you take comes down to a few intertwined variables like tax credit eligibility, budget targets for monthly payments, and/or total cost. Let’s dig in.

Tax Credits: Which Buyers And Vehicles Qualify?

Thanks to President Trump’s signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act, effective Sept. 30, the government tax credit for new and used EVs expires. The previous tax credit, implemented during the Biden administration, saved buyers up to $7,500 on new EVs and $4,000 on certain used EVs. Tax credits are supposed to be applied at the point of sale and effectively serve as a big discount off your final purchase price.

In other words, get ‘em while supplies last.

If you do intend on purchasing a new EV, know that not every vehicle qualifies for that tax credit, due to the current rules around battery sourcing, the location of final production and total costs.

Then, have a look at our list of the EVs that qualify for the full $7,500 credit. Even if a vehicle qualifies for the credit, the IRS has income thresholds that limit which buyers can get it. You can find those details here, but it is also recommended that you consult your tax professional. The tax credit is capped at $80,000 for vans, SUVs, and pickup trucks and $55,000 for other vehicles.

For more budget-oriented buyers looking for an inexpensive EV, vehicles that are at least two years old and have a transaction price of $25,000 and under (before local tax and fees), there is a tax credit up to $4,000. However, the income thresholds are a bit lower for these cars.

Many dealers will apply this credit at the point of sale, but other stores will provide the necessary paperwork for you to file for the credit on your own. Many EV shoppers have reported that it can be challenging to find reputable dealers that are willing to handle the necessary paperwork to obtain the credit. So buyers will want to confirm with the dealership if the store has the experience and willingness to handle the paperwork.

But if you lease a new EV, all limits are off, and you get the $7,500 tax credit regardless of what you want to drive.

Leases Are Where Most Of The Deals Are

When it comes to new EVs, the consensus is to lease them and not buy them. Currently, all EV leases qualify for the $7,500 regardless of the customer’s tax filing status or vehicle production. But that “leasing loophole” goes away at the end of September, too.

Where things get tricky is accurately comparing the lease programs across various brands to determine which ones are more competitive than others. Many automakers will advertise “lease specials” with super-low payments, but it’s important to pay attention to the fine print and details. Often, these low payments require substantial money up front for the math to work.

I often advise putting little or no money down on a lease because the total cost over time remains the same, and you don’t risk that down payment in case your leased car is totaled in an accident.

Before you go to the dealer, it would be wise to compare the advertised specials and reconfigure the numbers and look at what is called “effective monthly payment,” and then compare that cost to the MSRP.

Here is an example comparison between the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and the Kia EV6. Two cars that are essentially identical when it comes to mechanical components, most features, and their price point.

Photo by: InsideEVs

For a Hyundai on an Ioniq 5 SEL with an MSRP of $51,200, the lease payment is $209 per month with $3,999 due at signing for a 30,000-mile, 24-month lease. This works out to an effective monthly payment of about $376 per month or a total lease cost of $9,024.

Photo by: InsideEVs

Examining the EV6, we have a Light Long Range AWD with an MSRP of $51,795. Kia is offering a 24-month lease for $289 per month with $3999 due at signing. You get 10,000 miles per year on that one. This works out to an effective monthly payment of $456 per month or a total lease cost of $10,944.

Thus, the Hyundai is about $2,000 cheaper to lease over the course of the term, but in either case, these are super-cheap leases for cars that retail for $50,000.

Some brands have calculators built into their configurators that allow you to adjust your parameters accordingly, though keep in mind that any numbers you see online should be treated as an “estimate” as they often do not include tax and fees and local market factors may impact pricing as well.

I strongly suggest that lease shoppers engage in negotiations with dealers and request quotes in writing before setting foot into the showroom. That way, you can more accurately compare the numbers. Plus, many dealers advertise artificially low lease “deals” that are a way to get you into the store, and then saddle you with a much higher actual payment than you expected; we see this happen quite often.

Have a look at the chart below. I shopped for an Acura ZDX EV for a client. There can be a wide difference in what various dealers are willing to offer. And even though we request quotes for leases with zero down, not every dealer provides quotes in that manner, so we have to reconfigure the numbers for better comparisons.

A Purchase Could Be A Better Play For Hybrids and Plug-Ins

The reality is that a lot of folks don’t have a living situation that allows for home charging, and access to chargers across America is still a work in progress. Those buyers may want to reduce their fuel cost with a battery-assisted car, but not make the full jump to an EV. While leases are usually the way to go for fully electrified models, the programs for plug-in hybrids and standard hybrids may not be as compelling.

For example, the Honda Civic Hybrid is arguably one of the best cars you can buy right now in that $30,000 segment if an EV doesn’t work either from a lifestyle or logistics perspective.

Honda is currently advertising a Civic Sport Hybrid (MSRP $30,490) lease for $339 per month on a 10,000-mile-per-year, 36-month lease with $3,499 due at signing.

Photo by: InsideEVs

That works out to an effective payment of $436 per month, which isn’t terrible. However, when you look at a total lease cost of $15,696 (before tax and fees), the picture changes a bit. It is very unlikely that a $30,000 Civic is going to lose over half its value in three years with only 30,000 miles on the clock. Basically, you will have paid far more over the term of that lease than you should have.

A shopper would be far better off buying this car and taking advantage of Honda’s historically high residual values, even if they only planned on keeping it for a few years. Plus, Honda’s legendary reliability makes this a better purchase to hang onto for a while than many other options.

Despite the Civic Hybrid's popularity, buyers can still score competitive deals. Here is a grid I worked up for a client where my team managed to find discounts at over ten percent off on the more well-equipped Touring trim.

Once again: It pays to shop around.

Don’t Count Out Used Cars

Across the entire budget spectrum, there are some fantastic used values in the pre-owned space, from $15,000 cars to ones retailing for six-figures and beyond. The tax credit applies to any EV under $25,000 that is at least two years old, provided you meet the income requirements.

The market for $25,000-and-under EVs is pretty aggressive, but great deals are out there on perennial favorites like the Chevrolet Bolt EV, Nissan Leaf and Tesla Model 3—the latter in particular is a kind of used deal king.

I have found that the sweet spot for used EVs currently is in the $30,000 to $35,000 range, as that seems to have the best balance of age, mileage, equipment, remaining warranty balance, and price. If you are shopping in this range, the tax credit is no longer a factor, so you don't have to worry about the end-of-September deadline. And you can take advantage of EV depreciation to get something that was once quite expensive for comparably cheap; how about a $32,995 Mercedes-Benz EQE, a car that was probably well over $70,000 when new?

Shopping for a used car requires a bit of a different strategy than shopping for a new car. Most dealers don’t have a lot of wiggle room to move, and most dealers stand firm with their advertised price. This can be frustrating for buyers accustomed to negotiating prices down, but the key to finding a deal on a used car is to focus on the best value, not the biggest discount.

Let’s examine a sample of certified used BMW i4s under $35,000 in the DC metro area:

Photo by: InsideEVs

All three of these cars are within striking distance of each other in terms of price, with mileage at 15,000, 19,000, and 35,000, respectively. All three are eDrive 35 trims, but that doesn’t mean that their original retail price was the same. This is why it’s good to dive into the spec sheets and compare the MSRPs.

The Annapolis car with 19,000 miles had an original MSRP of $55,955, and the Mount Laurel car with 15,000 miles stickered in at $54,820. The Fort Washington car with 35,000 miles retailed for $55,345. BMW’s CPO warranty starts at the original service date. Both the Annapolis and Fort Washington cars were sold in May 2023, whereas the Annapolis car was sold in August 2023.

Examining a closer comparison between the three, we have the Mount Laurel car with 4,000 fewer miles than Annapolis, but $1,000 lower in specs; however, it does have an extra few months of warranty. The Fort Washington car has the highest mileage, yet is about $500 more than the Annapolis car, with a sticker price that is only $500 higher—both have the same warranty balance remaining.

While there really isn't a wrong answer among these three, it appears that the Fort Washington car with the higher mileage is not as good a value as the other two.

As you can see, there are more variables to consider when shopping in the pre-owned market versus new, and buyers need to balance their desired equipment with other factors like mileage and remaining warranty.

Of course, advertised prices don’t always tell the whole story. Unfortunately, many used car dealers will post an online price that is very market competitive, only to add in a bunch of additional charges like “reconditioning fees” and “mandatory accessories.” This is why it is critical to get itemized quotes to really compare the value scores of various leads.

With the tax credits expiring and potential tariff-induced price increases on the horizon, now is a great time to score a deal on your next vehicle, whether it be a full battery EV or a fuel-sipping hybrid. The key to doing so comes down to your ability to compare prices, and don’t limit yourself to your local market, as often better deals can be found elsewhere.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/NGMGLn/s1/labor-day-car-buying.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 11:00:28.120153

“Following a thorough internal investigation, EPA supervisors made decisions on an individualized basis,” an EPA spokeswoman said Friday in a statement.

The so-called declaration of dissent, signed by more than 170 employees in late June, “contains inaccurate information designed to mislead the public about agency business,” spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said. “Thankfully, this represents a small fraction of the thousands of hard-working, dedicated EPA employees who are not trying to mislead and scare the American public.”

The EPA “has a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November,” she added.

Vaseliou declined to say how many employees were disciplined, but the head of the agency’s largest union said at least six probationary employees who signed the letter were fired, along with at least two career employees. The firings were first reported by The Washington Post.

The EPA union, part of the American Federation of Government Employees, condemned the firings, which come after 139 workers were put on administrative leave shortly after signing the dissent declaration. The EPA at the time accused employees of “unlawfully undermining” the Trump administration’s agenda.

In a letter made public June 30, the employees wrote that the EPA is no longer living up to its mission to protect human health and the environment. The letter represented rare public criticism from agency employees who knew they could face retaliation for speaking out against a weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science.

Ford, Robert Zullo",,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/08/30/revolution-wind-was-heading-toward-finish-line-now-its-about-to-veer-into-boston-federal-court/,"Revolution Wind did not appear at risk, having already begun construction soon after receiving its final federal permit in November 2023.
The fundraising plan was unveiled in the company’s Aug. 11 quarterly earnings release, before work was forced to stop on Revolution Wind.
“The stop-work order for Revolution Wind emphasizes the increased regulatory uncertainty for offshore wind in the U.S.,” the company said Friday.
“Revolution Wind, a renewable energy project that is right at the finish line, and which would add 400MW to our clean energy portfolio, must move forward,” Neronha said in a statement Friday.
“Limiting relief in such a way would be practical and minimize risk of confusion for Agency Defendants responsible for overseeing federal wind leasing and permitting processes,” Gustafson wrote.","Limited power supply in extreme weather events, rising and unpredictable utility bills and thousands of union laborers without work.

That’s the dire picture of Rhode Island’s future without more offshore wind energy, Christopher Kearns, Rhode Island’s acting energy commissioner, said in an Aug. 8 affidavit submitted to federal court in Massachusetts.

Two weeks later, the Trump administration abruptly halted construction on Revolution Wind, a project already 80% completed and set to begin delivering power to Rhode Island and Connecticut in mid-2026. Predictions of economic and environmental harms quickly solidified, leaving workers stranded at sea, regional grid reliability under threat and state decarbonization mandates potentially out of reach.

“The invocation of the Wind Memorandum to issue a Stop Work Order for the fully permitted Revolution Wind project as it nears completion will harm Rhode Island, its residents, our strong labor workforce, and our offshore wind and related industries,” Kearns wrote in a second affidavit on Aug 28. “Moreover, it will harm our efforts to diversify our energy system and increase reliability.”

The consequences for Rhode Island’s only commercial offshore wind project will feature heavily in a Sept. 4 federal court hearing, where a group of 18 Democratic state attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, will ask U.S. District Judge William Young of Massachusetts to throw out the Trump administration’s Jan. 20 executive order halting reviews of offshore wind projects.

“The Revolution stop-work order provides another example of the harmful effects of Defendants’ arbitrary decision to adopt and implement the Wind Directive to stop wind-energy development in our States,” the AGs wrote in an Aug. 28 court filing. “And it underscores the importance of prompt vacatur of that decision to enable projects in and beyond the permitting pipeline to proceed toward development.”

The court hearing in Boston was scheduled two months before the Revolution Wind project was suddenly put in jeopardy, prompted by a multistate lawsuit filed in May against the Trump administration. The initial complaint centered on offshore wind projects still awaiting federal approvals, like the SouthCoast Wind project proposed off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard, from which Rhode Island is also in negotiations to buy power.

Revolution Wind did not appear at risk, having already begun construction soon after receiving its final federal permit in November 2023.

Stuck in limbo

Little comfort now to the dozen millwrights idled aboard Wind Scylla in Rhode Island Sound for over a week, who were building turbines when the stop work order came through.

“We’re still waiting for an answer from the companies and the contractors on what’s going on,” Evan Wytas, business representative for Millwrights Local 1121, said in an interview Friday morning. “We haven’t gotten any word that they are on their way back, or when that will be.”

Meanwhile, another two dozen union trade workers scheduled to head out to the construction site Aug. 28 are still on land, waiting by the phone for the call that they can head to work, said Erica Hammond, legislative director for the Rhode Island AFL-CIO.

Workers are still getting paid for now, Hammond confirmed, though those who remain onshore much longer might have to file for unemployment, depending on the specific details of their contracts.

“It is very frustrating,” Hammond said. “To stop now, in the case of this specific project, it’s a waste of resources.”

More than 1,000 union workers have spent the last two years building the 65-turbine project, 40 of which have been installed, as well as a pair of substations that will connect the power supply to Rhode Island and Connecticut. The 704 megawatts of nameplate capacity is enough to power 350,000 homes across both states, equal to 2.5% of the electricity load throughout New England, Kearns said in his affidavit.

The renewable electricity supply has already been baked into Rhode Island’s clean energy portfolio and is crucial to meeting the 2021 Act on Climate Law, which mandates net-zero emissions by 2050 with incremental, legally enforceable benchmarks that kick in at the end of the decade.

Orsted, the Danish company co-developing the project, pledged to explore solutions to resume work, including potential litigation, while exploring the financial implications for its $4 billion project. The company is seeking to raise another $9.4 billion from its shareholders, confirming Friday that its majority stakeholder, the Danish government, has agreed to the share sale. The fundraising plan was unveiled in the company’s Aug. 11 quarterly earnings release, before work was forced to stop on Revolution Wind.

“The stop-work order for Revolution Wind emphasizes the increased regulatory uncertainty for offshore wind in the U.S.,” the company said Friday. “The planned rights issue has been sized to provide the required strengthening of Orsted’s capital structure to execute its business plan, even when taking into account the impact of this uncertainty on Orsted’s US offshore wind portfolio.”

The Revolution Wind project was expected to bring in $156.7 million in net income for the company each year once operational, the company said. An “extraordinary general meeting” is scheduled for Sept. 5 to receive board approval for the share sale.

Trump administration plans to revoke federal approval for Ocean City wind farm

Neronha’s office is also considering additional legal action, but had not filed anything as of Friday. He’s focused on the existing multistate lawsuit challenging federal actions on offshore wind.

“Revolution Wind, a renewable energy project that is right at the finish line, and which would add 400MW to our clean energy portfolio, must move forward,” Neronha said in a statement Friday. “Billions in investment, more than 1,000 jobs, and an energy future that helps, not hurts, generations to come, are all on the line.

“For this reason, we formally notified the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts of the President’s unlawful stop work order and the harm it will cause to Rhode Islanders,” his statement said. “We cannot allow this Administration to stop this project, and we will continue to explore additional legal avenues to prevent them from doing so.”

The Sept. 4 hearing in Boston will also give the federal agencies and cabinet directors named as defendants a chance to present their own arguments on why the lawsuit should be tossed. Adam Gustafson, acting assistant U.S. Attorney General, defended the federal administration’s pause on offshore wind projects in an Aug. 8 memo, citing “potential legal deficiencies in past practices, the possibility of serious harm to various interests and marine mammals, and the potential inadequacies of various environmental reviews.”

Gustafson argued that states lacked the jurisdiction to challenge federal review powers, at least on a universal basis. He asked the judge to rule in favor of the defendants, or to limit orders to specific projects and permits, rather than a blanket ruling denying federal review power over offshore wind as a whole.

“Limiting relief in such a way would be practical and minimize risk of confusion for Agency Defendants responsible for overseeing federal wind leasing and permitting processes,” Gustafson wrote.

The judge is unlikely to make a decision on the dueling motions at the Sept. 4 hearing, but. will likely issue a ruling at a later, unscheduled date.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Revolution-installed-turbine-082025-2.jpeg,N,,2025-08-30 12:04:10.506891

The forthcoming years will reveal whether these efforts can sustain growth and innovation in the evolving landscape of electric vehicle manufacturing.","In a significant turn of events for Georgia’s electric vehicle (EV) industry, the recent enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act presents both challenges and opportunities as the state navigates the future of EV manufacturing without the support of federal tax credits.

The legislation, which came into effect on July 4, has eliminated federal tax credits for electric vehicle purchases, as well as tax incentives for battery manufacturers set to phase out by 2030. This bill is anticipated to slow the growth of EV sales, compelling the industry to rely more on manufacturer discounts rather than consumer incentives to stimulate purchases. Critics fear this shift could strain the market and impact the broader EV ecosystem pivotal to Georgia’s ambitious plans to be the “electric vehicle capital of America.”

Notably, the act has already had a tangible impact on investment in clean energy, with a reported $14 billion in projects either canceled or scaled back in the first quarter of 2025 alone. Among these, a planned $1 billion battery plant in Statesboro, Georgia, is a glaring example of lost potential investments. Industry leaders, however, remain optimistic, asserting that electric vehicle production can thrive independently of federal support.

Georgia Public Service Commissioner Tim Echols expressed confidence, stating, “The tax credits played a purpose, but that purpose may be over. We may not need a subsidy in the future.” The sentiment echoed across numerous EV press conferences in the state indicates a determination to cultivate a self-sustaining supply chain, critical for long-term viability.

While the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 injected enthusiasm into the sector—significantly boosting investments in battery production and critical mineral processing—its recent challenges are forcing local manufacturers to adapt quickly. The IRA had led to a nearly threefold increase in investments in related industries, a trend that professionals worry might reverse due to the scarcity of financial assistance under the new legislation.

With federal support diminishing, local manufacturers face the daunting task of ensuring the development of an American critical minerals supply chain. Experts note that the U.S. currently holds only about 1% of the world’s lithium reserves, essential for battery production. This reliance on external resources poses a severe risk as international competitors—particularly China—dominate the supply chain.

In August, General Motors announced significant investments in U.S. operations, including a collaboration with Hyundai to develop six new electric models. These strategic partnerships hint at a concerted effort for domestic manufacturing despite the legislative challenges. Meanwhile, Kia remains committed to enhancing its local supply chains, a move highlighted by the company’s aim to minimize reliance on imported materials.

Despite the hurdles presented by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, industry proponents maintain a glimmer of hope. Many believe that while traditional incentives fade, innovative manufacturer strategies will emerge, leading to new deals and discounts that could attract consumers. The upcoming phase-out of the 45X tax credit for U.S. battery manufacturers by 2030 looms large, and analysts warn that without a robust domestic strategy, the U.S. risks losing ground to rivals in China and Europe.

In conclusion, while Georgia’s journey toward establishing itself as a leader in the electric vehicle sector faces significant obstacles, industry stakeholders are looking toward an independent future, strategically adapting to minimize dependency on federal incentives. The forthcoming years will reveal whether these efforts can sustain growth and innovation in the evolving landscape of electric vehicle manufacturing.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Trumps-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-Act-Threatens-Growth-of-Georgias.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 12:05:40.227580

A federal appeals court has ruled most of Donald Trump's tariffs are an overreach of his use of emergency powers as president.

The so-called reciprocal tariffs - imposed on nearly every country the US trades with - are being illegally imposed, the US Court of Appeals said on Friday.

The decision upholds a May ruling from the Court of International Trade, which also rejected Trump's argument that his global tariffs were permitted under an emergency economic powers act.

The court did not halt the tariffs but instead said they would remain in place until mid-October, setting up a further legal challenge in the US Supreme Court.

There are still a lot of unknowns, but here's what we understand so far about the ruling - and what it could mean for the US president's flagship policy.

What did the appeals court say?

In its 7-4 decision, the appellate court backed a lower court's finding that President Trump did not have the authority to impose global tariffs.

This was largely because of the law Trump used to justify the policies, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which the judges said does not grant ""the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax"".

The US Court of Appeals rejected Trump's argument that the tariffs were permitted under his emergency economic powers, calling the levies ""invalid as contrary to law"".

Trump immediately rejected the judgement, taking to Truth Social in the hours after it landed to call the appeals court ""highly partisan"" and the ruling a ""disaster"" for the country.

""If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,"" he wrote.

What is the IEEPA?

The decades-old act, which has repeatedly been deployed by Trump during both terms in office, grants a US president significant authority to respond to a national emergency or a major threat from overseas.

The 1977 law states that a president can pull a number of economic levers ""to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy or economy"".

It's been used by both presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, who invoked the act to impose sanctions on Russia after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and then again after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine eight years later.

But the appeals court stated in its decision that the emergency law ""did not give the president wide-ranging authority to impose tariffs"".

The IEEPA ""neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the president's power to impose tariffs"", they said.

Trump argued when he unveiled his global tariffs that a trade imbalance was harmful to US national security, and was therefore a national emergency.

But the court ruled that imposing tariffs is not within the president's mandate, and ""the power of the purse (including the power to tax) belongs to Congress"".

Why is this important?

Outside of being a significant setback to President Trump's centrepiece agenda - tariffs - the federal appeals court ruling could have an immediate impact on the US economy, with knock-on effects felt in global markets.

""Businesses are going to be subject to uncertainty,"" Dr Linda Yueh, an economist at Oxford University and the London Business School, told the BBC's Today programme.

As countries wait to see if the Supreme Court will take up the case, which seems likely, they could decide to hold off on conducting business with the US.

If this happens, Dr Yueh said, it could ""dampen down economic activity"".

There are also significant ramifications that could be felt within the political sphere.

For instance, if the Supreme Court reverses the federal appeals court decision and sides with the Trump administration, it could set a precedent that emboldens the president to use the IEEPA more aggressively than he has done so far.

What happens next?

The case will now most likely proceed to the highest US court, a challenge that Trump signalled on Truth Social.

""Tariffs were allowed to be used against us by our uncaring and unwise Politicians,"" Trump wrote. ""Now, with the help of the United States Supreme Court, we will use them to the benefit of our Nation, and Make America Rich, Strong, and Powerful Again!""

The conservative majority on America's highest court could potentially make it more likely to side with the president's view.

Six of the nine justices were appointed by Republican presidents, including three that Trump selected during his first term in the White House.

But the court has also been more critical of presidents when it seems they're overreaching on policies not directly authorised by Congress.

During Joe Biden's presidency, for example, the court expanded on what it called the ""major questions doctrine"" to invalidate Democratic efforts to use existing laws to limit greenhouse gas emissions by power plants and to forgive student loan debt for millions of Americans.

What if the tariffs are ruled illegal?

The federal appeals court was divided 7-4 in its decision that Trump's nearly universal tariffs are illegal. It has now given the US administration until mid-October to appeal to the US Supreme Court on a case with implications for both the US economy and its trade relationship with the rest of the world.

If the Supreme Court affirms the decision, it could trigger uncertainty in financial markets.

There will be questions over whether the US will have to pay back billions of dollars that have been gathered by import taxes on products from countries that have been paying them over the past few months.

It could also throw into question whether major economies - including the UK, Japan and South Korea - are locked-in to the individual trade deals they secured with the US ahead of the August deadline. Other trade deals that are currently being negotiated could also be thrown into chaos.

If allowed to stand, the appeals court decision would also be a tremendous blow to Trump's political authority and reputation as a dealmaker. But if it were overturned by the Supreme Court it would have the opposite effect.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2329/live/1132b900-859a-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 09:58:46.228634

Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California energy regulators Friday put the brakes on plans requiring oil companies to pay a penalty if their profits climb too high, a temporary win for the fossil fuel industry two years after the governor declared the state had “finally beat big oil.”

The postponement by the California Energy Commission until 2030 comes after two oil refineries accounting for roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity announced their plans to close in the coming months. The commission has the authority to pass a penalty, not a requirement to do so.

The penalty was considered a landmark piece of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s government and the state’s ambitious goals to curb climate change. The state faces challenges in its efforts to take on the oil industry while ensuring a stable and affordable fuel supply. His administration is also proposing to temporarily streamline approvals of new oil wells in existing oil fields in an effort to maintain a stable fuel supply.

Siva Gunda, the commission’s vice chair, said the state is not “walking back” its efforts to wean itself off fossil fuels but must prioritize protecting consumers at the gas pump.

“I personally truly believe that this pause will be beneficial to ensure that this mid-transition is smooth,” he said.

The commission still plans to set rules that would require oil refineries to keep a minimum level of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when refineries go offline for maintenance.

Jamie Court, the president of Consumer Watchdog who supported the law, said the energy commission’s vote is “basically a giveaway to the industry.”

“I’m really disheartened and disgusted by Newsom,” he said. “I feel like this is just a total about-face. And in the end it’s going to result in greater price spikes.”

But the Western States Petroleum Association recommended that the state postpone a penalty for 20 years.

“While today’s action by the CEC stopped short of a full statutory repeal or a 20-year pause, it represents a needed step to provide some certainty for California’s fuels market,” CEO Catherine Reheis-Boyd said in a statement. “The vote demonstrates the CEC’s understanding that imposing this failed policy would have likely exacerbated investment concerns contributing to California’s recent refinery closures.”

In 2022, Newsom called the Legislature into a special session to pass a law aimed at holding oil companies accountable for making too much money after a summer of record-high gas prices in California. The governor signed a law the following year authorizing the energy commission to penalize oil companies for excessive profits.

Julia Stein, deputy director of a climate institute at UCLA School of Law, said state officials are still intent on advancing their efforts to transition away from fossil fuels.

“But I think there is also a sense at the state level that we’re entering a different phase of the transition where some of these problems are going to be presented more acutely,” she said. “And folks are kind of now trying to understand how they’re going to approach that in real time.”

California has the highest gas prices in the nation, largely due to taxes and environmental regulations. Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.

The commission hasn’t imposed a single penalty two years after Newsom gave them the authority to do so, nor has it determined what counts as an excessive profit.

Setting a penalty could be risky for the state because it could unintentionally discourage production and drive prices up, said Severin Borenstein, an economist and public policy professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

“It’s pretty clear they are shifting towards more focus on affordability and recognition that the high prices in California may not be associated with the actual refinery operations,” he said of state officials.",https://dailyjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/preview-2130.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 17:04:20.343070

“The EPA fired five whistleblowers who signed the EPA Declaration of Dissent, and issued a Notice of Removal for an additional four employees,” according to a statement from Stand Up for Science, a non-profit organisation created in response to US President Donald Trump’s cuts to federal research funding and other policies.

The EPA appeared to acknowledge the job losses in a statement on Aug 29, but did not specify if employees were fired.

“Following a thorough internal investigation, EPA supervisors made decisions on an individualised basis,” an agency spokesman said, declining to comment on “individual personnel matters”.

Since taking charge of the federal agency tasked with ensuring clean air, land and water, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin has executed Mr Trump’s agenda, including

gutting climate regulations

, ramping up fossil fuel development and slashing funding for clean energy.

The changes have drawn fierce backlash from scientists and environmental advocates alike.

in July after they signed the scathing open letter accusing Mr Zeldin of pushing policies hazardous to both people and the planet.

The letter – signed by 270 employees with 170 choosing to be named – described a climate of political interference and warned that the agency’s leadership was eroding public health protections and scientific integrity.

On Aug 29, the EPA noted their “zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November”.

That prompted an EPA review of the Clean School Bus program.
Zoom in: Congress also killed another Biden-era program that helped school districts offset the cost of electric buses.
Electric school buses have been deployed in 49 states, the District of Columbia, four U.S. territories and more than 20 tribal nations, according to data from WRI's Electric School Bus Initiative.
What to watch: Increasingly, state and local funding programs are helping to drive the electric school bus transition forward.","As students head back to school, a five-year effort to replace diesel school buses with electric ones has hit two big speed bumps: a federal funding freeze, plus the collapse of a leading bus manufacturer.

Why it matters: There's still lots of enthusiasm for cleaner buses, advocates say, but some school districts are turning back to diesel because they didn't get the electric buses they were promised or can't get service on the ones they own.

Catch up quick: Canadian electric bus maker Lion Electric filed for bankruptcy in December 2024 and shut down its only U.S. factory in Illinois.

The new owners, a group of Quebec-based investors that took control in May, reportedly said they won't honor U.S. orders or warranties.

Alarmed school districts that used taxpayer funds to buy Lion buses are left wondering about the status of pending orders, and about who will service buses already on the road.

Zoom out: The Trump administration hasn't said what will happen to the $2.3 billion in unspent funds in the EPA's $5 billion Clean School Bus program, created under 2021's bipartisan infrastructure law.

About $2.7 billion was disbursed across three rounds of funding in 2022 and 2023, during the Biden administration.

Applications for a fourth round of $965 million, announced in September 2024, closed in January, just before Trump took office, but no awards have been made.

As one of his first acts, Trump issued an executive order rolling back funding for clean energy and electric vehicles.

That prompted an EPA review of the Clean School Bus program. The agency expects to provide an update soon on whether more awards will occur, an EPA spokesperson tells Axios.

Zoom in: Congress also killed another Biden-era program that helped school districts offset the cost of electric buses.

The Commercial Clean Vehicle Tax Credit, approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, provided up to $40,000 for the purchase of electric commercial vehicles, including school buses.

It was axed, along with other tax credits for EV purchases, in this year's massive budget reconciliation bill.

Where it stands: There are nearly 14,000 committed electric school buses in the U.S. — meaning they're funded, ordered or delivered — including 5,300 already on the road.

Electric school buses have been deployed in 49 states, the District of Columbia, four U.S. territories and more than 20 tribal nations, according to data from WRI's Electric School Bus Initiative.

Yes, but: That momentum died in 2025, with 13,931 committed e-buses, only 73 more than in 2024.

What to watch: Increasingly, state and local funding programs are helping to drive the electric school bus transition forward.

Cumulative state-level funding grew dramatically from $268 million in 2020 to $2.47 billion in 2025.

""We're going to need some amount of incentives to keep moving forward,"" acknowledges Sue Gander, who leads a program at World Resources Institute to support school districts' purchases of electric school buses.

""The economic benefits and health benefits are still there,"" she said. ""Those are the reasons school districts want to move forward"".

The bottom line: Nearly half a million school buses carry more than 20 million children each day in the U.S., and about 90% run on diesel fuel, which has been linked to serious health risks and development issues in children.

""Hey everyone,"" the OP said. ""I have been lurking this subreddit for a while debating if I will make the jump to EV, but I finally did and I am super happy with the purchase.""

They bought their 2024 LR AWD M3 Tesla car used, with a $6,000 down payment and financing $29,000. While it had a ""couple of dings and scratches,"" they were ultimately happy with their decision.

""Went from a 2017 Passat SE I can't stop hard accelerating every chance I can get,"" they shared.

Electric vehicles are gaining traction. As the OP can attest, they accelerate faster than gas-powered cars and save you money over time. Let's look at the numbers.

Your average electric vehicle, while having a higher sticker price, costs $485 per year to run and requires about $900 per year for maintenance. Gas-powered vehicles require over $1,000 on both fronts. If you plan on keeping your car for over six years and are a homeowner with the means to install a charging station, then you'll reap the most benefits.

There's also the federal tax credit to consider, but you'll need to act quickly. Those who purchase an EV before September 30, 2025, will qualify for up to $7,500, per H&R Block. If you purchase a used EV, like the OP, you'll qualify for up to $4,000.

Aside from the financial benefits, EVs are also much more environmentally friendly than gas-powered vehicles. They don't run on dirty fuels, which pollute the air and warm the planet at unprecedented rates.

If you're still on the fence, you've got some options. Firstly, you might consider leasing instead of purchasing it outright. Plus, there are more brands than Tesla out there if you'd rather drive another car. Chevy, for example, has some insanely cheap deals on leasing their EVs.

EVs often promise lower fueling and maintenance costs, while hybrids have a more affordable purchase price. When asked which one was cheaper, ChatGPT said it’s not as straightforward as you might think.

Here’s a price comparison between EVs and hybrids, according to ChatGPT.

Purchase Price

The biggest car expense is its initial purchase price. ChatGPT pointed out that hybrids are generally cheaper to buy. The difference in price is largely due to battery costs, which make up almost a third of the price of a new EV, according to the Stanford Report.

Data from Kelley Blue Book shows that the cheapest starting price for an EV is $26,795, while hybrids start at $21,900.

Be Aware: I Asked ChatGPT Which Hybrid Vehicles To Stay Away From Buying: Here’s What It Said

Fuel and Energy Costs

EVs offer much lower fuel costs compared with hybrids, ChatGPT said. A hybrid combines a gas engine with an electric motor and a small battery, while electric-only vehicles rely solely on a larger battery and an electric motor.

According to Consumer Reports, the annual fuel cost for a hybrid is $300 to $800 less than that of a gas-only car, while EV owners pay about $1,300 less. Based on this data, EV owners pay roughly $500 to $1,000 less per year on fuel compared with hybrid drivers.

Maintenance

ChatGPT pointed out that EVs usually have lower maintenance costs due to fewer moving parts. EVs don’t need oil changes, but they do need brake pad replacements, although not as often due to regenerative braking. The highest maintenance cost is the battery; however, many manufacturers provide a warranty for the first eight years or 100,000 miles, CarEdge reported.

On the other hand, hybrids still have internal combustion components, so you’ll still need regular oil changes and part replacements on roughly the same maintenance schedule as gas-powered cars.

On a per-mile basis, EV maintenance and repairs are typically 40% lower than comparable gas vehicles, reported the National Resources Defense Council.

Incentives and Tax Credits

According to the IRS, buyers of new EVs can currently get up to $7,500 in federal tax credits, while used models may be eligible for $4,000. This also applies to plug-in hybrids. Standard hybrids do not qualify for the tax credit.

These tax credits can improve EV affordability, but they’re set to expire on Sept. 30, 2025, under President Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill.

Total Cost of Ownership

ChatGPT cited data compiled by Business Insider on the cost to own certain vehicles in the first five years. According to the data, the cost of owning a Tesla Model Y, the bestselling EV in the U.S., had a five-year cost of $34,500, which included interest charges on the loan, insurance, maintenance, tax and fees, and repairs. Including the purchase price, the total came to $91,000.

The total cost for a Toyota Rav4 hybrid was about $64,300 over five years, about the same as for the gas version. This also included the original purchase price of $35,000.

ChatGPT’s final verdict was that hybrids are generally cheaper to own in 2025, especially over the first five years, but EVs can catch up in the long run if buyers take advantage of tax credits and lower fuel and maintenance costs.

The debate that took place in a Washington, D.C., hearing room in June was so filled with energy-industry jargon that most people would not realize they were witnessing a battle over who could own and profit from power plants.

The same fight between utility companies and independent power producers is now happening in statehouses.

Utility companies see the current crisis in the electricity system, driven by rising demand from data centers and high pressure to curb rate increases, as an opportunity. But consumer advocates caution that utilities’ efforts are more a cash grab than a solution.

“We need to plan for contingencies, we need flexibility, we need to plan for redundancies and have all the tools available to us to make sure that when customers turn the lights on, those lights come on,” said Wendy Stark, executive vice president for utilities and chief legal officer for the utility PPL Corp. of Pennsylvania, at the June 4 hearing before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Stark was talking about changing the law in states that decided decades ago to shift to competitive markets for power plants.

Let’s take a step back, because the concepts discussed at the hearing and in cases before state regulatory commissions are well-understood by the companies involved, but might as well be in a foreign language to most observers.

The first thing to grasp is that more than a dozen states—California and Texas were the largest—decided in the 1990s and 2000s to change the rules for who can own power plants. The states said that utilities would focus on the basics of delivering power and billing, and continue to receive a guaranteed profit for this, while non-utility companies would compete on an open market to see who can produce and sell electricity at the lowest price.

Lawmakers and energy analysts often used the word “deregulation” to describe what was happening, but it would be more accurate to call it a restructuring, since power plants were still subject to federal regulations. The process varied by state, but it often involved the utilities selling their power plants, or spinning off those assets into an affiliated company that no longer had a guaranteed profit.

Meanwhile, most states didn’t move away from traditional regulation, and utilities there continue to have local monopolies over power plants and the electricity delivery system. So now the country has several different regulatory systems existing side by side.

But utilities have long argued that competitive markets are ill-suited to making sure a large region has a reliable supply of electricity at affordable prices. They would like to regain the ability to build power plants in restructured states.

Much of this discussion is happening in the territory served by PJM Interconnection, which runs from New Jersey to Chicago and is the country’s largest grid region. State officials have taken a high interest in PJM, the nonprofit company that manages the grid and market, because of recent spikes in electricity bills.

Utilities are backing legislation in Pennsylvania and New Jersey that would allow them to own power plants. Consumer advocates expect to see a similar proposal in Maryland in 2026. Some of the same discussions are happening in other states, such as Illinois and Ohio, but have gained little traction, based on interviews with people who monitor this lobbying.

Among the losers if utilities get what they want would be independent power producers, which are non-utility companies that own power plants, such as LS Power and Vistra Corp. They would face new competition from utilities that have the security of being able to pass costs directly to consumers.

Utility company officials are arguing that changes in market rules could facilitate the development of renewable energy and help meet state climate goals. But advocates say it’s a mistake to frame this debate solely in terms of its effects on climate change or renewable energy, which they say are secondary to the main reason for this fight: a desire by utilities to maximize profit from the growth of data centers.

“With so much growth on the horizon right now, I’m sure [utilities are] seeing dollar signs, and maybe that’s their job,” said John Howat, senior energy analyst for the National Consumer Law Center. “But that’s not necessarily in the public interest.”

David Lapp, the Maryland People’s Counsel, which is the state government’s consumer advocate on utility issues, said this situation may appear complicated, but it’s simple.

“Utilities see an opportunity to grow their profits by expanding their businesses into generation so they can shift risks on the ratepayers and take advantage of data center load growth,” he said.

Lapp sees no evidence that there would be benefits from allowing utilities to do what they want—no cost savings or improvements to reliability.

But some analysts say that consumer advocates may be missing some nuance. Tyson Slocum, director of the energy program at Public Citizen, argues that states should at least explore whether there is a consumer-friendly way to allow utilities to build power plants in the states where that’s otherwise not allowed.

“There are no easy fixes here,” he said. “But I think it’s important for state regulators and state lawmakers to explore all options on the table for how to keep the lights on in a reliable and affordable way.”

It’s not a coincidence that all the states considering changes have Democratic governors. Slocum said these officials feel an urgency because of a desire to reduce electricity prices and an awareness that the Trump administration is likely to use federal regulation to make competitive energy markets favor fossil fuels even more than they already do.

“Trump is going to turn federal energy regulators at FERC into a policy arm of the White House,” he said.

Remembering the Bad Old Days

For people like Rob Kelter, who has been advocating on utility issues since the mid-1990s, the current discussion reveals that many people don’t remember or understand that today’s system is largely a response to past excesses and failures of utility companies. He is a senior attorney for the Environmental Law & Policy Center, a Chicago-based nonprofit that is active in much of the Midwest.

“There’s a new generation of legislators who in states like Ohio and Pennsylvania and Illinois don’t all remember how bad things were, how high prices were, when we went through restructuring,” he said.

In the mid-1990s, the federal government and many corporations worked to reduce regulations across industries. Enron, which would later gain infamy as a business failure, helped to lead lobbying campaigns in state legislatures to deregulate utilities such as electricity and natural gas.

Utilities had been vertically integrated, with local monopolies over power plants along with the wires and pipelines to deliver resources. Supporters of restructuring pointed to high rates and cost overruns as evidence that the monopoly model led to inefficiency that could be fixed by allowing competition.

By the early 2000s, more than a dozen states had passed some form of electricity deregulation.

The changes meant that utilities needed to move away from direct ownership of power plants, but they retained control of wires, billing and other core functions. Other companies would own power plants and compete on an open market.

Under the new system, power plant owners would assume the risk for their investments. This was in contrast to a vertically integrated system in which utility ratepayers bore the risk.

The shift to deregulation slowed soon after, hurt by the California electricity crisis of 2000 and 2001, in which the state experienced rolling blackouts and high costs. The problems in California stemmed in part from market manipulations by Enron, which was about to collapse following the discovery of accounting fraud.

But states that had changed their rules mostly stuck with the new way of doing things. Competitive markets grew as independent power companies expanded and grid operators refined their processes for overseeing pricing and competition.

Today, 14 states have restructured electricity markets, according to the Energy Information Administration, including California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Texas, plus Washington, D.C. Others have more limited forms of these policies, including Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Virginia and Washington.

The hearing at FERC headquarters in June was part of a technical conference about the challenges that regional grid managers and utilities face as they try to bring new power plants online. One of the main issues is that data centers are becoming huge consumers of electricity, sometimes outpacing the ability to build new power plants and leading to concerns that a tight supply of electricity will lead to high prices for everyone.

Data centers are “sort of like an accelerant” to existing concerns about having enough power plants to meet consumer demand, Adam Keech, vice president of market design and economics for PJM, said at the hearing.

“We don’t have time to waste,” he said.

On that same panel were representatives from some of the utilities that want to own power plants, and some of the independent power producers that stand to be hurt if states move in this direction.

“If the generators and if the market doesn’t supply more generation, the utility could step in,” said Stark of PPL, which is based in Allentown, Pennsylvania.

On the opposite side are companies such as LS Power of New York, which owns power plants across the country and sells electricity in PJM and other markets.

“Can I just dispel some of the false information that’s being given here?” asked Marji Philips, vice president of wholesale market policy for LS Power. She said her company and other power plant owners were investing heavily in new plants and she rejected the idea that market forces were failing to meet demand.

Changes in state law would allow utilities to enter this market with minimal risk, while the existing players would face high risks and new competitors.

Todd Snitchler, president and CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, a trade group for independent power producers, said in an email that lawmakers should be wary of “a reversal in policy and a return to the monopoly utility approach for generation.”

On this point, he agrees with Amisha Rai, senior vice president of advocacy at Advanced Energy United, a trade group whose members include many of the leading solar, wind and energy storage companies.

“While growing energy demand is a challenge for all states to tackle, the solution isn’t for states to abandon market competition but rather to continue to press grid operators to make improvements that ensure the lowest cost for ratepayers,” Rai said in a statement.

“States Have an Opportunity”

The discussion at the June hearing hinted at the much larger lobbying effort taking place in statehouses.

In recent earnings conference calls, executives for several large utilities spoke about their hopes that states would change their laws to allow the companies to build and own power plants.

“Despite higher prices, we are not seeing the market respond fast enough,” said Calvin Butler, CEO of Exelon, in a July 31 conference call. His company owns utilities across PJM, including ComEd in Illinois, PECO in Pennsylvania, BGE in Maryland and Atlantic City Electric in New Jersey.

“States have an opportunity to proactively bring control, certainty and cost benefits by pursuing options outside of the capacity market, including regulated generation,” he said.

FirstEnergy, PPL and PSEG are among the other utilities that have been discussing this topic in state legislatures or before federal regulators.

The companies are focusing much of their attention on Pennsylvania, and, to a lesser extent, Maryland and New Jersey, based on comments from the companies and other interested parties.

Pennsylvania state Sen. Jarrett Coleman, a Republican, has introduced SB 897, which would allow utilities to build and own power plants in cases where state utility regulators determine that this would lead to cost savings for consumers. The bill is awaiting action in a Senate committee.

“Pennsylvania’s decades-old energy policies need to be updated to address potential energy shortfalls and provide the state with additional tools to help insulate customers from growing price volatility and reliability concerns,” Coleman said in an April memo about the bill.

The Energy & Policy Institute, a utility watchdog nonprofit, has been tracking this process and obtained records of email communications between Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s office and utilities such as Exelon, FirstEnergy and PPL. The messages reveal little about the views of Shapiro, a Democrat, on whether utilities should be allowed to own power plants, but they do show that large and influential companies are trying to nudge him in that direction.

“We look forward to continuing the productive dialogue surrounding resource adequacy in the face of surging electrical demand driven by new data centers, AI technology, electrification and business development,” said John Hawkins, FirstEnergy’s president for Pennsylvania, in a November 2024 email to Shapiro’s staff.

Inside Climate News asked Shapiro’s office whether the governor supports allowing utilities to own power plants.

“Gov. Shapiro’s focus continues to be on lowering costs for Pennsylvanians by expanding energy generation and pushing for PJM reforms that would better support the new power demands,” said Manuel Bonder, a Shapiro spokesman, in an email. “The Shapiro administration has put forward a comprehensive plan that would streamline project permitting, incentivize new energy generation, and reduce power demand through new investments in energy efficiency.”

The comment did not touch on whether utilities should be allowed to own power plants.

FirstEnergy spokesman Todd Meyers had this statement: “While we are not actively seeking to build generation in the deregulated states in which we operate, FirstEnergy would consider building generation under a regulated construct and if it provides benefits to our customers.”

In Maryland, Exelon and its local utilities have talked about the need for lawmakers to change rules about who can own power plants. Lapp, the People’s Counsel, expects this to intensify when the Maryland General Assembly reconvenes in January.

In New Jersey, Newark-based PSEG wants to be allowed to build power plants. Ralph LaRosa, the utility’s chairman, president and CEO, said in a conference call this month that the region’s need to rapidly increase the electricity supply “may require the consideration of a new approach to procuring capacity and resource planning.”

A pending proposal, Assembly Bill 5439, would allow utilities to compete for the right to do projects in the state. It’s not clear whether this has a chance of passing.

This bill would not be good for consumers, said Brian Lipman, director for New Jersey’s Division of the Rate Counsel, the state’s consumer advocate on utility issues.

“Competition is good for ratepayers,” he said in an email. “Moreover, utility-owned generation will likely shift the risk of producing generation away from generation developers and onto ratepayers. This means that if something goes wrong (cost overrun, inaccurate load forecast) ratepayers, not the generators, will be liable for the costs of that error.”",https://highlandcountypress.com/sites/default/files/36998-acd99b42-6825-4670-9083-1cf8208792ba_0.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 09:58:50.259856

But then electricity demand started growing faster than wind turbines and solar panels could keep up, so policymakers took another peek at the big stainless-steel beast they had parked.

By July 24, 2025, the NRC said, “Fine, you can go back to work,” and by August 25, Palisades officially clocked back in. Think of it as a plant that tried early retirement… then realized it couldn’t afford to sit on the beach all day.

Holtec aims to synchronize the power plant with the grid in the fourth quarter of 2025, making it the first U.S. commercial reactor ever to return to service after being formally retired and stripped for decommissioning.

Dollars, deals, and demand

Bringing a nuclear power plant back to life is not cheap. The DOE has furnished a loan guarantee of $1.52 billion, with five disbursements already released to cover new fuel, component repairs, and safety upgrades.

Michigan legislators added up to $300 million for local infrastructure and workforce training. On the revenue side, Wolverine Power Cooperative and Hoosier Energy signed long-term purchase agreements that lock in buyers for as much as two-thirds of Palisades’ output, anchoring the project’s finances even before the first electron flows.

The lure is obvious: Midwestern data centers, EV battery plants, and electrified factories all need round-the-clock clean juice, and they need it soon.

Why Palisades closed down in the first place

Palisades didn’t shut down in 2022 because of a green revolution or a sudden anti-nuclear crusade. It shut down because it simply stopped being profitable. For years, the power plant sold its electricity under a long-term contract, but once that deal started wobbling, it couldn’t compete in the free market.

Add in a flood of cheap natural gas reshaping the Midwest market, and running an 800-megawatt reactor suddenly looked like running a gourmet restaurant in a town that only wants fast food. (A Homer Simpson reference would be great here, but it’s already too obvious.)

By May 2022, the operator, Entergy, decided it wasn’t worth keeping the lights on. The decision had far more to do with economics and shaky contracts than politics or ecology. Ironically, this “permanent” retirement lasted just long enough for the U.S. Department of Energy and Michigan leaders to realize the grid would be cleaner and more stable with Palisades back on deck. Now, with demand spiking thanks to the rise of Artificial Intelligence and data centers all over the country, priorities have changed. We need stable energy, 24/7, and we need it now.

Tougher than flipping a switch

Resurrection is more complex than restarting a laptop. Holtec projects a combined workforce of more than 600 skilled jobs, preserving the region’s nuclear know-how and salaries that average well above the local median. Once components pass pressure tests, the power plant will run a staged start-up ending in a “grid-sync” test late next year. Only then can Michigan count on continuous output through 2040 and beyond.",https://eladelantado.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/palisades-power-plant.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 09:58:53.291415

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement.

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It's the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states' climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans' livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

From Florida to the Carolinas, families face a routine ritual: prepare and pray. But the storms are becoming stronger. The flooding is now more severe, and the economic toll increases every year. In 2024, the United States endured 27 separate weather and climate disasters costing a combined $182.7 billion – one of the costliest years on record.

As former Republican congressmen who represented southern districts in Florida and South Carolina, climate change isn’t abstract. Miami is seeing rising tides. North Carolina has been battered by torrential flooding. Energy grids have buckled under record-breaking heat. These risks are real, and they are reshaping our economy, insurance markets, and communities.

RICK PERRY SAYS KEN PAXTON'S ENERGY LAWSUIT WILL HURT US COAL COMPANIES

That is why conservatives must reclaim the climate conversation. Sadly, today’s debate is too often dominated by the loudest partisan voices. On the far left, some prescribe sweeping mandates and federal micromanagement that threaten innovation and growth. On the far right, others—ironically in the name of conservatism—are turning the tools of government against private companies, punishing them for evaluating the financial impacts of climate risk.

Take Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s lawsuit against BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard. He claims these firms formed an ""investment cartel"" by coordinating their consideration of climate risk, effectively conspiring to disadvantage coal producers and traditional energy companies. But that framing badly misrepresents reality. As the Wall Street Journal editorial board noted, coal production increased during the very period Paxton points to—undermining his claim of an anti-energy conspiracy. What he calls collusion is, in fact, routine fiduciary judgment: investors weighing risks and making portfolio choices. That’s not a cartel. That’s an efficient market working as it should.

Assessing risk, whether from hurricanes, regulation, or technological disruption, is the essence of responsible investing. If an asset manager concludes that coastal real estate is more vulnerable to flooding, or that insurance payouts are skyrocketing in certain regions, adjusting portfolios accordingly isn’t ""woke capitalism."" It’s their fiduciary duty. It’s to safeguard the value of their portfolios. It’s exactly how free markets are supposed to function.

Some of Texas’s most respected conservative leaders see this clearly. Rick Perry, former Governor and Energy Secretary during the first Trump Administration, has criticized Attorney General Paxton’s lawsuit, warning that weaponizing state power against investors undermines the very energy agenda conservatives claim to support. Perry has rightly argued that free markets, not lawsuits and political intimidation, are the best way to ensure American energy security and economic resilience. He argues true freedom means defending the right of businesses and investors to assess risk as they see fit.

Conservatives have long championed the principles of limited government and individual liberty. But when politicians intervene to dictate investment strategies or intimidate firms for recognizing climate risks, they abandon those very principles. The real conservative position is simple: the freedom to invest must be protected. American investors and companies must be able to manage all business risks and opportunities to remain profitable and competitive.

Across the country, center-right voices are beginning to step up and lead on this issue. Institutions like the Cato Institute, the National Taxpayers Union, R Street, and federal and state lawmakers are demonstrating how market-based approaches can preserve freedom, drive innovation, and prepare our communities for the realities of climate change. We will all convene later this month in New York City to share how conservatives can chart a path forward.

This is not about choosing between the environment and the economy. It is about unleashing American ingenuity to confront financial risks, create opportunities, and strengthen resilience. Conservatives should be the ones insisting that the marketplace—not government mandates—decides how to adapt and invest for the future.

The stakes are clear. If we cede the conversation, the public will be left with a false choice between big-government mandates from the left and big-government meddling from the right. Both are wrong. Conservatives must stand for freedom. For families rebuilding after storms, for entrepreneurs developing clean technologies, and for investors responsibly assessing risks. Here in America, we must firmly defend the freedom to invest.",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/08/paxton-ken.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 11:01:27.232341

Cell-cultivated meat offers an alternative that allows consumers to enjoy the taste of meat without the moral trade-offs.
Banning cell-cultivated meat betrays those values.","Starting Sept. 1, Texas joins six other states in banning the sale of cell-cultivated meat. It’s a move that feels more symbolic than substantive — after all, cell-cultivated meat is still in its infancy, produced in limited quantities and approved for sale among only a few companies. Yet the symbolism matters. Instead of embracing a tool with enormous potential to address pressing global challenges, some lawmakers are slamming the door before we’ve even had a chance to explore what’s possible.

For Texas lawmakers to ban this technology now is, frankly, shortsighted — and un-American.

Cell-cultivated meat — sometimes called lab-grown meat — is real animal meat produced by taking a small sample of animal cells and growing them in a controlled brewery-like environment. No slaughter is required. The goal is to create a more humane option that could reduce the environmental and health downsides of conventional meat production.

The bans run counter to the very values Texas often claims to champion: entrepreneurship, free markets, consumer choice.

Consider the environmental context. Traditional meat production is responsible for a staggering share of greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water use. And it drives habitat loss on a scale that endangers biodiversity worldwide. Cell-cultivated meat is not yet a perfect solution — current production methods remain energy intensive — but early studies suggest that with continued innovation, it could dramatically reduce land use, pollution and carbon emissions compared with industrial animal agriculture.

If we’re serious about tackling climate change, we need more options on the table, not fewer.

There’s also a public health dimension. Industrial animal farming is a breeding ground for zoonotic diseases and a major driver of antibiotic overuse, which accelerates the rise of resistant bacteria called superbugs. Cell-cultivated meat sidesteps many of these risks. Grown in sterile facilities, it doesn’t require anywhere near as many antibiotics, nor does it involve the dense confinement of animals that facilitates viral outbreaks. In a world where pandemics have reshaped our collective memory, ignoring safer food technologies is a gamble we cannot afford.

And then there’s the ethical dimension. Every year, tens of billions of land animals (and trillions of sea animals) are raised and slaughtered in conditions most people would rather not think about. Cell-cultivated meat offers an alternative that allows consumers to enjoy the taste of meat without the moral trade-offs. Even for those who do not personally object to torturing and/or killing animals, the simple fact that a more humane option exists should be cause for curiosity, not prohibition.

But here’s where the argument against bans becomes even clearer.

First, these laws are bad for the states themselves. Banning cell-cultivated meat doesn’t just block consumers from trying a new food. It also disincentivizes universities, startups and investors from putting down roots in states like Texas.

The cell-cultivated meat industry is still young, but it is already attracting billions of dollars in research funding, venture capital and private partnerships. By saying “not here,” Texas is essentially exporting those dollars, jobs and opportunities to more welcoming regions. At a time when states are competing fiercely to attract high-tech industries, this decision ensures Texas will lose out.

Second, these bans are bad for the nation. When American states reject innovation, they send a clear signal to companies: build elsewhere. And “elsewhere” increasingly means China, Singapore or Europe — regions that have been more open to experimentation. The U.S. risks repeating the mistake we made with solar panels, where hesitation at home allowed foreign competitors to dominate the market.

Do we really want the future of meat production — a technology that could reshape agriculture, trade and climate policy — controlled by other countries simply because we were too quick to shut the door?

Third, these bans are un-American. At their core, they run counter to the very values Texas and other states often claim to champion: entrepreneurship, free markets and consumer choice. To limit what scientists can research, what entrepreneurs can build and what consumers can buy is government overreach, plain and simple.

If cell-cultivated meat is truly unappealing, then consumers will reject it, and the companies making it will fail. That’s how markets work. But to pre-emptively prohibit a technology before it has even had the chance to compete? That’s not protecting freedom — it’s stifling it.

For Texas lawmakers to ban this technology now is, frankly, shortsighted — and un-American.

So why are states like Texas, Florida and Alabama banning cultivated meat? The justifications offered are often thin. Some politicians argue it’s about protecting ranchers, who fear economic displacement. Others appeal to “naturalness,” casting cell-cultivated meat as strange or unsafe. But history shows that dismissing new food technologies out of fear rarely holds up. Pasteurization, refrigeration and even “artificial ice” all faced initial skepticism before becoming mainstream. The idea that protecting ranchers requires banning potential competitors is particularly puzzling in states that otherwise champion free markets and innovation.

Of course, cell-cultivated meat is not a silver bullet. Critics are right to note that the technology is still expensive, scaling is difficult and its environmental advantages depend on how production evolves. But those are reasons to support research, not to prohibit it outright. If cell-cultivated meat succeeds, it could reduce our dependence on industrial animal farming. If it fails, it won’t be because Texas banned it in its early days — it will be because consumers didn’t want it, or the economics didn’t work out. That’s how innovation should rise or fall: on its merits, not on premature political bans.

At its heart, this debate is not about whether Texans — or anyone — should eat cell-cultivated meat tomorrow. It’s about whether we will allow innovation to flourish so that people can decide for themselves. Banning a technology before it has even had a chance to prove itself is not conservative. It is not pragmatic. It is not wise. It is anti-American.

Texas prides itself on independence, grit and innovation. Banning cell-cultivated meat betrays those values. Rather than fearing the future of food, the Lone Star State — and the rest of the nation for that matter — should be shaping it.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250828-lab-grown-meat-vl-1251p-73d3ac.jpg",N,,2025-08-30 09:59:44.768222

Ohio labor leaders say renewable energy is not just powering homes, but creating thousands of good-paying union jobs.

Despite the current administration's focus on fossil fuels, clean energy jobs are growing twice as fast as the overall labor market and Ohio ranks in the top 10 states for clean energy employment.

Pat Hook, business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 683 in Columbus, said his members have already worked on several utility-scale solar projects in central Ohio, with more underway.

""It has provided hundreds and hundreds of jobs, millions of dollars in wages and benefits, opportunities for a large number of people to enter the electrical industry, join our apprenticeship programs,"" Hook outlined.

Renewable energy workers earn about 30% more than the national median wage and union coverage in the sector is above 10%, nearly three times the private-sector average, according to federal labor data.

Hook acknowledged some local groups have opposed solar projects, raising concerns about land use or environmental impacts but he noted completed projects have disproved most claims and are generating tax revenues to benefit schools, police and fire services in surrounding communities.

Kevin Pranis, Great Lakes marketing manager for the Laborers' International Union of North America, said clean energy projects have provided stable, long-term job opportunities.

Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers began a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.

Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers’ jobs are in limbo, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.

Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.

The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.

“This is a pretty major change,” said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state fiscal policy team, noting “the challenge in enacting something that’s dramatically different for most drivers.”

Oregon’s transportation woes

Oregon’s transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.

Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.

Kotek’s proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state’s gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.

The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn’t have to pay supplemental registration fees.

Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle’s telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state’s decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.

Republican lawmakers, who have opposed the tax and fee increases, unveiled a different proposal Friday that largely focuses on lifting restrictions on how the transportation department can spend money on maintenance operations. It does not include a road usage charge.

As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state’s total vehicles, he said.

Hawaii launches program

Under Hawaii’s program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.

In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.

Questions about privacy and fairness

In past surveys commissioned by Oregon’s transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.

Oregon’s voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they’re more expensive and can be removed, he added.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.

Many people don’t realize that “both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,” said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.

Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.

“We are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,” Morgan said.",https://www.coloradohometownweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Electric_Vehicles-Road_User_Fee_73408-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-08-30 18:06:08.985271

B. Participation in Hybrid Public Hearing

EPA will begin pre-registering speakers for the hybrid public hearing upon publication of this document in the Federal Register . To register to speak at the hearing, please use the online registration form available on EPA's CCR website ( https://www.epa.gov/​coalash/​us-state-wyoming-coal-combustion-residuals-permit-program) or contact the person listed in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section to register to speak at the hearing. Both in-person and virtual hearing attendees are requested to pre-register at the link provided above. The last day to pre-register to speak at the hearing will be October 30, 2025.

EPA will make every effort to follow the schedule as closely as possible on the day of the hearing; however, please plan for the hearings to run either ahead of schedule or behind schedule. Additionally, requests to speak will be taken the day of the hearing at the hearing registration desk or via the Q&A functionality of the online platform. EPA will make every effort to accommodate all speakers who arrive and register, although preferences on speaking times may not be able to be fulfilled.

Each commenter will have five (5) minutes to provide oral testimony. EPA encourages commenters to provide EPA with a copy of their oral testimony electronically by emailing it to the person listed in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section. EPA also recommends submitting the text of your oral comments as written comments to the rulemaking docket. If EPA is anticipating a high attendance, the time allotment per testimony may be shortened to no shorter than three (3) minutes per person to accommodate all those wishing to provide testimony and who have pre-registered. While EPA will make every effort to accommodate all speakers who do not preregister, opportunities to speak may be limited based upon the number of pre-registered speakers. Therefore, EPA strongly encourages anyone wishing to speak to preregister. Participation in the public hearing does not preclude any entity or individual from submitting a written comment.

EPA may ask clarifying questions during the oral presentations but will not respond to the presentations at that time. Written statements and supporting information submitted during the comment period will be considered with the same weight as oral comments and supporting information presented at the public hearing.

Please note that any updates made to any aspect of the hearing are posted online at EPA's CCR website at https://www.epa.gov/​coalash/​us-state-wyoming-coal-combustion-residuals-permit-program. While EPA expects the hearing to go forward as set forth above, please monitor our website or contact the person listed in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section to determine if there are any updates. EPA does not intend to publish a document in the Federal Register announcing updates.

If you require the services of an interpreter or special accommodations such as audio transcription or closed captioning, please pre-register for the hearing and describe your needs on the registration form by October 16, 2025. Alternatively, registrants may notify the person listed in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section of any special needs. EPA may not be able to arrange accommodations without advance notice.

II. General Information

A. Overview of Proposed Action

On April 17, 2015, EPA published a final rule creating 40 CFR part 257, subpart D, which establishes a comprehensive set of minimum Federal requirements for the disposal of CCR in landfills and surface impoundments (80 FR 21302) (“Federal CCR regulations”).[ ] Section 2301 of the 2016 Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (WIIN) Act amended RCRA section 4005 to create a new subsection (d) that requires EPA to establish a Federal CCR permitting program. See 42 U.S.C. 6945(d).

As amended, RCRA section 4005(d) also allows States to seek approval for a State CCR permit program that will operate in lieu of a Federal CCR permit program in the State. The statute provides that within 180 days after a State submits a complete application to the Administrator for approval, EPA shall approve the State permit program if the Administrator determines that the State program requires each CCR unit located in the State to achieve compliance with either the Federal requirements or other State requirements that EPA determines, after consultation with the State, are at least as protective as those included in the Federal CCR regulations. See 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(B).

On February 6, 2023, WDEQ submitted its State CCR permit program application to EPA Region 8 requesting approval of the State's partial CCR permit program.[ ] EPA is proposing to approve the Wyoming partial CCR permit program pursuant to RCRA 4005(d)(1)(B). 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(B). The fact that Wyoming is seeking approval of a partial program does not mean it must subsequently apply for full program approval. However, Wyoming could apply for revised partial program approval or full program approval at some point in the future if it chooses to do so. If approved, the Wyoming CCR permit program will operate in lieu of the Federal CCR program (codified at 40 CFR part 257, subpart D), with the exception of the provisions specifically identified below for which the State is not seeking approval and for which the corresponding provisions of the Federal CCR program would remain in effect. For the approved provisions, EPA would retain its inspection and enforcement authorities under RCRA sections 3007 and 3008, 42 U.S.C. 6927 and 6928, consistent with EPA's ongoing oversight authority under RCRA. See 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(4)(B).

EPA has also engaged Federally recognized Tribes within the State of Wyoming in consultation and coordination regarding the program determination. EPA established opportunities for an informational session and consultation, beginning with EPA Region 8 sending a letter to the Eastern Shoshone Tribe at Wind River Reservation and the Northern Arapaho Tribe at Wind River Reservation. Tribal consultation has been and will continue to be conducted in accordance with the EPA policy on Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribes ( https://www.epa.gov/​sites/​production/​files/​2013-08/​documents/​cons-and-coord-with-indian-tribes-policy.pdf). Neither Tribe sought Tribal consultation.

B. Background

CCR are generated from the combustion of coal, including solid ( printed page 42349) fuels classified as anthracite, bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, and lignite, for the purpose of generating steam to power a generator to produce electricity or electricity and other thermal energy by electric utilities and independent power producers. CCR, commonly known as coal ash, include fly ash, bottom ash, boiler slag, and flue gas desulfurization materials. CCR can be sent offsite for disposal or beneficial use or disposed of in on-site landfills or surface impoundments. This section summarizes EPA's regulatory actions on CCR to date to provide relevant background on this proposed approval of Wyoming's partial CCR permit program.

On April 17, 2015, EPA published a final rule creating 40 CFR part 257, subpart D, which established a comprehensive set of minimum Federal requirements for the disposal of CCR in landfills and surface impoundments (80 FR 21302). The rule created a self-implementing program that regulates the location, design, operating criteria, and groundwater monitoring and corrective action for CCR units, as well as the closure and post-closure care of CCR units. It also requires recordkeeping and notifications for CCR units. EPA has since amended 40 CFR part 257, subpart D on August 5, 2016 (81 FR 51802), July 30, 2018 (83 FR 36435), August 28, 2020 (85 FR 53516), November 12, 2020 (85 FR 72506), May 8, 2024 (89 FR 38950), and November 8, 2024 (89 FR 88650). More information on these rules is provided in the Technical Support Document in the docket for this document.

C. Statutory Authority

EPA is issuing this proposed action pursuant to RCRA sections 4005(d) and 7004(b)(1). See 42 U.S.C. 6945(d) and 6974(b)(1). As amended by section 2301 of the 2016 WIIN Act, RCRA section 4005(d) instructs EPA to establish a Federal permit program similar to those under RCRA subtitle C and other environmental statutes and authorizes States to develop their own CCR permitting programs that go into effect in lieu of the Federal permit program upon approval by EPA. See 42 U.S.C. 6945(d).

Under RCRA section 4005(d)(1)(A), 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(A), States seeking approval of a State CCR program must submit to the Administrator “in such form as the Administrator may establish, evidence of a permit program or other system of prior approval and conditions under state law for regulation by the State of coal combustion residuals units that are located in the state.” The statute provides that EPA shall approve a State CCR permit program if the Administrator determines that the State program will require each CCR unit located in the State to achieve compliance with either: (1) The Federal CCR requirements at 40 CFR part 257, subpart D; or (2) Other State criteria that the Administrator, after consultation with the State, determines to be “at least as protective as” the Federal requirements. 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(B). The Administrator must make a final determination, after providing for public notice and an opportunity for public comment, within 180 days of receiving a State's complete submittal of the information specified in RCRA section 4005(d)(1)(A). 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(B). EPA may approve a State CCR permit program in whole or in part. Id. Once approved, the State permit program operates in lieu of the Federal requirements. 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(A). In a State with a partial program, only the State requirements that have been approved by EPA operate in lieu of the Federal requirements, and facilities remain responsible for compliance with all remaining Federal requirements in 40 CFR part 257.

As noted above, the Federal CCR regulations are self-implementing, meaning that CCR landfills and surface impoundments must comply with the terms of the regulations prior to obtaining a Federal permit or a permit issued by an approved State. Noncompliance with the Federal CCR regulations can be the subject of an enforcement action brought directly against the facility. Once a final CCR permit is issued by an approved State or pursuant to a Federal CCR permit program, however, the terms of the permit apply in lieu of the terms of the Federal CCR regulations and/or requirements in an approved State program, and RCRA section 4005(d)(3) provides a permit shield against direct enforcement of the applicable Federal or State CCR regulations (meaning the permit's terms become the enforceable requirements for the permittee).[ ]

RCRA section 7004(b), which applies to all RCRA programs, directs that “public participation in the development, revision, implementation, and enforcement of any . . . program under this chapter shall be provided for, encouraged, and assisted by the Administrator and the States.” 42 U.S.C. 6974(b)(1). Accordingly, EPA considers permitting requirements, requirements for compliance monitoring authority, requirements for enforcement authority, and requirements for intervention in civil enforcement proceedings in evaluating State CCR permit program applications.

Once a State CCR permit program is approved, the Administrator must review the approved program no less frequently than every 12 years, no later than three years after a revision to an applicable section of 40 CFR part 257, subpart D, and no later than one year after any unauthorized significant release from a CCR unit located in the State. EPA also must review an approved State CCR permit program at the request of another State alleging that the soil, groundwater, or surface water of the requesting State is or is likely to be adversely affected by a release from a CCR unit in the approved State. See 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(D)(i)(I) through (IV).

In a State with an approved State CCR permit program, EPA may commence administrative or judicial enforcement actions under RCRA section 3008, 42 U.S.C. 6928, if the State requests assistance or if EPA determines that an EPA enforcement action is likely to be necessary to ensure that a CCR unit is operating in accordance with the criteria of the State's permit program. 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(4). EPA can enforce any Federal requirements that remain in effect ( i.e., those for which there is no corresponding approved State provision). EPA may also exercise its inspection and information gathering authorities under RCRA section 3007 in a State with an approved program. 42 U.S.C. 6927.

III. The Wyoming Application

EPA began working with WDEQ in September 2019 as the State developed its application for the State's partial CCR permit program.[ ] As it has with other States, EPA discussed with WDEQ the process for EPA to review and approve the State's CCR permit program, WDEQ's anticipated timeline for submitting a CCR permit program application to EPA, and WDEQ's regulations for issuing permits. On February 6, 2023, WDEQ submitted its CCR permit program application to EPA Region 8 requesting approval of the State's partial CCR permit program.

EPA reviewed WDEQ's submission and, on March 27, 2023, sent a letter acknowledging receipt of the ( printed page 42350) application and clarifying the statutory 180-day review period for a final determination of adequacy.[ ] After reviewing the application in more detail, on December 5, 2023, EPA sent a letter stating that the formal review period had not yet begun; discussing further information that would strengthen the application; and discussing the State interpretation of the regulatory performance standards.[ ] On January 29, 2024, WDEQ sent a letter to EPA asserting that EPA's review period had expired, discussing the State's interpretation of the scope of EPA's review of the State CCR permit program application, and responding to EPA's questions from the December 2023 letter.[ ] After further discussions between EPA and WDEQ, on May 16, 2025, EPA sent to WDEQ additional clarification questions to supplement its application. On June 20, 2025, WDEQ responded to EPA's questions.[ ]

IV. EPA Analysis of the Wyoming Application

RCRA section 4005(d) requires EPA to evaluate two components of a State CCR permitting program to determine whether it meets the standard for approval: the program itself, and the technical criteria that will be included in each permit issued under the State program. This section discusses EPA's review of both requirements under RCRA section 4005(d) and the criteria EPA uses to conduct this review.

First, EPA must evaluate the permit program itself (or other system of prior approval and conditions). See 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(A) through (B). RCRA section 4005(d)(1)(A) directs the State to provide evidence of a State permit program's compliance with RCRA requirements in such form as determined by the Administrator. In turn, RCRA section 4005(d)(1)(B) directs EPA to approve the State program based upon a determination that the program “requires each coal combustion residuals unit located in the state to achieve compliance with the applicable [Federal or State] criteria.” In other words, the statute directs EPA to determine that the State has sufficient authority to require compliance at all CCR units located within the State. See also 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(D)(ii)(I). To make this determination, EPA evaluates the State's authority to issue permits and impose conditions in those permits, as well as the State's authority to conduct compliance monitoring and enforcement.

During this review of the State permit program, EPA also determines whether the program contains procedures consistent with the public participation directive in RCRA section 7004(b). RCRA section 7004(b), which applies to all RCRA programs, directs that “public participation in the development, revision, implementation, and enforcement of any . . . program under this chapter shall be provided for, encouraged, and assisted by the Administrator and the States.” 42 U.S.C. 6974(b)(1). To make this determination, EPA evaluates the State's public participation procedures for issuing permits and for intervention in civil enforcement proceedings.

Although 40 CFR part 239 applies to the approval of State Municipal Solid Waste Landfill (MSWLF) programs under RCRA section 4005(c)(1) rather than EPA's evaluation of CCR permit programs under RCRA section 4005(d), the specific criteria outlined in that regulation provide a helpful framework to examine the relevant aspects of a State's CCR permit program. States are familiar with these criteria because all States have MSWLF programs that have been approved pursuant to these regulations, and the regulations are generally regarded as protective and appropriate.

Consequently, EPA relied on the four categories of criteria outlined in 40 CFR part 239 as guidelines to evaluate the Wyoming CCR permit program: permitting requirements, requirements for compliance monitoring authority, requirements for enforcement authority, and requirements for intervention in civil enforcement proceedings.

Second, EPA must evaluate the technical criteria that will be included in each permit issued under the State CCR permit program to determine whether they are the same as the Federal criteria, or to the extent they differ, whether the modified criteria are “at least as protective as” the Federal requirements. See 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(B). Only if both components meet the statutory requirements may EPA approve the program. See 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1). EPA makes this determination by comparing the State's technical criteria to the corresponding Federal criteria and, where necessary, evaluating whether different State criteria are at least as protective as the Federal criteria.

Upon careful review, and as discussed in more detail below, EPA has preliminarily determined that Wyoming's partial CCR permit program includes all the elements of an adequate State CCR permit program. It also contains all the technical criteria in 40 CFR part 257, subpart D, except for the provisions specifically discussed below that Wyoming has not included in its partial CCR permit program. Consequently, EPA is proposing to approve the entirety of Wyoming's partial CCR permit program application. The State's CCR permit program does not encompass the full scope of Federal CCR requirements as presently constituted, and the provisions of the Federal CCR regulations that are not part of Wyoming's approved CCR permit program will remain directly applicable to affected CCR units. 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(B).

EPA's full analysis of the Wyoming CCR permit program, and how the Wyoming regulations differ from the Federal requirements, can be found in the Technical Support Document. EPA determined that the Wyoming CCR permit program application was complete and notified Wyoming of its determination by letter.[ ]

A. Adequacy of the Wyoming Permit Program

Section 4005(d)(1)(A) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(A), requires a State seeking State CCR permit program approval to submit to EPA, “in such form as the Administrator may establish, evidence of a permit program or other system of prior approval and conditions under State law for regulation by the State of coal combustion residuals units that are located in the State.” Although the statute directs EPA to establish the form of such evidence, the statute does not require EPA to promulgate regulations governing the process or standard for determining the adequacy of such State programs. EPA, therefore, developed the Coal Combustion Residuals State Permit Program Guidance Document; Interim Final (82 FR 38685, August 15, 2017) ( printed page 42351) (the “Guidance Document”). The Guidance Document provides recommendations on a process and standards that States may choose to use to apply for EPA approval of its CCR permit programs, based on the standards in RCRA section 4005(d), existing regulations at 40 CFR part 239, and the Agency's experience in reviewing and approving State programs.

EPA evaluated the Wyoming CCR permit program using the process and statutory and regulatory standards discussed in sections II.C. and IV.A. of this preamble. EPA's findings are summarized below and provided in more detail in the Technical Support Document located in the docket supporting this proposed determination.

1. Guidelines for Permitting

In EPA's judgment, an adequate State CCR permit program must ensure that: (1) Existing and new facilities are permitted or otherwise approved and in compliance with either 40 CFR part 257 or other State criteria; (2) The State has the authority to collect all information necessary to issue permits that are adequate to ensure compliance with relevant 40 CFR part 257, subpart D requirements; and (3) The State has the authority to impose requirements for CCR units adequate to ensure compliance with either 40 CFR part 257, subpart D, or such other State criteria that have been determined and approved by the Administrator to be at least as protective as 40 CFR part 257, subpart D.

The permitting process in Wyoming involves three entities: (1) WDEQ; (2) The Solid and Hazardous Waste Division (SHWD) within WDEQ; and (3) The Environmental Quality Council (Council), an independent body whose members are appointed by the Governor. For a more detailed description, see section 5.0 of the Narrative Statement.

a. Permit Required

All owners and operators of existing and new CCR facilities in Wyoming are required to comply with State CCR rules found at Wyoming Administrative Rules, Environmental Quality, Solid Waste Rules (SWR) chapter 18, and to obtain a permit in accordance with Wyoming Statutes (WS) section 35-11-502 and SWR chapters 1 and 18. Wyoming law requires every person who treats or transports solid waste or operates a solid waste management unit or facility, including CCR units, to have a valid permit issued by WDEQ. WS section 35-11-502(a); SWR chapter 1, section 1(c), chapter 18, section 4(a). Permit application requirements can be found in SWR chapter 1, section 2, and chapter 18, section 4(d).

b. Permitting Authority

WDEQ has the authority to collect all information necessary to issue permits that are adequate to ensure compliance with SWR chapter 18. WS section 35-11-109. In addition, SWR chapter 18, section 4(d) specifies the information that applicants for a solid waste permit, including a CCR unit permit, are required to submit to show compliance with the SWR.

c. Permit Requirements and Permitting Process

Existing CCR landfills must submit a permit renewal application no later than 12 months prior to the expiration date of the facility's existing solid waste permit. SWR chapter 18, section 4(d). Existing CCR surface impoundments must submit a new permit application within 12 months of the effective date of the State rule. Owners and operators of existing CCR landfills and surface impoundments that intend to cease disposal of all waste before obtaining a permit through the post-closure care period shall submit a closure permit application within 12 months prior to the expiration date of the facility's existing permit or the date the facility anticipates to cease disposal of CCR, whichever comes first. An alternate schedule to submit a new application, renewal application or closure permit application may be approved by the SHWD for good cause. SWR chapter 18, section 4(b).

Applications for renewal permits and closure permits are subject to the application procedures set forth in WS section 35-11-502 and SWR chapter 1, section 2(a), (b), and (c) and must follow the procedures and provisions of SWR chapter 1, section 2(d) and (e) respectively. CCR permits may be transferred from one operator to a new operator with written approval from WDEQ SHWD's Solid Waste Permitting and Corrective Action (SWPCA) Program Director (Director) in accordance with SWR chapter 1, section 3(d).

The permit duration for new or existing CCR surface impoundments and CCR landfills renewal permits will be for the operating life of the facility through post-closure, and closure permits will be issued for a period that includes the time required to complete closure activities and a minimum 30-year post-closure term. SWR chapter 18, section 4(c).

Within sixty days after a permit application has been submitted, WDEQ must notify the applicant whether or not the application is complete. WS section 35-11-502(e). Once WDEQ determines that an application is complete, WDEQ issues a letter of completeness and initiates a technical review of the permit application. At that time, the applicant must conduct a public notice and initiate a 30-day public comment period for the complete application, as described below. WS section 35-11-502(g), (h); SWR chapter 18, section 4. WDEQ must complete the technical review of the application within 90 days. During technical review of the application, WDEQ considers public comments submitted during the public comment period for the complete application. SWR chapter 18, section 2(c)(i)(C). Within WDEQ, the SHWD manages and implements the Wyoming CCR permit program. The SHWD may opt to conduct a public hearing on the application. SWR chapter 18 section 2(c)(i)(D).

Once the SHWD completes technical review of the application, it may make one of three determinations: (1) The permit application is technically inadequate; (2) The permit application is technically adequate, and a proposed permit is suitable for publication; or (3) The permit application is denied. WDEQ may modify, suspend, revoke, or deny a permit if: (1) Permit issuance would not meet the provisions of the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act, WS section 35-11-101 et seq. (the Act) or regulations; (2) The applicant fails to submit the required information; (3) The facility has a history of noncompliance; (4) The applicant indicates the facility would not comply with provisions of the regulations or misrepresents actual site conditions; (5) The applicant fails to employ a qualified solid waste manager; or (6) The applicant, or any partners, executive officers, or corporate directors has been found liable of violating environmental quality laws or criminal racketeering laws or regulations which constitute evidence that the applicant cannot be relied upon to conduct the operations described in the permit application in compliance with the Act or regulations. SWR chapter 1, section 4.

Provisions for amending permits for solid waste handling facilities are in SWR chapter 18, section 4(f). SWR chapter 18, section 3(c) specifies those changes to a permit that qualify as major amendments and which are minor amendments. Major amendments to permits may be requested by the Permittee and are reviewed and processed by the SHWD in accordance with the procedures for new or renewal permits described above. Minor amendments to permits may be completed through written notice and ( printed page 42352) approval by the SHWD within 60 days. SWR chapter 18, section 3(c). A written notice of a minor amendment to a permit can be determined to be deficient, approved, or denied. Permittees can provide additional information to the SHWD in response to any deficiency notice.

EPA has preliminarily determined that the Wyoming approach to CCR permit applications and approvals is adequate, and that this aspect of the Wyoming CCR permit program meets the standard for program approval.

2. Guidelines for Public Participation

Based on RCRA section 7004, 42 U.S.C. 6974, it is EPA's judgment that an adequate State CCR permit program will ensure that: (1) Documents for permit determinations are made available for public review and comment; (2) Final determinations on permit applications are made known to the public; and (3) Public comments on permit determinations are considered and significant comments are responded to in the permit record. EPA's review of Wyoming's CCR permit program indicates that the State has adopted public participation procedures that allow interested parties to talk openly and frankly about permit issues and search for mutually agreeable solutions to differences in views. An overview of Wyoming's public participation provisions is provided below.

a. Public Notice

The State program provides public notice in several ways and at several different stages of the permitting process, which taken together ensure that documents for permit determinations are subject to public review and comment. WDEQ requires State CCR permit applicants to provide notice to the public. Once WDEQ determines that an application is complete, WDEQ issues a letter of completeness and initiates a technical review of the permit application. At this time, the applicant must conduct a public notice and initiate a 30-day public comment period for the complete application. WS section 35-11-502(g), (h); SWR chapter 18, section 4. The public notice must provide specific information about the facility, including its proposed size and location; the types of waste to be managed; methods that will be used to manage the waste; and the operating life of the unit. WDEQ must complete technical review of the application within 90 days. During technical review of the application, WDEQ considers public comments submitted during the public comment period for the complete application. SWR chapter 18, section 2(c)(i)(C). The SHWD may opt to conduct a public hearing on the application. SWR chapter 18 section 2(c)(i)(D). Permit renewals are subject to the same public notice and comment requirements as new permit applications and are therefore subject to two, 30-day public comment periods with options to hold a public hearing for each.

b. Public Comment Period

All applicants for solid waste permits that submit a new, renewal, closure or major amendment permit application are required to complete two public comment periods during the permitting process. The first public comment period occurs after the SHWD deems the permit application complete, and the second occurs when the SHWD deems the permit application technically adequate and issues a proposed permit in accordance with WS section 35-11-502, SWR chapter 1, section 2(c), and SWR chapter 18 section 4(f). Public notice for the complete application and for the proposed permit must contain information about the permit application including the applicant; the proposed facility location and size; the waste types intended for management; the method of waste management; and the operating life of the unit. Public notices must also contain information on how to obtain special assistance or alternate formats of a notice for individuals with disabilities and inform the reader to visit WDEQ's website for a Spanish translation.

The applicant is required to publish each written notice once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation within the county where the applicant plans to locate the facility or where an existing facility is currently located, for each public comment period. WS section 35-11-502 (g through k) and SWR chapter 18 section 2. Each public comment period begins on the first day of the notice publication and continues until 30 days after the second publication. The applicant is required to give written notice of the permit application to landowners with property located within one-half mile of the site, the mayor of each city or town within 50 miles of the site, the Local County Commission, any solid waste district located in the county, and the Solid Waste Permitting and Corrective Action Program Interested Parties Mailing List (hard copy). The written notice is also posted to WDEQ's Public Notice website.

Permit applications and review documents are available for public review at any WDEQ office and can be sent digitally upon request. Specific information on how to request access to permit documents is found in Wyoming's CCR permit program narrative Section 7.0 Public Participation (Page 14), Appendix G Public Notice Templates, SWR chapter 1 section 2(c), and WS section 35-11-502. Additionally, the public can contact the WDEQ and request to be added to a listserv or mailing list (Interested Parties Mailing List). Written comments on permit applications are accepted by mail, fax, and through WDEQ's digital comment portal. If a commenter has technical difficulties with the digital comment portal, the portal website has instructions for obtaining assistance.

Public comments received by WDEQ during the first public comment period for the complete application are considered by WDEQ in drafting a proposed permit. If substantial written comments, including objections to a proposed permit, are filed during the public comment period for the proposed permit, a public hearing shall be held by the Council within twenty days after the end of the public comment period. WS section 35-11-502(k). The Director shall render a decision on the proposed permit within 30 days after completion of the public comment period if no hearing is requested. If a hearing is held, the Director will issue or deny the permit no later than 15 days from receipt of any findings of fact and decision of the Council. WS section 35-11-502(k) and (m).

All comments received are considered and WDEQ provides a response to each commenter prior to making a final permit determination. In addition to providing responses to individual commenters, all files in WDEQ are available for the public to review unless they are found to be confidential under WS section 35-11-1101 or otherwise protected under the Wyoming Public Records Act. The public can submit a record request using the WDEQ website. The public can also request to view documents at any of WDEQ's offices.

Final permit determinations are required to be added to the owner or operator's CCR website within five days of the owner or operator's receipt of the determination. SWR chapter 18, section 11(c)(i). Documents produced and distributed as part of the permitting process are maintained by WDEQ as a public record in accordance with Wyoming Public Records Act and must be made available to the public accordingly. Public comments are subject to the Wyoming Public Records Act and maintained by WDEQ. ( printed page 42353)

c. Challenges to Permit Decisions

In accordance with WS section 35-11-502(k), any interested person has the right to file written objections to the proposed permit with the Director within 30 days after the last publication of the written notice given for the proposed permit. If substantial written objections are filed, the Wyoming Environmental Council (Council) holds a public hearing. WS section 35-11-502(k). To notify the public of a pending hearing, the Council must publish written notice of the time, date, and location of the public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the facility would be located once a week for two consecutive weeks immediately prior to the hearing. The public hearing is to be conducted as a contested case under the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act (WY APA). WS 16-3-107 through 16-3-112. Judicial review can be obtained pursuant to the WY APA. WS 16-3-114.

If a public hearing is held, the Council shall issue findings of fact and a decision on the proposed permit within 30 days afterward. WDEQ shall issue or deny the permit within 15 days after receiving findings of fact and decision of the Council. WS section 35-11-502(m)

WS section 35-11-1001 provides that any aggrieved party under the Act may obtain judicial review by filing a petition for review within 30 days after entry of the order or other final action complained of pursuant to the provisions of the WY APA. Any interested person has the right to file written objections to a proposed permit with the Director within 30 days after the last publication of the public notice for the public comment period for the permit. If substantial written objections are filed, a public hearing shall be held by the Council. WS section 35-11-112 charges the Council to act as the hearing examiner for WDEQ in any case contesting the grant, denial, suspension, revocation or renewal of any permit required by the Act. The hearing shall be conducted as a contested case in accordance with WY APA, WS sections 16-3-101 et seq.

The WY APA provides that any person aggrieved or adversely affected in fact by a final decision of an agency in a contested case, or by any other agency action or inaction, is entitled to judicial review. WS section 16-3-114.

EPA has preliminarily determined that the Wyoming approach to public participation requirements provides adequate opportunities for public participation in the permitting process sufficient to meet the standard for program approval. The provisions described above meet the three criteria listed at the beginning of this section by providing several means by which documents for draft and final permit determinations are made available for public review and comment, as well as ensuring that public comments on permit determinations are considered and significant comments are responded to in the permit record.

3. Guidelines for Compliance Monitoring Authority

An adequate permit program must provide the State with the authority to gather information about compliance, perform inspections, and ensure that the information it gathers is suitable for enforcement. WDEQ has authority under WS section 35-11-109 to obtain any necessary documents and to conduct monitoring and testing to determine if an owner or operator of a CCR unit is in compliance with the permit and applicable regulations.

The Director or designated officers, employees, or representatives of WDEQ are also granted the authority under WS section 35-11-109 to conduct inspections of facilities, to inspect and copy any records, and to inspect any monitoring equipment or method of operation required to be maintained pursuant to the Act. Further, the application for a CCR unit includes an access agreement authorizing WDEQ to enter an operator's premises where a regulated facility or activity is located or conducted, or where records are kept, to perform inspections and to collect data for the purposes of ensuring compliance or as otherwise authorized by the appropriate rules and regulations of WDEQ. No permit shall be issued unless the owner of the facility provides the written authorization. SWR chapter 1, section 1(g).

In addition, the information that WDEQ collects or obtains during inspections, compliance monitoring, and enforcement, allows the State to verify the accuracy of information submitted by owners or operators of CCR units; verify the adequacy of methods (including sampling) used by owners or operators in developing that information; and produce evidence admissible in an enforcement proceeding. WS section 35-11-109.

Accordingly, EPA has preliminarily determined that these compliance monitoring authorities are adequate, and that this aspect of the Wyoming CCR permit program meets the standard for program approval.

4. Guidelines for Enforcement Authority

An adequate State CCR permit program must provide the State with adequate enforcement authority to administer its State CCR permit program, including the authority to: (1) Restrain any person from engaging in activity which may damage human health or the environment, (2) Sue to enjoin prohibited activity, and (3) Sue to recover civil penalties for prohibited activity.

WS section 35-11-701 authorizes the Director to issue an order requiring the cessation and desistance of violations of the Act, rules, regulations, standards, permits, licenses or variances under the Act. In addition, if the Director has evidence that any pollution source presents an immediate and substantial danger to human or environmental health or safety, the Director may institute, through the Wyoming Attorney General, a civil action for immediate injunctive relief to halt any activity causing the danger. WS section 35-11-115(a). Further, WS section 35-11-109(a)(i) grants WDEQ wide-ranging authority to perform acts necessary to enforce the provisions of the Act and any rules, regulations, orders, or permits established or issued thereunder, and WS section 35-11-109(a)(vii) grants the Director wide latitude to prepare and present enforcement cases before the Council for violations of the Act or regulations promulgated under the Act. When compliance with the Act or the regulations applicable to CCR units, SWR chapter 18, is not achieved, WDEQ is authorized under the Act to engage in voluntary stipulated settlement or to initiate a civil enforcement action in Wyoming District Court.

Finally, under WS section 35-11-901(a), the Director can bring an administrative action for the assessment of civil penalties in Wyoming District Court against any person who violates, or any director, officer or agent of a corporate permittee who willfully and knowingly authorizes, orders or carries out the violation of any provision of the Act, or any rule, regulation, standard, or permit adopted thereunder or who violates any determination or order of the Council pursuant to the Act or any rule, regulation, standard, permit, license, or variance. Such violations are subject to a penalty not to exceed $10,000.00 for each violation for each day during which a violation continues; a temporary or permanent injunction; or both a penalty and an injunction. WS section 35-11-901(a).

Based on the foregoing, EPA has preliminarily determined that this aspect of the Wyoming CCR permit ( printed page 42354) program meets the standard for program approval.

5. Intervention in Civil Enforcement Proceedings

Based on RCRA section 7004, an adequate CCR State permit program must provide an opportunity for citizen intervention in civil enforcement proceedings. Specifically, the State must either: (1) Provide for citizen intervention as a matter of right; or (2) Have in place a process to: (a) Provide notice and opportunity for public involvement in civil enforcement actions, (b) Investigate and provide responses to citizen complaints about violations, and (c) Not oppose citizen intervention when permissive intervention is allowed by statute, rule, or regulation.

WS section 35-11-904(c)(ii) provides that any person may intervene as a matter of right when WDEQ, through the attorney general, has commenced a civil action to require compliance with the provisions of the Act, or any rule, regulation, order or permit issued pursuant to the Act. Additionally, WDEQ has the authority under WS 35-11-701(a) to investigate citizen complaints concerning violations.

Inasmuch as the State explicitly provides for citizen intervention in civil enforcement proceedings as a matter of right, EPA has preliminarily determined that these authorities provide for an adequate level of citizen involvement in the enforcement process, and that this aspect of the Wyoming CCR permit program meets the standard for program approval.

B. Adequacy of Technical Criteria

EPA conducted an analysis of the Wyoming CCR permit program application, including a thorough analysis of Wyoming statutory authorities for the CCR program, as well as its regulations at Solid Waste Rules chapter 18: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals in Landfills and Surface Impoundments. As noted above, Wyoming has requested approval of a partial CCR permit program.

1. Wyoming CCR Units and Resources

WDEQ has identified 19 disposal units that are currently or have been used for disposal of CCR wastes (3 landfills and 16 surface impoundments) at 4 facilities in Wyoming.[ ] WDEQ has demonstrated that it has the personnel to administer a permit program that is at least as protective as the Federal requirements.[ ] The WDEQ SHWD is the lead program for permitting, compliance, and enforcement of CCR units. The WDEQ CCR Program is funded through the State budget process. The WDEQ budget is approved by the Wyoming State Legislature as identified in the Wyoming State Budget. In addition, WDEQ applied for EPA State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG) funding for Fiscal Years 2021 through 2023. In total, WDEQ has received $571,396 in funding to develop its CCR permit program. If EPA receives future appropriations, WDEQ can continue to apply for funds for implementation of its CCR permit program. EPA has preliminarily determined that the WDEQ staffing and funding are adequate for WDEQ to administer the CCR permit program.

2. Wyoming CCR Regulations

EPA has preliminarily determined that the portions of the Wyoming CCR permit program that were submitted for approval meet the standard for approval under RCRA section 4005(d)(1)(B)(i), 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(B)(i). To make this preliminary determination, EPA compared the technical requirements in the Wyoming CCR regulations at SWR chapter 18 to the Federal CCR regulations at 40 CFR part 257 to determine whether they differed from the Federal requirements, and if so, whether those differences met the standard in RCRA sections 4005(d)(1)(B)(ii) and (C), 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(B)(ii) and (C).

WDEQ previously regulated CCR in landfills under the SWR starting in 1990. Under the Wyoming Water Quality Rules promulgated in 1975, Wyoming began regulating CCR surface impoundments. WDEQ incorporated by reference the Federal CCR regulations, promulgated through December 14, 2020, with the addition of those portions of the Act (appendix A of the application) and SWR (appendix B of the application) that were more stringent. This includes additional definitions, general facility information, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring, and requirements for co-disposing of other waste streams, which are described further in section V. of the TSD. WDEQ amended the regulations to adopt EPA amendments through December 14, 2020, and chapter 18 became effective on August 19, 2022.

3. Wyoming Partial Program

WDEQ is seeking approval of its partial State CCR permit program pursuant to RCRA section 4005(d). The WDEQ's rules adopt the Federal CCR regulations promulgated through December 14, 2020. Wyoming is not seeking approval for the following four requirements of the Federal CCR regulations and, therefore, those requirements in the Federal CCR regulations will continue to apply directly to each regulated CCR unit in Wyoming:

1. Amendments made in the Legacy CCR Surface Impoundments and CCR Management Units Final Rule.[ ] This includes 40 CFR 257.50(e), which WDEQ has not yet adopted.

2. 40 CFR 257.73(a)(4), 257.73(d)(1)(iv), 257.74(a)(4), and 257.74(d)(1)(iv) for vegetative cover for slope stability;

3. 40 CFR 257.90(g) for suspension of groundwater monitoring; and

4. 40 CFR 257.95(h)(2) for groundwater protection standards for constituents in appendix IV having no Maximum Contaminant Levels.

With the exception of these four items, EPA has preliminarily determined that the Wyoming CCR regulations contain all of the technical elements of the Federal CCR regulations, including requirements for location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure requirements and post-closure care, recordkeeping, notification, and CCR website posting requirements. The Wyoming CCR permit program also contains State-specific language, references, definitions, and State-specific requirements that differ from the Federal CCR regulations, but which EPA has determined to be “at least as protective as” the Federal criteria. These State-specific requirements are also discussed further in sections III.1. and V. of the Technical Support Document.

The effect of approving a State CCR permit program is that, except for the provisions for which EPA has not granted approval, the Wyoming CCR permit program will apply in lieu of the Federal CCR regulations. For the State provisions that will not be approved upon finalization, the corresponding Federal requirements will continue to apply directly to facilities, and therefore facilities must comply with both the ( printed page 42355) Federal requirements and the State requirements.

V. Wyoming CCR Permits

In accordance with the Wyoming SWR, chapter 18, section 4(a), all CCR units must be permitted in accordance with chapter 18. WDEQ has not issued any SWR chapter 18 CCR permits in the State. In accordance with the SWR, chapter 18, section 4(b), existing CCR landfills and surface impoundments must submit an operating or closure permit application under chapter 18 under certain timeframes unless an alternate schedule is approved by the SHWD for good cause. New CCR units must obtain a permit under chapter 18 prior to construction.

Since WDEQ has not issued permits under the chapter 18 regulations, no Wyoming permits are part of the permit program record under review. In accordance with RCRA sections 4005(d)(3)(A) and 4005(d)(6), in the absence of a permit issued under an approved State program, the owner or operator of a CCR unit must continue to comply with the Federal CCR regulations until a permit from an approved State is issued. 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(3)(A), (d)(6). Any permits issued after approval will be subject to program review provisions required by RCRA sections 4005(d)(1)(D)(i) and 4005(d)(1)(D)(ii). 42 U.S.C. 6945(d)(1)(D)(i), (ii).

VI. Proposed Action

The governor signed a law the following year authorizing the energy commission to penalize oil companies for excessive profits.
The law also required oil companies to report more data on their operations to the state.
Newsom’s office thanked the energy commission for voting to postpone implementing a penalty, saying it was a “prudent step” toward stabilizing the oil market.
Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California energy regulators Friday put the brakes on plans requiring oil companies to pay a penalty if their profits climb too high, a temporary win for the fossil fuel industry two years after the governor declared the state had “finally beat big oil.”

The postponement by the California Energy Commission until 2030 comes after two oil refineries accounting for roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity announced their plans to close in the coming months. The commission has the power to implement a penalty but has not done so since it was given that authority in 2023.

The penalty was considered a landmark piece of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s government and the state’s ambitious goals to curb climate change. The state faces challenges in its efforts to take on the oil industry while ensuring a stable and affordable fuel supply. His administration is also proposing to temporarily streamline approvals of new oil wells in existing oil fields in an effort to maintain a stable fuel supply.

Siva Gunda, the commission’s vice chair, said the state is not “walking back” its efforts to wean itself off fossil fuels but must prioritize protecting consumers at the gas pump.

“I personally truly believe that this pause will be beneficial to ensure that this mid-transition is smooth,” he said.

The commission still plans to set rules that would require oil refineries to keep a minimum level of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when refineries go offline for maintenance.

Jamie Court, the president of Consumer Watchdog who supported the law, said the energy commission’s vote is “basically a giveaway to the industry.”

“I’m really disheartened and disgusted by Newsom,” he said. “I feel like this is just a total about-face. And in the end it’s going to result in greater price spikes.”

But the Western States Petroleum Association recommended that the state postpone a penalty for 20 years.

“While today’s action by the CEC stopped short of a full statutory repeal or a 20-year pause, it represents a needed step to provide some certainty for California’s fuels market,” CEO Catherine Reheis-Boyd said in a statement. “The vote demonstrates the CEC’s understanding that imposing this failed policy would have likely exacerbated investment concerns contributing to California’s recent refinery closures.”

In 2022, Newsom called the Legislature into a special session to pass a law aimed at holding oil companies accountable for making too much money after a summer of record-high gas prices in California. The governor signed a law the following year authorizing the energy commission to penalize oil companies for excessive profits.

The law also required oil companies to report more data on their operations to the state. It created an independent division at the commission to oversee the oil and gas industry and provide guidance to the state on its energy transition.

Newsom’s office thanked the energy commission for voting to postpone implementing a penalty, saying it was a “prudent step” toward stabilizing the oil market.

“When Governor Newsom signed this legislation two years ago, he promised that we would utilize the new transparency tools to look under the hood of our oil and gas market that had been a black box for decades,” spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said in a statement. “We did exactly that.”

Julia Stein, deputy director of a climate institute at UCLA School of Law, said state officials are still intent on advancing their efforts to transition away from fossil fuels.

“But I think there is also a sense at the state level that we’re entering a different phase of the transition where some of these problems are going to be presented more acutely,” she said. “And folks are kind of now trying to understand how they’re going to approach that in real time.”

California has the highest gas prices in the nation, largely due to taxes and environmental regulations. Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.

The commission has not determined what would count as an excessive profit under the policy.

Setting a penalty could be risky for the state because it could unintentionally discourage production and drive prices up, said Severin Borenstein, an economist and public policy professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

“It’s pretty clear they are shifting towards more focus on affordability and recognition that the high prices in California may not be associated with the actual refinery operations,” he said of state officials.",https://www.counton2.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/08/68b2129730e247.69368693.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-30 12:06:20.605618

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement.

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It’s the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

The cut includes $39.3 million for the Fairwinds Landing offshore wind and maritime logistics hub at the former Lambert’s Point Docks in Norfolk and another $20 million for improvements at Portsmouth Marine Terminal, which is a staging area for Dominion Energy’s under-construction wind farm off the shore of Virginia Beach.

Democratic leaders spoke out against the funding withdrawal on Friday. U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, representing Virginia, and U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, representing Hampton Roads, jointly emailed a statement on Friday that said the money was also intended to invest in maritime supply chains and port infrastructure to support not only clean energy but also shipbuilding and repair, and that they would work with their colleagues, state officials and other partners in the region to urge the Trump administration to reverse its decision.

“Stopping this project makes no sense, hurts our economy, and is completely counterproductive to the Administration’s so-called efforts to ‘restore America’s maritime dominance,'” they said.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states’ climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans’ livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

Here’s a price comparison between EVs and hybrids, according to ChatGPT.

Purchase Price

The biggest car expense is its initial purchase price. ChatGPT pointed out that hybrids are generally cheaper to buy. The difference in price is largely due to battery costs, which make up almost a third of the price of a new EV, according to the Stanford Report.

Data from Kelley Blue Book shows that the cheapest starting price for an EV is $26,795, while hybrids start at $21,900.

Be Aware: I Asked ChatGPT Which Hybrid Vehicles To Stay Away From Buying: Here’s What It Said

Fuel and Energy Costs

EVs offer much lower fuel costs compared with hybrids, ChatGPT said. A hybrid combines a gas engine with an electric motor and a small battery, while electric-only vehicles rely solely on a larger battery and an electric motor.

According to Consumer Reports, the annual fuel cost for a hybrid is $300 to $800 less than that of a gas-only car, while EV owners pay about $1,300 less. Based on this data, EV owners pay roughly $500 to $1,000 less per year on fuel compared with hybrid drivers.

Maintenance

ChatGPT pointed out that EVs usually have lower maintenance costs due to fewer moving parts. EVs don’t need oil changes, but they do need brake pad replacements, although not as often due to regenerative braking. The highest maintenance cost is the battery; however, many manufacturers provide a warranty for the first eight years or 100,000 miles, CarEdge reported.

On the other hand, hybrids still have internal combustion components, so you’ll still need regular oil changes and part replacements on roughly the same maintenance schedule as gas-powered cars.

On a per-mile basis, EV maintenance and repairs are typically 40% lower than comparable gas vehicles, reported the National Resources Defense Council.

Incentives and Tax Credits

According to the IRS, buyers of new EVs can currently get up to $7,500 in federal tax credits, while used models may be eligible for $4,000. This also applies to plug-in hybrids. Standard hybrids do not qualify for the tax credit.

These tax credits can improve EV affordability, but they’re set to expire on Sept. 30, 2025, under President Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Vnl3dPwxH6znN192dtBfBw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/gobankingrates_644/a599228de6616a2733d6c7be1b4589e2,N,,2025-08-30 11:00:50.295652

“It’s very uneasy not knowing who’s going to take over the lease,” Leonard said.","Homeowners who signed long-term lease agreements with solar panel installer PosiGen are searching for answers after the Louisiana-based company laid off hundreds of workers and ceased most of its operations.

PosiGen, which has offices in seven states and is Louisiana’s largest solar company, notified state and local officials on Monday that it was laying off 166 employees at its facilities in Jefferson and St. Charles parishes, saying it defaulted on a credit line and couldn't raise the long-term capital it needed amid rollbacks in federal renewable energy tax credits.

The news came as a shock to Iwona Leonard, who recently signed a 20-year lease agreement with PosiGen and had solar panels installed on the roof of her double in the Lower Garden District just last week.

Leonard said the person she reached on PosiGen’s customer service hotline told her they were “waiting for more information from the higher ups” on what the restructuring meant for customers.

“I’m very nervous,” Leonard said.

PosiGen's founder and executive chairman, Tom Neyhart, did not respond to calls, texts and emails. Messages left with contacts listed in the company’s state filings were also not returned.

Founded in 2011, PosiGen specializes in marketing solar energy systems to low- to moderate-income households and rode a wave of state and federal solar credits that allowed it to grow quickly for much of the past decade.

But it said its ability to secure new investments, which were needed to fund recent expansions, were hampered by the passage in July of President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, which cancels certain renewable energy tax credits starting next year.

In early August, the Trump administration also terminated $7 billion in grants aimed at expanding access to solar energy for disadvantaged communities. Louisiana was awarded $156 million through the Solar for All program last year but was still waiting for federal approval of its workplan.

According to a letter to employees from CEO Peter Shaper that was obtained by trade publication Solar Power World, PosiGen wasn't able to obtain enough financing to continue operating and would ""dramatically reduce"" the size of its workforce.

Jeff Cantin, who is the CEO of another New Orleans panel installer, Solar Alternatives, and also serves as board president of the Gulf States Renewable Energy Industries Association, said some companies were preparing for the roll out of the federal grant program. PosiGen, he said, may have been left in a bind when it was canceled.

“The government created a program, announced it, started rolling it out, asked businesses to scale up for it and then pulled the rug out from under it,” said Cantin. “It’s fine if the administration wants to change priorities, but they need to acknowledge that businesses have responded to the government and need time to adapt.”

Under her contract with PosiGen, Leonard agreed to pay $60 per month each for two sets of solar panels, with no upfront cost and payments increasing $1 a year for the next 20 years.

In return, Leonard would be able to use the power generated to offset her electricity bill, which she said can sometimes cost as much as $600 per month. Entergy New Orleans also credits residents with rooftop solar for the excess power they produce for the grid.

Leonard is still waiting for Entergy and the city of New Orleans to inspect the panels. After that, PosiGen said it would turn them on remotely and begin sending her a monthly bill.

It’s unclear what comes next for PosiGen. The company told state officials that an additional 92 employees in Louisiana could be laid off in the next two weeks if it can't find additional funding or a way to sell what remains of its business.

The bill's removal of incentives is expected to slow EV sales growth and increase reliance on manufacturer discounts and deals.

Building a domestic battery supply chain and expanding charging infrastructure are key challenges for the EV industry's future.

“I know he’d give me a discount,” said President Donald Trump moments before buying an $80,000 red Tesla from Elon Musk at the White House lawn on March 11. “But I want to pay full price.”

And full price, he decreed, is what everyone shall pay. Enacted July 4, Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act ends federal tax credits for electric vehicles (EVs) by the end of September and tax breaks for American battery manufacturers in 2030. And the uncertainty has already caused the industry to lose steam.

More clean energy projects were cancelled in the first quarter of 2025 than the past two years combined, according to research group Atlas Public Policy. Since January, these cancellations and downsized projects have amounted to roughly $14 billion in abandoned investments, including a $1 billion factory planned to produce thermal barriers for batteries in Statesboro, Georgia.

As for what these setbacks mean for a state that rolled out a red carpet worth billions of dollars in tax breaks for EV manufacturing plants, intended to become the Gov. Brian Kemp-proclaimed “electric vehicle capital of America” by the end of his second term, industry leaders seem reluctant to show signs of defeat.

In EV press conferences and roadshows across Georgia this month, public officials and manufacturers brushed aside Washington’s setbacks and boasted the industry’s growth, which they claim is headed towards an independent supply chain that will rely less on federal crutches.

“The tax credits played a purpose, but that purpose may be over,” said Georgia Public Service Commissioner Tim Echols in an interview. “We may not need a subsidy in the future.”

But Georgia's EV independence will likely rely on the success of bringing the moving parts closer to home.

“We must develop an American critical mineral supply chain,” said nonprofit Electrification Coalition Policy Manager Skye Golann in the opening speech of an Aug. 7 press briefing, How EV Investments Are Powering Prosperity in Georgia.

One Big Beautiful Bill Act expected to slow EV growth

The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in August 2022 provided tax credits, subsidies and incentives for the purchasing and manufacturing of EVs and their charging facilities.

Since then, “investments in batteries, fueling equipment, and critical minerals refining and processing have each grown at least three-fold,” according to a 2024 report by the Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Many of Georgia's own plants have been propped up by federal aid. In 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy granted $178 million for the construction of Solvay Specialty Polymers' battery-grade polyvinylidene fluoride facility in Augusta. Last year, the DOE awarded $80 million to Fort Valley-based Blue Bird for its electric school bus manufacturing and workforce development.

And Georgia appears to have played its hand right.

“The last few years is where we've really started to see [EV purchases] tick up” in the U.S., said Cox Automotive Director of Industry Insights Stephanie Streaty — a growth also spurred by an IRA credit offering a $7,500 discount for a new EV and $4,000 or 30% for a used EV. Last year ""was a record year of 1.3 million EVs” sold, she added.

EVs are cheaper than ever, said Echols. The Georgia Clean Energy Roadshow he hosted at Savannah Technical College on Aug. 12 featured over 60 vehicles, including one of the City of Savannah's Nissan Leafs, starting at about $30,000. When Echols first began the roadshow 15 years ago, only the Tesla Roadster was on display, worth more than $100,000 at the time.

But the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will remove those incentives that undercut EV prices, already too expensive for many consumers. This year, the average EV transaction was $10,000 more expensive compared to a gas vehicle, according to Cox Automotive data.

“The biggest barrier still is price,” said Streaty.

Before the passing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Cox Automotive predicted that EVs would make up 10% of all cars sold for 2025, up 2% from last year. But now, “you have tariffs, you have interest rates, all these headwinds, and so we adjusted that to 8.5%,” said Streaty.

“Taking away the federal tax credits will dampen some of the growth,” said Golann in an interview. “I certainly think that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a setback for EVs.”

Battery boom... or bust

But the biggest bet for EV stakeholders is likely the battery itself.

Lithium-ion batteries — notoriously expensive to mine, process and transport — could make up 40% the cost of the car, said Streaty. China still dominates the battery's mineral processing, Golan admitted in an interview. But “we've seen new mines, whether in North Carolina or Nevada... what we like to see is developing those supply chains in the U.S.” The U.S. is home to just 1% of the world’s lithium reserves, according to the World Economic Forum.

General Motors has already began building out its American operations, including in Georgia. On Aug. 6, GM announced plans to co-manufacture six EV models with Hyundai, including an electric van for the North American market. A day later, it inked a deal to import Chinese batteries that will “function as a stopgap"" until it can build its own lithium batteries at lower cost in the U.S., according to the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network.

About half of Kia’s manufacturing for EV and gas vehicles remains overseas, said Kia's Head of Department Corporate Services and Information Technology Ted Arnold. But Hyundai, a parent company of Kia, is in the process of ""bringing those suppliers locally so that we don't have to import,"" he added.

“We're definitely going to see the battery supply chain start to build out in the U.S.,” echoed Streaty.

But time is ticking before the One Big Beautiful Bill Act ends the 45X tax credit for U.S. battery manufacturers in five years — a move that will cede growth to other countries, such as China, Mexico, Canada and members of the European Union, according to think tank Energy Innovation.

And many of Georgia's battery manufacturing prospects have already abandoned ship earlier this year.

In January, Norway-based Freyr Battery called off of a battery manufacturing plant in Newnan, it stated in a letter to Coweta County. In February, Aspen Aerogels told investors it halted construction of its second plant manufacturing thermal barriers for EV batteries in Statesboro, and will instead increase production in China, Latitude Media reported. In March, Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America President José Muñoz announced an expansion focused on hybrid vehicles at its grand opening, a diversion from its expected all-electric operations.

While this year may end up being the beginning of a bad run, many EV proponents like Streaty are still all-in and holding onto hope that manufacturers will take advantage of the tax break before it ends.

""The IRA 45x reduction credit doesn't sunset until 2030, so I think that's a glimmer of light,"" said Streaty.

Manufacturers respond to Trump’s actions with... their own art of the deal

The road will be long for EV manufacturers to plant manufacturing more firmly in American soil.

Domestic and statewide supply chain growth ""will take some time,” said Golann. And in the meantime, manufacturers themselves will likely have to push their own deals to make up for today’s price differences. Although Trump can snub a discount for an EV, the average consumer might rely on it.

“Now that the IRA is going away, dealers are really getting aggressive,” said Streaty. Expect more rebates, deals and discounts. Manufacturers have “already spent the money to build the assembly lines and the factories,” said Echols “They're going to want to put incentives on those cars.”

But at some point, EVs “need to be able to sell on their own,"" said Streaty — without the constant incentives.

Now, a team of climate communication experts – including many members of the former climate.gov team – is working to resurrect its content into a new organization with an expanded mission.
“The things that were most popular on climate.gov were things that basically just taught people about climate, both natural climate and climate change,” said Lindsey.
“By carrying on the legacy of climate.gov and actually trying to republish the most vital parts of climate.gov, we hope that we can be a cornerstone,” said Lindsey.
And climate science is the only way to understand and adapt to what is happening on our big beautiful planet.”","Earlier this summer, access to climate.gov – one of the most widely used portals of climate information on the internet – was thwarted by the Trump administration, and its production team was fired in the process.

The website offered years’ worth of accessibly written material on climate science. The site is technically still online but has been intentionally buried by the team of political appointees who now run the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Now, a team of climate communication experts – including many members of the former climate.gov team – is working to resurrect its content into a new organization with an expanded mission.

Their effort’s new website, climate.us, would not only offer public-facing interpretations of climate science, but could also begin to directly offer climate-related services, such as assisting local governments with mapping increased flooding risk due to climate change.

The effort is being led by climate.gov’s former managing editor, Rebecca Lindsey, who, although now unemployed, has recruited several of her former colleagues to volunteer their time in an attempt to build climate.us into a thriving non-profit organization.

“A lot of federal employees are grieving over the sense that they’ve not just lost a job, but a vocation,” said Lindsey. “None of us were ready to let go of climate.gov and the mission.”

In the first few weeks after the Trump administration ended their work, Lindsey’s new team has received a steady flow of outside support, including legal support, and a short-term grant that has helped them develop a vision for what they’d like to do next.

“The things that were most popular on climate.gov were things that basically just taught people about climate, both natural climate and climate change,” said Lindsey. “There is a need for content that helps people achieve basic climate literacy independent of an agency.”

As multi-year veterans of the federal bureaucracy, at times they’ve been surprised by the possibilities that the new effort might offer.

“We’re allowed to use TikTok now,” said Lindsey. “We’re allowed to have a little bit of fun. We have a group chat. We’re diving into things that are not part of our wheelhouse.”

The climate.us team is also in the process of soft-launching a crowdsourced fundraising drive that Lindsey hopes they can leverage into more permanent support from a major foundation. Lindsey also set up an email address to contact the team to offer in-kind support.

“Someone bought our domain name for us. And we have somebody that’s volunteered web hosting space for this phase. But we do not yet have the sort of large operational funding that we will need if we’re going to actually transition climate.gov operations to the nonprofit space.”

In the meantime, Lindsey and her team have found themselves spending the summer knee-deep in the logistics of building a major non-profit from scratch.

“We’ve all had to let go of the 9-5 mentality and basically try to do things as quickly as possible,” said one member of Lindsey’s new team who previously worked with her at climate.gov but asked not to be named for fear of retribution.

“By carrying on the legacy of climate.gov and actually trying to republish the most vital parts of climate.gov, we hope that we can be a cornerstone,” said Lindsey. “We hope that it will provide a critical mass that will attract other partners who want to be part of the effort.”

Given the context of why Lindsey is doing this work at this time and in this way, it has been an emotional summer. The effort has the sheen of equal parts science journalism and a cathartic personal vendetta against an administration that has all but declared war on federal science efforts.

“We’ve been optimistic and alternating between being energized and feeling like this is a good thing and we’re on the right path and then, of course, being terrified that we’re not going to be able to pull it off and six months is going to have passed and we all should have been looking for new jobs and we didn’t,” said Lindsey.

“What’s happening can feel so overwhelming that it’s easy to feel like you’re powerless to do anything about it,” said Lindsey’s team member. “But sometimes you have to just look out and see what’s within your reach. And this problem is within our reach, so we just see it as sort of doing our part.”

Lindsey also told the Guardian that all the content for climate.gov is still up if you know where to look, which when she found that out, made her even more upset.

“This is information that the taxpayers have already paid for,” said Lindsey. “This administration is trying to hide it and take it away from us. It’s an abuse of government. It’s a waste of resources. People should be indignant. That’s not the way the government should work.”

“I think it’s important for this initiative to persist even past this crowdfunding phase,” said another part-time contributor to the project, who wished to remain anonymous because they are still an employee of the federal government.

“Whether people realize it or not, climate change impacts everyone, regardless of the current political environment. And climate science is the only way to understand and adapt to what is happening on our big beautiful planet.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f255e59b1df9494d2bf782873fac2de0e22a1656/443_0_4465_3572/master/4465.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cc3faab5a281ae982355cfdd298c7c48",N,,2025-08-30 08:00:13.328176

“The stop-work order for Revolution Wind emphasizes the increased regulatory uncertainty for offshore wind in the U.S.,” the company said Friday.
“Limiting relief in such a way would be practical and minimize risk of confusion for Agency Defendants responsible for overseeing federal wind leasing and permitting processes,” Gustafson wrote.","Limited power supply in extreme weather events, rising and unpredictable utility bills and thousands of union laborers without work.

That’s the dire picture of Rhode Island’s future without more offshore wind energy, Christopher Kearns, Rhode Island’s acting energy commissioner, said in an Aug. 8 affidavit submitted to federal court in Massachusetts.

Two weeks later, the Trump administration abruptly halted construction on Revolution Wind, a project already 80% completed and set to begin delivering power to Rhode Island and Connecticut in mid-2026. Predictions of economic and environmental harms quickly solidified, leaving workers stranded at sea, regional grid reliability under threat and state decarbonization mandates potentially out of reach.

“The invocation of the Wind Memorandum to issue a Stop Work Order for the fully permitted Revolution Wind project as it nears completion will harm Rhode Island, its residents, our strong labor workforce, and our offshore wind and related industries,” Kearns wrote in a second affidavit on Aug 28. “Moreover, it will harm our efforts to diversify our energy system and increase reliability.”

The consequences for Rhode Island’s only commercial offshore wind project will feature heavily in a Sept. 4 federal court hearing, where a group of 18 Democratic state attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, will ask U.S. District Judge William Young of Massachusetts to throw out the Trump administration’s Jan. 20 executive order halting reviews of offshore wind projects.

“The Revolution stop-work order provides another example of the harmful effects of Defendants’ arbitrary decision to adopt and implement the Wind Directive to stop wind-energy development in our States,” the AGs wrote in an Aug. 28 court filing. “And it underscores the importance of prompt vacatur of that decision to enable projects in and beyond the permitting pipeline to proceed toward development.”

The court hearing in Boston was scheduled two months before the Revolution Wind project was suddenly put in jeopardy, prompted by a multistate lawsuit filed in May against the Trump administration. The initial complaint centered on offshore wind projects still awaiting federal approvals, like the SouthCoast Wind project proposed off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard, from which Rhode Island is also in negotiations to buy power.

Revolution Wind did not appear at risk, having already begun construction soon after receiving its final federal permit in November 2023.

Stuck in limbo

Little comfort now to the dozen millwrights idled aboard Wind Scylla in Rhode Island Sound for over a week, who were building turbines when the stop work order came through.

“We’re still waiting for an answer from the companies and the contractors on what’s going on,” Evan Wytas, business representative for Millwrights Local 1121, said in an interview Friday morning. “We haven’t gotten any word that they are on their way back, or when that will be.”

Meanwhile, another two dozen union trade workers scheduled to head out to the construction site Aug. 28 are still on land, waiting by the phone for the call that they can head to work, said Erica Hammond, legislative director for the Rhode Island AFL-CIO.

Workers are still getting paid for now, Hammond confirmed, though those who remain onshore much longer might have to file for unemployment, depending on the specific details of their contracts.

“It is very frustrating,” Hammond said. “To stop now, in the case of this specific project, it’s a waste of resources.”

More than 1,000 union workers have spent the last two years building the 65-turbine project, 40 of which have been installed, as well as a pair of substations that will connect the power supply to Rhode Island and Connecticut. The 704 megawatts of nameplate capacity is enough to power 350,000 homes across both states, equal to 2.5% of the electricity load throughout New England, Kearns said in his affidavit.

The renewable electricity supply has already been baked into Rhode Island’s clean energy portfolio and is crucial to meeting the 2021 Act on Climate Law, which mandates net-zero emissions by 2050 with incremental, legally enforceable benchmarks that kick in at the end of the decade.

Orsted, the Danish company co-developing the project, pledged to explore solutions to resume work, including potential litigation, while exploring the financial implications for its $4 billion project. The company is seeking to raise another $9.4 billion from its shareholders, confirming Friday that its majority stakeholder, the Danish government, has agreed to the share sale. The fundraising plan was unveiled in the company’s Aug. 11 quarterly earnings release, before work was forced to stop on Revolution Wind.

“The stop-work order for Revolution Wind emphasizes the increased regulatory uncertainty for offshore wind in the U.S.,” the company said Friday. “The planned rights issue has been sized to provide the required strengthening of Orsted’s capital structure to execute its business plan, even when taking into account the impact of this uncertainty on Orsted’s US offshore wind portfolio.”

The Revolution Wind project was expected to bring in $156.7 million in net income for the company each year once operational, the company said. An “extraordinary general meeting” is scheduled for Sept. 5 to receive board approval for the share sale.

Neronha’s office is also considering additional legal action, but had not filed anything as of Friday. He’s focused on the existing multistate lawsuit challenging federal actions on offshore wind.

“Revolution Wind, a renewable energy project that is right at the finish line, and which would add 400MW to our clean energy portfolio, must move forward,” Neronha said in a statement Friday. “Billions in investment, more than 1,000 jobs, and an energy future that helps, not hurts, generations to come, are all on the line. For this reason, we formally notified the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts of the President’s unlawful stop work order and the harm it will cause to Rhode Islanders. We cannot allow this Administration to stop this project, and we will continue to explore additional legal avenues to prevent them from doing so.”

DOT yanks port funding

The U.S. Department of Transportation announced Friday it was pulling $679 million in federal infrastructure grants tied to 12 “doomed” offshore wind projects across the country. Among the casualties: an $11.2 million grant for Quonset Development Corp. to upgrade its port, improving terminal access for offshore wind projects along with strengthening resiliency against sea level rise.

“The Quonset Development Corporation is disappointed by this decision but understands that this administration is working to fund projects in line with its current policy priorities,” Steven King, managing director for the quasi-public state agency, said in an emailed response Friday. “Given that the Quonset Business Park’s 250 companies work broadly across nearly every sector of the economy, including in shipbuilding, we believe there is common ground to pursue and look forward to working together on new grant projects that align with the administration’s objectives and that grow the economy.”

Gov. Dan McKee was not as forgiving.

“This decision undermines progress on critical infrastructure and threatens Rhode Island’s economic and energy future,” McKee said in a statement late Friday afternoon. “The Port of Davisville and the broader Quonset Business Park are vital hubs for manufacturing, shipping, and energy, including the state’s offshore wind industry. This funding would have modernized port infrastructure and expanded cargo capacity. By withdrawing it, the Trump administration is undermining a high-performing port that drives real economic output, strengthens regional supply chains, and plays a central role in advancing energy and long-term growth for Rhode Island and across the Northeast.”

The Sept. 4 hearing in Boston will also give the federal agencies and cabinet directors named as defendants a chance to present their own arguments on why the lawsuit should be tossed. Adam Gustafson, acting assistant U.S. Attorney General, defended the federal administration’s pause on offshore wind projects in an Aug. 8 memo, citing “potential legal deficiencies in past practices, the possibility of serious harm to various interests and marine mammals, and the potential inadequacies of various environmental reviews.”

Gustafson argued that states lacked the jurisdiction to challenge federal review powers, at least on a universal basis. He asked the judge to rule in favor of the defendants, or to limit orders to specific projects and permits, rather than a blanket ruling denying federal review power over offshore wind as a whole.

“Limiting relief in such a way would be practical and minimize risk of confusion for Agency Defendants responsible for overseeing federal wind leasing and permitting processes,” Gustafson wrote.

Judge Young is unlikely to make a decision on the dueling motions at the Sept. 4 hearing. A ruling will come at a later, unscheduled date.

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It’s the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states’ climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans’ livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

Last week, the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, Sierra Club and Environmental Integrity Project filed a lawsuit against DEQ for granting Venture Global a Clean Air Act permit for the Calcasieu Pass 2 LNG facility, according to a joint news release from the organizations.
""We fear that CP2 LNG will be more of the same — more air pollution that is making us sick.
When The Advocate reached out to Venture Global, the company did not respond.
""The other problem is that it, not just for the people who are going to be directly breathing it, will contribute to the entire area having air quality violations.","Three environmental groups have joined forces to file a lawsuit against the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality regarding a permit for a new liquefied natural gas facility in Cameron Parish.

Last week, the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, Sierra Club and Environmental Integrity Project filed a lawsuit against DEQ for granting Venture Global a Clean Air Act permit for the Calcasieu Pass 2 LNG facility, according to a joint news release from the organizations.

“Venture Global has a long history of noncompliance with regards to its Calcasieu Pass LNG terminal,” Cameron Parish resident and Sierra Club member John Allaire said in the release. “This company has been a bad neighbor and continually pollutes the air we breathe, while generating billions of dollars in profits.

""We fear that CP2 LNG will be more of the same — more air pollution that is making us sick. It is time for LDEQ to do its job and protect people, not corporate profits.”

DEQ Communications Director Greg Langley told The Advocate the agency does not comment on pending litigation. When The Advocate reached out to Venture Global, the company did not respond.

David Bookbinder, director of Law and Policy for Environmental Integrity Project, said the complaint is centered around the belief that CP2 will emit more pollution than DEQ assumed and will have air quality violations, as well as the fact that some of the permit limits are more lenient than justified for different pollutants.

""We're dealing with a facility that's going to be emitting many, many, many tons of pollutants and … the local impact on people who are directly breathing the air is going to be bad,"" Bookbinder said. ""The other problem is that it, not just for the people who are going to be directly breathing it, will contribute to the entire area having air quality violations. It mucks up people's air.""

The facility, which will be one of the largest LNG plants in the nation, would export 20 million metric tons of LNG per year, according to the release. The estimated life cycle greenhouse gas from the methane gas would be more than the annual emissions of 47 million gas-powered cars, the release states.

Construction started on CP2 this summer, and the facility is expected to begin LNG production in 2027.

Allaire, a former oil industry worker, said he and the organizations are upset that the state would grant CP2 a Clean Air Act permit based on the compliance history of Venture Global at Calcasieu Pass, which began operating in 2022.

During its first calendar year of operation, the Calcasieu Pass LNG facility had at least 139 incidents where it exceeded the hourly emission limits of its air permits, The Advocate previously reported. In addition, DEQ granted the facility an increase in its allowed emissions in 2023.

Bookbinder said the next steps for the lawsuit will be the court reaching out within a couple of weeks to provide a schedule to submit all the preliminary paperwork, and about two months later it will release a schedule for briefing.

From there, there will be arguments and then a decision, ""hopefully by the end of 2026,"" Bookbinder said.

Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, said that overall the permit is flawed and that is what they would like to see fixed.

""The Department of Environmental Quality does not have a realistic assessment of this facility that they're letting them get away with putting whatever they want on paper and not really tending to the Clean Air Act,"" Rolfes said. ""Our goal would be to get a real serious permit on this facility. I do believe that if you took an honest look at the emissions and at the area and the burden it's already bearing, that they could never get a permit because the pollution there is already too intense.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/86/18631a50-4286-57fa-95c2-22a35d6d84fa/68b22b21d400c.image.png?crop=960%2C504%2C0%2C108,N,,2025-08-30 13:05:24.339327

I moved to Colorado because I wanted to live in a place where community, economic opportunity and the outdoors all come together. I’ve hiked across the Rockies, talked energy policy on front porches, and helped small business owners explore how solar might lower their operational costs. One thing is clear: Coloradans care deeply about where their energy comes from, and the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC) right now has the opportunity to give Coloradans what they want.

Since 2022, rooftop solar has surged across the state. Thanks in part to federal tax credits that were expanded and extended in the Inflation Reduction Act, Colorado has deployed 4,508 MW of solar, powering over 900,000 homes. Jobs in the solar sector are growing — not just in big cities like Denver and Colorado Springs, but all over the state.

Now, with the elimination of solar tax credits in the recently signed “One Big, Beautiful Bill,” that federal support is gone. It’s a devastating blow to an industry that was just hitting its stride, made worse by the fact that four Colorado Representatives — Jeff Hurd, Gabe Evans, Lauren Boebert and Jeff Crank — voted to advance this legislation. They abandoned the very constituents who believed in their promises of energy independence and economic resilience.

But solar won’t stop here.

The elimination of federal incentives forces us to think bigger and act locally. This is Colorado’s moment to lead, and we can do that through community solar programs and decentralized electricity generation systems — what are known as Distributed Power Plants. These are proven solutions that can deliver the benefits of solar energy even without federal support.

Community solar allows renters, condo owners and anyone without suitable rooftops to access renewable energy, spreading costs and benefits across entire communities. Distributed power plants coordinate community solar and battery systems to respond to grid needs in real time, acting like a single large power plant — while reducing the need for expensive peaker plants.

Colorado already has a strong foundation for this work. In 2010, Colorado became the first state to enable community solar with the Community Solar Gardens Act, requiring the state’s two major utility companies — Xcel Energy and Black Hills Energy — to purchase electricity from community solar gardens starting in 2026.

Now Colorado is ready to take the next leap forward with Distributed Power Plants. They can provide grid services, reduce peak demand and give homeowners new ways to earn money from their energy investments while making the entire system more reliable, and making solar more accessible to low- and moderate-income households. From Utah to Massachusetts, Distributed Power Plants are working hard for the grid in diverse locations around the country, and it’s time for Colorado to become a leader in pursuing this energy opportunity.

The details of how these programs will work are being decided right now. On August 26, the Colorado PUC held a virtual public comment hearing on Distributed Power Plant programs. This is our chance to ensure these programs are as accessible and beneficial as possible, serving those they stand to impact most — Colorado families and communities.

Colorado has always been ahead of the curve on clean energy — not because it’s trendy, but because it’s practical. In Boulder and Alamosa, on the Western Slope and in suburban Jefferson County, families go solar because it works — lowering bills, keeping dollars in local economies, and providing resilience during wildfires, heatwaves and winter outages. That demand hasn’t disappeared just because Congress failed to act.

It’s time for Colorado to show the nation what energy independence looks like: community-powered, locally controlled and resilient by design. Our representatives in Congress may have let us down, but our state and local leaders still have the chance to lead.

The solar revolution isn’t over. It’s just getting started — one community at a time.

The number of U.S. scientists working on the IPCC reports has decreased markedly over the past decade, from 210 during the panel’s 5th assessment cycle to 46 in the current cycle, according to the panel’s records. But there are still more Americans or scientists with dual citizenship and U.S. university affiliations contributing to the reports than from any other country.

Former NASA chief scientist and senior climate adviser Katherine Calvin, whose role with the international panel was unclear after the Trump administration fired her from the federal agency, is among them. She will co-chair one of the three main assessment groups, IPCC Chair Jim Skea said last week.

“Kate is there and we see no route to her leaving that role in the future,” he said. Calvin, a climate modeling expert, made significant contributions to previous IPCC reports, he added, and will now help guide the structure and direction of the entire climate mitigation working group, with 222 scientists, including 15 other U.S. climate researchers.

The IPCC is the United Nations body responsible for assessing climate science and issuing reports every three to five years to guide government climate policies.

U.S. scientific agencies and their Earth observation programs from satellites were foundational to the IPCC’s earliest reports, in 1990 and 1995, as were U.S. ground- and ocean-based measurements of temperature increases, sea level rise and polar and mountain ice melt.

Measurements developed by U.S. researchers in Hawaii in the 1950s revealed a rapid, steady increase in heat-trapping atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, lending the IPCC’s work a sense of urgency since its establishment in 1988.

And it was a U.S. scientist who helped shape one of the IPCC’s most significant findings in 1994, when the panel concluded that the balance of scientific evidence “suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.”

The IPCC’s influence on global climate policy increased with its 2014 report, the scientific basis for the Paris climate agreement’s goal of limiting warming.

The IPCC has announced a total of 664 authors for the current assessment cycle. For the first time, there are more authors, 51 percent, from developing and emerging-economy countries than from developed countries. The percentage of female authors increased from 33 percent in the last cycle to 44 percent, bringing the IPCC closer to its goal of gender and geographic parity, Skea said.

“You’re seeing many more people providing strong scientific contributions from what you might call the emerging scientific countries, like China, India, Brazil, South Africa and Kenya,” Skea said. “They’re all coming through the system in much greater numbers, which can only be a good thing.”

In the context of the IPCC’s mission to synthesize global climate science, he also noted an increased proportion of scientific literature coming from Europe, China and India in recent years.

The first report in this assessment cycle on climate and cities is due in 2027, and there are five U.S. authors involved. Despite the lack of federal funding, they’ve been able to use philanthropic support to attend lead author meetings in person, rather than simply participating online, Skea said.

Strong Science Institutions Support Democracy

U.S. turnout for the IPCC is a sign that the science community is working to bolster institutional strength and resilience in the face of increasingly hostile political winds, said Rutgers University human-ecology professor Pamela McElwee, who helped coordinate the nomination process for U.S. scientists after the U.S. Department of State canceled the official federal process.

The drop in the number of U.S. authors for the latest round of IPCC reports can’t just be attributed to the lack of federal support, said McElwee, who will co-author a chapter in an upcoming report focusing partly on anti-science policies and climate disinformation.

“I’m not concerned about fewer U.S. authors, because it’s made space for other folks,” she said. “But I am concerned that the authors that were selected get support, and are not told by the federal government in any way, shape or form, what it is that they’re allowed to do.”

Despite the absence of the usual federal nomination process, the total number of U.S. scientists was as high as in the previous cycle, which was during the first Trump administration, thanks to an effort by 10 U.S. universities with official IPCC observer status and the American Geophysical Union, which presented a “nice united front” of scientific solidarity, McElwee said.

That effort included a web portal for nominations, established in late February and early March amid uncertainty about whether a federal nomination process would be in place before the IPCC deadline.

The U.S. science community is also organizing at other levels, including coordinating a response to a climate report issued by the U.S. Department of Energy several weeks ago, she said.

The AGU and the American Meteorological Society have also teamed up to publish a collection of papers to update information from a National Climate Assessment formerly compiled and issued by the federal government but canceled by the Trump administration.

Another group of international scientists is networking to establish independent, distributed systems for storing and sharing scientific information, specifically aimed at protecting science from authoritarian threats.

The threats come from oligarchs acting in their own financial self-interest and that of their political allies, which are often nationalist, populist and authoritarian parties and governments worldwide, University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann and Baylor University health researcher Peter Hotez write in a new book. “Science Under Siege: How to Fight the Five Most Powerful Forces that Threaten Our World” is scheduled for release in early September.

Such political actors spread disinformation on climate science and vaccine science, undermining public trust in science and government and threatening democracy itself, the scientists warn in the book.

“While it may be inconvenient to the current administration, the U.S. does have some of the leading climate scientists in the world, and they will continue to find a way to do and communicate the science regardless of the oppressive political regime,” Mann said.

Former IPCC member Richard Alley, an ice researcher and professor of geosciences at Pennsylvania State University, noted that scientists can spend hundreds of hours on IPCC work, and most of it is volunteer time.

“An IPCC report represents a lot of lost sleep and missed milestones at home while the scientists are laboring to put it together, while still continuing to teach, discover and serve in other ways,” he said.

McElwee said she sees both hopeful and troubling signs for science in the future.

International collaboration remains strong, with U.S. participation, and science is becoming increasingly global and inclusive of Indigenous knowledge, as well as doing more interdisciplinary work to identify the links between social and physical sciences.

On the other hand, the threats are very real, especially in the United States right now, she said, noting that the current administration has said it may rewrite existing reports that have met all scientific standards for accuracy.

That level of threat to scientific integrity calls for a strong response, and researchers in relatively safe positions with academic tenure should step forward first, she said.

Staying engaged in international scientific efforts and helping others do the same is her way of working to protect democratic norms. But she’s discouraged by watching the erosion of those norms.

“I’m increasingly looking at this and saying, what’s the point of being a scientist in a country that doesn’t have rule of law or doesn’t accept the truth of scientific experimentation,” she said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IPCC-62nd-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 12:06:01.163518

It sparked frustration among electric vehicle drivers and raised concerns about how charger vandalism can slow the shift away from gasoline and diesel.

At many public stations, the screen is the main way to start and pay. Many networks let members start a charge with an account login or RFID card, but guests often depend on the on-screen unit. Damaged screens can leave drivers stranded, and isolated vandalism can undermine confidence in the network when reliability is critical.

Even accounting for manufacturing and battery production, EVs generate less lifetime heat-trapping pollution than gasoline vehicles. Research on battery metals found that mining for materials like lithium has a smaller footprint than the billions of tons of dirty energy — gas, coal, and oil — extracted each year. Driving an EV still reduces pollution over a vehicle's life.

Screens aren't the only targets. In Minnesota, officials reported over 80 damaged charging stations since public installation. These setbacks are also happening worldwide; in the U.K., vandals cut multiple public chargers, and a Glasgow vandalism case showed similar damage.

Some cut charging cords to steal copper wiring for resale; other incidents show no obvious motive. Elsewhere, gas-powered cars blocked chargers, preventing EV drivers from using them at all.

Whether for profit or mischief, vandalism makes a station unusable, inconveniencing drivers. Each case chips away at public trust and creates another barrier to choosing an EV.

As such, some drivers sidestep public chargers entirely by installing home solar and charging where they live. EnergySage's tools can help those looking to invest in solar power by comparing options and costs.

""Blink chargers around here used to be out of service all the time due to broken screens. It was really annoying,"" one commenter wrote.

They noted that smaller-screen units are especially vulnerable to damage. While Blink network users can just use their app or card, they added, ""For guest users it make the charger unusable though.""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/rFxcvtJZrIb42QJhioKTVQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02ODg7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/5c0894bc5ad1c06880305f90b2451196,N,,2025-08-30 08:59:31.995121

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It’s the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

The notion that renewable energy is eating up cropland is a myth.
U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright stopped in Iowa this month and proclaimed that it’s time for the state’s wind energy industry to stand on its own.
“I think it’s the right time to sunset them,” Wright said of tax incentives for wind energy projects.
But even Sen. Chuck Grassley, the “father of wind energy” appears to be falling in line by accepting Trump’s mistake.","Recently, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that federal funding for wind and solar energy projects will be slashed.

The reason? USDA says the agency is more interested in the potential for projects to be built on “prime farmland” than in promoting renewable energy. A press release said the agency’s goal is to end support of “unaffordable and unreliable ‘green’ energy sources.”

That criticism rings hollow in Iowa, where nearly 60% of the state's electricity comes from wind, more than any other state. The solar industry is also developing. And Iowa’s renewable energy prominence has been a key factor in attracting companies to the state.

Iowa's farmers will lose critical funding opportunities tied to solar and wind installations on their land. Many rural development plans may stall, and jobs tied to clean energy expansion in farming communities could be jeopardized.

The Clean Grid Alliance found that if all proposed solar projects were placed on Iowa’s 17.5 million acres considered “prime,” they would take up 35,000 acres, or just 0.2%. The notion that renewable energy is eating up cropland is a myth.

But, as you may know, President Donald Trump hates wind turbines. He’s talked often of birds killed by turbine blades and even insisted windmills can cause cancer. Trump has issued an executive order directing the Treasury Secretary to stop providing tax credits for wind and solar projects.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright stopped in Iowa this month and proclaimed that it’s time for the state’s wind energy industry to stand on its own.

“I think it’s the right time to sunset them,” Wright said of tax incentives for wind energy projects. “They’re 33 years old now. They’ve been extended 11 times.”

But the International Energy Agency reports that government subsidies benefiting the fossil fuel industry totaled $620 billion in 2023. The federal government has been propping up the ethanol industry in various ways for nearly 50 years.

This entire saga makes no sense. Renewable energy technology is America’s future. Trump administration policies clinging to fossil fuels are shortsighted and misinformed. Also, we’re pulling back from renewables at a critical moment when technology is making it more affordable and reliable.

The United States risks falling behind its global economic competitors. In Iowa, these misguided policies will stunt the growth of a promising industry that employs 4,000 Iowans and has generated $22 billion in capital investments, according to state figures.

Our congressional delegation should abandon its usual fealty to Trump and raise a ruckus over the loss of this funding. But even Sen. Chuck Grassley, the “father of wind energy” appears to be falling in line by accepting Trump’s mistake.

Iowa leaders must demand federal policies that keep our state at the forefront of renewable energy. If they don't, Iowa risks losing jobs, rural income, competitiveness, and the opportunity to counteract climate change. Our state has already seen the costs in floods, derechos and droughts.

Currently, the country relies heavily on imports for critical components. Strengthening the domestic supply chain will reduce dependence on foreign markets, create jobs, and support India’s goal of becoming a global hub for renewable energy manufacturing.

In Detail : The solar industry in India is calling for strong policy support to establish an end-to-end domestic solar manufacturing ecosystem. Currently, the country’s reliance on imported components such as wafers, cells, and polysilicon poses challenges to energy security. Industry players believe that achieving self-reliance in the entire value chain is crucial for long-term sustainability.

While India has made remarkable progress in expanding module manufacturing capacity, the upstream segments remain underdeveloped. The absence of facilities for polysilicon, ingots, and wafers keeps the sector dependent on global suppliers. This not only creates vulnerabilities due to supply chain disruptions but also impacts cost competitiveness in global markets.

Industry leaders are pressing the government to introduce comprehensive incentives that support manufacturing across all stages. Schemes like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) have given a boost, but further measures are required to encourage investments in raw materials and advanced technologies. An integrated ecosystem will help India capture global market share.

Domestic solar manufacturing also presents an opportunity for job creation and skill development at scale. Building the entire supply chain within the country will generate employment for engineers, technicians, and workers across various regions. Additionally, it would help build expertise in high-tech processes such as wafer cutting and cell efficiency enhancement.

Global supply chain disruptions during the pandemic highlighted India’s vulnerability to external markets. With rising energy demand, ensuring a secure and stable supply of solar equipment becomes critical. By building indigenous capacity, India can insulate itself from geopolitical risks and volatile import prices, while fostering resilience in its renewable energy transition.

End-to-end solar manufacturing will also support India’s ambitious renewable energy targets. With plans to achieve 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based capacity by 2030, ensuring reliable access to solar components is essential. Localized production will reduce project delays, lower costs, and accelerate the adoption of solar power across residential, commercial, and utility-scale sectors.

Industry stakeholders stress the importance of research and development alongside manufacturing. Innovation in efficiency improvements, advanced materials, and automation will be key to competing globally. Collaboration between manufacturers, research institutes, and government bodies could make India a hub not just for solar production but also for technology leadership.

The push for end-to-end solar manufacturing also has export potential. By building capabilities across the full supply chain, India can supply high-quality equipment to international markets. This aligns with the government’s vision of making India a global renewable energy hub and boosting foreign exchange earnings through clean energy exports.

The call from the industry reflects a broader understanding that energy transition must be backed by self-reliance in clean technology manufacturing. With the right policies, infrastructure, and incentives, India has the opportunity to emerge as a global leader in solar energy. Achieving this goal will ensure both sustainability and economic growth.",https://www.eqmagpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Quark-Solar-is-pleased-to-commission-its-first-rooftop-solar-plant-in-Chakan-industrial-park-of-578kWp-at-Mubea-India.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 07:59:52.394277

These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›

It's been a bit of a weird year for Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) investors. The company is dealing with external factors hurting business, including tariffs on imported vehicles and parts, a decline in global sales, increasing competition in China amid a brutal price war, mounting lawsuits, a talent exodus, and consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political adventures. Despite all those negative developments, Tesla's stock has surged 54% higher over the past 12 months. And one recent move could help move more vehicles, which is exactly what the company needs in the near term.

Worrisome pricing?

Political backlash has put pressure on Tesla's used-car pricing. So much pressure, in fact, that even though Tesla is often considered a premium brand, its used vehicles are now selling almost as cheaply as the average used car -- and the latter's price is moving higher, while Tesla's prices continue to move lower. The problem started last year when the broader used car market in the U.S. started seeing values drop, but the broader market began recovering in the spring, and Tesla values continued to drop.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »

What's Tesla to do?

While consumer backlash is likely to eventually fade, Tesla's primary problem in the near term is to reverse its sales decline. Tesla recently started offering leases of certified preowned cars, which is fairly rare in the automotive industry. It's also offering $0 down as it tries to load as many deliveries into the third quarter as possible before the federal $7,500 tax credit on new electric vehicles (EVs) and the $4,000 credit for used EVs expire at the end of September.

The industry is banking on demand being pulled into the third quarter, and Tesla is aiming to capture as many sales as possible with the new leasing strategy. Telsa is doing this for the first time, and these certified preowned vehicles, mostly Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, are being offered for as little as $215 per month with $0 down for a 24-month lease and 10,000 miles per year. Tesla is also offering a 12-month lease and up to 15,000 miles annually, with $0 down but an acquisition fee of nearly $700.

Whether you're a fan of Musk or not, or Tesla or EVs in general, this is a compelling deal and the cheapest way to get into a Tesla at the moment. The problem is that used Teslas have been piling up, as the brand took a hit this year, and this does appear a little desperate.

Tesla is also trying a new strategy with its Cybertruck that has left investors and analysts unimpressed with its deliveries. Tesla raised the price of the high-end version of the Cybertruck to $114,990, up from $99,990, in the U.S., per listings on its website. The Cybertruck now comes with what Tesla calls a ""Luxe Package"" including Full-Self Driving (FSD), four-year wheel and tire protection, and free supercharging access. Unfortunately, pricing changes on a single trim, even a high-end and more profitable trim package, aren't likely to move the needle for either deliveries or financials.

What it all means

With Tesla's stock up 54% over the past year despite all the negative developments, it's clear that investors are truly hoping the EV maker will capture lightning in a bottle with earnings growth driven by autonomous vehicles. Investors are in a tough position as they revisit their investing thesis for a company that might be in the middle of transitioning from an automaker to a company defined by self-driving vehicles, robotics, and artificial intelligence -- maybe not what everybody signed up for when originally investing in Tesla for its electric vehicles. What it all means is that the risk of owning Tesla is higher now and that the company will face a few bumpy quarters as the markets deal with losing the EV tax credits -- so buckle up and prepare for the ride.

“They would have to go in and destroy the community,” Mayfield said, referring to Eddystone.
Researchers from Haverford College have joined to explain how the LNG terminal would affect the county, beyond economic terms.
Mayfield and Carluccio said residents in the affluent area near Chester should care about the LNG terminal.
Modern day Chester is located in the Okehocking and Lenapehocken region, and Fontaine’s activism includes reclaiming his familial roots along the Delaware River.","CHESTER, Pa.—In this small city south of Philadelphia, trash is a problem. A thick white cloud rising from Reworld’s Delaware Valley Resource Recovery Facility, the largest trash incinerator in the country by capacity, and the stinging odor of garbage are daily reminders that mounds of waste from Philadelphia, New York City and Delaware are a toxic burden here.

Air pollution from the burning trash and emissions from other industrial sites along the river have long been blamed for contributing to high rates of deadly illnesses in Chester and the surrounding Delaware County. Beginning in 1996, the Environmental Protection Agency noted the harmful load of industrial facilities in the city.

Now, researchers and community groups are raising alarms that Chester and its neighboring towns could face a new liquified natural gas (LNG) terminal that will increase emissions and pollution and add a potential threat of explosions.

Their concern comes amid a push by the Trump administration to dramatically increase LNG exports, which could contribute an estimated $1.3 trillion dollars to the U.S. gross domestic product through 2040. Pennsylvania lawmakers speak of the financial benefits of a terminal along the Delaware River—they predict thousands of new jobs—but people who live in the region are most interested and worried about the quality of the air they breathe.

LNG is a form of natural gas cooled to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit. In Pennsylvania, the nation’s second largest energy-producing state, the gas comes primarily from fracking the Marcellus Shale, which runs beneath about two-thirds to three-quarters of the state.

The condensed fuel is shipped to international markets, which has bolstered the national economy in recent years. But a recent Inside Climate News analysis has found that those exports, and specifically the tankers that transport LNG from the United States, contribute to global warming through the emission of methane, a climate super-pollutant 80 times more warming than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period.

For the community activists facing a new LNG export terminal, the risks of the tanker traffic and possible pipeline accidents far outweigh the benefits. “It’s the potential of death,” said David Kronheim. The retired computer programmer has lived in Chester for five years, about a mile from the incinerator. If an LNG export terminal were built nearby, Kronheim said he would want to move. “It doesn’t matter where they build it. If you’re within 10 miles you’re in trouble,” said Kronheim, who has joined a local activist group that is fighting the terminal.

In 2016, a New York based company, Penn America Energy, wrote a report on the economic impact of building a $6.4 billion dollar facility that would operate out of Chester in 2023. CEO Franc James held meetings with local lawmakers but faced local pressure against allowing another polluting industry into an overburdened community and obstacles from the Biden administration to slow LNG exports.

That changed on Jan. 20 as President Trump signed an executive order declaring a national energy emergency. LNG exports have become a focus of foreign policy and energy development.

In April, Pennsylvania Republican Sen. David McCormick announced in a Washington Times op-ed that Penn America was collaborating with the Pennsylvania Building Trades, a union alliance, on a $7 billion LNG export terminal in Eddystone Borough, a working class white community next to Chester along the I-95 corridor south of Philadelphia.

That terminal, he said, would contribute to future “energy domination” and “that future runs through Pennsylvania.”

“This massive, proposed project in southeastern Pennsylvania has the potential to generate billions in economic impact over the next 20 years, create 3,000 good-paying jobs, and produce $30-$40 million per year in tax revenue for this community,” McCormick said in a separate statement on his Senate website that criticized Biden’s efforts to evaluate environmental and economic impacts of LNG exports.

“The Biden Administration foolishly placed an indefinite pause on this and other critical projects, halting our progress towards energy independence…I’m grateful to President Trump for immediately reversing this ban, allowing proposals like this new LNG export terminal to resume and unleashing Pennsylvania’s energy dominance,” McCormick said.

In June, Reuters reported that James, the Penn America Energy executive, had a meeting in the White House to “provide intelligence” on bringing LNG operations to southeast Pennsylvania. James told Reuters he was looking beyond the original Chester location to other possible sites in Trainer, Marcus Hook and Eddystone.

Last month, Trump signed a record agreement with the European Union to buy $750 billion dollars worth of American energy in the next three years—an amount that some experts warn is unrealistic.

Activists in Delaware County have said that McCormick’s optimistic estimates for job creation and tax revenues clash with on-the-ground realities: potential public health harm from what could be a 100-acre site in a residential area.

Chester and Eddystone are part of what advocates have identified as an environmental justice area, where low-income neighborhoods and communities of color have been disproportionately harmed by polluting industries for decades.

Zulene Mayfield, an activist who heads the nonprofit Chester Residents Concerned for Quality Living (CRCQL), has been at the forefront of the environmental justice movement in Chester since 1992.

When she hears talk of a potential economic boom in the area, Mayfield said she can’t help but take the word literally, thinking of a 2022 explosion at an LNG site in Freeport, Texas, that stemmed from a pipe failure. Vapors ignited a fireball. Damage was contained to the site, and there were no injuries reported to authorities, according to a government website.

She noted that the potential exists for liquified natural gas to combust and CRCQL is concerned about an explosion risk in Delaware County, a densely populated area. Two local hospitals closed in the past year, and Mayfield said that undercut the community’s ability to handle medical crises.

“The difference now is that they’ve ripped away the protections,” she said referring to EPA regulations. “And there have never been that many in the first place.”

Following Trump’s executive order, the U.S. Department of Energy announced in January that it was lifting Biden’s 2024 pause on LNG exports. In March, the EPA announced 31 regulatory rollbacks that it called ”the biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history” to encourage energy production.

“We know there’s no help from the EPA,” Mayfield said. “Don’t think the cavalry is coming from Washington. It is incumbent on us to become our own cavalry.”

The Delaware Riverkeeper Network, a nonprofit that aims to protect waterways, has submitted right-to-know requests to Eddystone Borough to sort through documentation or filings related to efforts to build the export terminal. Following Sen. McCormick’s op-ed that raised Eddystone as a possible site, the borough manager for code compliance in May emailed a response to the Riverkeepers that said: “There is nothing to report as I do not know what you are referring to.”

Tracy Carluccio, deputy director of the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, said she is concerned that Penn America Energy has been informally lining up support with elected representatives from the state.

Eddystone and Chester are communities directly next to each other on the Delaware River. Chester takes up six square miles, Eddystone accounts for less than two square miles. Activists say that neither are large enough to safely accommodate the industry, and there isn’t a site to build in either location that wouldn’t infringe on homes, small businesses, churches, or major throughways.

“They would have to go in and destroy the community,” Mayfield said, referring to Eddystone. “[An LNG terminal] is way too large for a populated area like this.”

Mayfield said she is just as worried about LNG in Eddystone as she was about Chester.

Comparing the situation to a house on fire,she said that the threat was the same, regardless of which town in Delaware County that investors had their sights on. “If they go to Eddystone, that’s the equivalent of a neighbor’s house on fire,” she said. “If their house is on fire, our house is going to burn, too.”

Turning their efforts to resisting plans for LNG in Eddystone, Mayfield and Carluccio are leading an education and mobilization campaign across Delaware County with public and virtual forums. Researchers from Haverford College have joined to explain how the LNG terminal would affect the county, beyond economic terms.

“They want us dumb,” said Mayfield at a public forum that CRCQL sponsored last month. “They don’t want educated thinkers. They want workers—bargain basement thinkers who won’t challenge them.”

A crowd of about 30 residents, community organizers and researchers sat on wooden pews one hot summer day at the Quaker Providence Friends Meeting House in Media, about six miles north of Chester, to learn how LNG’s promise for economic development could affect their health.

Mayfield and Carluccio said residents in the affluent area near Chester should care about the LNG terminal. “The fight is getting those who don’t see and smell it [to understand] that you are in just as much danger,” Mayfield said.

Residents living in towns not directly burdened by the industries that pollute Chester might not be aware of the dangerous air emissions that waft inland from the waterfront, she said.

Chester, a predominantly Black community, is burdened by a disproportionate amount of polluting industries, which fits a larger trend of systemic racial bias, along with lower socioeconomic status, as a defining factor of where these industries are historically located. A General Accounting Office study in the 1980s found 75 percent of hazardous waste sites across eight states were in low-income communities of color.

Mayfield pointed out that what happens in Chester now will affect nearby communities. Majority white suburbs will be affected by the LNG terminal’s traffic and air pollution, she said. Harm won’t be contained to just one zip code.

Lauren Minsky, a health studies professor at Haverford College who spoke during the meeting, said her research on cancer in Delaware County found industries on the river had contributed to pollution that correlates with a range of heightened rates of deadly diseases in southeast Pennsylvania.

Minsky presented a map during the meeting that tracked weather patterns and showed how wind moves northwest and inland from the waterfront. Towns farther from the river, including Media, would be affected, and the air from the waterfront was shown to be laden with particulate matter and carcinogens, she said.

“You can think of [it] as a sacrifice zone where people are losing their lives because of these facilities,” Minsky said. ““People in these communities are dying young.”

“It’s not always routine, it’s not only where you work, it’s not only your lifestyle, it can be the land and the air where you live that affects you,” Mayfield said about the causes of cancer and asthma in Delaware County. “Our children literally cannot breathe.”

Children in Eddystone developed Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, a blood cancer, at a rate 1,051 percent higher than the national average, according to Minsky’s research. Meanwhile in Chester City, female rates of laryngeal cancer were 201 percent higher than the national average, and male rates of liver and bile cancer were 97 percent higher than the national average, her research found.

A study published in May by Johns Hopkins researchers focused on Chester and surrounding boroughs in an effort to better account for and assess the noncarcinogenic health eﬀects of cumulative chemical exposures. The researchers found that the mix of pollutants from the various industries posed more health risks to nearby communities–called “fenceline communities” in the study–than the harm associated with a single pollutant.

The Johns Hopkins team noted that “communities along the Delaware River in southeastern Pennsylvania have long faced high levels of pollution from petro-chemical reﬁneries, municipal waste incinerators, and several other industrial facilities.” The EPA had for years documented elevated rates of infant mortality, cancer mortality, and asthma among residents.

Other groups that attended Mayfield’s meeting included Swarthmore College’s Campus Coalition Concerning Chester, Earth Quaker Action Team, and Choices, a youth environmental justice group affiliated with CRCQL.

While CRCQL has been spreading the word of environmental justice and rallying support against LNG proposals this summer through public meetings, Choices has been doing its own advocacy. Its members are between 8 and 18 years old.

Their work has included testing soil samples for lead with University of Pennsylvania researchers, volunteering at a local farm, building solar panels, and events to support and inspire the community.

Nolan Fontaine, who has an Ed.D. in sociology, equity studies and education, is an American Indian organizer who also leads Choices. Modern day Chester is located in the Okehocking and Lenapehocken region, and Fontaine’s activism includes reclaiming his familial roots along the Delaware River. He said Choices aims to change the narrative about industries that came to the city promising jobs and left residents fighting for air.

Hope and love for the community, he said, is intertwined with the resistance to the trash incinerator and polluting sites along the river. It’s evident in Choices initiatives including, “Sowing Seeds of Hope,” a gardening event and plant giveaway.

“It’s a small act of resistance. While we aren’t able to shut down Reworld Covanta yet,” Fontaine said of Chester’s trash incinerator, “we can control our homes and our small environments to make them cleaner, fresher, and a safe place for us to be able to breathe.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chester-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 06:59:50.772001

Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers began a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.

Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers’ jobs are in limbo, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.

Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.

The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.

“This is a pretty major change,” said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state fiscal policy team, noting “the challenge in enacting something that’s dramatically different for most drivers.”

Oregon’s transportation woes

Oregon’s transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.

Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.

Kotek’s proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state’s gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.

The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn’t have to pay supplemental registration fees.

Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle’s telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state’s decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.

Republican lawmakers, who have opposed the tax and fee increases, unveiled a different proposal Friday that largely focuses on lifting restrictions on how the transportation department can spend money on maintenance operations. It does not include a road usage charge.

As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state’s total vehicles, he said.

Hawaii launches program

Under Hawaii’s program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.

In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.

Questions about privacy and fairness

In past surveys commissioned by Oregon’s transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.

Oregon’s voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they’re more expensive and can be removed, he added.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.

Many people don’t realize that “both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,” said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.

Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.

“We are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,” Morgan said.",https://www.trentonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Electric_Vehicles-Road_User_Fee_73408-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-08-30 12:06:33.734518

Louisiana, USA, 30th August 2025, ZEX PR WIRE, Tyler Pommier, Executive Vice President of Innovation at GulfStream Renewables, is calling on individuals, communities, and leaders across the U.S. to rethink the way energy is produced, shared, and understood. After years of spearheading clean energy projects across the Gulf Coast, Pommier is using his platform to raise awareness about energy equity and local empowerment through decentralized, renewable systems.

“Everyone deserves access to clean power,” Pommier says. “Not just for the environment, but for dignity, safety, and freedom.”

This message is central to Pommier’s recent TEDx talk titled “Decentralizing Power: Energy Belongs to Everyone.” It also echoes throughout his work developing solar, wind, and battery systems that support schools, neighborhoods, and underserved rural areas.

The Power Gap

Pommier’s advocacy comes at a time when energy insecurity remains a serious issue. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration:

Nearly one in three U.S. households faces some form of energy insecurity each year.

In rural and low-income communities, power outages and energy costs impact health, education, and economic stability.

Schools in underserved areas face frequent disruptions due to unreliable power, affecting student learning and safety.

“This isn’t just a technical problem—it’s a people problem,” says Pommier. “When a school loses power, classrooms close. When a family can’t afford heating, people get sick. Energy touches every part of our lives.”

Local Action, Local Control

One of Pommier’s proudest achievements is a series of solar-plus-battery installations in rural schools across Louisiana.

“These schools had constant outages,” he explains. “We gave them a way to stay open, save money, and be resilient. That kind of project shows how clean energy can serve real human needs.”

He believes decentralized systems—like rooftop solar, community microgrids, and battery storage—can give control back to families, schools, and local governments.

“I want to see communities that don’t just use power,” he says. “I want to see communities that own their power.”

Making Clean Energy Understandable

Pommier is also focused on simplifying the conversation. “You can’t just throw data at people,” he says. “You have to explain how it affects their daily lives. Like: Will your fridge stay on in a storm? Will your kid’s school stay open during a blackout?”

His plainspoken approach has made him a trusted voice at town halls, schools, and policy meetings.

What You Can Do

Pommier isn’t asking people to wait for government action or big investment. Instead, he’s offering simple steps that everyday people can take:

Learn how your home or building uses energy.

Ask questions at local meetings about power sourcing and grid reliability.

Support community solar projects or energy co-ops.

Encourage schools and public buildings to explore renewable options.

Talk about it. Share energy stories with neighbors, family, and friends.

“Start small,” Pommier says. “Talk to your city council. Learn how your utility works. Ask where your electricity comes from. That’s how change begins.”

Canada drops several retaliatory tariffs to align with U.S. exemptions

Canada is dropping many of its retaliatory tariffs to match U.S. exemptions under the United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact (USMCA), Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Friday. The decision ensures that over 85% of Canadian trade with the U.S. remains tariff-free. The move aligns Canada with carve-outs that shield most goods from punitive duties, while maintaining tariffs on steel, aluminum, and autos as negotiations continue with Washington. Carney emphasized the strategic nature of the adjustment, framing it as a way to preserve Canada’s trade advantage and set the stage for the USMCA review in 2026. Read More

Backed by the Department of Energy (DOE), the project marks a shift toward nuclear-powered sustainability, with a clear focus on meeting rising energy demands while reducing environmental impact.

The Aalo-X is an experimental extra modular reactor (XMR), sited beside INL’s Materials and Fuels Complex.

Aalo aims for it to achieve criticality, the point at which a nuclear chain reaction becomes self-sustaining, by 4 July 2026.

The target date aligns with the company’s plan to go from “founding to fission” in under three years.

A public-private model for sustainable energy innovation

The Aalo-X reactor is selected through a competitive application process as part of the DOE’s newly formed Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program.

This initiative launches in June 2025 following Executive Order 14301.

It allows advanced nuclear designs to be tested beyond national laboratory sites, opening the door to faster commercial deployment.

For the sustainability sector, this means accelerated innovation in low-carbon power generation.

The pilot programme’s structure allows companies like Aalo to collaborate with national labs while fast-tracking testing protocols.

Its design encourages commercial deployment of advanced reactors to new industries, especially those experiencing surging power needs such as cloud computing and data storage.

“Our selection for the Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program is a significant catalyst for achieving our goal of going from ‘founding to fission’ in less than three years – a feat many deemed impossible just a year ago,” says Matt Loszak, Co-founder and CEO of Aalo Atomics.

“This milestone groundbreaking event is a testament to the potential that can be unlocked when public entities and private companies partner together in the critical interest of the nation.

""This is a pivotal time for the US nuclear energy industry and we are incredibly proud to be at the forefront.”

The INL test site is designed to help validate technologies that support energy scalability and consistent output.

These features are increasingly vital for data centre operators searching for power sources that are both clean and reliable.

As data centres face growing scrutiny for their energy usage, modular nuclear solutions present a path toward zero-carbon operations.

“Today’s groundbreaking symbolises the progress that can be achieved when innovation, vision and national purpose come together,” says John Wagner, Laboratory Director at INL.

“At Idaho National Laboratory, we are proud to support the Department of Energy’s efforts to accelerate advanced nuclear technologies that strengthen America’s energy security, provide reliable power, and inspire the next generation of innovators.

“Projects like Aalo-X reflect the promise of nuclear energy to meet our nation’s historic demand growth and help enable a more prosperous future for our nation.”

Compact nuclear plants for low-impact energy

The Aalo-X serves as the testbed for the company’s commercial system: the Aalo Pod.

The Aalo Pod is a 50 megawatt-electric (MWe) XMR system made up of five Aalo-1 sodium-cooled reactors.

Each unit runs on low-enriched uranium dioxide fuel, chosen for both its availability and established safety record.

This approach limits supply chain challenges and enhances operational safety.

Unlike traditional nuclear plants, the Aalo Pod does not require an external water source.

It is designed for direct onsite deployment next to data centres, using a compact footprint and fully modular architecture.

This allows operators to scale output from megawatts to gigawatts with lower permitting complexity and minimal construction disruption.

A conceptual design of the Aalo Pod shows the units sited alongside data centres, offering a clear energy strategy for digital infrastructure.

This model helps reduce reliance on fossil fuels while avoiding the intermittency challenges faced by wind and solar.

The company is building the Aalo-X reactor at its 40,000-square-foot pilot facility in Austin, Texas.

Once complete, the reactor will be moved to INL for final installation and commissioning.

Aalo expects the operational insights gained from Aalo-X to shape the commercial rollout of the Aalo Pod, targeted for market introduction by 2029.

New nuclear for a new energy age

“When Aalo-X achieves criticality next year, it will become the first new sodium-cooled reactor to start operation in the US in over four decades,"" says Yasir Arafat, Co-Founder and CTO at Aalo Atomics, who previously led the MARVEL microreactor project at INL",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/1011a5382019bfd570c92988515022e4:c115da524dab3466e0e53a983d54c282/68acb1a2c872dd1078bdb349-screenshot-2025-08-25-at-1-54-28-pm-copy.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 05:59:34.842819

“We’re continuing our trend here of looking into the world and saying, ‘How do we advance fusion as fast as possible?’” co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard told TechCrunch. “This round of capital isn’t just about fusion, just generally as a concept, but it’s about how we go to make fusion into a commercial industrial endeavor.” The company has raised nearly $3 billion — the largest amount ever for any fusion startup.

Existing investors include Emerson Collective, Eni, Future Ventures, Gates Frontier, Google, Hostplus, Khosla Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, Safar Partners, Eric Schmidt, Starlight Ventures, and Tiger Global.

New investors like Brevan Howard, Morgan Stanley’s Counterpoint Global, Stanley Druckenmiller, FFA Private Bank in Dubai, Galaxy Interactive, Gigascale Capital, HOF Capital, Neva SGR, Planet First Partners, Woori Venture Partners US, and a consortium of 12 Japanese companies led by Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and Mitsubishi Corporation joined the round.

Fusion power has long been considered a nearly limitless energy source but it is only recently investors have started placing serious bets on it. In a fusion reaction, atoms are compressed and heated until they form a fourth state of matter known as plasma. On reaching a specific temperature and pressure, the atoms begin to fuse, releasing massive amounts of energy.

CFS is currently building a prototype reactor called Sparc in a Boston suburb. The company plans to get the reactor operating by next year, and hopes scientific breakeven in 2027, a milestone in which the fusion reaction produces more energy than was required to ignite it. While Sparc hasn’t been designed to sell power to the grid, it is vital for CFS.

“There are parts of the modeling and the physics that we don’t yet understand,” Saskia Mordijck, an associate professor of physics at the College of William and Mary, told TechCrunch. “It’s always an open question when you turn on a completely new device that it might go into plasma regimes we’ve never been into, that maybe we uncover things that we just did not expect.”

READ: Bill Gates drops out of the Top 10 rich list — What happened? (

If Sparc starts operating according to plan, CFS will start working on Arc, its commercial-scale power plant, in Virginia starting in 2027 or 2028.

Earlier in this year, Google announced it will buy 200 megawatts of clean fusion power produced by Arc as part of a partnership with CFS. Arc is expected to generate 400 megawatts of clean, zero-carbon power in the early 2030s, which is enough energy to power large industrial sites or roughly 150,000 homes. With this agreement, Google can also purchase power from additional Arc plants.

Mumgaard also told TechCrunch that while Sparc will help prove that the science is sound, it will do more than that for CFS. “That’s very important. But it’s also to know the capabilities that you need to be able to deliver it. It’s also to have the receipts, know what these things cost,” he said. He also added that while the latest funding round will help build Sparc, it wouldn’t be enough for Arc.

“The fact that it’s a first of a kind technology is a wrinkle that then has a big impact on where the capital will come from,” he said. “We’re not entirely sure, but we are pretty committed to doing this.

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It’s the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states’ climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans’ livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

In August of 2024, the United States reached a new monthly record for crude oil production at 13.4 million barrels per day (MMbbl/d).
The Permian Basin remains a cornerstone of that growth, accounting for nearly 50 percent of U.S. oil production and over 20 percent of U.S. natural gas output.
Despite this record production, the prolific basin is actively contributing to environmentally conscious progress in key areas like methane emissions intensity.
Progress like dramatic reductions in methane emissions intensity showcase that industry’s voluntary commitments and pledges to eliminate emissions can and do work.","The latest data from S&P Global Commodity Insights confirms what producers in the Permian Basin have long been showing: oil and natural gas assets can deliver record energy production while reducing emissions. According to S&P, methane emissions intensity in the Permian Basin has dramatically declined by more than 50 percent from 2022 to 2024. The decline is attributed to improved operations, upgraded equipment, and the utilization of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence.

Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights

Additionally, S&P’s recent data shows that since the end of 2022, absolute emissions in the Permian Basin have declined by 55.2 billion cubic feet (Bcf), which is equivalent to 28.2 million metric tons (MMT) of carbon emissions avoided. To put this reduction into perspective, the reduction is roughly the same as eliminating the annual emissions of an entire country the size of Lithuania, and greater than the greenhouse gas emissions from heating and cooling every home in California, as S&P notes..

Record production does not inhibit emissions reduction efforts

This impressive reduction comes amid record-setting oil production for the country. The United States has produced more crude oil than any nation at any time for the past six years in a row, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). In August of 2024, the United States reached a new monthly record for crude oil production at 13.4 million barrels per day (MMbbl/d).

The Permian Basin remains a cornerstone of that growth, accounting for nearly 50 percent of U.S. oil production and over 20 percent of U.S. natural gas output. Despite this record production, the prolific basin is actively contributing to environmentally conscious progress in key areas like methane emissions intensity.

As Energy in Depth has previously analyzed, data from the Environmental Protection Agency shows that Permian methane emissions have fallen 32 percent since 2019, even as production surged 51 percent during the same time period. That’s a perfect example of how energy growth and environmental goals can go hand in hand.

Industry leads voluntary emissions reduction efforts

Notably, American oil and gas companies have been at the forefront of voluntary efforts, commitments, and programs to reduce methane emissions – which are exactly what lead to impressive declines in emissions like those reflected in S&P Global’s recent data.

Industry groups like the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership, The Environmental Partnership, ONE Future, and the Texas Methane and Flaring Coalition all work to bring together the country’s top oil and gas producers to work towards common goals like improving methane emissions reporting, ending routine flaring, and sharing of best practices for emissions detection.

Following the release of the latest S&P data, the Texas Methane and Flaring Coalition emphasized:

“Our members have consistently demonstrated a sincere and deep commitment to reducing the level of methane intensity levels—efforts that are clearly working. Since the Coalition’s inception in 2019, operators have made significant progress in ending the practice of routine flaring, and as this new data confirms, achieved extraordinary methane intensity reduction alongside record production levels.”

Rather than penalizing American producers, who have already delivered results on the ground, policymakers should continue to collaborate with the industry to develop fair emissions reduction policies.

Kotek's proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state's gas tax.
The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028.
In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections.
“We are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,” Morgan said.","PORTLAND, Oregon — Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers begin a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.

Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers' jobs are in limbo, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.

Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.

The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.

“This is a pretty major change,” said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state fiscal policy team, noting “the challenge in enacting something that’s dramatically different for most drivers.”

Oregon's transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.

Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.

Kotek's proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state's gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.

The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn't have to pay supplemental registration fees.

Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle's telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state's decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.

As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state's total vehicles, he said.

Under Hawaii's program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.

In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.

Oregon's voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they're more expensive and can be removed, he added.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.

Many people don't realize that ""both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,” said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.

Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.

“We are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,” Morgan said.",https://media.kgw.com/assets/KGW/images/a85ce34f-da03-4378-b580-1a73c2a7a0c6/20250425T144206/a85ce34f-da03-4378-b580-1a73c2a7a0c6_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 05:59:57.501396

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It’s the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states’ climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans’ livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

Speaking at the company’s annual general meeting for the first time, Anant Ambani, Executive Director and son of Chairman Mukesh Ambani, laid out the company’s vision to create one of the world’s most integrated renewable energy ecosystems — spanning solar modules, batteries, electrolysers, and green fuels like ammonia and methanol.

Reliance is investing in the entire clean energy value chain: from producing solar modules and energy storage systems to building electrolysers that use renewable electricity to generate hydrogen — seen as a key fuel for the future. The company also plans to produce sustainable aviation fuel and biofuels from organic waste for both domestic use and export.

“We are building platforms to deliver a comprehensive clean energy ecosystem — solar, battery storage, hydrogen — all at scale and under one umbrella,” said Anant Ambani. The products manufactured at these giga factories will support 24/7 renewable electricity supply and help produce green chemicals including green ammonia, e-methanol, and sustainable aviation fuels.

Jamnagar, already home to Reliance’s twin oil refineries — the world’s largest refining complex — is being transformed into the base for the company’s renewable energy ambitions. Construction of the Dhirubhai Ambani Giga Energy Complex is progressing rapidly and is expected to become the world’s largest clean energy hub in terms of scale and integration.

“Jamnagar will represent both the legacy of conventional energy and the future of new energy,” Mr Ambani said. Reliance has already begun producing solar photovoltaic modules at its Jamnagar facility. The company aims to scale up to a capacity of 20 GWp in the coming quarters, making it the largest single-site solar manufacturing facility in the world.

So far, it has successfully produced its first 200 MW of heterojunction (HJT) modules, which offer better performance and durability compared to conventional modules.

Alongside solar, the company is also building battery and electrolyser giga factories. The battery facility, scheduled to open in 2026, will start with an annual capacity of 40 GWh and expand to 100 GWh in phases. The electrolyser plant, also set to be operational by the end of 2026, will have the ability to scale up to 3 GW annually — supporting cost-effective hydrogen production on a global scale.

In Kutch, Gujarat, Reliance is developing one of the largest single-site solar projects in the world, covering 550,000 acres of arid land. At full pace, the site will deploy 55 MW of solar modules and 150 MWh of battery containers every day. Once complete, it could supply nearly 10% of India’s electricity demand within the next decade.

The company’s logistics and port infrastructure in Jamnagar and Kandla will support export operations for green hydrogen derivatives such as ammonia and methanol.

“India can become a global leader in affordable green hydrogen and its derivatives,” said Ambani, noting that the initial phase of production will serve the company’s own needs before scaling to 3 million tonnes per year by 2032.

Reliance is also focusing on bioenergy. It is building compressed biogas (CBG) plants with a target capacity of 0.5 million tonnes per year, aiming to scale to over 500 plants by 2030.

To support this, the company has set up the world’s largest Bioenergy Technology and R&D Centre in Jamnagar, where it is developing advanced technologies to increase biogas yields, including enzymes, microbes, and high-efficiency energy crops.

As part of its broader clean energy strategy, Reliance is also launching integrated energy hubs that combine smart farming, biogas and hydrogen production, agrivoltaics (dual land use for agriculture and solar power), and battery storage. These hubs aim to capture CO2 from CBG plants for green chemical production, targeting cost parity with fossil fuels.",https://themachinemaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Anant-Ambani-Executive-Director.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 12:04:17.443511

The U.S. Department of Interior is not saying yes, or no.

In a letter on Aug. 22, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Acting Director Matthew Giacona said his directive to halt work on the Revolution Wind project was due to agency concerns related to the protection of national security interests and the “prevention of interference with reasonable uses” of the ocean under federal law.

A subsequent statement from an Interior Department spokesperson had a different tone.

“Americans deserve energy that is affordable, reliable, and built to last — not experimental and expensive wind projects that are proven failures,” Deputy Press Secretary Aubrie Spady said. “In line with President Donald Trump’s Energy Dominance Agenda, Interior is putting an immediate stop to these costly failures to deliver a stronger energy future and lower costs for American families.

Revolution Wind has 20-year power purchase agreements to deliver 400 megawatts of electricity to Rhode Island and 304 MW to Connecticut, enough to power more than 350,000 homes across both states. Vineyard Wind 1 is exporting power from 17 of 62 planned turbines and plans to have construction completed by the end of the year.

Organizations that represent New England area power generators and the electric grid operator warned that suspension of the in-progress Revolution Wind project puts the region’s energy reliability at risk.

Reliance Industries is shifting from fossil fuels to clean energy. The company plans a mega battery plant by 2026. It will build a solar project larger than Singapore. Reliance aims for 3 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2032. Anant Ambani envisions an integrated new energy ecosystem.

Reliance Industries Ltd is accelerating its pivot away from fossil fuels with a sweeping clean energy strategy. The company plans to launch a mega battery manufacturing plant by 2026, build a solar power project larger than Singapore, and achieve 3 million tonnes of green hydrogen capacity by 2032.

Making his first appearance at Reliance’s Annual General Meeting, Anant Ambani — the youngest son of chairman Mukesh Ambani and executive director of the company — outlined a vision to create the world’s most integrated new energy ecosystem, spanning “from sand to electrons to green molecules.”

Fully Integrated Green Energy Platform

Reliance is investing in every link of the clean energy chain:

Solar modules to generate electricity from sunlight.

Advanced batteries to store renewable power.

Electrolysers to produce green hydrogen by splitting water molecules.

Giga factories to manufacture hydrogen and its derivatives, including green ammonia, green methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.

Biofuels derived from organic waste.

According to Anant Ambani, these facilities will enable round-the-clock renewable energy supply and support both domestic use and exports of clean fuels.

The centrepiece of this transformation is the Dhirubhai Ambani Giga Energy Complex in Jamnagar, already home to Reliance’s massive oil refining operations. Once complete, it will be the world’s largest integrated clean energy hub, producing solar modules, batteries, and hydrogen derivatives at unparalleled scale.

Live Events

Reliance has already started scaling its solar PV manufacturing line at Jamnagar to 20 GWp capacity, which would make it the largest single-site solar facility in the world. The company has rolled out its first 200 MW of high-efficiency HJT modules, which offer higher energy yields and lower degradation compared to conventional panels.

In parallel, construction of battery and electrolyser giga factories is underway. The battery plant, set to start production in 2026, will begin with 40 GWh annual capacity and eventually expand to 100 GWh. The electrolyser facility, also targeted for 2026, will scale up to 3 GW per year and enable globally competitive hydrogen production.

Mega projects in Gujarat

Reliance’s clean energy ambitions are concentrated in Gujarat. In Kutch, the company is developing one of the world’s largest single-site solar projects, covering 550,000 acres — nearly three times Singapore’s land area. At peak installation, Reliance expects to deploy 55 MW of solar modules and 150 MWh of battery containers per day. Within a decade, this single project could meet nearly 10% of India’s electricity demand.

The Jamnagar and Kandla ports will provide the critical infrastructure backbone, enabling Reliance to export green ammonia, e-methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel. By 2032, the group aims to produce the equivalent of 3 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually, establishing India as a hub for affordable clean fuels.

Beyond solar and hydrogen, Reliance is scaling its compressed biogas (CBG) operations. The company has set an ambitious target of over 500 CBG plants by 2030, with a combined capacity of 0.5 million tonnes per year. At its Bioenergy Technology and R&D Centre in Jamnagar, Reliance is developing next-generation enzymes, microbial solutions, and high-yield crops to enhance biogas productivity.

Anant Ambani also highlighted the company’s agrivoltaics model, which integrates solar and biogas production on the same land. By capturing carbon dioxide from CBG plants, these hubs will become centers for producing green chemicals. The approach, he noted, delivers a “triple value” — generating renewable gas, electricity, and boosting rural incomes for farmers.

However, the special session got off to a rocky start: The state Senate met as scheduled at 9 a.m., but the state House failed to reach the two-thirds quorum required to conduct business, leaving the session in limbo as of late Friday afternoon.

Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers’ jobs are at risk, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.

Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.

The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.

“This is a pretty major change,” said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state fiscal policy team, noting “the challenge in enacting something that’s dramatically different for most drivers.”

Oregon’s transportation woes

Oregon’s transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.

Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.

Kotek’s proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state’s gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.

The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn’t have to pay supplemental registration fees.

Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle’s telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state’s decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.

Republican lawmakers, who have opposed the tax and fee increases, unveiled a different proposal Friday that largely focuses on lifting funding restrictions to allow the transportation department to spend more money on maintenance operations, including by redirecting dollars earmarked for public transit and efforts to combat climate change toward such operations. It does not include a road usage charge.

As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state’s total vehicles, he said.

Hawaii launches program

Under Hawaii’s program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.

In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.

Questions about privacy and fairness

In past surveys commissioned by Oregon’s transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.

Oregon’s voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they’re more expensive and can be removed, he added.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.

Many people don’t realize that “both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,” said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.

Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.

“We are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,” Morgan said.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/6568c63/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2268+0+210/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F26%2F54%2F8c02b5b7edbcc5be9891313564b5%2Fd787cf5ed986407e99fde10e6ead8a17,N,,2025-08-30 03:59:10.105644

Maybe you have a chassis that's in beautiful shape in your garage, but its engine shot a rod through the block a few months back and it's just been sitting ever since. Well, a team of Australia's top engineer-scientists have developed a novel method of converting your gas car to an EV without need for heavy batteries or enormous motors: Just weld a garage door motor to the differential, and plug the whole thing into the wall.

The mad geniuses over at Garbage Time have done it again. After pulling the Barra inline-six from a Ford Falcon, Wade and James didn't want to push the shell all the way across the garage to be picked up for scrap with their bare hands. Instead, the pair decided to bring the old Falcon into the future, outfitting it with a full 750 watts of electric power and an extension cord.

That setup didn't exactly account for ""pedals,"" but that's fine. A single switch mounted atop the driver's airbag controls whether the rear motor is on or off, and the steering still seems to work. What else could a car need? Sure, the car may not be fast, but it does drive. It also can't shift into reverse without rewiring the plug on the extension cord, but that's fine. Oh, yeah, and you have to be very careful not to run over the extension cord — though, if you do, you can just coat the newly-stripped cable in tape and mount it to the door so it doesn't touch the oil leak.

Sign up to get it every Friday.

President Donald Trump has put energy front and center during his second term. On his first day in office alone, he froze spending under the Inflation Reduction Act, took a wrecking ball to offshore wind, and declared an “energy emergency,” citing affordability and grid reliability issues.

Critics have dismissed the emergency as a fabrication. Attorneys general from 15 states are challenging it in court. And Trump, whose policies are slowing the construction of cheap, clean energy, is not exactly acting like there’s an emergency at hand.

Take the Revolution Wind project as the latest example. Last Friday, the Trump administration ordered developer Ørsted to stop all construction on the huge, nearly complete project, citing unspecified “national security” reasons. It’s the second time the government has issued such an order to an offshore wind project that would’ve brought clean power to the Northeast.

The stoppage poses a real threat to the grid in New England, which is home to some of the highest power prices in the nation.

Revolution Wind was supposed to start delivering power next year — very soon in grid-planning terms. ISO-New England, the region’s grid operator, said Monday that it is banking on the wind farm to help meet demand and maintain power reserves. Further delays will continue the region’s reliance on natural gas, which ISO-New England has warned is in short supply and which is subject to price volatility.

Blocking major energy projects from coming online is not exactly consistent with declaring an energy emergency.

And yet, the Revolution Wind pause is just one example of how the administration is stymieing clean energy deployment. In recent months, it has rolled back federal subsidies and grants and implemented new federal leasing rules under which renewables are doomed to fail. Because of these policies, the country is expected to build less than half as much clean energy over the next decade — an outcome experts widely agree will raise power prices.

In fact, the only place the administration has acted as if its emergency is real is when it comes to preserving fossil-fuel power plants on the brink of closure.

The U.S. Department of Energy recently extended its emergency order barring a Michigan coal plant from retiring — a decision that cost the plant’s owner $29 million in its first five weeks. And on Thursday, the DOE extended another order keeping a Pennsylvania gas- and oil-fired peaker plant online. Regional grid operators had previously deemed both plants safe to close.

The moves reveal the incoherence at the heart of Trump’s energy policy, which exploits a questionable emergency to prop up expensive and unnecessary fossil-fueled power plants on the one hand — and blocks the fastest-growing and lowest-cost form of energy on the other.

Clean energy is getting its own day of action

If you’ve read even one edition of this newsletter since Trump took office, you’ll know that clean energy is facing a crisis in the U.S. Sun Day aims to elevate that message and boost the transition from fossil fuels with a nationwide day of action coming up on Sept. 21, Canary Media’s Alison F. Takemura reports.

The brainchild of climate journalist and activist Bill McKibben, Sun Day looks a lot like Earth Day. Advocacy groups and individuals will hold more than 150 events across the country, offering tours of homes with rooftop solar arrays, EV test drives, and other just-plain-fun activities like performances and face painting.

Two nuclear plants inch closer to “renaissance”

Two retired nuclear plants each took a step toward restarting this week. On Monday, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved a waiver that will let the Duane Arnold plant in Iowa move toward restarting, which plant owner NextEra Energy hopes to do by 2029. And in Michigan, the Palisades plant has returned to operational status after being decommissioned for three years. The designation just means it can start receiving fuel again — it’s not yet generating electricity.

The Trump administration is pushing for a “nuclear renaissance,” both through the development of new advanced nuclear reactors and the reopening of large, retired facilities. The administration and nuclear advocates say the power source can help meet growing electricity demand, though the U.S.’s most recent attempt to build a new nuclear plant took years and billions of dollars more than expected.

Fifteen minutes after the 26-year-old drove home, a roar thundered from the plant where he helped mix chemicals for motor oil and had just punched out. Fire consumed the air, the collapsing metal groaning and liquids hissing as they escaped into the surrounding water, soil, and air. From his yard, he saw neighbors pointing at the rising smoke, not knowing he had been inside the plant only minutes before.

Last Friday afternoon, Aug. 22, a catastrophic explosion erupted at Smitty’s Supply, a major lubricant manufacturing facility in a predominantly Black town about 60 miles northeast of Baton Rouge. The blaze swept through the 15-acre complex that housed half a million gallons of flammable materials.

Oily droplets spattered from the smoky sky as far as 20 miles away, coating rooftops, cars, and front lawns in a slick, shimmering film that glistened like tar. Cancer-causing air toxics such as benzene can be released in refinery and lubricant fires; officials say sampling is underway.

Although no deaths had been reported as of Thursday, the fire inflicted environmental anxiety, residents said. The inferno at Smitty’s Supply is just the latest flashpoint as states and the federal government make it harder to hold industrial companies accountable for damage by rolling back regulations and oversight.

“They don’t care about us,” said Taylor, referring to both the industrial company and government officials. “There is no way people don’t get sick, because we need help over here and we’re not getting it.”

Last year, Louisiana became the focal point for the erosion of civil rights protections against environmental injustice. A state court case stopped the federal government from using the Civil Rights Act to block the expansion of toxic facilities in Black communities.

Now, under the Trump administration, permits for polluting plants are being approved with little oversight. Facilities are also allowed to release more chemicals into the environment as parts of the Clean Air Act get weakened.

At the same time, the administration has moved to repeal a Biden administration rule that strengthened the country’s ability to plan for and address the fallout from hazardous industrial events. These disasters overwhelmingly burden Black families, who are more likely to live nearby and face the greatest health, economic, and environmental harms.

On Aug. 22, more than 80% of residents in the town, including Taylor, were forced to abandon their homes. Over 250 people crammed into a tiny community center overnight, with most sleeping on plastic chairs. Roseland’s mayor and housing director, who handled the evacuation, did not respond to requests for comment.

By Aug. 26, most of the community returned to their homes, but the air remained heavy with the pungent scent of petroleum.

“I’m probably already sick with something,” said Tevin Moore, 33, another former employee of Smitty’s Supply. On Sunday, Taylor and Moore were laid off, along with hundreds of other employees, from the plant. They both said they were offered about $250 in monthly severance.

In every reporting period since 2022, Smitty’s has been cited for significant Clean Water Act violations. The Clean Water Act is the nation’s governing law regarding water safety, but the Trump administration has proposed weakening the rule. Among those violations, the company reported polluting local waterways with organic chemicals, which may include benzene and toluene, at approximately 20 times the legal limit, oil and grease at over four times the cap, and fecal bacteria at four times the cap.

Residents here are exposed to more oil and gas facilities than 90% of Americans and face higher rates of respiratory illness than 95% of the country. As soot from the explosion settles on playgrounds and porches, many locals say the consequences of industry-friendly policies and the erosion of civil rights guardrails are evident.

Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry cautioned residents not to clean their homes until investigators have determined what chemicals are in the ash. He said at a press conference that the explosion had not caused an “immediate danger to wildlife or to human health.”

State health departments say breathing oil fumes for even a day can cause severe lung irritation, peeling skin, and chemical pneumonitis, and may also trigger neurologic effects and more serious health problems such as cancer, liver and kidney damage, and blood effects.

On Monday, the regional Environmental Protection Agency took over the cleanup of the disaster. Still, residents expressed distrust in the process. The current head of the regional department, appointed by President Donald Trump, is Scott Mason, a former energy official for the state of Oklahoma. Mason was also an author of the Project 2025 plan that called for ending certain pollution regulations, toxic chemical clean-up programs, and research on the impact of pollution on human health.

“I can’t trust them, and I also can’t do it myself,” said Mary, a 68-year-old resident. “I’m just going to have to leave it and hope for the best.”

In a statement issued Tuesday, Smitty’s Supply apologized to the community and its employees. One of the plant executives’ daughters, Bethany Tate, however, said in a Facebook post that “no one was to blame.” An investigation on the cause of the explosion is underway.

Taylor and Moore, who both said they routinely saw chemical fires in the plant, took exception to that comment.

“They never gave us [personal protective equipment] when we worked there, and it smelled just like this. Now we’re going to be walking in and touching oil for weeks,” Moore said.

Since 2020, Smitty’s has faced five serious labor violations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, including four for grease fires and one for a fatal incident, where a worker was struck and killed by a trailer.

The company has vowed to rebuild. Residents told Capital B they have mixed feelings about the facility’s possible return because of the health risks. Despite those concerns, some here would welcome the economic benefits of a new facility.

More than half of Roseland residents — and 90% of its children — live in poverty. In the town of 1,200, Smitty’s, which employed roughly 450 people, was an economic lifesaver. Without it, some residents said it will be harder for people to support themselves financially.

“People are gonna find themselves in the trenches,” Taylor said.

With Environmental Protections Erased, Residents Fend for Themselves

About 1.5 miles away from the plant, Patricia Thomas was mopping the black sheen from her kitchen floor on Tuesday morning when the smell grabbed her throat. Her eyes burned, and the oily grit stuck to her shoes, tracking in from her yard. In her front yard, her green bushes had turned gray, and the mailbox was stuck shut with the black substance that had rained down in the explosion. She has to keep her great‑grandbaby away now. Even her cats, who often go outside, often return to her house streaked in a tar-like substance.

The 65-year-old said she survives on her $450 per month Social Security income. A week ago, she charged over $1,000 on her credit card at Home Depot for new wood paneling for her trailer and paid roofers to lay fresh shingles to stop a leak. The panels are now speckled and tacky to the touch, the shingles already lifting.

“They’re acting like no one is responsible, but I know for sure who isn’t responsible — we didn’t do it,” she said. “Who is paying for it?”

Thomas, who retired early due to health reasons, said issues with her back and shoulders make it difficult for her to scrub the black mystery substance that now coats her porch, fencing, and floors. She is afraid to touch any of it, afraid not to.

“This stuff could kill me if I touch it,” she said, “but what about if I keep tracking it in my house, too?”

At a community meeting on Monday, where many attendees expressed anger that no representatives from Smitty’s Supply or its insurance company were present, neighbors were advised to consult a civil lawyer. Already, six residents have filed lawsuits against the company. But Thomas did the math and shook her head.

“I don’t have money for a lawyer,” she said. “I barely cover my bills.” If there is a class action, maybe she will be included, she said. Otherwise, she worries she will be left to choose between breathing toxic this air and going deeper into debt to clean a mess she did not make.

Both Thomas and Mary said their anxiety levels have already increased.

Following a similar chemical fire in Illinois in 2021, a government survey found that half of the neighboring city’s residents experienced new or worsened health issues. And in 2019, a similar explosion led to residents in France reporting increased stress, depression, insomnia, and anxiety for a year after the event.

Just a year ago, residents in this majority-Black, low-income town would have had the legal right and avenue to petition the government to investigate the company and the disaster for elements of discrimination and wrongdoing. It would also be more difficult for the company to secure pollution permits to reopen operations.

Today, they said they’re left with complimentary water bottles and cleaning supplies.

“In the long run, this is gonna mess up for a long time, and they don’t care because of who lives here,” Taylor said, referring to what she sees as discrimination against Black people. “We don’t know what’s in this air right now or what might be in our water and bodies.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/explosion.webp,N,,2025-08-30 03:59:50.180914

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the Alliance for the Climate Transition (ACT), and the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA) applaud Governor Healey for taking decisive action through SMART 3.0 to ensure cost-effective solar generation can come online at a time when federal policies and red tape are raising energy prices.

SMART 3.0 demonstrates the Commonwealth’s commitment to protecting ratepayers, supporting local jobs and meeting growing electricity demand. The Final Regulations and the plans for the initial years of the program clear a path for projects that can leverage the expiring federal tax credits. At a time when we need every electron we can get, solar and storage can come online faster than any other technology and SMART 3.0 will help make that happen.

“The Healey-Driscoll Administration’s release of SMART 3.0 charts a strong path for community and commercial scale solar and storage in Massachusetts and will be critical for driving down energy costs for families,” said Valessa Souter-Kline, SEIA’s Northeast regional director. “We look forward to working with state leaders on implementation to ensure the solar and storage industry continues to create good jobs and can deliver clean, reliable, affordable energy that people across Massachusetts are demanding.”

“With SMART 3.0, Gov. Healey and the DOER team have risen to the occasion to tackle the challenges of our energy system head on,” said Kate Daniel, Northeast Regional Director for CCSA. “Going big on solar now is the best way to unlock affordable, local, clean energy generation for the Commonwealth, while putting savings into the pockets of the energy consumers who need them most.”

“Given the difficult federal climate, it is more important than ever that states step up to play a leading role in strategically crafting thoughtful, targeted programs to unleash clean energy and address rising energy costs,” said Tim Snyder, ACT’s VP of Public Policy and Government Affairs. “That is what the Healey-Driscoll Administration has done with SMART 3.0. We are excited to engage with the legislature and administration to shape legislation that complements these regulations and creates the right landscape for solar projects of all sizes and types, from residential to large arrays.”

The updated program builds on a proven track record while making needed improvements to respond to market conditions on an annual basis, rather than keeping the former rigid pricing structure intact. It addresses implementation challenges raised in the review process to make sure program requirements for site selection and energy storage achieve their intended policy goals. The SMART 3.0 rules aim to better serve low-income customers and improve consumer confidence in solar.

Experts are available for interview.

Georgia Power owns and operates 15 hydro generation facilities, with an ownership interest in a 16th, for a total of 66 hydroelectric generating units in Georgia and over 1,100 MW of hydroelectric capacity. The utility continues to make investments in its hydro fleet with the review and approval of the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC). Most recently, the company received approval in the 2025 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) to further modernize its hydro fleet with additional investments and upgrades at the Tallulah, Yonah, Bartlett’s Ferry, and North Highlands hydro facilities.

The company’s investments in its hydro facilities address essential equipment that has reached or is nearing the end of its useful life and requires modernization investments to continue their generating capability and maintain compliance with their FERC licenses. Hydro modernization projects include critical replacements and/or refurbishments needed for turbines, generators, and balance of plant equipment. These investments are designed to allow these resources to operate for at least another 40 years while improving the efficiency and integrity of the hydro fleet and preserving valuable, dispatchable carbon-free resources for the long-term benefit of customers.

The Northeast faces distinct challenges, including transportation electrification, aging infrastructure, renewable integration, grid modernization, and increasingly severe weather. DTECH® Northeast will assemble leading stakeholders to tackle these issues head-on, offering insights into cutting-edge technologies and strategies that ensure reliability, sustainability, and customer satisfaction. Join us in Boston, Massachusetts, from November 17-19, 2025!

“For more than a century, Georgians have enjoyed reliable electricity from our hydro plants located on lakes and rivers across the state,” said Rick Anderson, Georgia Power senior vice president and senior production officer for Georgia Power. “As we continue to work with the Georgia PSC to invest in our generation fleet to meet the needs of a growing Georgia, modernizing our hydro facilities helps to ensure continued compliance with federal regulations and our licenses, as well as providing additional longevity for the units and overall value for customers.”

Georgia Power recently filed an update on hydro modernization progress with the Georgia PSC, which included the completion of the scope of work for all four units at Plant Tugalo. Tugalo Units 1-4 are part of the North Georgia hydro group, located near Turnerville, and began operation in 1923 and 1924. The scope of work included generator replacements, turbine replacements, and replacement of the balance of plant (BOP) systems, such as lubricating oil, service water systems, 480-volt switchgear, and the plant control system. Completion of this work at Tugalo follows similar work at nearby Plant Terrora, which was completed several years ago.

The filing also noted progress in work at Plants Bartlett’s Ferry, Nacoochee, Oliver, Burton, and Sinclair. Notably, work on Bartlett’s Ferry Unit 1 has been completed, and the unit returned to service in July of this year. Plant Bartlett’s Ferry Units 1-4 are part of the Chattahoochee hydro group, located north of Columbus on the Chattahoochee River. Units 1-3 entered service in the 1920s, with Unit 4 entering service in 1951.

This, in addition to other actions taken by the Trump administration, puts hundreds of projects in California at risk of stalling and makes energy more expensive for consumers. These projects will create thousands of good-paying jobs, power thousands of homes, and add critical clean electricity capacity to the state’s power grid.

Full text of the Governor’s executive order is available here.

No other state in the nation has built as much clean energy as fast as California – it’s why we just recently became the largest economy on the planet to be powered by two-thirds clean electricity.

While Trump and Republicans want to bring back the days of dirty coal powering our homes, polluting our air and increasing our electric bills, California will continue our decades of progress building our affordable, clean, reliable energy future.

Governor Gavin Newsom

Trump’s biased, 19th century energy policies mean dirtier, more expensive electricity and higher risk of power outages. A recent study by Energy Innovation expects Californians to pay over $320 more a year for energy thanks to Trump’s backward energy policies. Overall, Americans will be forced to pay $170 billion in added costs on their energy bills while hundreds of thousands of jobs are lost and hundreds of thousands of megawatts in added electricity capacity never get built.

Today’s executive order:

Designates the Energy Working Group of the Governor’s Infrastructure Strike Team to track projects eligible for tax credits and state agencies’ actions to accelerate clean energy project development.

Directs relevant state agencies to prioritize actions within their purview that support projects beginning construction before July 4, 2026 or coming online by December 31, 2027 to capture the expiring federal tax credits.

Directs state energy agencies to assess actions both to capture expiring clean energy tax credits and to further expedite clean energy deployment, and to submit recommendations to the Governor for consideration.

The Governor also continues to work with the Legislature to enable the expansion of regional energy markets to lower energy costs, reduce air pollution, and avoid power outages.

California’s climate leadership

Pollution is down and the economy is up. Greenhouse gas emissions in California are down 20% since 2000 – even as the state’s GDP increased 78% in that same time period.

The state also continues to set clean energy records. California was powered by two-thirds clean energy in 2023, the latest year for which data is available – the largest economy in the world to achieve this level of clean energy. The state has run on 100% clean electricity for some part of the day almost every day this year.

Since the beginning of the Newsom Administration, battery storage is up to over 15,000 megawatts – a 1,900%+ increase, and over 25,000 megawatts of new resources have been added to the electric grid.",https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/clean-energy-EO-3.png,N,,2025-08-30 05:59:19.791437

The Kentucky plant in Georgetown will assemble Toyota’s first U.S.-built battery electric vehicle starting soon.
In Indiana, Toyota has committed another $1.4 billion to prepare its Princeton plant for a separate three-row electric SUV.
One frequent rumor is the name of Toyota’s three-row EV.","(TestMiles) – Toyota is investing billions in U.S. manufacturing and EVs, but rumors continue to swirl about even bolder future products. Separating fact from speculation matters for both buyers and industry insiders.

Why does this matter right now?

Toyota is not dabbling in electrification; it is betting billions. Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina is scheduled to open soon with fourteen lines for hybrid and battery output. The site covers more than 1,800 acres, carries a price tag of nearly 13.9 billion dollars, and is expected to employ about 5,100 people. The factory will feed batteries to U.S.-built hybrids and EVs for both Toyota and Lexus, forming the backbone of Toyota’s electrification strategy in America.

Two new three-row EVs are confirmed. The Kentucky plant in Georgetown will assemble Toyota’s first U.S.-built battery electric vehicle starting soon. A 1.3 billion dollar investment adds battery pack assembly to the facility, tying production directly to the North Carolina supply chain. In Indiana, Toyota has committed another $1.4 billion to prepare its Princeton plant for a separate three-row electric SUV. Together, these programs signal that Toyota is not just selling EVs in the U.S. But it is building them here.

How does it compare to rivals?

Rivals have already planted their flags. Tesla operates a vertically integrated model from Nevada to Texas. Hyundai’s metaplant in Georgia is scaling up for EVs across several of its brands. Toyota’s plan is different: decentralized, multi-state, and methodical. By splitting battery, pack, and vehicle assembly, Toyota spreads risk, uses existing facilities, and leverages its hybrid expertise while competitors chase scale in single mega-plants.

For now, Toyota’s current models like the Crown Signia also play a different game. The Signia is hybrid only, with 240 horsepower, standard all wheel drive, up to 2,700 pounds of towing capacity, and 38 mpg combined efficiency. Its pricing just above 44,000 dollars slots it neatly between mainstream SUVs and Lexus territory. By focusing on hybrids with premium touches, Toyota continues to exploit an efficiency gap while rivals rush into full battery electric territory.

Who is this for, and who should skip it?

If you are an industry professional, this story underlines where Toyota is putting its real money. For consumers, it clarifies what is available now, the Crown sedan and Signia SUV, and what will be available soon, namely, Toyota’s first U.S.-built EVs. Enthusiasts and speculators, however, will want to lean into the second half of this story: the rumors Toyota is not confirming.

And Now for the Speculation: Toyota is not confirming.

This is where things get interesting. Industry chatter often fills the vacuum left by Toyota’s conservative announcements. Some speculation is logical, some fanciful, and all of it has been downplayed by Toyota spokesperson Nathan Kokes, who has emphasized that only announcements made by Toyota should be considered fact. Kokes went on to tell us, “To improve manufacturing efficiencies and better serve customers based on market demand, Toyota is strategically transitioning production across our plants in Kentucky and Indiana”.

Kokes went on to say, “As previously announced, Toyota plans to produce two all-new, three-row battery electric SUVs in the U.S. Toyota will now assemble both vehicles at Toyota Kentucky.” And “Toyota Indiana will continue to assemble the Grand Highlander in its west plant and add assembly of the vehicle to its east plant to accommodate increased production volume”. Finally, Kokes gave some insight into Toyota’s commitment to its workforce by saying, “We remain committed to providing long-term job stability for our team members.”

But the speculation from some persists. One frequent rumor is the name of Toyota’s three-row EV. Outlets often label it the “bZ5X,” following Toyota’s bZ (beyond zero) naming convention. Others expect a Lexus version called the “TZ.” Toyota has never confirmed these names, and official channels continue to describe the projects simply as future three-row battery electric SUVs.

The Crown line is another hotbed of rumor. In Japan, the Crown family includes sedan, crossover, sport, and estate body styles. Some observers expect Toyota to expand the U.S. Crown line beyond the sedan and Signia SUV, potentially with a larger three-row premium vehicle or a sportier fastback. At this time, Toyota has not confirmed such plans, but marketing material in the U.S. clearly positions Crown as a “family” of models, hinting at long-term potential.

Trucks and off-roaders draw even more speculation. At the 2023 Japan Mobility Show, Toyota revealed the EPU concept, a compact electric pickup with a footprint similar to a Ford Maverick. Many expect this to morph into a U.S. product, but Toyota has never confirmed American production. Similarly, Toyota showed the Compact Cruiser EV, a boxy small SUV in the vein of an FJ or Bronco Sport rival. Rumors continue that Toyota could launch a rugged EV or hybrid under the Land Cruiser or FJ nameplates, but again, no confirmation exists. The only rugged revival officially on the books is the Land Cruiser hybrid, which is already in American showrooms.

There are even whispers of a new sub-brand dedicated to electrification. Commentators suggest Toyota could spin off its EVs into a distinct nameplate, following the path of Lexus in the 1980s or Prius in the 2000s. Toyota has never acknowledged this idea, and so far, the closest evidence is the consistent branding of “bZ” on its vehicles.

What is the long-term significance?

The long-term view is two-sided. On the one hand, the confirmed investments are enormous and concrete. North Carolina, Kentucky, and Indiana will become the core of Toyota’s American electrification strategy, and the Crown family already plants Toyota’s premium flag between Toyota and Lexus. On the other hand, the speculation illustrates the appetite for Toyota to do more: a compact truck to take on Ford, a rugged EV to challenge Bronco, or a broader Crown brand to pull buyers away from Acura and Infiniti. For now, those remain rumors, and Toyota has made it clear that only official announcements are the truth.",https://www.wjtv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/72/2025/08/Tacoma_Overlanding_Concept_Action_SEMA_2021_Hi-Res_15-600x400-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-30 00:59:26.160904

Yet, some experts counter that higher effective new EV prices could drive shoppers to used options, propping up resale values.
Historical trends from the early 2010s, when initial EV incentives waned, saw used prices stabilize or even rise temporarily as supply tightened.
In Q3 2025 reports, used EV prices are already volatile, with models like the Nissan Leaf dropping 15% year-over-year amid subsidy jitters.
Will used EV values tank due to lost affordability, or rise as the cheaper alternative?","As the clock ticks toward September 30, 2025, the federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credits are set to expire, marking the end of a significant era in U.S. auto policy. Under the current system, buyers of new EVs can claim up to $7,500, while used models qualify for up to $4,000—subsidies designed to boost adoption amid climate goals. But with Congress passing legislation to terminate these incentives, the ""Fed money"" vanishes, leaving a big question: What happens to new and used EV prices? Will used values soar or plummet? Will new prices drop to lure buyers, or will sales simply freeze?

Let's break it down. For new EVs, the removal of the $7,500 credit effectively hikes the cost to consumers overnight. Economists argue this could dampen demand, especially as EVs already face hurdles like charging infrastructure and range anxiety. Manufacturers like Tesla, Ford, and GM might respond by slashing MSRPs or offering deeper discounts to maintain volume—similar to how the industry reacted to past incentive phase-outs. However, if production costs remain high due to battery prices and supply chain issues, prices could hold steady, leading to a sales slowdown rather than a drop. Recent data shows uncertainty is already fueling a rush in 2025 sales, with new EV registrations up amid fears of post-subsidy sticker shock. But once the credits end, analysts predict a potential 20-30% dip in demand, forcing automakers to choose between profit margins and market share.

The used EV market adds another layer of complexity. Without the $4,000 credit, affordability takes a hit, potentially tanking values as budget-conscious buyers shy away. Yet, some experts counter that higher effective new EV prices could drive shoppers to used options, propping up resale values. Historical trends from the early 2010s, when initial EV incentives waned, saw used prices stabilize or even rise temporarily as supply tightened. Factors like battery degradation and warranty concerns could exacerbate depreciation, though a growing surplus in U.S. battery manufacturing might indirectly lower repair costs, supporting values. In Q3 2025 reports, used EV prices are already volatile, with models like the Nissan Leaf dropping 15% year-over-year amid subsidy jitters.

Overall, the post-subsidy landscape hinges on broader economics: If gas prices spike or state incentives fill the void, EVs might weather the storm. But a full removal could impose societal costs exceeding $33 billion, per recent analyses, by slowing the shift from fossil fuels.

So, readers, what's your call? Will used EV values tank due to lost affordability, or rise as the cheaper alternative? Will new prices plummet to keep showrooms buzzing, or will sales halt until tech advances catch up? Drop your predictions in the comments for bragging rights when the dust settles—history will judge the boldest forecasters!",,N,,2025-08-30 12:05:30.954893

As climate policies tighten and renewable energy adoption accelerates, the region is prioritizing strategic investments in hydroelectric efficiency and grid expansion. These initiatives are not only critical for aligning with national clean energy targets but also present compelling opportunities for investors seeking long-term, high-impact returns.

Transmission Expansion: Bridging Markets and Resources

The Southern Spirit Transmission project, a flagship initiative under the federal Transmission Facilitation Program, exemplifies the Southeast's commitment to grid modernization. This 320-mile, 525 kV HVDC line, funded with up to $360 million in federal support, connects the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) with the Southeastern grid. By enabling 3,000 MW of bidirectional capacity, the project enhances regional energy resilience and facilitates the flow of renewable resources—particularly solar and wind from Texas—into the Southeast.

Such infrastructure is vital for addressing the region's growing electricity demand, projected to rise by 30% by 2040 due to population growth and industrialization. For investors, this project underscores the importance of transmission assets in enabling decarbonization. Companies like Southern Spirit Transmission, LLC and contractors involved in HVDC technology (e.g., Siemens Energy, ABB Ltd.) are poised to benefit from similar projects nationwide.

Hydroelectric Efficiency: Unlocking Legacy Assets

While solar and wind dominate headlines, hydroelectric power remains a cornerstone of the Southeast's renewable portfolio. The U.S. Department of Energy's Maintaining and Enhancing Hydroelectricity Incentives program has allocated $430 million to upgrade aging hydropower facilities, including Santee Cooper's Jefferies Hydroelectric Station in South Carolina. These upgrades—such as replacing outdated turbines with high-efficiency models—boost output by 3% or more while improving grid stability during extreme weather.

Hydro's role in decarbonization is often underestimated. Unlike intermittent renewables, hydro provides dispatchable power and grid inertia, making it a critical partner in a 100% clean energy future. Investors should monitor companies like Kern and Tule Hydro LLC, which are leveraging federal incentives to modernize infrastructure, as well as engineering firms specializing in hydroelectric retrofitting.

Policy and Market Alignment: A Tailwind for Investors

The Southeast's grid modernization efforts are bolstered by a robust policy framework. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act have injected billions into transmission and renewable projects, while states like Virginia and North Carolina are adopting performance-based regulation to incentivize clean energy adoption. The Q2 2025 50 States of Grid Modernization report highlights 77 energy storage deployments and 35 smart grid initiatives in the region, signaling a regulatory environment conducive to innovation.

For example, Virginia's virtual power plant mandate and Georgia's distribution system planning reforms are creating markets for distributed energy resources (DERs) and energy storage. These trends align with the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) Program's focus on advanced conductor technologies and dynamic line ratings, which could expand transmission capacity without costly new lines.

Investment Strategy: Where to Allocate Capital

Transmission Developers and Contractors: Prioritize firms involved in HVDC technology, substation upgrades, and interregional grid projects. The Southern Spirit Transmission line is a model for future investments, with similar projects likely in the Southeast and Midwest.

Hydroelectric Modernization Firms: Target companies with expertise in turbine retrofitting and dam safety upgrades. Federal funding programs ensure a steady pipeline of projects through 2030.

Energy Storage and Grid-Enhancing Technologies: As the Southeast integrates more renewables, demand for battery storage, dynamic line ratings, and microgrid solutions will surge. States with procurement mandates (e.g., Texas, North Carolina) offer high-growth opportunities.

Performance-Based Regulation (PBR) Advocates: Utilities adopting PBR frameworks, such as Duke Energy and Southern Company, are better positioned to fund modernization while aligning with decarbonization goals.

Conclusion: A Golden Age for Grid Infrastructure

The Southeast's grid modernization is not merely a technical upgrade—it is a strategic pivot toward a resilient, low-carbon economy. With federal funding, state-level innovation, and private-sector collaboration, the region is setting a blueprint for the U.S. energy transition. For investors, this represents a unique window to capitalize on infrastructure that will underpin the next decade of clean energy growth.

As the 50 States of Grid Modernization report underscores, the Southeast is no longer on the sidelines of the renewable revolution. It is now a central player—and the best time to invest is when the transformation is already underway.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-30 00:59:07.619865

Braverman, a Chernobyl survivor with an incredible success story and vision for wave energy, was profiled by Factor This earlier this year.

The Los Angeles project is designed as a demonstration station, with the following objectives:

Showcase Eco Wave Power’s patented onshore technology in U.S. marine conditions

Support environmental monitoring and regulatory processes in collaboration with local stakeholders and authorities, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

Serve as an educational hub for industry partners, regulators, and potential customers

Establish a foundation for future grid-connected commercial wave energy projects in the U.S.

Eco Wave Power’s patented onshore wave energy system attaches floaters to existing marine structures. The up-and-down motion of the waves drives hydraulic cylinders, which send pressurized fluid to a land-based energy conversion unit that generates electricity.

The company argues that its technology is modular, low-maintenance, and “designed for minimal environmental impact.” The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that wave energy has the potential to generate over 1,400 terawatt-hours per year—enough to power approximately 130 million homes.

According to the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), this new project is essential for California to achieve its ambitious carbon reduction goals and the resilience and modernization of the electrical grid in Southern California by offering a new, critical pathway in a currently constrained area. Increasing transmission capacity across the region will help reduce unnecessary costs of congestion, integrate more clean energy, and expand access to resources in the Imperial Valley and the Southwest.

“We are proud to undertake a project that is so vital to California’s customers. We must continue to strengthen our energy grid to meet the growing demand for electricity in the Southern California region and to advance the state’s clean energy goals – all while keeping affordability front and center,” said SDG&E President Scott Crider. “We will work closely with customers and communities through a robust stakeholder engagement process to ensure this critical line gets built responsibly.”

This transmission pathway was recognized in CAISO’s 2022-2023 Transmission Plan, which identified the need for 45 transmission projects throughout the state, including this project.

Costs to build and upgrade high-voltage transmission lines (200kV or higher) that provide statewide benefits are proportionately distributed among all California customers within CAISO’s Balancing Authority Area and governed by the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission. This is important because the costs of building transmission projects are shared across California, helping to limit the estimated cost impact on SDG&E customers to approximately 9%, based on current data.

SDG&E is well positioned to deliver this project, backed by a proven track record in developing critical energy infrastructure – from large-scale transmission lines to advanced battery storage systems. The company will also integrate its nationally recognized wildfire safety program into the project. This award-winning initiative has helped prevent a catastrophic utility-caused wildfire for nearly 18 years, underscoring SDG&E’s commitment to safety and resilience.

Importantly, SDG&E will begin an extensive community engagement process where the public will have multiple opportunities to submit feedback on ways to ensure the project is built responsibly as part of the state and federal permitting process. Construction on the transmission line is expected to begin in 2029, with a target in-service date of 2032, subject to obtaining necessary state and federal agency approvals and permits.

“Following a thorough internal investigation, EPA supervisors made decisions on an individualized basis,'' an EPA spokeswoman said Friday in a statement.

The so-called declaration of dissent, signed by more than 170 employees in late June, “contains inaccurate information designed to mislead the public about agency business,'' spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said. “Thankfully, this represents a small fraction of the thousands of hard-working, dedicated EPA employees who are not trying to mislead and scare the American public.”

The EPA ""has a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November,'' she added.

Vaseliou declined to say how many employees were disciplined, but the head of the agency's largest union said at least six probationary employees who signed the letter were fired, along with at least two career employees. The firings were first reported by The Washington Post.

The EPA union, part of the American Federation of Government Employees, condemned the firings, which come after 139 workers were put on administrative leave shortly after signing the dissent declaration. The EPA at the time accused employees of “unlawfully undermining” the Trump administration’s agenda.

“The Trump administration and EPA’s retaliatory actions against these workers was clearly an assault on labor and free-speech rights,'' said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA employees.

More than 150 workers who were disciplined — up to and including being fired — included scientists, engineers, lawyers, contract officers, emergency response personnel “and a whole host of other jobs,” Chen told the Associated Press. “They live and work in communities around the country, and all believe in the mission of the agency to protect human health and the environment on behalf of the American public.""

In a letter made public June 30, the employees wrote that the EPA is no longer living up to its mission to protect human health and the environment. The letter represented rare public criticism from agency employees who knew they could face retaliation for speaking out against a weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science.

Employees at other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and Federal Emergency Management Agency, have issued similar statements. Some FEMA employees who signed a public letter of dissent earlier this week were put on administrative leave Tuesday, according to documents reviewed by The Associated Press.

“It’s madness to stop a project that already had permits,” said Jack Morris, a Massachusetts-based scalloper and manager for Sea Services who voted for Trump.
The cooperative helped build Ørsted’s South Fork Wind — America’s first large-scale offshore wind farm, which went online last year.
Commercial fishermen have spent a total of 1,109 days working at sea for Revolution Wind, according to Yerman.
Fishermen are paid for the days they work, not for standby,” Gordon Videll, CEO of Sea Services, told Canary Media.","The Trump administration’s order to stop construction of the nearly completed Revolution Wind project is putting hundreds of offshore workers out of a job — including dozens of local fishermen who voted for President Donald Trump and are asking him to reverse course.

A week ago, the acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Matthew Giacona, ordered the Danish wind developer Ørsted to stop all offshore work on the Revolution Wind farm so the federal government can​“address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States.” Giacona did not specify the nature of those security concerns.

Construction began on the 704-megawatt project in January 2024 and is now 80% complete, according to Ørsted. The wind farm is being built off the coast of Massachusetts and Rhode Island in a federally designated ​“wind energy area” that received sign-offs from multiple branches of the military, Canary Media reported Sunday.

Though often seen as opposed to offshore wind, many New England fishermen have made peace with the industry in recent years.

They increasingly rely on part-time salaries from wind companies as fishing revenues dry up. Over the past two years, Ørsted put 80 fishermen to work on the Revolution Wind project, paying out $9.5 million to captains, deckhands, and fishing boat owners, according to Gary Yerman, a Connecticut-based fisherman who founded and leads a fisher cooperative called Sea Services North America, which has an active contract to work on Revolution Wind.

“Most of us are Trump voters, and we still believe in a leader who builds. That’s why we’re asking President Trump to reverse the stop-work order issued to Revolution Wind by Interior,” Yerman told Canary Media.

The stop-work order echoes a similar one the Interior Department gave in April that froze all offshore work on New York’s Empire Wind project — a move that grounded Sea Services’ fishermen for a month, until Trump lifted the ban.

Yerman and other commercial fishermen remained quiet the last time Trump’s assault on a wind farm put them out of work. This time they’re speaking out.

“It’s madness to stop a project that already had permits,” said Jack Morris, a Massachusetts-based scalloper and manager for Sea Services who voted for Trump. ​“This is not something any of us planned for: the captains, the crew, the shore engineers, the people we buy food from for our trips.”

Ørsted was one of the first firms building turbines in U.S. waters to employ local fishermen, offering Sea Services a contract in 2021 to perform safety and scout tasks. The cooperative helped build Ørsted’s South Fork Wind — America’s first large-scale offshore wind farm, which went online last year.

Today, it’s common for wind developers to rely on local U.S. fishermen. Avangrid and Vineyard Offshore, codevelopers of the embattled Vineyard Wind project off the coast of Massachusetts, have paid out about $8 million over the past two years directly to local fishermen and vessel owners.

“If the infrastructure and pilings are already in, what good is stopping now?” fisherman Tony Alvernaz told Canary Media when asked about the Revolution Wind pause. A Massachusetts fisherman unaffiliated with Sea Services, Alvernaz works part-time for Vineyard Wind, assisting with the ongoing construction of its 62 turbines. Of those, 17 are already sending power to the grid.

Alvernaz is concerned about the Trump administration’s pattern of halting wind projects without warning and with little justification. Trump has already pressed pause on two of the five offshore wind farms currently under construction in America today.

Trump putting fishermen out of work

In a statement Monday, an Ørsted spokesperson said Revolution Wind supports more than 2,500 jobs around the U.S., including ​“hundreds” of local offshore jobs.

Commercial fishermen have spent a total of 1,109 days working at sea for Revolution Wind, according to Yerman. Now, sitting at the docks due to the Trump administration’s stop-work order, the 15 fishermen who planned to be at sea, working 10-day shifts throughout this month, will get paid nothing.

“Our cooperative only invoices when our boats are on active duty. Fishermen are paid for the days they work, not for standby,” Gordon Videll, CEO of Sea Services, told Canary Media. The group is calling on Trump to lift the ban so that its members can resume the job, which would have involved eight more fishermen helping with an offshore substation this fall.

The extra income from Revolution Wind has been a lifeline, particularly for scallop fishermen who, in recent years, have been severely restricted in how much they can fish.

Strict federal quotas have been put in place to allow scallop populations to rebuild after years of being overfished, according to Morris, but that has meant scallopers — who form the majority of Sea Services’ members — are off the water for about 10 months a year.

Before the pause on Revolution Wind, scalloper Kevin Souza expected to make an additional $200,000 working on the project as a part-time boat captain for two years. Souza told Canary Media in February that, had he stuck to scalloping alone, he’d be ​“lucky” to earn $100,000 in a single year. The deckhands he hires only bring in around $30,000 per year working on scallop boats, but the offshore wind gig makes it possible for them to earn a ​“middle-class wage,” said Souza.

Souza has recruited both of his sons, his nephew, and other young people from longtime fishing families to work for the wind industry. They might have otherwise left the scallop industry if not for the supplemental income, he said.

Losing faith in Trump

As a group, America’s commercial fishermen have long been loyal to Trump. Last week’s order is shaking that confidence.

“I can’t think of one guy who isn’t a Trumper in our co-op. We’re blue-collar guys (and some gals too) who get up before dawn, work with our hands, and we trusted him to look out for us. The truth is, we love President Trump,” Yerman said.

In New Bedford, Massachusetts, home to the country’s most profitable fishing port, ​“TRUMP 2024” flags fly from dozens of boats docked in the harbor. A few of those crews work for the offshore wind companies, and at least one captain lowers his MAGA flag before setting out to the wind farms, according to Rodney Avila, a Sea Services fisherman.

That kind of faith makes Trump’s pause on Revolution Wind even more gutting.

“It’s like having the rug pulled out from under you. … Nobody understands why Trump did it. I don’t know what Trump’s agenda is,” said Morris.

Trump’s attacks on wind have dried up job prospects for local fishermen up and down the East Coast. His administration’s hostile actions have thrown sand in the gears of a New Jersey wind farm that planned to start construction in the next three years, Maryland’s first offshore wind farm, and another wind project off the coast of Maine.

In addition to targeting individual projects, the Trump administration has initiated policies intended to undermine the entire sector: killing offshore wind leasing, pausing permitting for wind farms, and sunsetting tax credits critical to their economic viability.

Many fishermen, including those who have pocketed thousands by working at offshore wind farms, remain wary of the companies building turbines out at sea.

“No fisherman loves new structures in the water, but we all have grandkids,” Roy Campanale, a Sea Services member based in Rhode Island, told Canary Media. ​“We’ve lived with the water getting warmer, watched the fish move north, and had to adapt again and again.”

Alvernaz voted for Trump and opposes certain wind farms that he believes pose a risk to his favorite fishing grounds. He said that he does not support Revolution Wind due to its placement on Cox Ledge, a swath of seabed identified by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as critical habitat for Atlantic cod.

“Something about national defense? How can it be an issue of national defense if there are other wind farms out there with the same technology?” pondered Alvernaz. ​“It’s kind of odd.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Fishing-boats-New-Bedford-State-Pier.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=c16edac04a098db36a6d1e4a035923e5,N,,2025-08-29 23:59:09.222944

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It’s the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states’ climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans’ livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/08/2025-08-26T140459Z_687643563_RC21FGA36LNZ_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRANSPORTATION-DUFFY-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 23:59:18.650513

“Following a thorough internal investigation, EPA supervisors made decisions on an individualized basis,” an EPA spokeswoman said Friday in a statement.
“The Trump administration and EPA’s retaliatory actions against these workers was clearly an assault on labor and free-speech rights,” said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA employees.
More than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed the letter made public Monday.

“Following a thorough internal investigation, EPA supervisors made decisions on an individualized basis,” an EPA spokeswoman said Friday in a statement.

The so-called declaration of dissent, signed by more than 170 employees in late June, “contains inaccurate information designed to mislead the public about agency business,” spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said. “Thankfully, this represents a small fraction of the thousands of hard-working, dedicated EPA employees who are not trying to mislead and scare the American public.”

The EPA “has a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November,” she added.

Vaseliou declined to say how many employees were disciplined, but the head of the agency’s largest union said at least six probationary employees who signed the letter were fired, along with at least two career employees. The firings were first reported by The Washington Post.

The EPA union, part of the American Federation of Government Employees, condemned the firings, which come after 139 workers were put on administrative leave shortly after signing the dissent declaration. The EPA at the time accused employees of “unlawfully undermining” the Trump administration’s agenda.

“The Trump administration and EPA’s retaliatory actions against these workers was clearly an assault on labor and free-speech rights,” said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA employees.

More than 150 workers who were disciplined — up to and including being fired — included scientists, engineers, lawyers, contract officers, emergency response personnel “and a whole host of other jobs,” Chen told the Associated Press. “They live and work in communities around the country, and all believe in the mission of the agency to protect human health and the environment on behalf of the American public.”

In a letter made public June 30, the employees wrote that the EPA is no longer living up to its mission to protect human health and the environment. The letter represented rare public criticism from agency employees who knew they could face retaliation for speaking out against a weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science.

Employees at other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and Federal Emergency Management Agency, have issued similar statements. Some FEMA employees who signed a public letter of dissent earlier this week were put on administrative leave Tuesday, according to documents reviewed by The Associated Press.

More than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed the letter made public Monday. The statement criticizes recent cuts to agency staff and programs and warns that FEMA’s capacity to respond to a major disaster is dangerously diminished.

The EPA said last month it is eliminating its research and development arm and reducing agency staff by thousands of employees. Officials expect total staffing to go down to about 12,500, a reduction of more than 3,700 employees, or nearly 23%, from staffing levels when Trump took office in January.",https://www.abc27.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/08/68b2526cef5983.44955024.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-29 23:00:22.256788

If the US is going to build massive new LNG terminals in the Gulf of Mozambique or whatever that body of water between Texas and Florida is called today, it will need plenty of customers for that climate-killing fuel. By definition, exports are not intended for domestic customers, so all that lovely liquid death is intended for people and industries in places other than America.

When the so-called president declared an “energy emergency” earlier this year, he meant that he intended to reward the fossil fuel interests who spent so much money to help him get elected. When he proclaimed his intention to establish “energy dominance,” he meant the US would now supplant OPEC as the top dog on the international energy stage.

During the now infamous three-hour cabinet meeting last week, where all the MAGA faithful competed to be the biggest suck-up to the Pharaoh Of The Potomac, our Dear Leader crowed that he was trying his best to get other nations that have clean energy and climate initiatives as part of their national planning to see the error of their ways.

“I’m trying to have people learn about wind real fast, and I think I’ve done a good job, but not good enough because some countries are still trying,” he said, and added that countries were “destroying themselves” with wind energy. “I hope they get back to fossil fuels,” he said. According to a report by Lisa Friedman of the New York Times, two weeks ago, the failing administration promised to punish countries by imposing tariffs, visa restrictions, and port fees on them if they vote for a global agreement to slash greenhouse gas emissions from the shipping sector.

A few days later in Geneva, the Trump US joined Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing countries to oppose limits on the production of petroleum-based plastics. “They are clearly using various tools in an attempt to increase the use of fossil fuels around the world instead of decrease,” said Jennifer Morgan, Germany’s former special envoy for climate action,

Chris Wright, the fracking billionaire who is now the head of the US Energy Department, warned that the United States could end its support for the International Energy Agency because it predicted that global demand for oil would peak this decade instead of continue to climb. He proclaimed to Europeans in April that they faced a choice between the “freedom and sovereignty” of abundant fossil fuels and the policies of “climate alarmism” that would make them less prosperous.

Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, said the goal of the administration was “restoring America’s energy dominance, ensuring energy independence to protect our national security and driving down costs for American families and businesses. The…..administration will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals.”

Most CleanTechnica readers will be surprised to hear that taking prudent steps to keep the Earth habitable for humans is a “vague climate goal,” but that is the sort of drivel one gets form people infected with a MAGA mind virus.

Alarm On The Continent

Many European officials are alarmed by the amount of pressure the US is exerting on their countries, especially in light of the catastrophic heat waves that have blanketed the Continent in recent years. Lisa Friedman writes that the vast majority of scientists agree a transition away from oil, gas, and coal and toward clean energy resources like wind, solar, geothermal, and hydro power is essential to avoid making climate change more severe.

“At this moment in time it is absolutely imperative that countries double down, triple down, on their collaboration in the face of the climate crisis to not allow the active efforts for a fossil fuel world by the Trump administration succeed,” Jennifer Morgan said.

The alleged president has been pursuing a vendetta against wind energy ever since Scotland approved an offshore wind installation that is visible from his golf emporium in that country 14 years ago. When he met with Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, earlier this year, he denounced wind power as a “con job” and claimed that wind turbines drive birds “loco.”

Shortly thereafter he met with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and called wind energy “a disaster.” He added that “Wind needs massive subsidies, and you are paying in Scotland and in U.K., and in all over the place where they have them, massive subsidies to have these ugly monsters all over the place.”

This maladministration is “actively trying to undermine countries” on global warming, David Goldwyn, an energy consultant, told Friedman. Several diplomats from other countries said that the administration has used increasingly aggressive tactics to influence international energy policies.

In February, Chris Wright told a conference in London via video that net zero is a “sinister goal” and criticized a British law that makes becoming net zero by 2050 a national goal. In March, the maladministration denounced the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, which were adopted by nations unanimously in 2015 and include such woke ideas as addressing poverty, hunger, and climate change. The administration said “the government of the United States must refocus on the interests of Americans,” which apparently means combating “climate ideology.”

Just this month, the US government announced it would reject the agreement reached by the members of the International Maritime Organization to impose a fee on carbon emissions from shipping. The US said it would “not hesitate to retaliate or explore remedies for our citizens” against other countries that support the shipping fee.

“You see a more systematic attempt to be a fossil fuel first strategy to everything that they do,” Jake Schmidt, director of international programs at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told Friedman. He added that the administration may slow the transition to clean energy by other countries but cannot stop it.

Diana Furchtgott-Roth, director of the Center for Energy, Climate and Environment at the Heritage Foundation, which spawned the agenda of grievance and hate known as Project 2025, told Friedman the administration was doing the right thing by pressuring countries to reject renewable energy.

“Europe is coming to the United States saying, ‘Help defend us against Russia, help us with Ukraine,’” she said. “Where at the same time, they’re spending $350 billion a year on green energy investments that are slowing their economies. It doesn’t seem to make very much sense to the administration. I think we’re going to see more pressure.”

Paul Krugman On Allies & Power

Paul Krugman is highly critical of how the US is alienating its allies. On August 29, he wrote on Substack, “The Pax Americana that emerged after World War II — and basically ended on January 20, 2025 — was, in many ways, an American Empire…. We built international economic and military alliances to support a world order in effect designed to U.S. specifications.

“In 1947 a conference in Geneva established the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which set the ground rules for — tariffs and trade. The GATT in turn became the foundation for the World Trade Organization, established in 1994.

“NATO is another international institution create by the US in partnership with its allies. It has always been a partnership of equals. While the NATO military commander has always been an American, the Secretary General has always been a European,” Krugman wrote.

“The current occupant of the White House clearly has no use for subtlety and understatement. In just 7 months Trump has completely ripped up the foundations of the Pax Americana,” Krugman said. “Almost all his tariffs are clearly in violation of the GATT, yet Trump has vandalized the world trading system as casually as he has paved over the Rose Garden. We haven’t yet had a test of whether he would honor our obligations under NATO, but he’s said that his willingness to abide by the most central obligation, the guarantee of mutual defense, ‘depends on your definition.’

“Trump’s foreign policy doctrine appears to be Oderint dum metuant — let them hate as long as they fear — supposedly the favorite motto of the Emperor Caligula. America, he seems to believe, is so powerful that it doesn’t need allies; he can bully the world into doing his bidding.

“Whatever Trump may imagine, the world doesn’t fear us. For example, Trump may have imagined that his tariffs would bring India crawling to him, begging for relief. Instead, India seems to be moving to closer ties with China. In fact, not only does the world not fear us; increasingly, it doesn’t need us. This is even true for nations that used to depend on U.S. military aid.

“One of the many problems with the slogan Make America Great Again was that America already was great. Now, not so much. In a world in which America is no longer the dominant economic and military power it once was — measured by purchasing power, China’s economy is already 30 percent larger than ours — our role in world affairs depends, even more than it did in the past, on having willing allies who trust our promises.”

Krugman ends with this analysis: “We used to be very good at having allies. But Trump has flushed all of that down the golden toilet.”

Alienating Allies Is A Fool’s Game

The damage being done is incalculable. After the first attempt at governing by the man who would be king, the world decided to forgive and forget when adults started running the US government again. They thought America had learned its lesson. They will not be so quick to forget after Americans decided last November, “Yeah, we want more of that.” Repairing the damage from this clown show will take decades, during which America’s leadership on the world stage will be like that of all former empires — nattering on the sidelines about how things used to be and plotting how to regain their former prominence.

The deliberate assault on America’s allies is likely to benefit one nation most of all — China. With its focus on clean energy and electrification of all segments of its economy, China will become the leader of the world’s nations, not least because the US chose to give up its pursuit of education and science to concentrate on grievances and settling scores — real and imagined.

That is not to say that China is prefect; it is not. But it is intent on preserving the Earth as a place where humans can continue to flourish. The US, on the other hand, is doing everything it can to ramp up the destruction of the environment in every way possible. That is a strategy sure to make other nations turn their backs on America and go in search of other allies.

In retrospect, Project 2025 won’t make the US great, it will make the US irrelevant. When historians ask who is responsible for the destruction of America, their search will lead them to the Heritage Foundation and its paterfamilias, Charles Koch. Trump is merely a puppet; Koch is the one pulling the strings. If you are in doubt about the accuracy of that assertion, pick up a copy of Jane Mayer’s Dark Money and be prepared to be frightened out of your wits.

Under the influence of Koch and the MAGAlomaniacs, the US will soon find itself on the outside looking in. When it needs a friend, no one will answer the call. Then and only then with the full extent of the damage done to America by this administration become apparent for all to see.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-30-2025-01_49_51-PM-800x533.png,N,,2025-08-29 23:00:34.065987

Car and Electric Vehicle Financing","Electric vehicles have been gaining popularity in the U.S. In 2024, sales were up 7.3% from 2023, with 1.3 million plug-in electric cars sold. If you’re getting ready to buy a car, you may be wondering if you should get in on the action or stick with a tried-and-true gas-powered vehicle.

Cutting out fuel costs is appealing, but are electric vehicles, or EVs, cheaper to operate and maintain overall? Adding up the dollars and cents is not as cut and dry as it sounds. In this article from The Police Credit Union, we’ll show you how to weigh the price of owning an electric vehicle versus a gas-powered vehicle so you can make an informed decision when you buy your next set of wheels.

Create a Vehicle Budget

To compare costs, you’ll want to make a budget for each type of vehicle. Since buying a car is a big investment, you’ll probably want to include an auto loan in your budgeting, no matter which car you decide to buy. Take note that car loan interest rates and terms can vary depending on your credit history, the time of year you purchase the vehicle, and other factors. You’ll also want to account for maintenance, insurance, and other expenses for each type of car. All these items will have an impact on the final ownership costs.

Use our Savings Goal Calculator and Auto Rebate vs. Low Interest Financing Calculator to help add everything up.

Vehicle Purchase Price

Buying an EV typically comes with a heftier price tag than a traditional gas-powered car. However, the gap between gas and EV purchase prices has started to close in recent years. According to Cox Automotive, the parent company of Kelley Blue Book, the average price of an EV in July 2025 was $56,910 while the average gas-powered vehicle came in at only a few thousand dollars less, around $48,907.

Tax Credits and Incentives on Electric Vehicles

In an effort to promote the purchase of EVs, the federal government offers a tax credit of up to $7,500 for new EVs and is also paying out a $4,000 credit for used EVs through September 2025.

Many states also offer electric car incentives like rebates for purchasing or leasing an electric vehicle or for purchasing a charging station. California currently offers numerous incentives, rebates, and rewards.

Maintenance and Insurance Costs

Since routine engine maintenance and oil changes aren’t needed on an EV, they’re cheaper to own in that respect. However, other repairs can be a different story.

Certain EV parts are much more expensive than parts for a gas-powered vehicle, so when repairs are required, they often cost more. For example, replacing the battery on a gas vehicle is typically around $100-200, while EV batteries start around $4,000 and, depending on the make and model of your car, can reach a staggering $20,000. Another thing to consider is locating an EV repair shop in your area with specially trained technicians. These mechanics can be harder to find depending on where you live, and may charge higher fees. So, how reliable the EV you buy proves to be can become a major factor in your ownership costs.

The higher costs to repair and replace an EV are the major contributor to higher insurance rates as well.

You may want to consult AAA’s Your Driving Cost fact sheet to get a better idea of how much you might pay in maintenance per mile to drive different types of vehicles.

The Cost of Fueling Up vs Plugging In

Charging an EV could be more attractive than fueling up a vehicle if you’re looking for more stability in your car expenses. Driving a gas-powered vehicle puts you at the mercy of historically unpredictable fuel prices that rise and fall depending on the economic climate, and sometimes causing serious pain at the pump. For example, the national average per gallon went from $2.17 in 2020 to $3.30 in 2024, with lots of other ups and downs over the last 20 years. So, while high fuel costs may not be stressing your budget at the moment, they could change anytime.

On the other side of the coin, when making an investment in an EV, you’ll likely need to pay to install a charger at your home unless you’re living in an apartment community that has this feature. A standard 120-volt outlet typically offers about 32 miles of range. If you want to be prepared for longer trips, you can get a Level 2, 240-volt outlet that can add 250 miles of range.

The utility's “just transition” plan calls for replacing aging coal plants with wind farms, solar arrays and transmission infrastructure to meet growing power demands from data centers, population growth and future electrification needs.

""That 5,000 megawatts, the estimate that's typically quoted is $7.5 billion,"" said Maxwell Brown, an economics and business assistant professor at the Colorado School of Mines.

The cost will be passed on to customers through gradual rate increases.

""I think the average customer bill in Colorado is somewhere around $150 per month, and that's per household, and so, a 30% to 50% increase would be an extra $45 to $75 per month,"" Brown said.

He said that is in line with where bills should probably be by then.

Costs could climb higher, however, due to federal trade policies. Brown noted that proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum, materials essential for wind turbines and solar panels, could add significant expenses to the project.

""The tariffs on steel and aluminum, you know, 50% tariffs are significant, and they make up a large portion of the cost for natural gas facilities, for wind and solar, especially wind turbines, there's a lot of steel in a wind turbine,"" Brown said. ""If we're talking $7.5 billion, that's somewhere between $0.9 and $1.1 billion extra.""

The elimination of federal investment tax credits, which previously provided 30% off capital costs for renewable energy projects, will also increase expenses. Brown estimates this could result in a 22%-23% cost increase compared to when credits were available.

The transition creates challenges for coal-dependent communities. Angeline Letourneau, an associate professor focused on energy transitions at the Colorado School of Mines, said renewable energy jobs won't directly replace coal plant employment.

""They're just not as labor-intensive as coal mining is,"" Letourneau said. ""It's not like we can build a bunch of solar farms or wind farms, and expect to employ everyone who is employed in a coal plant facility. Hence this need to create new jobs in other fields besides just energy.""

Despite funding allocated for economic alternatives in affected communities, Letourneau noted these resources often go toward infrastructure projects rather than creating new employment opportunities.

“They've put money in place to give economic alternatives to communities, but that hasn't really translated into new job opportunities yet,"" Letourneau said. ""It still often goes towards, kind of, community infrastructure projects that communities have been looking for funding for, and less so towards developing new economic opportunities in the future.""

Brown acknowledged the financial burden on customers but said the transition is necessary and not just happening in Colorado.

""In order to get there, it's going to cost money. And that's just the way of the world,"" Brown said. ""This isn't really unique to Colorado. There's a lot of places around the country that have these sort of mandates, that are facing this sort of uncertainty, that have even more aggressive clean energy targets or emissions reduction targets.""",https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/739de345-4caa-450f-97f0-83a1ae91fa61/20250830T002240/739de345-4caa-450f-97f0-83a1ae91fa61_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 23:59:14.665374

It means the country's battery makers face a looming overcapacity issue with 193 gigawatt-hours of batteries capacity online already and an additional 428 gigawatt-hours likely to be built out by 2030.
Meanwhile, battery makers are at risk of losing another type of buyer: power companies.
In Texas alone, some 4 gigawatts of battery capacity - enough to power around 3 million homes - switched on in 2024.
A growing number of battery makers have put their manufacturing plans on hold or scrapped projects entirely since Trump took office.","LOS ANGELES: US battery makers will likely face a major surplus in manufacturing capacity by 2030 as President Donald Trump's administration withdraws support for electric vehicles, according to a new report.

The US is forecast to deploy nearly 378 gigawatt-hours of batteries by 2030, BloombergNEF said in a report, 56% lower than the group's forecast issued before Trump took office.

It means the country's battery makers face a looming overcapacity issue with 193 gigawatt-hours of batteries capacity online already and an additional 428 gigawatt-hours likely to be built out by 2030.

Batteries are a key component for electric vehicles, a segment that grew rapidly under the Biden administration.

But with the Trump administration rolling back federal incentives and phasing out tax credits for EV purchases, demand is expected to slow.

With 14 million fewer EVs expected to be sold in the US through 2030, that will be a hit to battery manufacturers.

""Stable regulatory support still matters for EV adoption,"" says Matthew Hales, a BNEF analyst specializing in trade and supply chains. ""President Trump has taken a wrecking ball to that support.""

Meanwhile, battery makers are at risk of losing another type of buyer: power companies.

Utilities in recent years have deployed large-scale batteries to avoid blackouts and store excessive output generated by renewable energy sources.

Virtually non-existent a decade ago, utility-scale battery installations in the US reached a total of 26 gigawatts last year.

In Texas alone, some 4 gigawatts of battery capacity - enough to power around 3 million homes - switched on in 2024.

But the Trump administration has announced rules that push energy storage project developers to steer clear of Chinese battery materials and components in order to qualify for tax credits, which will be hard for the industry.

China dominates the global trade of battery components, with 88% of the world's cathode and 96% of anode production capacity in 2024, according to BNEF.

""These criteria may yet prove unworkable or challenging, dragging down new additions to energy storage in the US,"" Hales says.

The projected surplus may not fully materialize, though. A growing number of battery makers have put their manufacturing plans on hold or scrapped projects entirely since Trump took office.

Kore Power Inc. abandoned its battery plant plans shortly after Trump was sworn in.

Amprius Technologies announced in May that it wouldn't move forward on a US$190 million (RM803mil) battery plant in Colorado.

Automaker Stellantis has also called off its plan to build an Illinois battery plant.

Shrinking demand combined with collapsing government support for clean tech, will likely lead to more factory cancellations, Hales says, calling it ""a poison pill for US manufacturing hopes.""",https://da4dkroembtou.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/24C0265_089.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 03:59:37.613857

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy withdrew or terminated a total of $679 million in funding for 12 doomed offshore wind projects across America. This action will ensure federal dollars are prioritized towards restoring America’s maritime dominance and preventing waste.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy. “Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg bent over backwards to use transportation dollars for their Green New Scam agenda while ignoring the dire needs of our shipbuilding industry. Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

The Trump Administration has refocused the Department of Transportation (USDOT) and its Maritime Administration (MARAD) on rebuilding America’s shipbuilding capacity, unleashing more reliable, traditional forms of energy, and utilizing the nation’s bountiful natural resources to unleash American energy.

Where possible, funding from these projects will be recompeted to address critical port upgrades and other core infrastructure needs of the United States.

Additional Information:

As part of the Department of Transportation’s review of all discretionary grant programs with obligated and unobligated projects, USDOT identified 12 offshore wind grants and project selections that were not aligned with the goals and priorities of the administration.

USDOT has withdrawn one project in the Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects (INFRA) program, resulting in a total retraction of roughly $427 million.

MARAD has withdrawn six projects and terminated five within its Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP), resulting in a total retraction of $177 million and roughly $75 million, respectively.

CAISO ranks third, but has one of the lowest success rates, driven by a high volume of speculative projects.","U.S. grid interconnection agreements reached historic highs in 2024, surging 33% to 75 GW -- the highest volume on record -- due to new federal regulations aimed at streamlining the process, according to a new report from Wood Mackenzie.

According to the report “Tracking the progress of US grid interconnection”, data from Wood Mackenzie’s Lens Power and Renewables platform shows that Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order No. 2023, issued in July of 2023, along with other reforms led by Independent System Operators, has made a considerable impact on processing interconnection agreements, by driving improvements through reducing speculative projects and clearing queue backlogs.

On top of increased connections, regional grid operators are experiencing 9% fewer new project entries, a 51% increase in withdrawals of non-viable projects since 2022.

“It’s clear that these reforms are showing early signs of promise in accelerating the pace of interconnection studies,” said Kaitlin Fung, research analyst, North America Utility-Scale Solar for Wood Mackenzie. “We saw a record year in 2024, with 75 gigawatts (GW) of secured capacity. 2025 is maintaining this momentum, as major grid operators have already secured 36 GW through July 2025, positioning the year to match 2024’s record.”

Solar and storage technologies captured 75%, or 58 GW, of all interconnection agreements in 2024 and will retain a similar market share in 2025. Solar has accounted for half of all signed IAs since 2019, a trend that continues in 2025.

Natural gas has seen an increase in interconnection requests since 2022, adding 121 GW of capacity. This trend has continued in 2025 with new applications for gas generation already breaking annual records by mid-year. However, the number of successful gas interconnection agreements is down 25% since 2022, mainly in PJM, MISO and ERCOT, Wood Mackenzie said.

Regional differences

“Interconnection success rates and queue processing times vary dramatically for different grid operators across regions,” said Fung.

According to the report, ERCOT leads in both success rates and processing speed due to its streamlined queue process through their connect-and manage approach. ISONE ranks second in success rates but has the longest processing time due to its delayed transition from serial to cluster-based processing. CAISO ranks third, but has one of the lowest success rates, driven by a high volume of speculative projects.",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-29 21:00:37.743199

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump's administration has fired some Environmental Protection Agency employees after they signed a letter critical of the Trump administration's policies in late June, the EPA said on Friday.

The EPA did not mention how many people were fired and said the June petition had information that the agency called inaccurate. The Washington Post cited union officials to say at least seven EPA employees were fired.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

The development is likely to fuel concerns that the Trump administration does not tolerate dissent. Earlier this week, some employees at the Federal Emergency Management Agency were put on leave after they signed an open letter against the agency's leadership.

CONTEXT

The June letter, titled as a ""Declaration of Dissent,"" accused the federal government of engaging in ""harmful deregulation,"" ""ignoring scientific consensus to benefit polluters"" and ""promoting a culture of fear"" within the agency.

In early July, the EPA placed about 140 employees on administrative leave after they signed the letter and said it has ""zero-tolerance"" for those sabotaging the government's agenda.

KEY QUOTES

""Following a thorough internal investigation, EPA supervisors made decisions on an individualized basis. EPA does not comment on individual personnel matters,"" an agency spokesperson said.

""The petition — signed by employees using a combination of their titles and offices — contains inaccurate information designed to mislead the public about agency business,"" it added.

The union representing EPA employees criticized the firings.

""The Trump administration and EPA's retaliatory actions against these workers was clearly an assault on labor and free speech rights,"" Justin Chen, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, a nationwide union that represents more than 8,000 EPA employees, said in a statement cited in the Washington Post.

Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers began a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.

Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers’ jobs are in limbo, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.

Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.

The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.

“This is a pretty major change,” said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state fiscal policy team, noting “the challenge in enacting something that’s dramatically different for most drivers.”

Oregon’s transportation woes

Oregon’s transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.

Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.

Kotek’s proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state’s gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.

The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn’t have to pay supplemental registration fees.

Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle’s telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state’s decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.

Republican lawmakers, who have opposed the tax and fee increases, unveiled a different proposal Friday that largely focuses on lifting restrictions on how the transportation department can spend money on maintenance operations. It does not include a road usage charge.

As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state’s total vehicles, he said.

Hawaii launches program

Under Hawaii’s program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.

In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.

Questions about privacy and fairness

In past surveys commissioned by Oregon’s transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.

Oregon’s voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they’re more expensive and can be removed, he added.

Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.

Many people don’t realize that “both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,” said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.

Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.

“We are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,” Morgan said.",https://www.broomfieldenterprise.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Electric_Vehicles-Road_User_Fee_73408-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-08-29 22:03:40.840063

Also cut was $33m for a port project in Salem, Massachusetts, to redevelop a vacant industrial facility for offshore wind projects.
China, for instance, has invested heavily in solar and wind energy and has become a leading source for wind turbine parts.","The administration of United States President Donald Trump has moved to cancel $679m in federal funding for offshore wind projects, in its latest salvo against renewable energy.

The move on Friday is set to affect 12 offshore projects, including a $427m project in California, as Trump pushes to deregulate and re-prioritise fossil fuels.

In a statement, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the funding was a waste of money “that could otherwise go towards revitalising America’s maritime industry”.

“Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritising real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little,” he said.

The funding had been awarded under the administration of former President Joe Biden as part of a wider pivot towards green energy.

Among the cancellations was funding for The Humboldt Bay project, which was meant to be the first offshore wind terminal on the Pacific coast.

A spokesperson for California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has emerged as a leading state opponent to Trump, criticised the action as an example of the administration “assaulting clean energy and infrastructure projects – hurting business and killing jobs in rural areas, and ceding our economic future to China”.

The cuts include a $47m grant for an offshore wind logistics and manufacturing hub near the Port of Baltimore in Maryland, as well as $48m awarded in 2022 for an offshore wind terminal project near New York’s Staten Island.

Also cut was $33m for a port project in Salem, Massachusetts, to redevelop a vacant industrial facility for offshore wind projects.

In a statement, Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey said cancelling the Salem grant will cost 800 construction workers their jobs.

“The real waste here is the Trump administration cancelling tens of millions of dollars for a project that is already under way to increase our energy supply,” she said.

The latest trimming comes after the Trump administration abruptly halted construction of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Department of the Interior said the move was necessary to address national security concerns, without providing further details.

In early August, the Interior Department also cancelled a major wind farm in Idaho, which had been approved in the final days of Biden’s presidency.

Multiple federal agencies, including the Departments of Defense, Energy and Commerce, said they are reviewing offshore wind farms approved by the Biden administration along the Atlantic coast.

Trump has regularly lashed out at green energy, and particularly wind power, calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries do not use.

Yet, foreign allies and rivals alike have increasingly embraced renewable energy in an effort to slow the ravages of climate change. China, for instance, has invested heavily in solar and wind energy and has become a leading source for wind turbine parts.

Critics have said Trump’s approach will set the US back behind its competitors.

Last week, as US electricity prices rose at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump falsely blamed renewable power for the skyrocketing prices, calling the industry a “scam”.

On Tuesday, he pledged not to move forward with any wind power projects.

GIVE IT SOME JUICE: Rivian is getting vocal about the Trump administration’s attacks on electric vehicles — and California’s role as a counterbalance to them.

Hannah Steinweg, public policy and business development manager for California-based maker of electric SUVs, trucks and commercial vans, is pushing Gov. Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers to double down on their support for the EV market. The push comes in the wake of President Donald Trump’s moves to revoke the state’s vehicle emissions rules and the federal $7,500 tax incentive for EV purchases.

Rivian would like to see California expand state-backed EV tax credits to a wider swatch of California drivers, and to fund the expansion with revenues generated by the state’s emissions trading program, which is at the center of intense negotiations as lawmakers try to hash out a bill to extend cap-and-trade during the final weeks of session.

Steinweg spoke with POLITICO about tax incentives, cap-and-trade and the threat that China will overtake the United States in the global auto market.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

How much of a blow for Rivian is the loss of the $7,500 federal tax credit?

We don’t think incentives replace merit. We think that we make a really compelling product that is one of the best-selling luxury SUVs in California and in the country. But incentives do accelerate adoption, and they move fence sitters. They’re historical market-shaping tools, and the federal tax credit going away is just one more regulatory support that is going away and is going to create a lot of regulatory uncertainty. Uncertainty makes it hard to plan.

California has an opportunity to backfill that incentive, and it can set up a 50-year roadmap that anchors EVs as a core part of the economy, not just in California, but around the country. Along with other industries like [artificial intelligence] and advanced manufacturing, EVs are the next generation of jobs in California, and … in the United States.

What should the structure of a new California-led incentive program look like?

Our RS1 [7-seat SUV model] is used by small businesses. We have fleets that use it, both public fleets and private fleets. The Palo Alto police department just procured the first RS1 in the nation used at a police department. I think that there is a huge gap in incentives that really hit that vehicle segment. If we’re going to electrify all passenger vehicles, we can’t just electrify sedans. We also have to meet the needs of consumers who want to buy a vehicle with more storage, more towing capacity.

We were the first all-electric truck to market, and I think an incentive that excludes these larger vehicles is really leaving out a lot of Californians and their needs. And so we encourage California to consider bifurcating the incentive to have one MSRP cap for cars and sedans and another MSRP cap for trucks and SUVs. We do have the RS2 coming out the first half of next year, our base model will be $45,000, and any incentive in California would also really benefit the consumers who are looking at a mid-size SUV.

How big a loss was Congress’s revocation of California’s electric vehicle mandates, given that companies like Rivian generate revenue by selling credits to manufacturers who don’t hit their sales goals?

Advanced Clean Cars II and Advanced Clean Trucks are really creative policy solutions to get automakers to choose to invest in this emerging technology of electric vehicles, or purchase credits to become in compliance. That really bolstered emerging new companies like Tesla, who sold millions of dollars of credits. We also benefited a lot from both programs. It’s no secret that this revenue is going away, but we are not dependent on that revenue to be successful as a company. We do think that those credit programs serve a great purpose in advancing the EV industry here in the United States, which will create American jobs across the country. Rivian is manufactured in Normal, Illinois. We’re setting up another manufacturing facility in Georgia. The benefits of investing in electric vehicle technology has an economic impact across the country, not just in California.

What else should California do to counter these setbacks for the EV market?

It’s imperative that we reauthorize cap and invest [another name for the state’s cap and trade market]. It is important for regulatory certainty. It sends a really positive message to the market and is a perfect vehicle for funding EV incentives. For every $1,000 that you put towards an EV incentive, 8 percent more people purchase an electric vehicle. That policy support brings the cost down, and it gets more people into electric vehicles who might be on the fence now. It is so rare to see so much support for something.

I think it sends a really important message to the rest of the country that California is recommitting itself to the future of the EV industry. It’s better for consumers, and it sends a message to other states. These vehicles are being manufactured in states like Georgia, Illinois and South Carolina. Supporting the industry here supports research and development broadly. China produces 70 percent of electric vehicles, and right now, other [manufacturers] are slowing their EV technology. It’s short-sighted, and it might result in short-term wins, but long-term, it will jeopardize the role of the American auto industry around the world.

How concerned are you that Chinese manufacturers will soon enter the US market?

China has been very generous with its subsidies for electrification, and that works. And the best way the United States can establish itself as a global leader in this new technology is by investing in American car companies like Rivian.

SUSPENSE OVER: The Legislature is into the home stretch after Friday’s deadline to pass bills with a significant price tag.

It wasn’t as bad of a killing field as we expected. According to a tally by veteran lobbyist Chris Micheli, only 27 percent of the bills got held back. (He had projected 31 percent earlier.) The list of survivors included bills we previewed yesterday: SB 34, which limits Southern California air quality regulators’ ability to set port emissions rules; SB 326, Sen. Josh Becker’s bill requiring Cal Fire do costly and detailed wildfire risk forecasts. Sen. Ben Allen got through his SB 682 to ban PFAS from more products, despite cookware manufacturers seeking an exemption for non-stick cookware, by delaying a ban on PFAS in parts for youth off-highway vehicles. And his SB 615, which would require can manufacturers to recycle EV batteries, made it through after removing language that would have tapped cap-and-trade revenues to fund enforcement of the law.

More time is needed on some of the biggies. Allen did decide to turn his SB 601, which would enshrine Biden-era water quality rules in state law, into a two-year bill amid continued opposition from developers, farmers and water agencies that argue the expanded state authority would increase their costs. Next up: a State Water Resources Control Board report due Jan. 1 detailing any workload or legislative changes it needs to fully backfill the 2023 Sackett v. EPA Supreme Court decision that narrowed the definition of wetlands under federal protection.

Investor-owned utilities scored some wins, but the final outcome is still TBD. Appropriators held back SB 332, Sen. Aisha Wahab’s measure to study whether to turn investor-owned utilities in to publicly-owned utilities, and AB 1020, Assemblymember Pilar Schiavo’s measure requiring more thorough reporting of investor-owned utility companies’ taxpayer funding. But other measures the utilities are fighting lived to see another day as lawmakers continue to hash out their energy affordability package, including Assemblymember Marc Berman’s AB 1167 and Sen. Jerry McNerney’s SB 24, which would limit utilities from passing lobbying and political advertising expenses on to ratepayers. Also still in the mix are proposals to reform the credit that appears on ratepayers’ bills from cap-and-trade revenues, limit what infrastructure costs utilities can pass along to ratepayers, and publicly finance new transmission lines.

Data center sustainability is an ongoing issue. Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan’s embattled effort to force data centers to disclose their energy usage, AB 222, died in the Senate Appropriations Committee amid sustained pushback from the tech industry. Assemblymember Diane Papan, however, got her AB 93 through to require data centers to track and report their water use. Sen. Steve Padilla was also successful with SB 57, which would empower energy regulators to set up a separate electric price for data centers.

THE WAIT IS OVER: It’s official. The California Energy Commission voted Friday afternoon to suspend its authority to impose a profit cap on gasoline refiners for five years. The move is a win for the oil industry, which had chafed under the possibility regulators would impose the cap ever since Newsom’s 2023 signature on SB X1-2 raised the spectre of the rule.

Scores of union officials, many from the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California who were representing refinery workers from across the state, voiced their support for the margin cap delay ahead of the CEC vote during a marathon public comment period.

“Every meeting that I go to, I hear from my members concern of the refinery getting shut down,” said Albert Duarte, business manager for the Riverside San Bernardino Building and Construction Trades.

Environmental justice advocates, meanwhile, voiced their displeasure with the CEC’s move.

“It’s counterproductive to gut regulations to provide sweetheart deals to big oil,” said Julia May, a senior scientist for Communities for a Better Environment.

In a report released Friday, commission staffers recommended prioritizing implementing resupply and minimum inventory rules for refiners rather than the profit cap. — NB

THE WINDS ARE CHANGING: Humboldt County was the big loser in the Trump administration’s announcement Friday that $679 million in funding to support offshore-wind-related ports and manufacturing facilities has been canceled.

Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind, the ambitious project to build turbines off the state’s northern coast, had $427 million in funding pulled, the largest cancellation among the 12 offshore wind grants and project selections that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said he revoked.

“Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little,” Duffy said in a statement.

The move is Trump’s latest attack on clean energy, including recent efforts to restrict funding for solar and wind projects established during the Biden era. The Transportation Department said the retractions come as part of a wider review of all discretionary grant programs, POLITICO’s Kelsey Tamborrino reports.

Rep. Jared Huffman, who represents Humboldt, slammed the rollback, calling it “a new level of idiocracy.”

“The Trump administration is trying to destroy an entire sector of clean energy, kill thousands of good paying jobs, and drive up electricity prices for American consumers,” Huffman said in a statement. — AN, KT

However, clean energy advocates and leaders in the states losing funding criticized the move, predicting it would contribute to higher energy costs and elimate jobs.

“Our Florida springs are something unique, not just to Florida but to the country,” Fine said.","ZEPHYRHILLS, Fla. (AP) — Seen from the air, a Florida freshwater spring is a bit of liquid heaven, luring humans and wildlife to enjoy its aquamarine cool. With at least 1,000 of them — more than any other state — the springs serve as beaches for large swaths of central and northwestern Florida far from the ocean, with teenagers backflipping from docks and snorkelers peering into the crystalline depths.

But these treasures are under threat from agricultural pollution, rapid development and climate change.

Some places, such as fast-growing Zephyrhills in west-central Florida, have paused some construction as it struggles to stay within limits on the drinking water it can withdraw from a vast underground aquifer. Zephyrhills is home to Crystal Springs, source of the bottled water named after the town and several other brands.

“We really had to do something,” said Steven Spina, a member of the town council. “A lot of residents thought it was a good thing. People were happy to see us take a breath.”

Vast Floridan aquifer is source of springs

Covering an estimated 100,000 square miles (250,000 square kilometers), the underground Floridan Aquifer is the source of 90% of Florida’s drinking water. Because of the porous nature of the state’s bedrock, millions of gallons of water find their way to the surface in the form of clear, clean springs that, in turn, feed into rivers.

The highest concentration of springs are in central and northern Florida, including most of the 30 “first magnitude” springs — those that discharge at least 65 million gallons (246 million liters) of water every day. All but four of them are considered polluted.

“We just have too much pollution going into the ground and too much water coming out of the ground,” said Ryan Smart, executive director of the nonprofit Florida Springs Council. “And when you get that combination, you end up with springs that are no longer blue and vibrant and full of life.”

Agriculture, development are main threats

In rural Florida, runoff from fertilizers and pesticides used in farm fields is a major part of the problem. Fertilizers containing phosphates and nitrogen promote algae blooms that can suffocate a spring. Livestock waste contributes, too.

“When that algae covers everything, then you lose all of the seagrasses. The seagrasses are the forests of the water,” Smart said. “Then you begin to lose the biodiversity. And it even puts our drinking water at risk.”

Elsewhere in Florida, rampant development is the threat. With over 1,000 people moving to Florida every day, more housing subdivisions are sprouting, along with the roads, strip malls, restaurants, golf courses and everything else that comes with them.

That means more paved surfaces that keep rainwater from percolating down into the aquifer and more pollutant-laden runoff from lawn fertilizers, parking lots, ever-widening roads and sometimes septic tanks. It also means more and more people, many of whom enjoy tubing, paddleboarding, kayaking and swimming in the springs.

It gets so busy in summer at some springs located in state and local parks that entry is halted by late morning. At Ichetucknee Springs State Park north of Gainesville, the daily limit of 750 tubers on the upper river is often reached within an hour after the park opens.

Kaelin Gibbs, on vacation in June with his family from Georgia, was swimming in the Blue Hole Spring along the Ichetucknee River.

“This is simply incredible; the water is cool and clear,” said Gibbs. “We’ve been to Florida’s beaches and to Orlando. There is no comparison to how beautiful this spring is.”

But that’s in peril, said Dennis Jones, a Republican former legislator deeply involved in springs issues. He said the volume of permits being issued for water use isn’t sustainable.

“You cannot keep taking water out of the aquifer because it’s not an endless supply,” Jones said.

Phosphate mining has also taken a toll on springs. Their operations require a great deal of water, which reduces water pressure available for springs. Some have died almost completely from mining and other factors, including White Sulphur Springs in north Florida, which was a sacred place for Native Americans and later a tourist resort that attracted famous visitors such as Henry Ford and Theodore Roosevelt.

Climate change alters rainfall patterns, causes sea rise

A more subtle threat to the health of springs involves Earth’s changing climate. It is altering rainfall patterns around the globe, threatening the balance that feeds Florida’s springs.

In addition, some springs along the coasts are facing an intrusion of salt water, according to the Southwest Florida Water Management District. Four major springs are becoming increasingly brackish because of sea level rise and declining rainfall.

“As a result, freshwater vegetation has a hard time surviving in this saltier environment and unwanted vegetation moves in,” the district said in a website post.

State laws to protect springs remain stalled

Florida spends billions every year on water quality projects, including about $800 million this year for Everglades restoration work. State funding for springs runs about $50 million a year, according to state documents.

Two state efforts at improving springs’ quality, both around a decade old, remain bottled up in court and administrative challenges. One would strengthen rules for permits to draw water from the major springs. The other would enhance rules to reduce the amount of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphates that goes into springs that are considered impaired.

Jones, the former legislator, said lobbying by powerful agricultural interests and related political pressures have blocked progress on the nitrogen reduction plan that was expected to take about 20 years.

“We’ve burned up almost 10 years and they haven’t got on stage one. We got more nitrates now than when we started,” Jones said.

In Congress, U.S. Rep. Randy Fine recently filed a bill that would create a Florida Springs National Park across several counties, centered around the Ocala National Forest. Fine said in a statement the designation would protect the springs and increase funding. “Our Florida springs are something unique, not just to Florida but to the country,” Fine said.

Bottling companies get cheap permits for water

It costs bottling companies just $115 for a permit allowing them to withdraw millions of gallons of water in perpetuity. But they do pay local taxes.

Blue Triton, the company that bottles Zephyrhills water, pays about $600,000 a year in taxes for things like schools, public safety and so forth, said Spina of the city council.

“They are one of our largest taxpayers,” he said.

Time grows short to ensure springs survive

Though they have challenges, Florida’s freshwater springs have energetic friends, too.

Michelle Jamesson loves the springs; she grew up swimming in one and is determined to help protect them for future generations. She volunteers for SpringsWatch Citizen Science Program, coordinating and working with other volunteers for monthly tests on the Wekiva River, north of Orlando.

They test water quality, take photos of underwater vegetation, count birds and more, seeking to spot any big changes that may require action. The Wekiva is fairly stable, she said, though it carries a lot of excess nutrients.

“The wildlife and the ecology, and all of it — it’s so full of life,” Jamesson said.

At the Environmental Protection Authority, we have taken a bold but necessary step—leading the national conversation on phasing out takeaway packs from our system. This is not just a policy directive; it is a mission. A mission to build a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable Ghana for ourselves and for generations to come. As CEO, I am fully committed to this vision. The President has declared his support, and I am personally engaged in ensuring that this transition is both effective and inclusive. We have already begun laying the groundwork with key stakeholders and the wider public. We at EPA understand that this shift will require change—new habits, new systems, and new mindsets. But I am confident that together, as a nation, we can rise to the occasion. Ghana has the potential to lead Africa in environmental responsibility. And with collective action, we will.

Government is facing out Styrofoam packs, properly called take away, the stakeholder engagement were told would be underway, as well as border checks set up to block imports of such products by colleague Maxwell Akobo, 2, has more in the following report. Styrofoam parks, popularly known as takeaways, have long been a common choice for food packaging across the country. But amid growing concerns over their environmental impact, the government is not taking. The same stance against their use. The move follows A directive from the President of the Republic, John Dramani Mahama, who in early June 2025, called for actions to phase out the use of Styrofoam in the country. Speaking at the inauguration of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Ghana Atomic Energy Commissions Board, the Chief Executive Officer of EPA, Professor Amar Brancacci, told journalists that the agency is already engaging key stakeholders to facilitate the ban of the use of Styrofoam. We have started engaging stakeholders, the Ghanian public who used the style of phones to start looking for alternatives to the style of phones so that our nests is to issue official letters and do media engagement as well on it. For now, what we are doing is engaging those stakeholders. So our next step is issuing official notices to organize on that and then we see to the ban. We believe that. Though the President has stated it, we need to engage stakeholders in the disuse of it before we go on the complete ban. She further noted that inspection offices have been established at various border points as part of efforts to prevent the importation of Styrofoam into the country. We've set up offices at the port of entry into Ghana. So currently, we have a physical space at Tema Port, which is the main entry and that will have other spaces. At the other port of entry that landed ports applaud Paga, Elubo all these areas we are going to have physical presence there so that we monitor closely item that comes in. The EPA says it remains committed to enforcing policies that protect the environment. Reporting for joining news Maxwell Acrobat 2 acre.

The company confirmed it has received a critical nuclear fuel allocation from the United States Department of Energy (DOE), ensuring a supply of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU), essential to the reactor’s operation.

This federal decision is part of the DOE’s Reactor Pilot Program, aimed at accelerating the deployment of advanced nuclear technologies. Natura Resources is among the first companies selected for the initiative, reinforcing its position within the strategic US civil nuclear sector.

Dedicated infrastructure in Texas

At the same time, the MSR-1 project has received significant academic and financial support. The Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center (SERC), located at Abilene Christian University (ACU), was delivered in August 2023. Specifically designed to host the reactor, this technical facility streamlines the construction operations of the experimental unit.

The project also received construction authorisation from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for the deployment of the reactor on ACU’s campus, marking the first such approval for a liquid-fuel advanced reactor. In June 2025, the detailed design of the MSR-1 was completed, enabling procurement activities for the reactor system to begin.

Texas legislative funding and industrial timeline

At the regional level, the Texas Legislature allocated $120mn to Texas Tech University, which will be used to support the construction of the Natura MSR-1. This public backing strengthens collaboration between academic institutions and industry in developing next-generation nuclear technologies.

The Natura MSR-1 is based on a low-pressure liquid fuel technology, with potential applications in power generation, water desalination, and medical isotope production. The next steps include assembling critical components and preparing for the test phase, expected after construction is completed.

“We are grateful for the support from the DOE, the NRC, the State of Texas, and our university partners,” said Doug Robison, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Natura Resources. “The MSR-1 aims to open a new path in advanced nuclear energy.”",https://energynews.pro/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/en_11403008283540-1.webp,N,,2025-08-29 22:01:56.734719

The Colorado River Indian Tribes (or CRIT) are taking a groundbreaking step that could reshape how we protect our waterways—they’re working to give the Colorado River the same legal rights as a person.

The Trump Administration Dismisses the Endangered Species List as ‘Hotel California.’ But There’s Far More to the Story. A small percentage of species protected by the law have ever recovered, but an even smaller fraction have gone extinct. With all the threats they face, including long-shrinking federal support, that’s an achievement, scientists note.

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

It’s the latest step by the administration against renewable energy sources

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Other wind projects are also being halted

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Trump blames renewable power for rising energy prices

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states’ climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Critics say climate and jobs are at risk

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans’ livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

By Judah Prero and Shampa Panda-Bryant

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has issued a series of regulations – both proposed and final – to implement the 2019 New York Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, which sets ambitious goals to work towards economy-wide carbon neutrality for New York. This article examines two such regulations: revisions to the existing hydrofluorocarbon standards and reporting, and mandatory greenhouse gas reporting.

New York Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act

The New York Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act requires a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions[1] statewide by 40% by 2030 and 85% by 2050 from 1990 levels.[2] It created the Climate Action Council, a group that was tasked with developing a scoping plan to set forth recommendations for how the state would be able to achieve these statewide greenhouse gas emission limits.[3] In December 2022, the council released its final scoping plan, an extensive document that recognized the need for “multipronged policy action, including new regulations and a major scale-up of public investments, to break through thorny market barriers and to manage significant risks to achieving the necessary equity and emissions reduction outcomes.”[4] Two of the regulations the DEC issued in furtherance of the scoping plan are revisions to its existing hydrofluorocarbon standards and mandatory greenhouse gas reporting.

Part 494 Revisions: Hydrofluorocarbon Standards and Reporting

New York finalized revisions to its existing Hydrofluorocarbon Standards and Reporting Regulations found at 6 N.Y.C.R.R. Part 494 that took effect in January of this year. These revisions aim to reduce the environmental impact of refrigerants, substances that are used for cooling, heating and refrigeration with global warming potentials[5] that can be hundreds to thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide. The revisions focus on fluorinated gases, a category of gases comprised of hydrofluorocarbons, chlorofluorocarbons, and hydrochlorofluorocarbons, among others. It covers a number of activities including the use, manufacture, and sale of fluorinated gases with the purpose of a full phasedown of regulated substances to the lowest global warming potential level to achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions.

The Part 494 Revisions also act as a regulatory backstop to potential changes to federal regulation of hydrofluorocarbons, which are set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part 84. HFCs are alternatives to ozone-depleting substances such as HCFCs and chlorofluorocarbons, which are controlled under the Montreal Protocol for Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, a global agreement finalized in 1987 to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances. In the United States, Title VI of the Clean Air Act implements the Montreal Protocol.[6] As a result of the phaseout of ozone-depleting substances, HFCs became the commercial refrigerant of choice. By 2016, the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol was added to phase down the production and consumption of HFCs. In 2020, Congress enacted the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act,[7] which directs the United States Environmental Protection Agency to phase down the production and consumption of specifically listed HFCs, manage these HFCs and their substitutes, and facilitate the transition to next-generation technologies through sector-based restrictions.[8] The federal HFCs regulations are contained in 40 C.F.R. Part 84.

Saliently, the Part 494 Revisions include a number of restrictions more stringent than or not included in the federal HFC regulations with oftentimes more accelerated timelines for compliance. For example, the Part 494 Revisions include restrictions that are applicable to all fluorinated gases beyond the federally regulated HFCs. As another example, the federal HFC regulation seeks to phase down the production and consumption of bulk regulated HFCs over a longer period compared to the Part 494 revisions.

Overview of Prohibitions on Fluorinated Gases in Part 494

The Part 494 Revisions have broad applicability, covering the sale, import, manufacture, and activity that “otherwise enters [fluorinated gases] into commerce” in New York.[9] They set sector-based prohibition dates on new and retrofitted equipment, products, and substances with fluorinated gases. The specific sectors identified are aerosols, foam, air conditioning, and refrigeration. They also establish time periods during which newly manufactured products may be sold after the prohibition date. The prohibition dates are determined by the regulated substance’s global warming potential, as defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.[10] It also prohibits the purchase and use of bulk regulated substances, or fluorinated gases in containers, in regulated sectors including the air conditioning and refrigeration sectors based on global warming potential. Part 494 sets prohibition dates based on the global warming potential of the regulated substance corresponding to the prohibition dates in the corresponding California state regulation.[11] That section set a prohibition date of Jan. 1, 2025 for bulk regulated substances with a global warming potential exceeding 2,200, with an upcoming prohibition date of Jan. 1, 2030 for bulk regulated substances with a potential exceeding 1,500

Although the Part 494 Revisions do not include any explicit sector-based exemptions, the DEC, in its “Assessment of Public Comments” on the Part 494 Revisions, explained that the restrictions of Part 494 do not extend to certain activities such as research and development and industries such as semiconductor manufacturing.[12] However, the restrictions would apply to any activities that fall outside of research and development such as the purchase of bulk regulated substances for use in comfort cooling of laboratories in a research and development facility.

Additional Requirements

The Part 494 Revisions also include labeling, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements. Fluorinated gas manufacturers must provide written disclosures regarding the regulated substances to buyers and the public as a label or other form of documentation. Owners and operators of the largest equipment must report annually on their equipment, leak management, and purchases of regulated substances. Owners and operators of certain equipment that contain regulated substances must now register with the DEC. Additionally, any facility that “supplies, manufactures, produces, or distributes bulk regulated substances” that is “intended for sale or use in New York State” must comply with a separate registration requirement.[13]

The Part 494 Revisions also establishes a refrigerant management program that focuses on the management of existing fluorinated gas emission sources, specifically large commercial equipment. The program establishes requirements for owners or operators of certain refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment with requirements differing depending on the equipment’s refrigerant charge capacity. For example, refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment in a listed subsector[14] with a refrigerant charge capacity of 1,500 pounds or greater must include an automatic leak detection system[15] if the equipment is operated year-round. An owner/operator of such equipment must also register with the DEC and apply a compliant label on the equipment itself or in a location in the facility that holds the equipment.

Litigation

In April 2025, the Heating, Air-conditioning & Refrigeration Distributors International and the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute industry associates filed a lawsuit against the DEC challenging the Part 494 Revisions.[16] The groups alleged that the Part 494 Revisions should be overturned on the grounds that the DEC did not adhere to the law as the authorizing statute, did not adequately consider and discuss the costs in the regulatory impact statement that accompanied the rule, failed to minimize the economic impact of compliance on small businesses, and failed to explain why the regulation exceeded the federal minimum standards as set forth in the federal HFC regulation, among other grounds.[17] The industry group petitioners seek to have the Revised Part 494 regulations vacated and set aside.

Part 253: Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting

The DEC recently proposed a rule to require mandatory greenhouse gas reporting beginning in 2027 (Part 253). Part 253 would require emissions reporting in “carbon dioxide equivalent”[18] using the 20-year global warming potential and the incorporation of upstream out-of-state greenhouse gas emissions from electricity and fossil fuel uses. It would impose reporting requirements for a number of entities that engage in activity in New York state, including electric power entities of all sizes, fuel suppliers, and certain facilities that emit 10,000 or more metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. It adds new obligations, including emissions verification by a third-party auditor and submission of an emissions monitoring plan for emission sources categorized as “large emission sources.” Part 253 is intended to inform other actions regarding greenhouse gas emission reduction, including serving as a framework for a future cap-and-trade program.

Reporting Requirement

Part 253 proposes reporting requirements for emission sources considered to be a “reporting entity,” which includes all suppliers of natural gas, petroleum products, and liquified natural gas, as well as all electric power entities. The reporting threshold and data that each reporting entity must report to the DEC differs based on the type of reporting entity. For example, natural gas suppliers must report greenhouse gas emissions that result from the use of natural gas sold, transferred, or delivered to end users in New York state. In contrast, owners and operators of waste to energy facilities must report emissions in New York state from stationary combustion and fugitive emissions, as well as upstream out-of-state emissions from fossil fuel use required for generation of energy imported into the state. Notably, Part 253 also regulates out-of-state activity. For example, natural gas suppliers must also report upstream out-of-state emissions from fossil fuel use in producing gas supplied to New York.

The DEC has stated it will accept greenhouse emissions data reported under the EPA’s greenhouse gas reporting program at 40 CFR Part 98 for those facilities required to report under Part 98, but that all facilities that report under Part 98 that qualify as a “reporting entity” must also report under Part 253.[19]

Large Emission Sources

Part 253 mandates additional requirements for “Large Emission Sources,” or emission sources that exceed a certain level of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. “Large Emission Sources” include:

Facilities in New York State that meet or exceed 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per emission year.

Waste transporters that have 25,000 MT carbon dioxide equivalent per year of emissions for out-of-state landfill and combustion facilities for all waste exported out of New York state.

Depending on the amount of fuel supplied to New York, suppliers of natural gas, petroleum products, liquified or compressed natural gas, and coal.

The additional standards include working with third-party services accredited by the DEC to submit verification of greenhouse gas emissions data.

Key Takeaways and Next Steps

These recent regulations issued under the New York Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act introduce an additional layer of complexity to the landscape of climate regulations. In these and anticipated future regulations, companies will face not only increased reporting and recordkeeping requirements but also enhanced risks for potential enforcement actions as a result of noncompliance. Adding uncertainty are recent and anticipated lawsuits challenging the validity of any final regulations. Any judicial invalidation of all or portions of final regulations could delay or forestall their implementation, halt enforcement, and lead to reevaluation of the rulemaking process. While the suits proceed, regulated entities must stay apprised of the current compliance requirements and applicable regulations.

New York will continue to issue regulations under the new law to address climate change in furtherance of the state’s goal of aggressively transitioning to a carbon-neutral economy. These regulations may have a likelihood of being more stringent than analogous federal law, which creates complexities in crafting compliance programs and modifying business operations. Compliance with this evolving regulatory landscape will be a critical priority for regulated entities in New York.

We need to stand up to the cruel, inept and corrupt administration in Washington.","This commentary is by Larry Satcowitz, of Randolph. He is a Democrat representing the Orange-Washington-Addison District in the Vermont House of Representatives and is the ranking member of the House Environment Committee.

Every day I look at the headlines with a sense of dread. Every day, it seems, the oligarchs and authoritarians gain a bit more control of our country.

As I was writing this commentary earlier this month, President Donald Trump ordered the National Guard to Washington, D.C., and threatened to do the same to other major U.S. cities. It was just one of a long string of abuses of his power as president.

It is hard to overstate how unprecedented and dangerous our situation is, and it is horrifying to think that they are just getting started. Resistance right now is critical.

In Vermont, our resistance ought to be led, at least in part, by Gov. Phil Scott. Our governor, however, has done little to resist the bully in Washington. Not only has he failed to condemn the outrageous excesses of the federal administration, but he has also readily acquiesced.

In winter, while hundreds of Vermonters protested, he welcomed JD Vance to the state. In April he rejected a call from Vermont state senators to cancel contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies that have been illegally snatching people off the streets.

Last month, his administration failed to provide evidence to the courts that would have allowed Vermont to obtain funds which had already been committed to help us with our electric vehicle charging infrastructure, undermining the efforts of our attorney general.

Earlier this month Scott met with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, who I think is doing everything he can to undermine the rules and laws that keep our nation’s environment clean and safe. Shortly after the visit, Zeldin canceled $62.5 million of already appropriated funding that would have helped low-income Vermonters get energy from solar power projects.

A few days later, and perhaps most egregiously, Scott saw fit to release the personal information of more than 140,000 Vermonters to a federal government that has no legitimate purpose for it. Governors of other states rejected the demand for this information, but our governor capitulated.

Again, the Trump administration is just getting started. There will be more assaults on our liberty and civil institutions. How many more times will Scott disregard Vermonters’ values, safety, livelihood and privacy in favor of taking the easy path?

As we all know, appeasing bullies gives them more power. Our governor either does not understand this or supports Trump’s actions. Either way, he’s dramatically failing us. We need to stand up to the cruel, inept and corrupt administration in Washington. Instead, he’s helping to pave the way for its continued consolidation of power.

Scott is only part of the way through his current term. He still has plenty of time to join other Vermont leaders in resisting Trump. I urge him to do so.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,N,,2025-08-29 20:02:09.385518

In the first five months of 2025, renewable energy projects accounted for 91% of new electricity generation.

And since Trump took office, 64,000 renewable energy jobs have been cut or paused.","In three recent segments, Fox personalities questioned the Trump administration’s efforts to block new renewable energy projects as increased demand for electricity to power new data centers drives rate hikes.

Between 2021 and 2024, average monthly residential electricity bills went up by about $22 per month. Now, energy prices are rising twice as fast as the cost of inflation. According to The Guardian, a recent report from the think tank Energy Innovation found that, “Household electricity bills have increased by 10% since Donald Trump re-entered the White House.”

Several factors, including the cost of equipment updates in response to extreme weather events and an increase in demand for electricity, are contributing to the rate hikes. In New Jersey, grid operators have reportedly been slow to connect new energy projects, with many renewable and storage projects waiting in interconnection queues. In the first five months of 2025, renewable energy projects accounted for 91% of new electricity generation. But much more is needed to help lower the cost of electricity.

One such project is Revolution Wind, a wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island that is expected to power “more than 350,000 homes.” Or at least, it was. On August 22, Trump issued a stop-work order on the project.

Fox News has scrambled to find a way to blame rate hikes on renewable energy, recently focusing on New Jersey after wholesale electric bills in the state rose by 20% in 2025.

But in an August 26 segment of Varney & Co., Fox correspondent Madison Alworth discussed the stop-work order in Rhode Island for “national security concerns” and concluded that “at the end of this are those folks that are left in the lurch the ratepayers? Because energy bills, they just continue to go up.”

Host Stuart Varney then asked, “And they haven't spelled out what is the national security concern with the project, have they?” Alworth replied that “they have not.” Varney continued, “I thought we wanted all forms of energy to power AI, wind included.”

Fox contributor and wealth management CEO Mark Tepper told Varney, “That would make sense but what we really want is consistent energy sources, and wind is known to be intermittent. It’s inconsistent.”

(Though he appeared to question the administration’s directive in the moment, Varney has hosted Interior Department Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright to push anti-renewable energy talking points unchallenged in defense of cancelling the wind project.)

During an August 23 interview on Fox News Live, correspondent Rich Edson asked Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin why it was necessary to halt a nearly-finished offshore wind farm.

“What’s the problem with this wind farm in Rhode Island?” Edson asked. Zeldin replied that Trump is “not a fan of wind,” pointed to largely overblown claims of negative environmental impacts, and added that, “Our country needs more baseload power. … It’s just not an honest approach to this entire energy conversation if we start acting as if wind is going to be a substitute for all of those things.”

In an unusual move for Fox, Edson continued to challenge Zeldin. “This project is apparently largely almost finished,” he continued. “You’ve got AI, you’ve got the electrification of everything around us. I mean, we just need power. Why would you take any power offline?”

Later in the segment, after Zeldin plugged a proposed natural gas pipeline, Edson continued to press the question of renewables, asking, “Is there room for both, though?”

Edson and Varney haven't been the only Fox employees to push back recently.

In an August 22 Fox Business segment, anchor Cheryl Casone interviewed Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ), a leading anti-renewable voice in New Jersey. Casone asked “The critics will say yeah, sure, but the money was already put through, these projects have already begun, so you’re going to get a lot of job losses. I'm curious if you worry about that?”

She also referenced that this is a nationwide issue, pointing out higher rates in Connecticut and Maine, saying, “The EIA reports that there’s going to be a 13% rise in electricity costs from 2022-2025 just in general. So this is a major problem. And now with AI data centers, we need all the energy.”

Trump is actively shrinking potential energy supply and killing hundreds of “good union jobs” by halting the construction of the Revolution Wind Project, which began in 2023.

According to Ørsted, the company behind the project, Revolution Wind is 80% finished. It has reportedly created 1,200 jobs in the region, including 300 union jobs.

Trump promised to “cut energy and electricity prices in half within 12 months” during his 2024 campaign. Instead, the administration is actively pumping the brakes on new energy projects, and costs are up and expected to continue rising. In fact, the Rhodium Group predicts that “new clean capacity additions to the grid will shrink by 57-62% from 2025 through 2035,” tightening energy supply as demand grows. And since Trump took office, 64,000 renewable energy jobs have been cut or paused. BloombergNEF also recently found that billions of dollars in investments are leaving the U.S. in response to Trump’s anti-renewable energy policies.

Experts also say that Trump’s tariffs will make the grid less reliable by making batteries more expensive. According to Wood Mackenzie, Trump’s tariffs on Chinese imports could mean that “the cost of a utility scale solar facility in the US will be 54% more expensive than in Europe and 85% more expensive than a new solar plant built in China.”",https://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/D8Image/2025/08/28/rhode-island-wind-project.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 20:01:58.679280

Led by Professor Mim Rahimi at UH’s Cullen College of Engineering, the team released two significant publications that made significant strides relating to carbon capture processes. The first, published in Nature Communications, introduced a membraneless electrochemical process that cuts energy requirements and costs for amine-based carbon dioxide capture during the acid gas sweetening process. Another, featured on the cover of ES&T Engineering, demonstrated a vanadium redox flow system capable of both capturing carbon and storing renewable energy.

“These publications reflect our group’s commitment to fundamental electrochemical innovation and real-world applicability,” Rahimi said in a news release. “From membraneless systems to scalable flow systems, we’re charting pathways to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors and support the transition to a low-carbon economy.”

According to the researchers, the “A Membraneless Electrochemically Mediated Amine Regeneration for Carbon Capture” research paper marked the beginning of the team’s first focus. The research examined the replacement of costly ion-exchange membranes with gas diffusion electrodes. They found that the membranes were the most expensive part of the system, and they were also a major cause of performance issues and high maintenance costs.

The researchers achieved more than 90 percent CO2 removal (nearly 50 percent more than traditional approaches) by engineering the gas diffusion electrodes. According to PhD student and co-author of the paper Ahmad Hassan, the capture costs approximately $70 per metric ton of CO2, which is competitive with other innovative scrubbing techniques.

“By removing the membrane and the associated hardware, we’ve streamlined the EMAR workflow and dramatically cut energy use,” Hassan said in the news release. “This opens the door to retrofitting existing industrial exhaust systems with a compact, low-cost carbon capture module.”

The second breakthrough, published by PhD student Mohsen Afshari, displayed a reversible flow battery architecture that absorbs CO2 during charging and releases it upon discharge. The results suggested that the technology could potentially provide carbon removal and grid balancing when used with intermittent renewables, such as solar or wind power.

“Integrating carbon capture directly into a redox flow battery lets us tackle two challenges in one device,” Afshari said in the release. “Our front-cover feature highlights its potential to smooth out renewable generation while sequestering CO2.”",https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTUzMjA0MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4ODkyMTc3OH0.JzXp_aNHLeW4C1rGD9tI0eyo9ZLUdobQq-apHQXd1Qs/img.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C72%2C0%2C73,N,,2025-08-29 22:59:27.979539

Dubbed the “OPEC of nickel,” Indonesia has transformed the global nickel market through a raw export ban and a surge of Chinese investment.
In 2024, Indonesia accounted for 60 percent of global nickel production and majority Chinese owned companies accounted for approximately 80 percent of battery grade nickel production.
The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) has already expressed interest in nickel projects in Brazil and Tanzania.
But the DFC could back energy infrastructure projects critical to cleaner nickel production, while EXIM could leverage its “Make More in America” initiative to finance domestic PCAM and CAM production using Indonesian nickel as feedstock.","The elimination of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean vehicle tax credit in the Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Bill” is raising urgent questions for the electric vehicle industry in the United States. How will this impact demand? Can American vehicles compete against Chinese vehicles? And where should companies now source critical minerals?

Known as 30D, the tax credit incentivized the sourcing of critical minerals from free trade agreement (FTA) partners and non-Chinese owned companies for vehicles to qualify for the $7,500 credit. This created a premium for minerals from Australia, Canada, and Chile, helping to stimulate the development of alternative supply chains. Producers without FTAs – such as Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo – were excluded.

But the tax credit’s elimination is shifting the calculus on critical mineral sourcing. U.S. strategy must evolve accordingly, particularly in relation to Indonesia, where the current market trajectory is increasingly untenable.

Dubbed the “OPEC of nickel,” Indonesia has transformed the global nickel market through a raw export ban and a surge of Chinese investment. In 2024, Indonesia accounted for 60 percent of global nickel production and majority Chinese owned companies accounted for approximately 80 percent of battery grade nickel production. Despite criticism over weak environmental and labor standards and overproduction, Indonesia’s low-cost supply continues to expand – driving down prices and forcing competitors in Australia and New Caledonia to suspend operations. As Jorge Uzcategui, cobalt and nickel senior analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, noted, Indonesia’s market share grows “day by day.”

The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects Indonesia will account for 67 percent of mined nickel by 2030 and 75 percent by 2040, while production in countries like Australia, Canada, and the Philippines declines. Weak EV demand in the United States – exacerbated by the loss of the 30D tax credit and broader economic uncertainty – is likely to depress prices further, reinforcing Indonesia’s dominance.

Ford is the only major U.S. company invested in the battery supply chain in Indonesia. They partnered with Vale Indonesia and China’s Huayou Cobalt, one of the leading nickel refiners and midstream producers. Aware of the negative view toward Indonesia, Ford’s press release stressed the project meets their high ESG standards and the nickel will be “mined in line with our company’s sustainability targets.” Nickel rich lithium-ion batteries remain the most popular battery choice in the United States for EV manufacturers because the nickel-based batteries offer extended driving range, limiting “range-anxiety” for Americans.

Lacking an FTA with the United States, the Indonesian government actively pushed for a “critical minerals agreement,” a critical mineral focused mini-FTA, that would have made Indonesia’s nickel IRA compliant after the initial passage. But all potential minerals agreements faced bipartisan criticism, and a potential Indonesia agreement received intense scrutiny. Now any discussion over a critical minerals agreement is moot.

Without a new strategy that accounts for the elimination of 30D, combined with Indonesia’s continued dominance, the nickel market will continue to consolidate. The United States needs to decide on a new strategy for nickel and Indonesia: build a separate supply chain because of issues with Chinese involvement and labor and environmental standards, or actively engage with the leading producer to ensure that U.S. companies benefit?

Building a Western focused supply chain would require a multipart strategy that utilizes targeted tariffs and strategic investments in coordination with key allies.

Tariffing Indonesian nickel directly is challenging, as the U.S. imports little to none of it. The United States does not have the midstream capabilities to refine the material. Instead, trade actions would need to focus on finished goods – battery cells, packs, and electric vehicles – that contain refined Indonesian nickel. These tariffs could be implemented as a result of the Section 232 investigation the Department of Commerce is currently undertaking on processed critical minerals and derivative products. Any trade actions would need to be undertaken in coordination with strategic investments into non-Indonesian nickel projects across the supply chain to finance new mine and processing facilities or support existing mines nearing care and maintenance. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) has already expressed interest in nickel projects in Brazil and Tanzania.

In an ideal scenario, the strategy would be coordinated with key nickel producers like Australia, Canada, New Caledonia, Norway, and others, who could offer domestic incentives to support key mines. At the same time, consumer economies such as the EU, Japan, and South Korea could impose similar tariffs to reinforce non-Indonesian supply chains. Together, these measures would establish a premium for Western-backed projects, helping them compete on cost despite higher environmental and labor standards. This strategy would take several years to get off the ground as production at new mines or the construction of processing facilities require significant time.

Australia, Canada, and potential U.S. projects stand to benefit from this strategy. But the biggest winner would be China. Its dominant position in Indonesia would only strengthen, giving their firms continued access to low-cost nickel. The biggest losers would be automakers and battery manufacturers in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and South Korea. Swapping EV tax credits for tariffs would raise their production costs, making electric vehicles less competitive with internal combustion engine models. This would further slow adoption and widen the gap with Chinese automakers.

This strategy is also unlikely to succeed. Coordinating tariffs, investments, and domestic incentives across allied nations is politically and logistically difficult in the best environments. It is impossible in the current Trump administration-led environment.

The U.S. and its partners also lack the resources to develop parallel supply chains for every mineral on the USGS critical list. Washington needs to prioritize what minerals are the most important for national security purposes while being willing to rely on foreign supply chains for other minerals. I do not think nickel rises to the same level of criticality as other key minerals when considering potential supply disruptions. Immediate efforts to reduce reliance on China should focus on minerals where Beijing controls strategic chokepoints domestically. In terms of nickel, the U.S. should instead prioritize the midstream by onshoring precursor and cathode active material (PCAM and CAM) production.

This means the best strategy is direct engagement with Indonesia and investment into their nickel sector. The Trump administration and Indonesia are finalizing trade negotiations and have the opportunity to make cooperation on nickel a major part of the final deal.

Indonesia, like other resource rich developing countries, wants to diversify away from China. They specifically want increased access to the U.S. market because it has the highest growth potential due to the popularity of nickel-rich lithium-ion batteries. The new Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions for manufacturing tax credit (45X) make sourcing from Indonesia challenging but the Indonesian government has shown the willingness to support divestment and reduce ownership stakes in projects in order to get U.S. investment. The trade negotiations are the best opportunity to get responsible U.S. participation in the market and lift environmental and labor standards.

Chinese ownership makes direct U.S. government investment from DFC or EXIM mining and processing projects unlikely. But the DFC could back energy infrastructure projects critical to cleaner nickel production, while EXIM could leverage its “Make More in America” initiative to finance domestic PCAM and CAM production using Indonesian nickel as feedstock.

The Ford model provides the best example for American engagement in Indonesia. It is unlikely new Western mining companies would become involved in the Indonesian nickel industry given policy uncertainty around royalties, depressed prices, and the current incumbents. Instead, the U.S. can utilize the trade negotiations to push for American automakers or commodity firms to take ownership stakes in key projects and receive the subsequent offtake for domestic production. While Chinese companies dominate the industry, Benchmark estimates the share of majority Chinese owned battery grade production in Indonesia will decrease from 80 percent to 54 percent by the early 2030s. American companies can partner with Vale Indonesia, Eramet, Harita Nickel, or other Indonesian companies.

Lower environmental and labor standards have been a key sticking point for avoiding Indonesia. Story after story highlights the environmental damage caused by the nickel sector. Indonesia needs to raise environmental standards, especially regarding its reliance on coal for processing. But the U.S. has limited leverage to drive these changes by standing on the sidelines. Indonesian companies “want assurances that putting money into ESG will lead to further investment from the West” according to Uzcategui. Active and direct engagement is the only way that the U.S. can give those assurances and push for meaningful improvements. Indonesian companies have already shown their willingness to raise standards, even committing to an IRMA audit — one of the most rigorous in the mining industry.

Other critics have pointed to the export ban as a major impediment to engagement. Despite reports after the initial deal suggesting the elimination of trade barriers, it is highly unlikely that Indonesia will change their export restrictions on raw material. Even if they did, the United States does not have the capabilities to process the ore. But more importantly, the export ban is beneficial to the U.S as the nickel would be flowing to China for processing if not for the ban. The United States should view any major critical mineral production out of China as a strategic win as it is out of the reach of potential export restrictions from Beijing.

Comparisons to the oil and gas sectors are often overused when discussing critical minerals. But the last 100 years of energy diplomacy should remind us that we cannot always pick our partners when sourcing key commodities. Indonesia is not the perfect partner, but they cannot be ignored. Direct engagement with them will make American automakers more competitive and make the nickel industry more sustainable.",https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2025-08-29-152705.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 19:03:42.522201

(AP) — California energy regulators Friday put the brakes on plans requiring oil companies to pay a penalty if their profits climb too high, a temporary win for the fossil fuel industry two years after the governor declared the state had “finally beat big oil.”

The postponement by the California Energy Commission until 2030 comes after two oil refineries accounting for roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity announced their plans to close in the coming months. The commission has the power to implement a penalty but has not done so since it was given that authority in 2023.

The penalty was considered a landmark piece of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s government and the state’s ambitious goals to curb climate change. The state faces challenges in its efforts to take on the oil industry while ensuring a stable and affordable fuel supply. His administration is also proposing to temporarily streamline approvals of new oil wells in existing oil fields in an effort to maintain a stable fuel supply.

Siva Gunda, the commission’s vice chair, said the state is not “walking back” its efforts to wean itself off fossil fuels but must prioritize protecting consumers at the gas pump.

“I personally truly believe that this pause will be beneficial to ensure that this mid-transition is smooth,” he said.

The commission still plans to set rules that would require oil refineries to keep a minimum level of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when refineries go offline for maintenance.

Jamie Court, the president of Consumer Watchdog who supported the law, said the energy commission’s vote is “basically a giveaway to the industry.”

“I’m really disheartened and disgusted by Newsom,” he said. “I feel like this is just a total about-face. And in the end it’s going to result in greater price spikes.”

But the Western States Petroleum Association recommended that the state postpone a penalty for 20 years.

“While today’s action by the CEC stopped short of a full statutory repeal or a 20-year pause, it represents a needed step to provide some certainty for California’s fuels market,” CEO Catherine Reheis-Boyd said in a statement. “The vote demonstrates the CEC’s understanding that imposing this failed policy would have likely exacerbated investment concerns contributing to California’s recent refinery closures.”

In 2022, Newsom called the Legislature into a special session to pass a law aimed at holding oil companies accountable for making too much money after a summer of record-high gas prices in California. The governor signed a law the following year authorizing the energy commission to penalize oil companies for excessive profits.

The law also required oil companies to report more data on their operations to the state. It created an independent division at the commission to oversee the oil and gas industry and provide guidance to the state on its energy transition.

Newsom’s office thanked the energy commission for voting to postpone implementing a penalty, saying it was a “prudent step” toward stabilizing the oil market.

“When Governor Newsom signed this legislation two years ago, he promised that we would utilize the new transparency tools to look under the hood of our oil and gas market that had been a black box for decades,” spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said in a statement. “We did exactly that.”

Julia Stein, deputy director of a climate institute at UCLA School of Law, said state officials are still intent on advancing their efforts to transition away from fossil fuels.

“But I think there is also a sense at the state level that we’re entering a different phase of the transition where some of these problems are going to be presented more acutely,” she said. “And folks are kind of now trying to understand how they’re going to approach that in real time.”

California has the highest gas prices in the nation, largely due to taxes and environmental regulations. Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.59 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.

The commission has not determined what would count as an excessive profit under the policy.

Setting a penalty could be risky for the state because it could unintentionally discourage production and drive prices up, said Severin Borenstein, an economist and public policy professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

The federal government has been equally committed to exploring nuclear energy across the Biden and Trump administrations as the country seems to be marching forward into a new era of nuclear energy production.","As the United States faces escalating energy demands amid advancing resource-intensive technology and aging infrastructure, nuclear power has rematerialized as a central pillar of national and state-level energy strategies.

Recent federal executive actions and passage of bipartisan legislation—alongside a wave of state initiatives—signal a renewed commitment to nuclear development, with implications for permitting, licensing and infrastructure investment. This alert outlines the latest regulatory shifts, including executive orders from the Trump administration, implementation of the ADVANCE Act and state-level momentum from New York to Colorado.

Federal Updates

On May 23, President Trump signed four executive orders aimed at fostering a “nuclear renaissance” to help the country “face a new set of challenges, including a global race to dominate in artificial intelligence (AI) a growing need for energy independence, and access to uninterruptible power supplies for national security.”

The executive orders are titled:

“Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies For National Security,”

“Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,”

“Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy,” and

“Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base.”

These executive orders lay out ambitious goals to reinvigorate U.S. nuclear energy, from deploying nuclear reactors to power military bases and AI data centers, recycling and processing spent reactor fuel, increasing domestic production of uranium, bolstering the nuclear workforce, and ultimately expanding nuclear energy by 300 gigawatts by 2050.

However, while the Trump administration has demonstrated ambition for expanding nuclear energy, this is paired with an equally ambitious desire to cut the regulatory scheme surrounding it, particularly around reactor licensing and testing. This has resulted in staff reductions and restricting resources at key agencies.

One of President Trump’s executive orders is aimed at reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the independent agency that regulates the safety of nuclear reactors. The order directs the NRC to work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to “reorganize the NRC to promote the expeditious processing of license applications and the adoption of innovative technology.” The order also seeks to cut staff at NRC: “The personnel and functions of the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) shall be reduced to the minimum necessary to fulfill ACRS’s statutory obligations.”

Also in the interest of cutting bureaucratic red tape, one order directs Department of Energy (DOE) leadership to consult with DOGE to streamline environmental reviews by “reform[ing] the Department’s rules governing compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)” and “eliminate or expedite the Department’s environmental reviews for authorizations, permits, approvals, leases, and any other activity requested by an applicant or potential applicant.” These orders are consistent with President Trump’s broader agenda of cutting the size of federal agencies and reducing regulatory schemes for businesses across all sectors.

Even as the Trump administration makes these regulatory reforms, the DOE is expected to work towards implementing the Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy (ADVANCE) Act, which President Biden signed on July 9, 2024. The ADVANCE Act passed with significant bipartisan support and included provisions aiming to streamline the permitting process by:

providing incentives for developing and deploying new nuclear technologies;

keeping existing nuclear plants online;

converting old coal plants into nuclear plants;

restricting imports of uranium from Russia and China; and

implementing initiatives for efficient, timely and predictable license application reviews by the NRC.

DOE is also working to refocus the Office of Nuclear Energy per the president’s fiscal year 2026 Budget Request. Under the budget proposal, the program would focus on developing innovative concepts for next-generation nuclear reactors and researching advanced nuclear fuels, shifting away from nuclear research.

Simultaneously, Congress is working to create new and strengthen existing programs supporting the growth of nuclear energy. Citing the need for reliable, baseload generation resources, House Energy and Water appropriators provided an increase of $110 million for DOE’s Nuclear Energy Office, including an increase for the Advanced Nuclear Fuel Availability Program to help support production of the kind of fuel used by advanced reactors. The loan program office would also get more money for nuclear project financing. Senate appropriators have not yet released their version of the Energy and Water Appropriations bill.

Most recently, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee held a hearing for the Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Energy Policy and Regulatory Affairs on July 22 titled “The New Atomic Age: America’s Energy Future.” This hearing was the latest congressional action related to nuclear energy policy.

State Updates

The federal government is not alone in its renewed appetite for nuclear energy development. Since last year, 34 states across the political spectrum and rural-urban divides introduced legislation relating to nuclear energy policy. In 2024 alone, 25 states passed pro-nuclear legislation, and public utility commissions (PUCs) in seven states approved orders or took direct action in support of nuclear energy. These actions range from funding viability studies for nuclear energy and creating workforce development programs, to paving the way to build new nuclear reactors.

In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) recently directed the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to develop and construct a zero-emission nuclear power plant in upstate New York. The proposed plant would be the first major nuclear plant built in the United States in over 15 years, and only the sixth built since 1991. Hochul said the new plant will provide one gigawatt of clean energy for the state to help address the increased energy demands and meet the state’s climate goals. The proposal has garnered support from labor unions, including the Transport Workers Union International and the Utility Workers Union of America, but has drawn criticism from environmental groups who fear that the plan will distract from other renewable energy projects.

Texas has also made recent strides to become a leader in nuclear energy. In 2023, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) created the Texas Advanced Nuclear Reactor Working Group to “position Texas as the national leader on advanced nuclear energy.” This year, Gov. Abbott called for the legislature to position the state to lead the country’s “nuclear renaissance,” seeing nuclear energy as a solution to increasing energy needs. Texas currently consumes more energy than any other state and ranks sixth in energy use per capita. This demand has led the state to invest heavily in energy programs from oil and gas to renewable energy sources, and now nuclear as well. In response to Gov. Abbott’s agenda, lawmakers passed the Texas Nuclear Deployment Act this past session, which created the Texas Nuclear Advanced Energy Office and invested $350 million in programs to develop and deploy next-generation nuclear technologies.

And most recently, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) signed the bipartisan House Bill 25-1040 into law passed during the 2025 legislative session to define nuclear energy as a “clean energy resource.” Additionally, Denver International Airport CEO Phil Washington recently announced that the airport is considering plans to build a small modular nuclear reactor on-site to help meet increasing energy demands.

On the other side of the Continental Divide, the governors of Utah, Idaho and Wyoming met for the “Built Here: Nuclear Energy Summit” and signed a tri-state compact to shape regional energy policy with a focus on nuclear development. According to a press release by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox (R), “The compact focuses on advancing energy resilience, coordinating infrastructure, advocating for commonsense federal policies, and accelerating the development of reliable, affordable nuclear energy.” Gov. Cox also said that the compact “highlighted Utah’s mission to become a national hub for advanced nuclear energy development and underscored the critical role of regional collaboration in building a secure, abundant energy future.”

In January, Wyoming issued the first state permit for a commercial-scale advanced nuclear reactor project. The planned power plant has begun construction near Kemmerer, Wyoming, and will begin producing 350 megawatts of consistent power, enough to power 250,000 homes. The parties involved in in the Wyoming project have begun discussion with additional communities across Wyoming and Utah to build small modular reactors at sites where coal power plants are being retired.

What’s Next?

Proponents and opponents of nuclear energy are not isolated on either side of the aisle. Proponents are motivated by various factors including the need for reliable baseload power, the potential job growth associated with a growing nuclear energy sector, emissions reductions and lower electricity costs. Opponents site concerns with safety and a lack of solutions for storing large amounts of nuclear waste. Interest in solving a different problem may unify both sides, the need to meet the expected exponential increase in demand for electricity due to the growth of AI.

Nuclear energy may well be entering a renaissance in the United States as the country and individual states look for solutions to address increasing energy demands. The last few years have seen states across the country and across the political spectrum take steps to investigate the feasibility of and even begin constructing nuclear reactors. The federal government has been equally committed to exploring nuclear energy across the Biden and Trump administrations as the country seems to be marching forward into a new era of nuclear energy production.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14565_3925.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 22:02:06.139138

Utah signed a new memorandum of understanding with TerraPower, a nuclear energy company founded by Bill Gates, to explore a potential site for a reactor and an energy storage plant in the state.

The agreement establishes a non-binding framework for cooperation between the Utah Office of Energy Development, TerraPower and Flagship Companies, a developer, aiming to bring a project to Utah similar to one under construction near Kemmerer, Wyoming — a sodium-cooled fast reactor known as Natrium.

Preliminary site recommendations will come by the end of 2025, according to a news release from the Utah Office of Energy Development. The state and the companies will consider factors like “community support, the physical characteristics of the site, the ability of the site to obtain a license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and access to existing infrastructure.”

Gov. Spencer Cox praised the project’s prospects, saying it aligns with Operation Gigawatt, his plan to double the state’s energy production over the next decade.

“Operation Gigawatt is about adding capacity from diverse sources — nuclear, natural gas, geothermal and more — so families and businesses have power that is affordable, reliable and clean,” Cox said in a statement. “This agreement with TerraPower will help keep rates low, strengthen our grid and ensure Utah’s future can be as strong as our past.”

The agreement also adds to a list of memorandums of understanding the state has signed with other nuclear energy developers in its quest to lead in the country’s “nuclear renaissance.”

TerraPower CEO Chris Levesque said in an interview with Bloomberg Podcasts that new technologies, like Natrium, will be essential to upscale nuclear energy in the country, since they are cheaper and safer than current plants.

“It’s still a fission reactor. We break uranium atoms to release a lot of heat and boil water to make steam and drive turbines to make electricity the old fashioned way,” Levesque said. “But by cooling the reactor with liquid sodium, it allows us to have a low pressure plant, which is going to be safer.”

The company has already made progress with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for its first plant in Wyoming, Levesque said. After that’s cleared, the timeline for the construction of a Natrium reactor could be about three years, “which is much shorter than today’s technologies that require all of the steel and concrete,” he said.

For Cox, the project represents an important step in the country’s advancement of nuclear technology, which he said has stalled for the last 50 years. Building more energy resources is in the nation’s best interest, he added, especially with the emergence of power-hungry AI and data centers.

Utah Republican Sen. John Curtis, who has championed green energy initiatives in Washington, D.C., is also on board with the project.

With operations in more than 55 countries and over 50,000 employees supporting 22 brands, the company reaches hundreds of millions of homes worldwide.

CEO Hakan Bulgurlu says this scale brings responsibility to reduce environmental impact while ensuring resilient global operations.

Beko is driven by sustainability at the heart of growth, which has resulted in the company embedding low-carbon solutions and circularity across its value chain, from raw material sourcing through to product end-of-life.

By addressing energy use, emissions and waste management throughout manufacturing and distribution, the company aims to reduce risks while creating long-term efficiency gains.

Hakan also points to the role of leadership networks in aligning supply chains with climate goals.

As part of the Climate Leaders CEO Alliance within the World Economic Forum, and as President of the European Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (APPLiA), he works with peers to raise industry standards. These collaborations seek to harmonise supply chain practices globally, ensuring suppliers and partners adopt measurable sustainability targets.

How has Beko’s sustainability progressed across regions?

Sustainability used to be a niche expectation in a few developed markets but today, it’s a global imperative.

We are seeing a rising demand for cleaner, more efficient solutions across all markets we operate in.

At Beko, we’ve made it our mission to ensure our ethos of sustainability is accessible to all and is deeply embedded in our manufacturing processes – in some markets, there are no energy-efficiency standards.

We raised our own bar anyway because we answer to something bigger than compliance.

When we entered the South African market in 2011, the average refrigerator was ‘E’ energy class.

We voluntarily improved our market offering so that the lowest class refrigerator we sell is an ‘A’ energy rating.

We were able to reduce the energy consumption of refrigerators made in South Africa by 50%.

Last year, our Defy brand launched its Solar Off-Grid refrigerator and freezer range, specifically designed to address the challenges related to frequent loadshedding and clean energy access in South Africa.

The products are revolutionary themselves, by leveraging solar energy, this range operates independently of the electrical grid, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and minimising carbon emissions.

Emerging markets, such as Pakistan, Bangladesh and Egypt, are key to the global transformation effort but they can’t do it alone.

These regions face unique challenges as rising incomes and temperatures drive greater energy demand.

And it’s simply not acceptable to deny those in the Global South access to comfortable and healthy lives out of fear that emissions will rise as they gain access to what many in the Global North have taken for granted for decades.

That’s why we are focused on using advanced technologies in these markets and establishing sustainable manufacturing facilities.

Our factory in Egypt will achieve up to 50% energy savings compared to conventional facilities.

While in Bangladesh, our factory is designed to maximise natural daylight, featuring skylight roof surfaces for sustainable energy management with energy monitoring systems to track sustainability targets.

By investing in cleaner, more efficient production methods and creating localised solutions, we’re not only reducing emissions but also enabling these countries to leapfrog to more sustainable development pathways.

In Ulmi, Romania, our manufacturing plant was awarded Sustainability Lighthouse status by the WEF for the implementation of cutting-edge sustainable technologies that includes advanced wastewater treatment and running on renewable energy and green electricity.

These are practical examples of how sustainable design can be scaled globally without compromising on performance or accessibility across our planet.

We want solutions that cross borders and solve real problems because unless sustainability is global, it’s not working.

What significant environmental progress has Beko made?

While our initial goal was to achieve 50 MWp of renewable energy capacity by 2030, we have exceeded expectations.

In 2024, our renewable energy capacity reached 90.2-megawatt peak (MWp) — almost 30 times what it was just four years ago.

As of 2024, 60.5% of the electricity we use in manufacturing comes from renewable sources, with a goal to reach 100% by 2030, we’ve also scaled our circular economy model.

Since 2014, we’ve recycled more than 1.86 million Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) units in our WEEE recycling plants and in 2024, more than 114,000 products were refurbished across our global refurbishment network which covers facilities in UK, Italy and Türkiye.

In addition, thanks to the innovative recycled material formulations we have been developing, we have increased our use of recycled plastic throughout the years.

In 2024, 27,835 tonnes of recycled plastics were used in our products and our products are becoming more efficient, too.

In 2024, 61.9% of our turnover came from energy-efficient products, while low-carbon products accounted for 71.5% – that’s impact at scale.

No one would expect a sustainability leader to come from an emerging market, especially in an emission-heavy industry like ours.

Yet, we have been leading our industry in Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the last 6 years in a row. And we didn’t get there by doing what was easy.

We got there by embedding sustainability into the DNA of how we design, build, operate and lead.

These efforts also contributed to us earning a place in TIME Magazine’s list of the world’s most sustainable companies, ranking 17th overall (a leap from 44th in the 2024 list) and first in our industry.

How have the KPIs been strengthened?

For us, sustainability is an operating system.

By aligning our key performance indicators to global climate goals, we are safeguarding our sustainability intentions and sticking close to the science.

We have science-based targets officially validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) to cut our Scope 1,2 and Scope 3 use phase emissions by 42% by 2030 and reduce Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 90% by 2050, aligned with the 1.5°C climate scenario.

We have embedded sustainability into our leadership DNA by indirectly linking the success of sustainability related KPIs to executive compensation as part of the overall performance reviews.

Targets for reducing Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, along with supply chain sustainability integration, are included in the scorecards of our key C-suite leaders.

Our Sustainability Linked Financing Framework ties our financial commitments to tangible goals, including reducing GHG emissions and increasing female representation in our workforce.

And we publish it all: verified, transparent ESG data that meets CSRD, GRI and IIRC standards.

We believe sustainability metrics should be as robust as financial ones because in the future, they will be.

How does Beko extend its sustainability into product design and its supply chain?

We take a full lifecycle approach to sustainability and that starts with the materials we use.

We use recycled PET bottles, fishnets and textile wastes in washing machines, dishwashers, ovens and air conditioners and we’re also designing products for easier disassembly and recyclability.

As a global appliance manufacturer, we recognise the critical role our industry plays. Four major product categories, electric motors, air conditioners, refrigerators and lighting, account for 40% of global electricity consumption.

With appliances accounting for more than a third of residential energy use and 15% of global carbon emissions, we have an obligation to do our part.

For years, our industry has focused on Scope 1 and 2 emissions, those we can directly control.

At Beko, we’ve also made substantial progress in reducing emissions in our manufacturing plants through energy efficiency initiatives and renewable energy investments but, these only represent around 1% of our total emissions.

The real challenge lies in Scope 3, which accounts for almost 99% of our company’s GHG emissions and more than 80% of these Scope 3 emissions come from the use phase of our appliances in consumers’ homes – innovation plays a critical role here too.

Technologies across our appliances such as EnergySpin achieves up to 35% energy savings in comparison to our traditional washing machines in everyday wash programmes, not just in eco mode, while our smart home platform HomeWhiz tracks energy consumption in connected devices, with personalised intelligent recommendations and energy saving modes.

For example, our CoolAdapt technology in refrigerators adjust around usage patterns and external conditions to reduce energy use – proving that small changes can add up.

Choosing efficient appliances with adaptive features, maintaining them properly and using features like eco programmes can significantly lower both emissions and energy bills.

Even switching your laundry from a 40 °C wash to a 30 °C wash can cut energy consumption by approximately 30–40%.

Ultimately, our goal is to give people the tools and technology to live more sustainably, without having to compromise on comfort, convenience or performance.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/d7116cea5ac0e09a1215d8ed16885a66:af322f9ea161e54ee69f223b3493a32d/hakan-bulgurlu-beko-ceo.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 05:59:31.731232

Concerns over the DOE plan, however, go beyond the commission’s ability to regulate nuclear power.","The Trump administration plans to supply the nuclear power industry with plutonium from decommissioned warheads dating back to the Cold War. The plan could provide 20 metric tons of plutonium fuel to make nuclear power more viable, but it has raised concerns over safety and economic feasibility.

The Department of Energy is expected to release details on the plan in the coming days, Reuters reported, citing a source familiar with the matter and a draft memo. The idea of repurposing plutonium from warheads for the power sector was originally floated in an executive order that President Donald Trump signed in May.

The initiative comes as the nuclear power industry looks to grow, and it has the backing of major tech companies that are looking for zero-emissions power for data centers. Trump has touted nuclear as a reliable power source, but access to fuel remains a key barrier that raises costs and slows the construction of new facilities.

Why does the US have extra plutonium?

Uranium can be found in nature, deep under the Earth’s surface. Plutonium, on the other hand, is man-made. Nuclear power plants in the U.S. use uranium, but plutonium is produced as a byproduct of the chain reaction. Some nuclear power plants can use plutonium as fuel, but it has to be extracted and processed.

Both elements are used to make nuclear weapons. Weapons-grade plutonium is derived from uranium to produce a more powerful explosion. Both elements are highly radioactive.

As the Cold War ended, the U.S. and Russia began disassembling nuclear warheads. The U.S. government currently holds about 60 metric tons of excess plutonium from used reactor fuel, the “pits” that were used in nuclear weapons and other residue, according to a 2018 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.

What do we know about the DOE plan?

The 20 metric tons that will become available for the nuclear power industry would come from a 34-metric-ton stockpile the U.S. promised to dispose of in a 2000 nonproliferation agreement with Russia, according to Reuters.

A June memo published on the DOE website outlines takeaways from Trump’s directions, stating, “the President ordered the creation of a program to dispose of surplus plutonium by processing and making it available for advanced reactor fuel.”

A DOE spokesperson did not divulge any specific details on the plan. Reuters quoted the spokesperson as saying the department is “evaluating a variety of strategies to build and strengthen domestic supply chains for nuclear fuel, including plutonium.”

What are the potential pros and cons of recycling plutonium?

Denia Djokić, an assistant research scientist at the University of Michigan specializing in radioactive waste management, told Straight Arrow News she is “hesitant” about the administration’s plan.

On one hand, recycling plutonium has appeal because access to nuclear fuel is “one of the big bottlenecks” facing the nuclear power industry, which currently relies on mining uranium. The fuel would more likely be used to power conventional nuclear reactors, as the next-generation small modular reactors use a specific type of uranium fuel called HALEU.

However, Djokić said the U.S. government had already attempted to recycle plutonium, starting 25 years ago, and found the costs to be prohibitive.

“They wouldn’t be any different now,” Djokić said.

The government even funded a facility in South Carolina to convert leftover plutonium into fuel for nuclear reactors, but cost overruns led the first Trump administration to cancel the $50 billion contract before the facility was completed.

Djokić said plutonium is “a notoriously finicky metal” that makes it difficult to handle. During any recycling process, she said, “you’re essentially increasing the risks of radioactive things being released,” so safety measures contribute to high costs.

Edwin Lyman, a nuclear physicist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told Reuters that the “DOE should stick to the safer, more secure and far cheaper plan to dilute [excess plutonium] and directly dispose of it.”

Lyman pointed to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, an underground storage site in New Mexico designed to dispose of nuclear waste.

However, some experts see potential in the DOE’s approach.

Bradley Williams, an energy policy advisor at the Idaho National Laboratory, said using existing plutonium is “an initial step that makes sense,” Axios reported. “We might as well get useful electricity out of it,” Williams said at a recent National Press Club event.

What is the state of nuclear regulation?

The use of a different fuel type may also be subject to review by federal regulators.

However, nearly 200 employees have left the Nuclear Regulatory Commission since January amid budget cuts by the Trump administration, according to the Financial Times.

Two of five commissioners’ seats are vacant, and half of the agency’s senior leaders are serving in an “acting” capacity. When Scott Morris left the NRC in May, he was the deputy executive director of operations. Now, Morris told the Financial Times, the agency is experiencing a “huge brain drain of talent.”

Overhauling the commission was also among the goals outlined in Trump’s executive order. Concerns over the DOE plan, however, go beyond the commission’s ability to regulate nuclear power.

Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., cochair of the Congressional Nuclear Weapons and Arms Control Working Group, spoke out against the plan, warning that it poses a security risk.

Giving away 20 metric tons of plutonium amounts to “trashing long-standing bipartisan U.S. policy and raising serious concerns about the spread of nuclear weapons to additional states or terrorist groups,” Markey said. Some scientists think that it’s possible to reverse-engineer aspects of nuclear warhead design by analyzing repurposed plutonium.

“We might as well just sell nuclear weapons at Costco,” Markey said.",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/082925-GFX_Mikael_FI-PlutoneumNuclearPower-CLEAN.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 19:04:00.192819

In Indiana, Toyota has committed another $1.4 billion to prepare its Princeton plant for a separate three-row electric SUV.
One frequent rumor is the name of Toyota’s three-row EV.","(TestMiles) – Toyota is investing billions in U.S. manufacturing and EVs, but rumors continue to swirl about even bolder future products. Separating fact from speculation matters for both buyers and industry insiders.

Why does this matter right now?

Toyota is not dabbling in electrification; it is betting billions. Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina is scheduled to open soon with fourteen lines for hybrid and battery output. The site covers more than 1,800 acres, carries a price tag of nearly 13.9 billion dollars, and is expected to employ about 5,100 people. The factory will feed batteries to U.S.-built hybrids and EVs for both Toyota and Lexus, forming the backbone of Toyota’s electrification strategy in America.

Two new three-row EVs are confirmed. The Kentucky plant in Georgetown will assemble Toyota’s first U.S.-built battery electric vehicle starting soon. A 1.3 billion dollar investment adds battery pack assembly to the facility, tying production directly to the North Carolina supply chain. In Indiana, Toyota has committed another $1.4 billion to prepare its Princeton plant for a separate three-row electric SUV. Together, these programs signal that Toyota is not just selling EVs in the U.S. But it is building them here.

How does it compare to rivals?

Rivals have already planted their flags. Tesla operates a vertically integrated model from Nevada to Texas. Hyundai’s metaplant in Georgia is scaling up for EVs across several of its brands. Toyota’s plan is different: decentralized, multi-state, and methodical. By splitting battery, pack, and vehicle assembly, Toyota spreads risk, uses existing facilities, and leverages its hybrid expertise while competitors chase scale in single mega-plants.

For now, Toyota’s current models like the Crown Signia also play a different game. The Signia is hybrid only, with 240 horsepower, standard all wheel drive, up to 2,700 pounds of towing capacity, and 38 mpg combined efficiency. Its pricing just above 44,000 dollars slots it neatly between mainstream SUVs and Lexus territory. By focusing on hybrids with premium touches, Toyota continues to exploit an efficiency gap while rivals rush into full battery electric territory.

Who is this for, and who should skip it?

If you are an industry professional, this story underlines where Toyota is putting its real money. For consumers, it clarifies what is available now, the Crown sedan and Signia SUV, and what will be available soon, namely, Toyota’s first U.S.-built EVs. Enthusiasts and speculators, however, will want to lean into the second half of this story: the rumors Toyota is not confirming.

And Now for the Speculation: Toyota is not confirming.

This is where things get interesting. Industry chatter often fills the vacuum left by Toyota’s conservative announcements. Some speculation is logical, some fanciful, and all of it has been downplayed by Toyota spokesperson Nathan Kokes, who has emphasized that only announcements made by Toyota should be considered fact. Kokes went on to tell us, “To improve manufacturing efficiencies and better serve customers based on market demand, Toyota is strategically transitioning production across our plants in Kentucky and Indiana”.

Kokes went on to say, “As previously announced, Toyota plans to produce two all-new, three-row battery electric SUVs in the U.S. Toyota will now assemble both vehicles at Toyota Kentucky.” And “Toyota Indiana will continue to assemble the Grand Highlander in its west plant and add assembly of the vehicle to its east plant to accommodate increased production volume”. Finally, Kokes gave some insight into Toyota’s commitment to its workforce by saying, “We remain committed to providing long-term job stability for our team members.”

But the speculation from some persists. One frequent rumor is the name of Toyota’s three-row EV. Outlets often label it the “bZ5X,” following Toyota’s bZ (beyond zero) naming convention. Others expect a Lexus version called the “TZ.” Toyota has never confirmed these names, and official channels continue to describe the projects simply as future three-row battery electric SUVs.

The Crown line is another hotbed of rumor. In Japan, the Crown family includes sedan, crossover, sport, and estate body styles. Some observers expect Toyota to expand the U.S. Crown line beyond the sedan and Signia SUV, potentially with a larger three-row premium vehicle or a sportier fastback. At this time, Toyota has not confirmed such plans, but marketing material in the U.S. clearly positions Crown as a “family” of models, hinting at long-term potential.

Trucks and off-roaders draw even more speculation. At the 2023 Japan Mobility Show, Toyota revealed the EPU concept, a compact electric pickup with a footprint similar to a Ford Maverick. Many expect this to morph into a U.S. product, but Toyota has never confirmed American production. Similarly, Toyota showed the Compact Cruiser EV, a boxy small SUV in the vein of an FJ or Bronco Sport rival. Rumors continue that Toyota could launch a rugged EV or hybrid under the Land Cruiser or FJ nameplates, but again, no confirmation exists. The only rugged revival officially on the books is the Land Cruiser hybrid, which is already in American showrooms.

There are even whispers of a new sub-brand dedicated to electrification. Commentators suggest Toyota could spin off its EVs into a distinct nameplate, following the path of Lexus in the 1980s or Prius in the 2000s. Toyota has never acknowledged this idea, and so far, the closest evidence is the consistent branding of “bZ” on its vehicles.

What is the long-term significance?

The long-term view is two-sided. On the one hand, the confirmed investments are enormous and concrete. North Carolina, Kentucky, and Indiana will become the core of Toyota’s American electrification strategy, and the Crown family already plants Toyota’s premium flag between Toyota and Lexus. On the other hand, the speculation illustrates the appetite for Toyota to do more: a compact truck to take on Ford, a rugged EV to challenge Bronco, or a broader Crown brand to pull buyers away from Acura and Infiniti. For now, those remain rumors, and Toyota has made it clear that only official announcements are the truth.",https://fox4kc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2025/08/Tacoma_Overlanding_Concept_Action_SEMA_2021_Hi-Res_15-600x400-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-29 20:01:49.360418

However, judging by the words of an influential Republican, these incentives may soon disappear.

“I think it’s more likely that we will cancel them than keep them,” House Speaker Mike Johnson stated in an interview with Bloomberg. “But we’ll see how it goes.”

The new administration does not hide its negative stance on these incentives, which were introduced during Barack Obama’s tenure and later modified under Joe Biden. Some countries, including the UK and Germany, have already abandoned subsidies, believing that the electric vehicle market is now strong enough to develop without government support.

Canceling the incentives would align with Trump’s policy of promoting fossil fuels and dismantling the environmental initiatives of previous years. Furthermore, it would help Republicans save funds, although the real impact on the budget would be minimal—only $2 billion was spent on EV subsidies in the first 10 months of last year.

However, for automakers and buyers, the cancellation of incentives could have serious consequences. The production of electric cars is currently more expensive than that of conventional cars, and tax credits help to equalize prices. The loss of these incentives could further slow down the already weaker demand for electric vehicles in 2024, despite the billions invested by auto giants in the development of new models and factories.

These factors could become an argument in favor of preserving the incentives, as some Republicans would not support a decision that threatens job losses in their states.

Natura Resources LLC announced Wednesday it has secured nuclear fuel from the U.S. Department of Energy for its molten salt reactor, dubbed the MSR-1. The reactor will be built at Abilene Christian University and could revolutionize how nuclear power plants operate.

Unlike traditional nuclear plants that use solid fuel rods, the molten salt reactor runs on liquid fuel at low pressure. Company officials say this advanced nuclear technology makes it inherently safer while producing clean electricity, making fresh water from seawater and medical isotopes for cancer treatment.

The project has racked up several firsts: It's the only liquid-fueled reactor approved for construction by federal regulators, and ACU became the first university to get a construction permit for an advanced reactor.

Texas lawmakers threw their support behind the project, allocating $120 million through Texas Tech University. The Energy Department also selected Natura for a pilot program designed to fast-track advanced reactor development.

""This represents a transformative step toward sustainable energy,"" said Doug Robison, Natura's founder and CEO.

The company completed a specialized research facility at ACU in 2023 and finalized the reactor's design this summer. Construction activities are now underway.

His vote when those cases come before the court may be the ultimate Reagan legacy on the Trump EPA.","Barbara Kates-Garnick, Tufts University

When the Trump administration announced it was moving to eliminate dozens of U.S. climate policies, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said he was sending “a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion.”

That drive – to both repeal environmental regulations and cast doubt on science – reflects the Trump administration’s approach to environment policy.

Deregulation has long been a key theme in Republican environmental policy. The conflict between the obligation to protect public health and the desire to boost markets traces back to Ronald Reagan’s presidential administration. Reagan’s perspective that government is not a solution to problems, but is the problem instead, set the stage for Republican administrations that followed.

Reagan argued that the growth of government spending and business regulation had stymied economic prosperity. Environmental regulations were a prime target.

Forty years later, America is seeing many of the same concepts in the Trump administration. However, its strategy could have a greater effect than Reagan ever envisioned.

Slashing budgets and staffing

There are many ways to kneecap government agencies: Instituting massive budget cuts, cutting staff with critical functions and appointing leadership whose goal is limiting the reach and effectiveness of the very agencies they direct are just a few.

In these efforts, Reagan and Trump had similar approaches to the EPA, although with different levels of intensity.

Trump’s EPA budget plan for 2026 includes a draconian 50% cut from the previous year and the lowest budget proposal, when adjusted for inflation, since Reagan. Staff cuts in just the first six months of the second Trump administration put the agency’s total employment at 12,448, down from 16,155 in January.

Reagan dissolved the EPA Office of Enforcement to limit “unnecessary regulation,” which resulted in a 80% decline in actions to enforce environmental regulations. Trump is also stopping enforcement actions, dismantling the EPA’s Science and Research Office and politicizing the agency’s science by putting political appointees in charge, moves that undermine EPA’s independence and expertise.

Both cut EPA’s budget, but that alone does not reduce an agency’s effectiveness.

Politicizing EPA leadership

When the EPA was founded in 1970 during the Nixon administration, it represented a bipartisan consensus: After decades of auto exhaust, polluted waterways and smog-filled air, environmental protection had become a national policy priority.

But industries that EPA regulated argued that the costs of implementing the agency’s mandates were too high. That created tension between economics and science and enforcement.

As part of his “government is not the solution” approach, Reagan issued an executive order shortly after taking office in 1981 requiring federal agencies to submit all proposed rules to the White House Office of Management and Budget before making them public. In Reagan’s eyes, this approach centralized power in the White House and was a way to eliminate burdensome regulations before the agencies announced them to the public.

He also appointed an EPA administrator who shared his anti-government perspective. Anne Gorsuch Burford was a lawyer and state legislator from Colorado, where she routinely voted against toxic waste cleanup and auto pollution controls.

Once in Washington, she appointed several people to the EPA’s leadership team with direct ties to industries the EPA regulated. An example was Rita Lavelle, head of the EPA’s toxic waste programs, who was later convicted of perjury for lying to Congress about when she knew her former employer, a defense contractor, was disposing of toxic waste at a now notorious dump site.

These appointments were an example of regulatory capture by the industries EPA was in charge of overseeing. Anne Gorsuch Burford was held in contempt of Congress for not turning over records related to the Superfund cleanup of the same hazardous waste site, which led to her resignation. The Superfund program to clean up toxic waste dumps was new and one of EPA’s largest programs at the time.

The scandals, broken staff morale, stripped budgets and fights over policy discredited the agency.

Going after government scientists

Anne Gorsuch Burford’s deregulation efforts weren’t fully successful, in part because EPA staff experts rallied to preserve science and regulatory functions. They leaked materials about delays in the Superfund site cleanup to sympathetic congressional staff, who in turn found support from Republican and Democratic senators.

That history may have influenced the Trump administration’s strategy toward the federal bureaucracy’s staff experts, who Trump calls “the Deep State.”

The Department of Government Efficiency, an unofficial group Trump set up in early 2025 headed by Elon Musk, directed the firing of tens of thousands of government scientists and other staff with expertise that government agencies rely on. Thousands more have resigned amid intimidation tactics such as surveillance.

Trump’s head of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, has been clear about targeting bureaucrats. He said in 2023: “We want their funding to be shut down so that the EPA can’t do all of the rules against our energy industry because they have no bandwidth financially to do so. We want to put them in trauma.”

There is a clear focus today on EPA programs that don’t align with the administration’s views. Programs related to environmental justice for low-income communities are in the line of fire. The appointment of people from the chemical, fossil fuel and corporate industries to high-level regulatory and legal positions raises questions about regulatory capture – whether their focus will be more on the health of the industries they oversee than on the health of the public.

An example is decision-making related to who bears the costs of cleaning up pollution from PFAS “forever chemicals” − persistent, harmful chemicals that are now found in drinking water and in people’s bloodstreams. Steven Cook, a Trump appointee, once represented chemical companies that are fighting a rule that would require them to clean up PFAS pollution. He has now proposed scrapping the rule, The New York Times reports. That move could shift what are expected to be billions of dollars in cleanup costs to taxpayers instead. It would be a significant shift away from the 45-year Superfund mantra that “the polluter pays.” Such actions blur the lines between ethics, policymaking and consumer and company interests.

The first Trump administration had a focus on reforming permitting and bureaucracy. While appearing radical at the time, the revamping of scientific boards to include more industry representatives, the undoing of power plant rules and the lessening of enforcement hobbled but did not completely undo the agency.

The second Trump administration, in actively supporting fossil fuel “energy dominance,” is taking steps to not just eliminate regulations but to ensure future administrations can’t bring the regulations back, by using a complex set of legal arguments related to the regulation of greenhouse gases.

At the same time, the administration is trying to discredit scientific research to downplay the risks of a warming planet.

The Reagan administration, while it also pushed for deregulation and expanded permitting of oil, gas and coal leases, embraced some elements of environmental protection. Reagan designated more than 10 million acres as protected wilderness and signed the Coastal Barriers Resources Act, which helped protect 3.5 million acres of shoreline from development. When Reagan signed the Montreal Protocol in 1988 to help protect the ozone layer, he cited scientific data showing the growing risks of ozone-depleting substances.

When Congress doesn’t push back

There is another critical difference between the first and second Trump administrations: The current Republican-controlled Congress is consenting to almost every request the president makes.

Congress has a constitutional responsibility to be a check on the executive branch, and a bipartisan Congress has long taken an active role in oversight and investigation involving environmental issues.

In 2025, however, Congress has approved most of Trump’s demands, including voting to repeal much of the Inflation Reduction Act, a package of pro-environment spending it had just passed two years earlier and that included many projects in Republican districts.

The administration’s effort to eliminate U.S. climate policies will take time and face lawsuits.

In an irony of history, Anne Gorsuch Burford’s son Neil Gorsuch now sits on the Supreme Court. His vote when those cases come before the court may be the ultimate Reagan legacy on the Trump EPA.

We can do that here, and it would be a boon for the whole West Coast, not just Humboldt Bay and not just California.
In July, the administration announced that Interior Secretary Doug Burgum would have to personally approve all wind energy projects moving forward.
California Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire (D-Healdsburg) told the Times-Standard in May of this year that offshore wind represented “a once in a lifetime opportunity for the North Coast’s rural economy.” Friday morning, McGuire took a defiant tone in addressing questions about the future of offshore wind in California.

Duffy announced that the Department of Transportation has withdrawn or terminated $679 million for 12 offshore wind projects currently in various stages of development, essentially scuttling the promise of many in-development offshore wind projects in the U.S. in the near term.

Those funds include $426.7 million for the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind Heavy Lift Terminal (an INFRA grant that would essentially pay for the construction and completion of the project) and $8.6 million for the Redwood Marine Terminal Project planning.

In a news release, the DOT characterized the 12 projects as “doomed.”

“The Trump Administration has refocused the Department of Transportation and its Maritime Administration (MARAD) on rebuilding America’s shipbuilding capacity, unleashing more reliable, traditional forms of energy and utilizing the nation’s bountiful natural resources to unleash American energy,” DOT’s press release said.

Humboldt Bay Harbor, Recreation and Conservation District Commissioner Greg Dale told the Times-Standard that the district would continue to work toward its project goals, hoping to fund the final construction phase of the project at a later date. He said that news of the withdrawal of funds had been disappointing but not altogether unexpected.

“It’s kind of a bummer, but I’m not surprised after all the rhetoric we’ve heard over the last six, eight, 10 months,” Dale said.

Dale said that the shift in policy away from offshore wind, a potential growth industry that could bolster local, state and nationwide manufacturing jobs, seems misguided and that, had the U.S. invested in solar manufacturing at a similar juncture 10 years ago, the nation would be manufacturing solar panels rather than importing them.

“We believe in the project. We believe in the industry, and we want to see the industry thrive, so our goal would be to continue on as best we could,” Dale said. “We’d like to get the project permitted and through all the process, and then when it comes time that we could actually build the project (Dale noted that that phase is likely a decade away “at minimum”), we will cross that bridge when the time comes …

“These are large infrastructure projects. We build lots of large infrastructure projects like offshore oil rigs in America. We can do that here, and it would be a boon for the whole West Coast, not just Humboldt Bay and not just California. It would be a boon for every port on the West Coast, small and large. So I think it’s a good utilization of our resources.”

Rhetoric about wind energy

Concerns about the future of offshore wind have been percolating in the past year, as President Donald Trump continually maligned and misrepresented wind and other green energy technologies, and made efforts to scuttle offshore wind projects.

In May, a coalition of 16 states and Washington, D.C., sued the administration over an executive order halting leasing and permitting for offshore wind projects.

In July, the administration announced that Interior Secretary Doug Burgum would have to personally approve all wind energy projects moving forward.

Just last week, the administration halted construction on the Revolution Wind project, an 80% complete wind energy project off the Rhode Island and Connecticut coast, citing “national security concerns.”

“Wasteful wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy in a news release issued by the DOT. “Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg bent over backwards to use transportation dollars for their Green New Scam agenda while ignoring the dire needs of our shipbuilding industry. Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

Elected officials respond

“If it’s a day ending in Y, it’s another day the Trump administration is assaulting clean energy and infrastructure projects — hurting business and killing jobs in rural areas, and ceding our economic future to China,” Gov. Gavin Newsom told the Times-Standard via email Friday afternoon.

Humboldt County Fourth District Supervisor Natalie Arroyo called the news “incredibly disappointing.” She said that she was unsure what the next steps the Humboldt Bay Harbor District would take with the vast majority of its funding withdrawn.

California Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire (D-Healdsburg) told the Times-Standard in May of this year that offshore wind represented “a once in a lifetime opportunity for the North Coast’s rural economy.” Friday morning, McGuire took a defiant tone in addressing questions about the future of offshore wind in California.

“I’ll be damned if we let Trump’s profit-first, science-last approach take root here at home. California’s green energy and climate programs continue to lead the nation, and offshore wind is a critical component to protecting our progress and communities in the face of the climate crisis,” McGuire said via email. “The Humboldt Bay Harbor District has been working tirelessly with community partners to bring offshore wind to the North Coast and California must continue to support their efforts despite Trump’s moves to bring back offshore oil and expand coal. Wind is the future and we must keep pressing forward.”

Rep. Jared Huffman (D-San Rafael) issued a statement on Friday at noon lambasting the decision to cancel offshore wind projects, but he was not available to directly answer questions Friday.

“This is a new level of idiocracy, where the Trump administration is trying to destroy an entire sector of clean energy, kill thousands of good paying jobs, and drive up electricity prices for American consumers,” Huffman said. “Surrendering the future to China by dragging America back to dirty, climate-wrecking fossil fuel dependency while most of the world is moving on to safer, cleaner, and cheaper clean energy, is reckless, corrupt, and profoundly against our national interests.

“The Humboldt project in my district shows what’s possible when we put people over polluters. For a small, rural community, it means jobs, affordable and clean power for millions, and Tribes getting a seat at the table and share of the benefits. But Trump has decided that keeping Big Oil happy matters more than lowering costs, creating jobs, or securing America’s energy future.”

Earlier in the week, Huffman told the Times-Standard that “for environmental and economic reasons, the state must position itself as the renewable energy leader.”

He expressed optimism about the state reaching its decarbonization goals and efforts to develop infrastructure around green energy on the North Coast, but stopped short of saying he believed the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind project would be able to weather the antagonism of the Trump administration, saying “without offshore wind, the path forward would be different, but not unattainable.”

“The Administration’s posture and actions have made it harder for the companies involved to maintain the investment they need to move forward right now,” Huffman said. “We have to continue to develop the infrastructure to support the project, and my goal is to position Humboldt as a ‘shovel ready’ port when the winds are more favorable (yes, pun intended).

“Even ignoring the need to decarbonize in order to prevent the worst impacts of climate change, renewable energy is now cheaper and with fewer health impacts than fossil fuel infrastructure. For instance, electricity production from solar energy is now 41% cheaper than the deployment of fossil fuels (according to the UN). As offshore wind technology matures, its price-point will also rapidly decrease.”

Assemblymember Chris Rogers (D-Santa Rosa), a proponent of offshore wind, said in February that the technology has “the potential to transform the economy of the North Coast.” Rogers was traveling Friday and could not be reached in time to comment.

It costs an average of $4,058 annually to insure an electric vehicle, compared with $2,732 for a traditional vehicle, according to the data.
Transitioning more completely to electric vehicles is vital in the fight against human-caused climate change, experts say.
Specialized carriers, including Aspire, Bristol West and National General, which offer policies to high-risk drivers, typically don’t cover electric vehicles.
“Electric vehicles are more technical and finicky,” she said.","As the price of buying an electric vehicle is set to soar with tariffs and the end of government incentives, drivers who want to go green have another hidden cost to consider before making the switch.

The insurance premiums on electric vehicles are, on average, a whopping 49% higher than those for gas-powered cars, according to new data from the digital insurance platform Insurify.

It costs an average of $4,058 annually to insure an electric vehicle, compared with $2,732 for a traditional vehicle, according to the data. Electric cars cost more to replace, are more expensive to repair, and are more likely to have issues that lead to insurance claims, the report said.

The steep insurance prices for EVs come as the U.S. electric-vehicle industry is being battered by auto tariffs, federal legislation and the expiration of a tax incentive attached to new and used electric vehicles.

“Insurance costs, because they are ongoing, do matter in the long-term calculation of whether it costs more or less for any given person to drive an EV versus a gas-powered car,” said Julia Taliesin, who authored the report.

Battery-powered cars cost more to insure because they have higher sticker prices, are more easily damaged and require specific parts for repairs, Taliesin said. A fender bender that would be a simple fix on a traditional vehicle could require an expensive and lengthy repair on an EV to mend the battery and recalibrate the car and its sensors.

“The cost of what’s making up the car, and the cost of the labor to make those repairs, all go into why EVs are more expensive to insure,” she said.

Insurance prices are even higher in states where there are fewer EVs and fewer mechanics who can work on them, the report said. In Arkansas and Idaho, where there is low EV adoption rates, the cost of full coverage for an electric vehicle can be almost twice that of a traditional car.

In California, it costs 15% to 31% more to insure an electric vehicle than it would to insure a traditional car, according to Insurify. Widespread EV adoption in the state drives prices down and gives insurers more data, allowing them to offer lower premiums, Taliesin said.

“California has been very intentional about infrastructure and incentivizing EV ownership,” Taliesin said. “It leads the nation in EV adoption, and that has a bit of a waterfall effect on a few other things that relate to insurance costs.”

As federal EV incentives dwindle under the Trump administration, state-level programs become increasingly important tools in encouraging EV adoption, experts said. The California Air Resources Board mandates that all new cars sold in the state by 2035 be zero-emission, an ambitious goal that faces challenges in Washington.

Transitioning more completely to electric vehicles is vital in the fight against human-caused climate change, experts say. However, recent polling data from Gallup show that fewer Americans are open to buying an EV than they were two years ago. As of April, 51% of those surveyed said they already owned or were considering buying an EV, down from 59% in 2023.

It’s easier to insure an EV now than it was a decade ago, said Mallory Mooney, director of sales and service at Insurify.

“When we first started seeing EVs, we had a hard time placing Teslas for coverage and other specific models that we’ve seen are troublesome for repair,” she said.

The Tesla Model X and Model 3 top Insurify’s list of most expensive EVs to insure.

The Model X has an average annual cost of $4,765 for full coverage, a sharp 36% jump since last year. The data also show that the Model 3 has a claims frequency rate that is significantly higher than the industry average, indicating it may require more frequent repairs.

Most standard insurance carriers offer policies for EVs, but there are exceptions, even in California, Mooney said. Specialized carriers, including Aspire, Bristol West and National General, which offer policies to high-risk drivers, typically don’t cover electric vehicles.

Though EVs tend to cost more to repair, they usually cost less to maintain under normal conditions, said Taliesin. Savings on maintenance and gas could help offset ongoing insurance fees and high up-front price tags on EVs.

“Electric vehicles are more technical and finicky,” she said. “The more there are on the road, the more affordable they should become.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2023/08/06/2MVTYBRXY7GOJ5XBSC5FIQWP4E.jpg?w=1024&h=670,N,,2025-08-29 19:07:09.864425

The State Land Office said in a news release Thursday it expects the proposed rule to modernize and improve the agency’s process for issuing geothermal leases in response to an increase in demand.

New Mexico in 2013 amended the Geothermal Resources Act to limit what counts as a “geothermal resource” to be a renewable source of natural heat from the Earth that is above 250 degrees Fahrenheit. The law also required lease holders to pay both the base rent and royalties for any power generated and minerals or chemicals derived from a project.

The State Land Office said in an Aug. 22 explainer that the proposed rule is meant to align with the 2013 legislation.

Under the proposed rule, the State Land Office would be allowed to issue a geothermal lease for a period of up to five years for the purpose of exploration, in anticipation of a potential long-term lease that would last as long as the resource is producing or capable of producing heat “in commercial quantities.”

New Mexico Commissioner of Public Lands Stephanie Garcia Richard said Thursday the public comment process will guide her office’s decisions about how to offer leases of state land “to tap this growing renewable energy potential.”

“New Mexico’s geothermal industry is poised for significant growth in the coming years — with the perfect combination of prime geology, technical expertise and a supportive regulatory environment,” Garcia Richard said in a statement. “We need to be ready to meet the growing demand for clean, sustainable energy.”

For example, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in June announced a new private investment in a geothermal plant or plants that will provide social media giant Meta’s New Mexico data centers with 150 megawatts of energy.

The project is expected to start generating power by 2030, XGS Energy Vice President and Head of Development Logan Stephens told the interim legislative Economic and Rural Development and Policy Committee on Aug. 11.

“It represents only a fraction of the broader opportunity here in the state, driven by that abundance of hot-rock geothermal resources, as well as an abundance of suitable land, both private, federal, state and tribal,” Stephens told the committee. “We believe the market opportunity for XGS in New Mexico over the next five years could be several thousands of megawatts. We’re really limited only by our ability to deliver that power to the grid and to the customers, and our ability to secure permits.”

The State Land Office’s public rulemaking hearing begins at 10 a.m. on Sept. 30 in Morgan Hall at the agency’s building at 310 Old Santa Fe Trail in Santa Fe.

The proposed cuts would target the city’s fleet electrification program and energy audits, among other programs. The City Manager’s proposed budget increases spending on the city’s electric vehicle fleet transition from $2.7 to $6.1 million dollars. It also proposes a year by year goal for the city to transition a portion of the municipally owned vehicle fleet to electric: 10% by the end of FY26 and 15% electric by the end of FY27.

Sisemore, who served as mayor from 2005 to 2011 and as a city commissioner, will act as Fermi’s local representative.
Fermi co-founder and CEO Toby Neugebauer said Sisemore was chosen because of his deep ties to the region.
“For me, this project is about making sure Amarillo’s skilled workforce benefits from the opportunities it will bring,” Sisemore said.
“Doosan is the largest, most respected nuclear power plant component supplier in the world,” he said.","Fermi America, which is developing what it calls the world’s largest private grid to power artificial intelligence, has named former Amarillo Mayor Trent Sisemore as its community lead while advancing a major international nuclear partnership with Doosan Enerbility.

The Texas Tech University System partner announced the move this week as part of its effort to connect with the Amarillo community, where it plans to build an $11 billion private grid and artificial intelligence campus on 5,200 acres of university land near the city. Preliminary economic impact studies project the development could create about 2,500 direct jobs and 6,000 indirect jobs, generating an estimated $1.2 billion annually during construction.

Sisemore, who served as mayor from 2005 to 2011 and as a city commissioner, will act as Fermi’s local representative. His role includes hosting town halls, collaborating with civic groups and businesses, and leading a new Community Advisory Board that the company says will address infrastructure, housing and environmental concerns.

Fermi co-founder and CEO Toby Neugebauer said Sisemore was chosen because of his deep ties to the region.

“Growing up in the Panhandle forged shared values that Trent exemplifies,” Neugebauer said. “We believe his leadership will help ensure Amarillo’s voice is heard as we build this project.”

Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, another Fermi co-founder, described Sisemore’s appointment as a signal of the project’s credibility.

“Trent’s track record shows he gets things done while keeping community first,” Perry said.

A familiar local figure

Sisemore is a well-known figure in Amarillo politics and business. During his tenure in city government, he supported initiatives that brought Bell Helicopter’s manufacturing plant to Amarillo, helped develop the Amarillo Civic Center’s performing arts space, and backed the purchase of water rights that city leaders say will sustain the city for more than 200 years.

Beyond politics, Sisemore served 17 years on the board of Happy State Bank and worked with local charities, including the High Plains Food Bank. A businessman and entrepreneur, he co-owned Jack Sisemore Traveland with his father before selling it in 2017, and he was a founding partner of Keystone RV, which grew into the world’s largest travel trailer manufacturer at the time of its sale in 2001.

“For me, this project is about making sure Amarillo’s skilled workforce benefits from the opportunities it will bring,” Sisemore said.

Global partnership

The announcement came days after Fermi signed a memorandum of understanding with Doosan Enerbility, a South Korean company that supplies components for more than 40% of the world’s nuclear power plants, according to industry reports.

Neugebauer said Doosan’s track record gives him confidence the project can remain on schedule. “Doosan is the largest, most respected nuclear power plant component supplier in the world,” he said. “They know how to deliver on time and on budget.”

Mesut Uzman, Fermi’s chief nuclear commercial officer, also pointed to Doosan’s history of delivering projects in Asia and the Middle East. “Having worked with them before, I’ve seen their precision and commitment to safety firsthand,” Uzman said.

Doosan President Jongdoo Kim characterized the partnership as one built on “mutual respect and a shared commitment to innovation.”

Long-term plans

Fermi’s Amarillo campus aims to deliver 11 gigawatts of power — enough to supply about 3 million homes — and 15 million square feet of AI computing capacity. The project will combine natural gas, nuclear, solar and battery storage to meet the demand for data centers, which the U.S. Department of Energy estimates consume 10 times more energy than traditional facilities.

The first gigawatt of natural gas generation is expected online by the end of 2026, with one additional gigawatt added annually for a decade. Nuclear construction is slated to begin in 2027, with the first small modular reactor projected to be operational by 2032.

Fermi has pledged to invest $50 million in local water conservation and renewable energy integration to reduce environmental impacts. Sisemore’s Community Advisory Board is expected to hold its first public meeting in early 2026 to discuss housing expansion, road upgrades and water use with city officials.

“Amarillo has the talent and grit to make this project a success,” Sisemore said. “We’ll work together to ensure this campus benefits our community for generations.”","https://www.amarillo.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/29/NAGN/85893680007-img-9067.jpeg?crop=1498,843,x0,y100&width=1498&height=843&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-29 18:04:12.883124

Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) combine electric and gasoline (or diesel) powertrains removing range anxiety concerns and reducing the need for extensive mining required for larger battery packs.
When electric vehicles first arrived on the market, they were promoted as having no ecological downsides.
According to the University of Michigan’s coverage of the relevant studies that's tied to the Vehicle Lifecycle Emissions Calculator, that may not necessarily be true.","The University of Michigan is offering a tool that’s supposed to calculate the total lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for new vehicles based upon a person’s location and driving patterns. The equation is supposed to take into account everything from the very moment components start being assembled to the day the model is hauled to the junkyard to be destroyed. According to the researchers involved, all-electric vehicles are significantly cleaner than their gasoline-dependent rivals.

Published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, and supported by the State of Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity and the U-M Electric Vehicle Center, the study that yielded the Vehicle Lifecycle Emissions Calculator attempted to map U.S. emissions. The takeaway was that the “electrification of powertrains is a powerful tool for decarbonization.”

While the default tool makes a lot of broad assumptions about driving habits, users can tweak things to create a more accurate representation. According to the university, the authors are calling it the most comprehensive analysis to date — “providing drivers with estimates of emissions per mile driven across 35 different combinations of vehicle class and powertrains.”

In terms of body styles, sedans typically produced the least amount of emissions per mile. As you might expect, the numbers come up the bigger and boxier a vehicle gets. Battery electric vehicles were the exception, with the study claiming that EVs had the lowest emissions at just 81 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per mile. That’s 20 percent less than the per-mile emissions of the average gasoline-powered truck.

Since nothing comes out of an EV’s nonexistent tailpipe, the study had to take into account where the electricity was being sourced from. The Vehicle Lifecycle Emissions Calculator that coincides with the research takes that into account and lets you set those parameters for yourself when making those comparisons.

However, the research team alleges that it doesn’t really matter. Their final takeaway was that the more electrified a vehicle becomes the less emissions are produced, even with weight and differences in regional power grids being a factor. But their study did not entirely ignore some of the downsides of electrification, even if it was signal minded about the overarching solution.

From the study Greenhouse Gas Reductions Driven by Vehicle Electrification across Powertrains, Classes, Locations, and Use Patterns:

Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have substantial environmental benefits over both internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) and hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) alternatives, but have disadvantages such as limited range, inadequate charging infrastructure, longer refueling times, and performance issues in extreme environments. BEVs have a larger production burden than other powertrains due to the need for critical minerals and substantial energy for manufacturing long-range batteries. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) combine electric and gasoline (or diesel) powertrains removing range anxiety concerns and reducing the need for extensive mining required for larger battery packs. PHEVs offer many of the benefits of BEVs with the added flexibility of being able to use conventional fuel. To inform consumers, the automotive industry, and national decarbonization strategies, it is important to have a detailed understanding of the lifecycle emissions associated with different vehicle classes, powertrains, and use patterns across the U.S.

“Vehicle electrification is a key strategy for climate action. Transportation accounts for 28 [percent] of greenhouse gas emissions and we need to reduce those to limit future climate impacts such as flooding, wildfires and drought events, which are increasing in intensity and frequency,” said Greg Keoleian, senior author of the new study and a professor at the U-M School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS).

“Our purpose here was to evaluate the cradle-to-grave greenhouse gas reduction from the electrification of vehicles compared with a baseline of gasoline-powered vehicles.”

We’re fairly certain that transportation only accounts for about 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. And even that is split between passenger vehicles, commercial trucks, airplanes, railway lines, and other sources. But the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has cited significantly higher numbers (up to 30 percent) domestically during periods where it was controlled by more climate-focused administrations (e.g. 2020-2024). With that in mind, it might be worth considering the ongoing politicization of the overall premise.

In the past, the University of Michigan has been known for tracking the true average fuel economy of the United States based upon driving habits and the kind of vehicles Americans actually purchased. That study revealed that practical fuel economy only improved by about 10 percent between 1991 and 2015 and was basically stagnant in the later years. This was despite a swath of new government regulations being launched within that timeframe specifically designed to reduce emissions by boosting MPGs. It was an extremely useful dataset and helped showcase how there's often a major break between policy and results.

For whatever reason, the college has since abandoned that study. But it continued to release papers advocating for people to drive differently or embrace new lifestyles that could make up the difference. We’ve likewise seen researchers backed by the university assert that people should simply make different automotive purchasing decisions. Suffice it to say, the college is fairly keen on green initiatives and has provided a mix of highly salient information and what some would consider academic propaganda.

Some of that historically stems from the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI), which has a self-stated mission to conduct research that results in improved roadway safety. However, it’s likewise funded by federal and state government agencies, motor vehicle manufacturers and suppliers. That leaves concerns that its studies, which often go back to those same entities to support their decisions, could be influenced by funding.

But the Vehicle Lifecycle Emissions Calculator didn’t come via the UMTRI, it came by way of the University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS). Previously known as the School of Natural Resources and Environment prior to 2005, and originally created as the School of Forestry, the SEAS is laser focused on environmental issues and promoting things like “climate justice.”

That’s not necessarily a bad thing. However, it still suggests a fairly heavy bias from the relevant source after the public has already endured years of preachy environmentalism. When electric vehicles first arrived on the market, they were promoted as having no ecological downsides. But we eventually learned that wasn’t the case. Battery production not only polluted the environment but often yielded hazardous mining operations that employed children in third-world countries. Modern arguments have EVs as being significantly tougher on the planet and its inhabitants during the manufacturing process, with the ability to make up for it over time by not being as reliant on petroleum products over the lifespan. But this typically presumed a meaningful portion of the electricity was being sourced from renewables.

According to the University of Michigan’s coverage of the relevant studies that's tied to the Vehicle Lifecycle Emissions Calculator, that may not necessarily be true. It’s making the claim that choosing the more electrified vehicle will almost always reduce a driver’s greenhouse gas emissions, regardless of where they happen to live within the contiguous United States. However, the study’s authors were a little more nuanced when commenting on the matter.

“The thing is really matching your vehicle with your needs,” stated Keoleian. “Obviously, if you’re in the trades, you may need a pickup truck. But you can get a battery electric pickup truck. If you’re just commuting to work by yourself, I’d recommend a sedan BEV instead.”

However, he likewise suggested that simply pivoting to the smallest gasoline car that would suit a household’s needs would also help move the environmental needle. That certainly feels correct and will undoubtedly save you money in the process. But automakers have pivoted away from lightweight affordable cars in recent years in the hopes of seeing juicier profit margins and better safety scores, making finding those small cars difficult.

All told, it seems like the research has resulted in a potentially useful tool and it's genuinely impressive that anyone was able to compile this much data to begin with. But it has also resulted in some of the same blanket statements about emissions that we’ve been hearing for decades when the whole point of the Vehicle Lifecycle Emissions Calculator was to make specific comparisons between regions and vehicle models.

Your author is personally skeptical about any tool being able to take every single factor into account, however. I've been following the industry for a long time and trying to estimate the average emissions of foreign suppliers and shipping companies required to being a single component to a factory before final assembly takes place is borderline impossible. Attempting to do that for every component that goes into every new model currently in production would be a staggering undertaking loaded with false datasets provided by companies desperate to make themselves look as environmentally friendly as possible. At a minimum, even a generalized summation of greenhouse gasses that proved to be truly accurate on a single model would be a tall order and that's before we've attempted to estimate emissions over the remainder of its lifespan.

It’s also unclear whether or not this tool will impact the market in any meaningful way. EVs aren’t really being held back because the public views them as insufficiently green. It’s because they went to market before the technology could offer an ownership experience matching what drivers were already accustomed to at a price they could afford. They’re simply too specialized to work for all households.",https://cdn-fastly.thetruthaboutcars.com/media/2025/08/28/15481/social-45130666.jpg?size=1200x628,N,,2025-08-29 20:02:13.338383

In Indiana, Toyota has committed another $1.4 billion to prepare its Princeton plant for a separate three-row electric SUV.
One frequent rumor is the name of Toyota’s three-row EV.","(TestMiles) – Toyota is investing billions in U.S. manufacturing and EVs, but rumors continue to swirl about even bolder future products. Separating fact from speculation matters for both buyers and industry insiders.

Why does this matter right now?

Toyota is not dabbling in electrification; it is betting billions. Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina is scheduled to open soon with fourteen lines for hybrid and battery output. The site covers more than 1,800 acres, carries a price tag of nearly 13.9 billion dollars, and is expected to employ about 5,100 people. The factory will feed batteries to U.S.-built hybrids and EVs for both Toyota and Lexus, forming the backbone of Toyota’s electrification strategy in America.

Two new three-row EVs are confirmed. The Kentucky plant in Georgetown will assemble Toyota’s first U.S.-built battery electric vehicle starting soon. A 1.3 billion dollar investment adds battery pack assembly to the facility, tying production directly to the North Carolina supply chain. In Indiana, Toyota has committed another $1.4 billion to prepare its Princeton plant for a separate three-row electric SUV. Together, these programs signal that Toyota is not just selling EVs in the U.S. But it is building them here.

How does it compare to rivals?

Rivals have already planted their flags. Tesla operates a vertically integrated model from Nevada to Texas. Hyundai’s metaplant in Georgia is scaling up for EVs across several of its brands. Toyota’s plan is different: decentralized, multi-state, and methodical. By splitting battery, pack, and vehicle assembly, Toyota spreads risk, uses existing facilities, and leverages its hybrid expertise while competitors chase scale in single mega-plants.

For now, Toyota’s current models like the Crown Signia also play a different game. The Signia is hybrid only, with 240 horsepower, standard all wheel drive, up to 2,700 pounds of towing capacity, and 38 mpg combined efficiency. Its pricing just above 44,000 dollars slots it neatly between mainstream SUVs and Lexus territory. By focusing on hybrids with premium touches, Toyota continues to exploit an efficiency gap while rivals rush into full battery electric territory.

Who is this for, and who should skip it?

If you are an industry professional, this story underlines where Toyota is putting its real money. For consumers, it clarifies what is available now, the Crown sedan and Signia SUV, and what will be available soon, namely, Toyota’s first U.S.-built EVs. Enthusiasts and speculators, however, will want to lean into the second half of this story: the rumors Toyota is not confirming.

And Now for the Speculation: Toyota is not confirming.

This is where things get interesting. Industry chatter often fills the vacuum left by Toyota’s conservative announcements. Some speculation is logical, some fanciful, and all of it has been downplayed by Toyota spokesperson Nathan Kokes, who has emphasized that only announcements made by Toyota should be considered fact. Kokes went on to tell us, “To improve manufacturing efficiencies and better serve customers based on market demand, Toyota is strategically transitioning production across our plants in Kentucky and Indiana”.

Kokes went on to say, “As previously announced, Toyota plans to produce two all-new, three-row battery electric SUVs in the U.S. Toyota will now assemble both vehicles at Toyota Kentucky.” And “Toyota Indiana will continue to assemble the Grand Highlander in its west plant and add assembly of the vehicle to its east plant to accommodate increased production volume”. Finally, Kokes gave some insight into Toyota’s commitment to its workforce by saying, “We remain committed to providing long-term job stability for our team members.”

But the speculation from some persists. One frequent rumor is the name of Toyota’s three-row EV. Outlets often label it the “bZ5X,” following Toyota’s bZ (beyond zero) naming convention. Others expect a Lexus version called the “TZ.” Toyota has never confirmed these names, and official channels continue to describe the projects simply as future three-row battery electric SUVs.

The Crown line is another hotbed of rumor. In Japan, the Crown family includes sedan, crossover, sport, and estate body styles. Some observers expect Toyota to expand the U.S. Crown line beyond the sedan and Signia SUV, potentially with a larger three-row premium vehicle or a sportier fastback. At this time, Toyota has not confirmed such plans, but marketing material in the U.S. clearly positions Crown as a “family” of models, hinting at long-term potential.

Trucks and off-roaders draw even more speculation. At the 2023 Japan Mobility Show, Toyota revealed the EPU concept, a compact electric pickup with a footprint similar to a Ford Maverick. Many expect this to morph into a U.S. product, but Toyota has never confirmed American production. Similarly, Toyota showed the Compact Cruiser EV, a boxy small SUV in the vein of an FJ or Bronco Sport rival. Rumors continue that Toyota could launch a rugged EV or hybrid under the Land Cruiser or FJ nameplates, but again, no confirmation exists. The only rugged revival officially on the books is the Land Cruiser hybrid, which is already in American showrooms.

There are even whispers of a new sub-brand dedicated to electrification. Commentators suggest Toyota could spin off its EVs into a distinct nameplate, following the path of Lexus in the 1980s or Prius in the 2000s. Toyota has never acknowledged this idea, and so far, the closest evidence is the consistent branding of “bZ” on its vehicles.

What is the long-term significance?

The long-term view is two-sided. On the one hand, the confirmed investments are enormous and concrete. North Carolina, Kentucky, and Indiana will become the core of Toyota’s American electrification strategy, and the Crown family already plants Toyota’s premium flag between Toyota and Lexus. On the other hand, the speculation illustrates the appetite for Toyota to do more: a compact truck to take on Ford, a rugged EV to challenge Bronco, or a broader Crown brand to pull buyers away from Acura and Infiniti. For now, those remain rumors, and Toyota has made it clear that only official announcements are the truth.",https://www.nbc4i.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/08/Tacoma_Overlanding_Concept_Action_SEMA_2021_Hi-Res_15-600x400-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-29 22:02:41.953134

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

The Trump administration has stepped up its crusade against wind and other renewable energy sources in recent weeks, cutting federal funding and canceling projects approved by the Biden administration in a sustained attack on clean energy sources that scientists say are crucial to the fight against climate change.

President Donald Trump has vowed to restore U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market and has pushed to increase U.S. reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Duffy’s action “outrageous” and deeply disappointing.

Trump and his Cabinet “have a stubborn and mystifying hatred of clean energy,” Huffman said in an interview. “It’s so dogmatic. They are willing to eliminate thousands of jobs and an entire sector that can bring cheap, reliable power to American consumers.”

The canceled funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, the Transportation Department said.

Separately, Trump’s Energy Department said Friday it is withdrawing a $716 million loan guarantee approved by the Biden administration to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate a now-threatened offshore wind project in New Jersey.

The moves come as the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department said the government needs to review the $4 billion Revolution Wind project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are.

Democratic governors, lawmakers and union workers in New England have called for Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse course.

Trump has long expressed disdain for wind power, frequently calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don’t use.

Earlier this month, the Interior Department canceled a major wind farm in Idaho, a project approved late in former President Joe Biden’s term that had drawn criticism for its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.

Last week, with U.S. electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump lashed out, falsely blaming renewable power for skyrocketing energy costs. He called wind and solar energy “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve any wind or solar projects.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand from artificial intelligence and energy-hungry data centers, along with aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

Revolution Wind’s developer, Danish energy company Orsted, said it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction on the New England project and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. In addition to hampering the states' climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.

Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Some critics say the steps to cancel projects put Americans' livelihoods at risk.

“It’s an attack on our jobs,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said of the move to stop construction of Revolution Wind. “It’s an attack on our energy. It’s an attack on our families and their ability to pay the bills.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said his union is “going to fight (Trump) every step of the way, no matter how long it takes.”

Under Biden, the U.S. held the first-ever auction of leases for floating wind farms in December 2022. Deep waters off the West Coast are better suited for floating projects than those that are anchored in the seabed, officials said.

Proc. 2025-28 advising taxpayers how to handle making various elections, filing amended returns, and changing accounting methods for research or experimental expenditures, as provided under Section 70302 of H.R. 1, P.L. 119-21, commonly known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The revenue procedure also modifies Rev. Proc. 2025-23, List of Automatic Changes, and allows more time for partnerships, S corporations, C corporations, individuals, estates and trusts, and exempt organizations to file superseding 2024 federal income tax returns.

Under the revenue procedure:

A small business taxpayer may, in general, elect to treat Section 70302(e)(1) of H.R. 1 as providing that amendments made by Section 70302 apply to amounts paid or incurred in tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2021, rather than Dec. 31, 2024.

An eligible small business taxpayer may, in general, make a late election under Sec. 280C(c)(2) for any prior applicable tax year to have the provisions of Sec. 280C(c)(1) not apply and instead elect to adjust the amount of the research credit under Sec. 41 as required under Sec. 280C(c)(2)(B) for such applicable tax year (late Sec. 280C(c)(2) election).

An eligible small business taxpayer may, in general, revoke a prior election under Sec. 280C(c)(2) for any applicable tax year.

In addition, for domestic research or experimental expenditures paid or incurred in a tax year beginning after Dec. 31, 2024, a trade or business of a taxpayer (applicant) may elect to capitalize and amortize all such expenditures paid or incurred in the tax year under Sec. 174A(c) with one exception. The applicant cannot have changed its method of accounting with respect to domestic research or experimental expenditures under Section 7.02(3) of Rev. Proc. 2025-23, as modified by this revenue procedure, for such tax year.

The final section of Rev. Proc. 2025-28 says the IRS will treat the timely filing of Form 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income, including the furnishing of any applicable Schedules K-1, by a partnership; Form 1120-S, U.S. Income Tax Return for an S Corporation, including the furnishing of any applicable Schedules K-1, by an S corporation; Form 1120, U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return, (or another form in the Form 1120 series) by a C corporation; Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, by an individual; Form 1041, U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts, including the furnishing of any applicable Schedules K-1, by a trust or estate; or Form 990-T, Exempt Organization Business Income Tax Return, by an exempt organization described in the revenue procedure as a timely and appropriately filed request for a six-month extension of the due date to file the forms.

An eligible partnership, S corporation, C corporation, individual, trust, estate, or exempt organization that timely filed a tax return (without regard to the extension provided by this revenue procedure) may file a superseding tax return, as well as furnish Schedules K-1, as applicable, before the expiration of the extended due date.

One frequent rumor is the name of Toyota’s three-row EV.","(TestMiles) – Toyota is investing billions in U.S. manufacturing and EVs, but rumors continue to swirl about even bolder future products. Separating fact from speculation matters for both buyers and industry insiders.

Why does this matter right now?

Toyota is not dabbling in electrification; it is betting billions. Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina is scheduled to open soon with fourteen lines for hybrid and battery output. The site covers more than 1,800 acres, carries a price tag of nearly 13.9 billion dollars, and is expected to employ about 5,100 people. The factory will feed batteries to U.S.-built hybrids and EVs for both Toyota and Lexus, forming the backbone of Toyota’s electrification strategy in America.

Two new three-row EVs are confirmed. The Kentucky plant in Georgetown will assemble Toyota’s first U.S.-built battery electric vehicle starting soon. A 1.3 billion dollar investment adds battery pack assembly to the facility, tying production directly to the North Carolina supply chain. In Indiana, Toyota has committed another $1.4 billion to prepare its Princeton plant for a separate three-row electric SUV. Together, these programs signal that Toyota is not just selling EVs in the U.S. But it is building them here.

How does it compare to rivals?

Rivals have already planted their flags. Tesla operates a vertically integrated model from Nevada to Texas. Hyundai’s metaplant in Georgia is scaling up for EVs across several of its brands. Toyota’s plan is different: decentralized, multi-state, and methodical. By splitting battery, pack, and vehicle assembly, Toyota spreads risk, uses existing facilities, and leverages its hybrid expertise while competitors chase scale in single mega-plants.

For now, Toyota’s current models like the Crown Signia also play a different game. The Signia is hybrid only, with 240 horsepower, standard all wheel drive, up to 2,700 pounds of towing capacity, and 38 mpg combined efficiency. Its pricing just above 44,000 dollars slots it neatly between mainstream SUVs and Lexus territory. By focusing on hybrids with premium touches, Toyota continues to exploit an efficiency gap while rivals rush into full battery electric territory.

Who is this for, and who should skip it?

If you are an industry professional, this story underlines where Toyota is putting its real money. For consumers, it clarifies what is available now, the Crown sedan and Signia SUV, and what will be available soon, namely, Toyota’s first U.S.-built EVs. Enthusiasts and speculators, however, will want to lean into the second half of this story: the rumors Toyota is not confirming.

And Now for the Speculation: Toyota is not confirming.

This is where things get interesting. Industry chatter often fills the vacuum left by Toyota’s conservative announcements. Some speculation is logical, some fanciful, and all of it has been downplayed by Toyota spokesperson Nathan Kokes, who has emphasized that only announcements made by Toyota should be considered fact. Kokes went on to tell us, “To improve manufacturing efficiencies and better serve customers based on market demand, Toyota is strategically transitioning production across our plants in Kentucky and Indiana”.

Kokes went on to say, “As previously announced, Toyota plans to produce two all-new, three-row battery electric SUVs in the U.S. Toyota will now assemble both vehicles at Toyota Kentucky.” And “Toyota Indiana will continue to assemble the Grand Highlander in its west plant and add assembly of the vehicle to its east plant to accommodate increased production volume”. Finally, Kokes gave some insight into Toyota’s commitment to its workforce by saying, “We remain committed to providing long-term job stability for our team members.”

But the speculation from some persists. One frequent rumor is the name of Toyota’s three-row EV. Outlets often label it the “bZ5X,” following Toyota’s bZ (beyond zero) naming convention. Others expect a Lexus version called the “TZ.” Toyota has never confirmed these names, and official channels continue to describe the projects simply as future three-row battery electric SUVs.

The Crown line is another hotbed of rumor. In Japan, the Crown family includes sedan, crossover, sport, and estate body styles. Some observers expect Toyota to expand the U.S. Crown line beyond the sedan and Signia SUV, potentially with a larger three-row premium vehicle or a sportier fastback. At this time, Toyota has not confirmed such plans, but marketing material in the U.S. clearly positions Crown as a “family” of models, hinting at long-term potential.

Trucks and off-roaders draw even more speculation. At the 2023 Japan Mobility Show, Toyota revealed the EPU concept, a compact electric pickup with a footprint similar to a Ford Maverick. Many expect this to morph into a U.S. product, but Toyota has never confirmed American production. Similarly, Toyota showed the Compact Cruiser EV, a boxy small SUV in the vein of an FJ or Bronco Sport rival. Rumors continue that Toyota could launch a rugged EV or hybrid under the Land Cruiser or FJ nameplates, but again, no confirmation exists. The only rugged revival officially on the books is the Land Cruiser hybrid, which is already in American showrooms.

There are even whispers of a new sub-brand dedicated to electrification. Commentators suggest Toyota could spin off its EVs into a distinct nameplate, following the path of Lexus in the 1980s or Prius in the 2000s. Toyota has never acknowledged this idea, and so far, the closest evidence is the consistent branding of “bZ” on its vehicles.

What is the long-term significance?

The long-term view is two-sided. On the one hand, the confirmed investments are enormous and concrete. North Carolina, Kentucky, and Indiana will become the core of Toyota’s American electrification strategy, and the Crown family already plants Toyota’s premium flag between Toyota and Lexus. On the other hand, the speculation illustrates the appetite for Toyota to do more: a compact truck to take on Ford, a rugged EV to challenge Bronco, or a broader Crown brand to pull buyers away from Acura and Infiniti. For now, those remain rumors, and Toyota has made it clear that only official announcements are the truth.",https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/08/Tacoma_Overlanding_Concept_Action_SEMA_2021_Hi-Res_15-600x400-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-29 18:05:50.159930

More than half the country gets its power from electric cooperatives like Tipmont.","A rural utility in the Lafayette area aims to slowly reduce the amount of energy it gets from its power supplier.

More rural electric cooperatives around the country are looking to cut ties with their suppliers in favor of cheaper electric bills for customers and the flexibility to do what they want. That includes individual co-ops in Colorado, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Carolina.

Tipmont Rural Electric Membership Cooperative (REMC) plans to slowly phase out the amount of power it gets from Wabash Valley Power Alliance.

One of the benefits of these rural cooperatives is that customers get more of a say in what their utility does — including where it gets its power. But many of them are also part of larger generation and transmission cooperatives — which help REMCs get power and other resources. Contracts with these companies can be long and difficult to get out of.

It took Tipmont seven years to end its contract with WVPA — an agreement had to be approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Tipmont Communications Director Rob Ford explains why the utility decided to leave.

""Number one, the rates that were being offered oftentimes weren't competitive with the open wholesale power market. And number two, that all requirements contract had us paying for a lot of things that we didn't necessarily need,"" he said.

Ford said buying more power from the wholesale energy market will help the utility access cheaper and potentially cleaner power for customers. The utility hired NextEra Energy to help them navigate the open market — something Ford said will be a learning curve for Tipmont.

Tipmont also hopes to use excess power from rooftop solar and electric school buses to make the utility more reliable.

“We would be able to draw the energy off those school buses around 5, 6 o'clock, use that to lower our peak demand and then the school buses would charge back overnight and be ready to go at 6, 7 a.m. in the morning,” Ford said.

Wabash Valley Power Alliance serves 21 electric cooperatives across Indiana and Illinois. Vicki Duncan Gardner is vice president of marketing, communications and advocacy at WVPA.

She said generation and transmission cooperatives like WVPA have expertise that can help REMCs navigate the complex electric power system.

Duncan Gardner said Tipmont and its customers will no longer be able to benefit from things like the company’s financial investments, energy efficiency programs, and assistance navigating federal and state laws.

“You know this was a decision made by all parties and we certainly wish them the best,"" she said.

Duncan Garder said WVPA has kept electric rates relatively low — especially compared to double-digit increases this year at Indiana’s investor-owned utilities.

The Revolution Wind project, a 65-turbine clean energy initiative that would provide roughly 700 megawatts of energy to homes in Connecticut and Rhode Island, was expected to reduce energy costs in the region. The project is roughly 80% complete, with more than 1,200 workers involved in the effort.

But with the project’s abrupt freeze, many of those workers have been pushed out of work, disrupting a source of high-paying local jobs and leaving local union workers searching for answers.

“A lot of building trades workers, a lot of union workers voted for Donald Trump and his team. But they didn’t vote to have union jobs shut down,” Patrick Crowley, the president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, told USA Today this week. “It shouldn’t work like this.”

The decision has also raised larger concerns about how the administration is handling already ongoing projects.

“We were surprised that he shut down a project that’s 80% complete,” said Aziz Dehkan, the executive director of the Connecticut Roundtable on Climate and Jobs. “I could almost see him stopping nonpermitted or projects that are in the permitting process. But to close down a project that’s 80% complete seems to be a little out of line here.”

In the days since the project was halted, advocates for the Revolution Wind project and clean energy initiatives more broadly told The Connecticut Mirror that the incident raises concerns that go beyond a singular project.

They also point to a broader climate of uncertainty that has been created by the past few months of policy changes affecting wind and solar programs. Those concerns have grown as the Trump administration reverses many of the energy policies of the Biden administration, including elements of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that provided incentives for clean energy projects around the country.

The uncertainty, advocates say, is contributing to further disruption in the industry as the clean energy sector shifts to avoid further setbacks from the federal government. The result could have serious economic implications, halting the industry’s once rapid job growth, limiting investments in new projects and curtailing the continued development of what clean energy supporters see as a vital part of America’s energy economy.

“Over the last six months, the landscape has really changed dramatically,” said Mike Trahan, executive director of the Connecticut Solar and Storage Association, which represents solar companies working in Connecticut. “How do you work your way through all those changes to stay competitive and stay in business?”

A growing industry thrown into chaos

Connecticut isn’t at the top of the list when it comes to its clean energy workforce. The state ranks 27th in the nation, employing roughly 44,000 clean energy workers. That’s around 60% of all energy and motor vehicle jobs in the state, according to E2, a national organization focused on finding common ground between energy advocates and business groups.

Still, the state has benefitted from recent investment in clean energy — largely defined as efforts to harness the power of wind, solar, and renewable energy sources — in the past few years. The Revolution Wind project, as well as various “Solar for All” initiatives, have fueled demand for a workforce skilled in clean energy technology, installation, manufacturing and storage.

In recent months however, that has shifted.

“There’s been more than $22 billion worth of private sector investments in clean energy projects, ranging from offshore wind to electric vehicle production to solar panel factories, that have been canceled in just the past eight months alone,” said Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director. “Unfortunately, it looks like those numbers are going to continue in the wrong direction, which is bad for any of us who depend on electricity or, like, jobs in America.”

Much of the industry has been at least in part affected by new policy changes in Washington. In January, the president issued an executive order calling for a halt to the disbursement of any remaining funds allocated under the Inflation Reduction Act.

In July, passage of the Trump-supported budget reconciliation bill included a phase-out of federal tax credits that incentivized solar and wind. Earlier this month, news reports noted that the administration was also planning to claw back some $7 billion in grant money allocated to the Solar for All initiative, a national program to improve access to solar in low-income and disadvantaged communities.

Those changes, Keefe said, have put the potential economic benefits of solar and wind projects in jeopardy.

“We saw what was truly an economic revolution in the making,” he said. “But now all of that has been put at risk because companies have no more market certainty given this current administration. The tax credits and the policies that they were told were going to be in place for 10 years have suddenly been pulled out from underneath them.”

The shift has sparked concerns that the clean energy sector will contract significantly, impacting jobs and limiting the possibility of future projects. According to a June estimate from the Solar Energy Industries Association, earlier versions of the budget reconciliation bill would put some 330,000 “current and future jobs across the country” at risk. A separate state-by-state analysis from the group found that around 2,900 jobs in Connecticut could be impacted.

“Lost jobs in every single state are a recipe for disaster for American families, businesses, and the U.S. economy,” SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said in a statement earlier this year.

A ‘psychological challenge’

In interviews this week, clean energy advocates and business experts voiced deep concerns about the Trump administration’s reversal of energy policy, framing the sudden halting of Revolution Wind as particularly alarming. But advocates stopped short of saying that the project’s abrupt pause is a harbinger of future economic difficulties in the industry or larger job issues in the state.

Rather, advocates argued that the changes add to an ongoing sense of uncertainty and instability in the clean energy sector more broadly. That uncertainty, they said, could ultimately prove as damaging as any policy changes, as companies retreat from clean energy projects and investors pull away to avoid issues with the federal government.

“That’s the psychological impact that really discourages people,” said Tony Sheridan, the president and CEO of the Chamber of Commerce of Eastern Connecticut.

That concern was at the top of mind for Kyle Wallace, the then-vice president of public policy and government affairs of solar developer PosiGen, when he spoke to the Connecticut Mirror last month. “We’re just continuing to see an administration that is just actively hostile to renewables, and we had hoped that they would be more indifferent and not actively hostile,” he said.

Wallace confirmed to CT Mirror this week that he was one of the employees affected by PosiGen’s recent announcement that it was laying off a significant number of its workforce, including 78 workers in Connecticut.

In a WARN notice announcing the layoffs, the company, which has been active in state “Solar for All” initiatives and focuses on providing solar to low-income and disadvantaged households that would be unable to afford it, cited financial difficulties as the main factor behind the layoffs.

“These business circumstances were not reasonably foreseeable and arose in an increasingly challenging economic environment that already has forced several other major companies in the renewables industry to cease or significantly reduce their operations,” John Truschinger, the company’s chief administrative officer, explained in the notice.

PosiGen did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.

The PosiGen layoffs have sparked further concerns about the state of the clean energy workforce in Connecticut, with some state lawmakers laying blame squarely at the feet of the federal government.

“President Trump talks a big game about standing up for the working man, but the truth is he’s left 78 Connecticut families without a paycheck,” Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, said in a statement this week. “These are blue-collar jobs that built our clean energy future. Now they’re gone because Trump needed the money for tax cuts for billionaires and his corrupt circle.”

Others see the layoffs in a different light. Trahan of the Connecticut Solar and Storage Association said he thinks ultimately, PosiGen “did everything right.”

“I don’t think people should be looking at that as indicative of what the industry as a whole is facing,” Trahan said, noting that the organization faces specific funding issues. His organization is currently working with former Connecticut PosiGen employees to help them find work in the state.

Still, after a tumultuous few months, clean energy supporters, industry organizers and business group leaders say that companies will need to remain resilient if they plan to continue operating.

“If you want to be successful or you want to sustain your business, you’ve got to be willing to adapt to change,” Trahan said. “And that’s what they’re doing right now.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-2.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 18:03:22.669993

By withdrawing offshore wind leasing areas, canceling $679 million in funding for 12 projects, and rescinding key approvals like the Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island, the administration has not only stifled renewable energy growth but also redirected capital toward fossil fuels and nuclear energy [1][4]. This shift has created a “regulatory lottery” for developers, eroded investor confidence, and raised urgent questions about the U.S.’s ability to compete in a global clean energy race [1].

The Immediate Fallout for Renewable Energy

The administration’s actions have triggered a 36% decline in U.S. renewable energy investment in the first half of 2025, with over 17,000 blue-collar jobs in offshore wind at risk [1]. The cancellation of 3.5 million acres of designated offshore wind areas has disrupted supply chains and delayed projects critical to regional grid reliability, particularly in the Northeast [4]. For instance, the Northeast’s reliance on natural gas has increased, undermining climate goals and exposing the region to price volatility [1]. Meanwhile, tariffs on wind components from Mexico, Canada, and China have further exacerbated challenges for onshore wind, potentially reducing annual capacity additions by 9% through 2028 [6].

A Shift Toward Traditional Energy

The administration’s preference for fossil fuels is evident in emergency permits for oil and gas projects and the rollback of methane regulations [3]. While these measures may provide short-term economic gains, they risk locking in high-emission infrastructure at a time when global markets are pivoting toward decarbonization. The termination of funding for offshore wind port infrastructure and the rescission of the Lava Ridge wind project in Idaho signal a broader retreat from long-term renewable energy planning [5]. This creates a paradox: as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentivizes domestic clean energy manufacturing, federal policies are simultaneously undermining the very sectors the IRA aims to bolster [2].

Long-Term Risks and Opportunities

Political uncertainty remains a double-edged sword. While the IRA has driven $115 billion in clean energy manufacturing investment since 2022, potential reversals of its provisions under a new administration could destabilize the sector [2]. For example, the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) and associated executive actions threaten to remove subsidies for solar and wind, reducing tax credits for electric vehicles and batteries [3]. Yet, renewables retain inherent advantages: lower levelized costs, quicker deployment timelines, and bipartisan state-level mandates, such as the 17 jurisdictions with statutory clean energy requirements for utilities [3].

Global Competitiveness and Investor Behavior

The U.S. risks ceding global leadership in clean energy as international investments surge. In 2024, global clean energy investment hit $2.1 trillion, with projections of $3.3 trillion in 2025—far outpacing fossil fuel investments [5]. U.S. policy instability, however, has prompted investors to hedge by redirecting capital to sectors like green hydrogen and energy storage or jurisdictions with clearer regulatory frameworks [1]. This trend is compounded by the Supreme Court’s constrained regulatory environment, which limits the Trump administration’s ability to overhaul renewable policies but also creates uncertainty for future administrations [3].

Conclusion

The Trump administration’s offshore wind cuts underscore the precarious balance between political ideology and market realities. While traditional energy sectors may benefit from short-term gains, the long-term risks—ranging from grid instability to lost global competitiveness—are profound. For investors, the path forward lies in hedging against political volatility by diversifying portfolios across technologies and geographies. Yet, the resilience of state-level policies and the IRA’s foundational role in clean energy manufacturing suggest that renewables will remain a cornerstone of U.S. energy markets, even amid headwinds. The challenge now is to navigate this uncertainty with strategic foresight, ensuring that the U.S. does not fall behind in the race for a sustainable future.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-29 18:03:32.549695

The sudden reversal highlights the vulnerability of the sector to political shifts and raises concerns about the long-term stability of the U.S. clean energy market [1].

The decision also comes at a time when the broader renewable energy sector is experiencing significant growth. Wind and solar power accounted for more than 40 percent of U.S. electricity output in 2024, up from 28 percent nearly two decades earlier [2]. This growth is driven by declining costs, government incentives, and increasing demand for clean energy, particularly in states like Texas, which leads in both wind and solar production [2]. However, the lack of consistent federal support could hinder further development and strain the industry’s ability to scale up at the necessary pace.

While employment in renewable energy continues to rise, there are challenges in accurately measuring the workforce due to discrepancies in data collection methods. For example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Department of Energy differ significantly in their assessments of jobs in the sector. The Department of Energy reported 125,000 jobs in the wind industry in 2022, compared to only 8,000 by the BLS, highlighting the need for more comprehensive and standardized data [2]. As the demand for electricity is projected to increase in the coming years, driven by AI, data centers, and electrification, ensuring an adequately trained labor force will be critical to supporting the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure [2].

(AP) — Robb Rynd and his brother grew up farming and wanted to do more of it outside their day jobs, so they went in together on what’s now a little over 200 acres of corn, soybeans, wheat and sorghum. Last year was a good year, and Rynd said he enjoyed walking the fields with his kids to see how the corn was doing.

This year is a different story.

All summer he’s been scouting for brown and wilting leaves or ears of corn with kernels missing, and now it’s becoming clear that every kernel will count this harvest. “It’s almost kind of depressing to go out there and look at it and say, ‘oh yep, it does look bad,’” he said.

Across major corn-growing states, climate change is fueling conditions that make watching the corn grow a nail-biter for farmers. Factors like consistently high summer overnight temperatures, droughts and heavier-than-usual rains at the wrong time can all disrupt the plants’ pollination — making each full ear of corn less of a guarantee and more of a gamble.

Overall, corn growers got lucky this year with late-season weather that contributed to what is now predicted to be a record bumper crop. But experts say bouts of extreme weather are intensifying the waiting game during a critical time of year between planting and harvest.

Human-caused climate change has worsened multiple U.S. extreme heat events this year and has steadily increased the likelihood of hotter overnight temperatures since 1970, according to Climate Central, an independent group of scientists who communicate climate science and data to the public.

”The hot nights too, like the corn’s never getting a break. It’s just hot all the time,” Rynd said. “I know it’s wearing on me.”

How excessive heat and rainfall can impact corn pollination

As a corn plant grows, the leaves unroll to reveal the tassel, the part that sheds pollen, explained Mark Licht, an associate professor of agronomy and an extension cropping systems specialist at Iowa State University. If the plant grows too fast, which can happen when it’s consistently very hot, the tassel may be wrapped too tightly by the leaf, meaning less pollen gets released.

That can lead to patchy ears of corn. Tight tassel wrap was reported in pockets across parts of the Midwest and the Plains, according to some agricultural trade publication reports during the growing season. Licht said he’d only seen tassel wrapping issues once before in his 20 years as an agronomist.

High temperatures can stress corn in other ways, lowering pollen production, reducing pollen’s viability or drying out other parts of the plants, reducing fertility. “I think any of the pollination issues that we might be having are more because the nights have been so exceedingly warm,” said Larry Walton, who farms near Rynd in southwestern Michigan, where many farmers irrigate because it’s a drier area.

“We tend to see pollination issues being more problematic when we have high temperatures and drought conditions or lack of rainfall,” Licht said. Yet Iowa had plenty of rain and still saw some pollination issues. Excessive moisture can cause corn smut, a type of fungus that grows on the ears.

He said farmers are having to pay more attention to this because “there’s just more variable weather.”

Overall ‘monster’ yield expected despite tricky weather conditions

This winter, the U.S. drought monitor reported drought in nearly 60% of corn production areas in the Midwest. But near or above normal rainfall nearly everywhere east of the Rockies this summer brought that down to just 3% as of the beginning of August, said Brad Rippey, a meteorologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

That, combined with consistent heat, means that “we are expecting a monster U.S. corn crop in 2025,” Rippey said.

But it wasn’t easy for everyone. “This has probably been one of the most difficult growing seasons that I’ve experienced in my career,” said Philip Good, a farmer in Macon, Mississippi and chair of the United Soybean Board. He planted his corn and soybeans 60 days behind schedule because it rained nearly every day for two months.

They lost some fertilizer and some plants died in standing water, Good said, but they made up for it with some lucky weather later in the season.

“The rain does fall in heavier bursts,” Rippey said. He said that can be an issue for farmers because even when it doesn’t cause flash floods, the moisture doesn’t necessarily percolate into the soil. It runs off and carries fertilizer with it, which is a problem for rivers’ health and farmers’ pocketbooks.

The trend toward higher humidity levels and warmer ocean temperatures, contributing to hotter nights, could be a bigger issue going forward, putting stress on crops like corn and soybeans, Rippey added.

Climate variability adds stress to a critical time for farmers

Late summer is a make-or-break time for farmers: They’re trying to gauge how much they’ll make from the year’s crop and planning their next steps, and patchy pollination doesn’t help.

“We’d like to upgrade a tractor … or we’d maybe try to pick up some more ground,” Rynd said. “It’s hard to want to go do those things when you have a bad year like this.”

When the uncertain pollination is at its worst, if 15% to 25% of every ear of corn doesn’t have kernels, that could mean a significant yield loss over a large field, said Nicolle Ritchie, a Michigan State University extension agent who helps Walton and Rynd survey their crops.

Jason Cope co-founded a farm tech company called PowerPollen whose equipment can mechanically collect pollen and then pollinate future crops. He said that due to extreme weather events, the number of “rescue” pollination jobs they’ve done for customers — to save fields that didn’t naturally pollinate very well — has nearly doubled since they started in 2018.

Walton said he can manage as long as the pollination issues don’t get too bad.

“You learn to roll with the stress part of it because most of that you can’t control anyway,” he added.
